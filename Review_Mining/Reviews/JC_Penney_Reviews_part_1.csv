rating,review
bad,the whole time there I felt discriminated  against.  you are only a number at jcp. they care nothing about their employees and pay nothing. they figure there is always someone else to fill your shoes
bad,"JCPenney has financial problems, and due to these financial problems, they screw over loyal employees. They use nefarious methods (through their HR reps) to have employees let go with no chance of unemployment aid so that they won’t be charged. "
bad,"JCPenney asks more of you than they give back. The phrase,""Do more with less"" is a common phrase. They do not give associates the proper training, tools or technology to do their jobs. They penalize associates for following procedures, policy and rules. I have literally heard the Store Manager say that there are no black and white rules. Salaried managers are so concerned with a negative customer service review that they will give the customer just about anything even when the customer is harassing an associate or being verbally abusive. Expectations are a moving target that you have to guess at. The company doesn't pay associates to be competitive with surrounding businesses. "
bad,"Jc Penny is a good place to work it includes diversity and inclusion very generous associate discount , and flexible scheduling , employee recognition, and opportunity for growth"
bad,Management poor. Cares only about sales. Employees are expendable. I was hired as seasonal and was told if do well they would keep you permanent.  I worked in busiest times with worst hours and then told that payroll can’t afford to keep me.  Lots of lies and just don’t care about employees
bad,"No work life balance-"
bad,I worked here for a long time and they overwork you for little pay. It’s also not a very positive work environment. I would only recommend this job for high school students
bad,Constantly cutting payroll and not enough hours to get tasks done. Store is always a disaster.  Very upset customers as the check out stations never have enough staff.
bad,"Having worked at JCPenney for about five years, I've outlasted 4 general managers at our store. Corporate doesn't give a flip about associates as they tend to keep on a vile, toxic HR manager in place. One that not only demeans customers and associates but will physically grab and assault associates. An HR manager who tells associates going through chemotherapy that its a ""inconvenience to my scheduling"". As a response to associates going through dark times, corporate HR's response is that ""you shouldn't worry your managers with this information"". All-in-all, avoid working here like the plague."
bad,"Too many warehouse associates would not do their jobs quickly or efficiently. Most bin replenishment clerk employees in Area 1 would just stand around and talk to their friends wasting production time and supervisors would hardly do anything about it. The training is so unorganized. I come in for my first day and the supervisor partners me up with someone who wasn't even a trainer and was never trained to learn to train new hires,  and has only been there for 2 weeks.The place was dirty and gross. Too many bed bugs, trash and torn boxes lying around. Hardly anyone would clean up after themselves. Too much overtime."
bad,they are very bias to they own work i had to deal with racist remarks from workers and staff me and manger did not get along because he blame me for the lack of others workers works since i was the only black guy there. if you choose to work there be care and safe
bad,"Unfortunately that's where the list of positives ends. Working here was an HR nightmare for bread crumbs. Work environment was extremely toxic, unrewarding, and mentally and physically taxing."
bad,The management makes working there truly terrible. Whether it is corporate or in-store leaders. The wellness and happiness of employees does not exist in JCPenney as every part of their job is to juice you of all you have to have offer with nothing left for yourself. You don't matter to them.
bad,"Stay away, very prejudice now that we’ve had new management. Very stressful Environment to work in. Management Singles people out! They have favoritism. In all the years that I’ve worked they’re, Ive never seen it so bad. The manager can’t even take responsibility of her own position, she expects everyone else to do her job, while she crunches more the  just numbers in her office."
bad,I was fired because of a system issue in attendance and knowing that they tried to deny me unemployment and I was only made aware when I filed for it. They're not good with looking out for the benefit of employees and flexibility options that are flexible to unforeseen events and hopefully that’s progressed since I’ve been there
bad,"Absolutely, no work security! Very old, obsolete equipment. Not a clean work environment. No training for employees. Minimal benefits. Poor work culture. Not a safe work atmosphere. No managerial leadership, plenty of Managers that are unaware of the jobs they are managing."
bad,They try to use you to do 3 people’s jobs and get little pay. If you don’t use your vacation days - at the end of year they take them because you only an carry over 40 and they have black out days.
bad,"The worst company I've worked for. Company does not care about the employees. I was assaulted at work and the district manager laughed about it, then terminated me 2 months later for going to a different store on my lunch break."
bad,Worst job ever. expected you to work long hours and never call out even in case of emergency. Wouldn’t schedule me for a month at a time and then only gave me a 4 hour shift. For 8.75 an hour that’s not even worth the gas to get there. At the end of the night when we would clean the store the 4 managers on duty would go sit down and have us there till 11 at night when we closed at 9.
bad,"At first I loved working at JCPenney but the management has gotten so horrible, they put credit applications over their customers & employees. Customers are supposed to be the main priority!! The employees has no say so what so ever I will never go back there if I can help it!!"
bad,"I cannot say if it is the same with every JCPenny however the Glendale Galleria location was a nightmare. My supervisors and managers were more concerned about each other than the whole staff. I was once called a biracial mutt by my supervisor because I asked for my paycheck when she was ""busy"". I was even told by other employees that they only liked to communicate with employees who were also Armenian as they were and would only treat fairly those employees. So basically we were all singled out and mistreated for that reason. We were never given fair breaks or proper communication. It was just an uncomfortable and very stressful work environment."
bad,On day off was asked to come in and I told them I couldn’t come due to the fact I was in a doctors appointment and from that day on I was not on or barely on the schedule then was told I had to work holiday and last minute as soon as I was almost to work was told I can’t come in
bad,Would not recommend this job to anyone that doesn't mind $12.25 and rude managers and supervisors the worst and closing is horrible everyone I worked with look tired and stress alot of work for very little pay.
bad,Manager had his favorites and you could tell. Was not willing to work around college schedule or when emergencies came up. It is not a place to work at if you are going to school.
bad,Their closing all jersey stores within the next year. So not a good place to look for employment. Never listen to employees that are part time. Especially if tbey have a background in business mgt.  Their afraid your after their jobs.
bad,"Management is not so good. Very low pay and not good benefit. No future for long career . Long hours but low pay. Co workers rude and gossiping. "
bad,If you schedule was 6 pm to 12 am you finished you department and you have to move another and stay until 2 o 3 am. If you have medical issue and you have Dr excuse they don't care and put on you record you late or missed a day
bad,"i enjoy my job, but when situations occur staff is not there for you. I have worked for Jc Penney 10 years. My son passed and they did not show me no appreciation"
bad,Hired as a seasonal helper .The store Manager in my opinion is unprofessional as many of Dept heads are. They were ver unorganized in training and communication.No regard for the customers and their time even when the line is not long or store is filled.
bad,Have no great reviews about this place. Good apparel and prices and discounts but overall.working in there with management was not good. They don’t appreciate your hard work!
bad,"I left Jc penny at the age of 16 while I was still in school due to the fact they have horrible management, communication, an there scheduling is bias ."
bad,"Poor work life balance, demanding hours and unrealistic expectations and time frames. Manage is very do as I say and doesnt lead by example. They only accept ""opportunities"" on us associates can do better but not feedback on how the company can do better. Were just supposed to confirm to their demands."
bad,"I worked truck at JCP and it was horrible. Starting hours were between 4 and 5 AM, which wasn't the terrible part, except if you were qualified to work both floor and truck they would often schedule you to work the evening before a truck shift, giving you no reasonable time to get a good night's sleep. "
bad,"The store manager himself does not display any of the positive characteristics of the company. He's rude, he doesn't listen , he is not accepting of others, he does not follow company protocols unless he can use them to his benefit, he takes credit for others hard work and is quick to blame others for his mistakes, he does not care about his employees well being, he likes to play mind games that interfere with employee productivity such as hiding the necessary work tools just to see how long it takes for someone to ask for them, he doesn't even put in a 40 hour work week. He often just doesn't show up. On big holidays or sales he is usually the last one to show up and the first one to leave."
bad,I would never work at jcpenney again. You aren’t appreciated and you have to work really hard for a very little amount of money. The day’s you want off you never get because HR does what she wants to do. And all the managers are messy and never like the new hires.
bad,"All they care about is credit cards and the employees who don’t get enough are treated like they’re less than those who meet the credit goal. They also recently cut my hours after over a year of working there but they are maxing out the hours of an employee who just started two months ago, an employee that does not do their job and lies about the tasks they’ve completed. Managers are two faced and like to play favorites. Do not apply here. This job is a horrible work environment."
bad,"I worked there part time and the people there after the change of managers lost their minds; the immediate supervisor, a German lady I will not say her name was too much of a dictator and chauvanist"
bad,It is a very busy environment at JcPenneys. My training team for the recovery was very detailed. Just having other team members proving that team work and communication was good to see.
bad,"You don't have to be talented to get ahead at JCP, you just have to be in the right clique.  The treatment I received there was inhumane, I never worked in such a horrible environment.  I would not recommend anyone to work at this evil place.  Management is a joke."
bad,"No one wants you to succeed"
bad,After having complaints about meyerland jcpenny instead of getting any positive or helpful feedback I got removed from position and after leaving I was taking out of data base saying I never worked there after back and forth on the phone for a year they just decided altogether to just say I never worked there even though I provided pay stubs. Terrible company to work for
bad,It's retail. The management was bad. The store cleanliness was terrible. Benefits were awful. the company as a whole just seems disarray. Some of my coworkers made it worthwhile.
bad,"Working in the salon sucked out my soul and moving to a private salon was the best decision I ever made.  I finally was able to charge my worth instead of doing all of the deals and coupons The Salon by Instyle inside JcPenny does  working at the salon by instyle was like working for free and working for ungrateful customers .  It took forever to build clientele, I had a full book within a year of leaving. I also more than doubled my income. I finally had an owner who was actually coaching and mentoring me and helping me grow. Getting out of penny’s was the best decision I ever made."
bad,They are unfair when it comes to the employees. They look the other way for some but not all. The pay is not worth all the work you are required to do.
bad,Stylist are kept at an hourly wage... by not reaching a specific amount to make commission.  Any services beyond the minimum wage... would be moved to Seniors and Masters to ensure they hold their status.  Also certain stylist receive all the call ins..  I personally had two friends book appointments anonymously with a huge gap in between. The other stylist was booked with both of my friends.
bad,"I never worked in retail before.  Unorganized, uncommunicative and clear favoritism.  There is more concern on ""putting a band-aid"" over issues then fixing it properly.  Never enough hours budgeted for projects or daily work."
bad,"This place is unorganized and the management is poor. I wouldn't recommend this place at all. The coworkers are unprofessional and they don't pay enough , but love piling work on others. You may think it's all fun and dandy looking from the outside but inside it's truly filled with drama."
bad,The hours are terrible. My manager made me do all of her work and took all the credit. I was an eighteen year old part time associate. I was taken advantage of for my hard work when it came to my manager and the store manager. I was also discriminated against by another employee. hr was a nightmare and lied to unemployment saying I did a no call no show and gave bo reason for quitting. When I had written a very detailed email as to why I was resigning.
bad,"I dont recommend jcpenney. Management is sour. You are just a number to them and it doesnt matter how much money you bring it, you are still only a number and expected to do more. Its no wonder jcpenney has such a bad name"
bad,"I agree that you get a good retail experience in this job, but the management sucks, the pay sucks. I've been working in JCPENNEY since a year and a half. I do Register, customer service, recovery and fitting all in a single day and Stoll they just pay you the minimum. The management is worst. None of the managers know what they doing, they don't even have a proper communication with associate. JCPENNEY sucks"
bad,"Not the best place to work for, not willing to give hours to just anyone, a lot of favoritism. Managers aren’t good at what they do but expect a lot from associates."
bad,"Don't work for this company, when you have problem in your job, nobody can come  and help you. You are always alone .    You don't have enough"
bad,Very stressful. All that is expected are to get people to apply for JcPenney charge card. You need to meet a quoteIf quota not met than written up. Looking to leave because HOLIDAYS are very stressful & everybody works except upper management so you have NO holiday time with family. Not good for people that family orinated
bad,In my time working here managers were not welcoming at all. When i was being trained i got passed around to a lot of employees because no one wanted to train me. Most of the employees didn't want to help me throughout my shifts as i was still just learning on my own. When i would go on break other employees and managers would stare and glare at me with dirty looks. I believe this was due to me being pregnant.
bad,Worst place to work! No hours and little pay for all the hard work and stress they put you through. I was belittled by manager and their favorite workers.
bad,A lot of retaliation if you speak up about something that is bothering you. If it’s not convenient for them they will not help at all. Extremely shady
bad,"Poor Management, home-office allows senior management to bully associates. Inconsistent, and favor certain  associates. HR makes excuses for the store manager. Worst place to work,"
bad,"I have been with the salon for a few years now. I am still at the same position/pay rate I was when I first started; minimum wage. The manager keeps hiring new stylists (there are over 20 of us now) when the stylists that have been there for years haven't got the clientele to make the productivity standards the company sets. The managers on the floor think we're there for them to use out on the sales floor as they see fit, even if that means stylists lose out on walk-ins, and the salon manager is fine with it. The manager also has clear favorites, some stylists can disappear for hours at a time, leave the premises while on the clock, and take hour or longer lunches, while others can't take their 15 minute break without her looking all over for them. Rules change every day, the HR department and the GM act like they're on our side, then either use what we told them against us, or does nothing about things being reported. They're is always drama in this place, and minimum wage doesn't even begin to be a compensation for dealing with everything going on here. And they just took away what little motivation there was by taking away our commission in California, even for selling products with services, which really helped since reaching commission for services was always near impossible."
bad,"Be careful , fast pace, numbers are more important than people. Told to walk faster to get better numbers. They will do whatever it takes to protect their job."
bad,Morale is very low company wide. Emphasis on diversity has resulted in discrimination against traditional American workers. Large store closings will be announced next Spring.
bad,"Manager does not care for her employees, speaks ill about associates, very confrontational, shows favouritism towards certain employees, unbalanced/fair hours. Demeans associates infront of customers, curses on the sales floor. Cuts your time if you request off. "
bad,"was given NO hours for  a month then was sent termination letter in the mail that is  how they treat temps "
bad,"As a part time cashier/sales associate you are commanded to hound EVERY customer into opening a JCP Credit Card.  If there is a 99 year old lady buying a washcloth with pocket change and a coupon - you are to try to trick her into thinking that by opening a high interest credit card she will save 20% on her purchase at that time and be better off.  There are NO exceptions!  ALL customers are to be accosted in this way mercilessly.  The flipside is that if you DO NOT trick people into opening credit cards YOU get your hours reduced to nothing.  NO SHAM CREDIT OPENED = NO HOURS FOR YOU!  Management does schedules on SUNDAY night for the next week so you can't plan even one day out.  You don't know on Sunday night if you are scheduled for Monday morning and it's YOUR problem to find out. If you are unfortunate enough to work until the store closes don't think that is your ending time.  Oh no, you must now at the end of your evening shift set about recovering the entire store.  The sales associates MUST do this task - sometimes it takes an additional two hours after close.  This puts your exit time near 11pm so take that into consideration. Holidays are far worse.  In the 2 years I worked for JCP they were sued by employees in a Class Action Suit for stealing our earned vacation pay!  I received a large check in the settlement.  They are a disgustingly dishonest company to work for.  They management through fear and intimidation and they ultimately find a way to rob their hourly workers.  Greed, corruption and tyranny is rampant!  Sorry folks but RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!"
bad,These people will overwork you and underpay you. All they care about is people signing up for credit cards. The employees receive $2 per credit card that they sign a customer up for meanwhile the managers are getting $10-20 per card
bad,Recuersos humanos tiene falta de Etica ya que me dejaron sin trabajo sin dejarmelo saber ni por escrito ni verbal solo me sacaron del horario sin ninguna razon justificada espero tomen accion para que no se vuelva a repetir con otro empleado
bad,"Unfair pay, no accommodations for disabilities, stingy with hours. This is just another large company that doesn’t really care about its employees. They avoid making anyone full time to avoid giving benefits."
bad,"Have nothing in place to hire someone skilled, only pay & rules for a newbie. Lowest I’ve been paid in 15 years!"
bad,"Ambiente de estrés, no importa que realices bien tu trabajo solo importa que coloques tarjetas de crédito existe favoritismo muy feo ambiente entre los compañeros nadie se respeta. No hay oportunidad de crecimiento al menos que te la lleves bien con algún manejador no importa que hagas bien tu trabajo importa que sepas decir a todo que si aunque sepas que no es correcto"
bad,"One supervisor may tell you to do one thing daily one way and you do it then that supervisor is not here so you have to get in trouble when something don’t get done the next day "
bad,"Friendly environment, great for college student or someone wanting to earn extra money.  Excellent for someone that only wants part time work. Not recommended for someone that wants to advance or build with the company"
bad,"Not worth the pay. Leadership does not care about employees or their families. General manager is worst than a jail warden. I would advise to stay away from the Killeen, TX store. No asset protection and always at risk of assault by shoplifters and boosters."
bad,Regret wasting my time there. Was there for two years and all I got was management training to only remove that position. They keep changing CEOs which than changes everything in the store.
bad,"Manager always talked behind other stylist, to other stylist. Never wanted to solve the problem but go talk about it to other people. She fed into the drama and would spread it more then try to get rid of it. I dont even know how JCP is getting away with the pay, With hourly only. By far the worst place I've ever worked."
bad,The Rocky Mount store was terrible when I worked. I felt like a slave. Not enough pay for the work asked of you. There were changes in the leadership and each time it got worse and the district manager allowed the chaos and was well aware and the whole leadership except 1 person eventually quit because of the foolery that was being allowed.
bad,"None .. Sucked. Unorgan8.. Employees were theives. I don't "
bad,Jcpenney only cares about Jcpenney . They don’t care about your schedule or what you have to do they care about the money and time your bringing in for them.
bad,"Terrible work environment, terrible management, poor hours, all lumped into a dying mall. It may have changed now, but at the time it was poorly managed and the sales were poor."
bad,"Customers were beyond horrible, management was barely existent, the store was chaos, always hiring teens and school kids who didn't care about the job itself and let others who actually needed the job do all the work."
bad,I got tired of working on thanksgiving not enough hours no good mangers rude coworkers gotta work all hoildays stay open later than the mall mangers don't no how to respect you very rude bad attitude
bad,Large store with many useless managers doing nothing. Poorly run and inefficient. Lazy and sleazy co-workers given superior treatment for kissing ***.
bad,"when I started with Jcp I was excited an moved up in the company after 5yrs I became a supervisor , but had to move to AZ when I transferred they had promised a supervisor position but when I arrived it wasn't there. so I got less hours than I was receiving and not the position I was expecting. after 10 yrs  thought they would of been better."
bad,"The Management team seemed stuck in its infancy. As it was the associates were more qualified to be in charge.  The GM acted very inappropriate at times which caused the morale to suffer.  The HR department despised any sort of camaraderie unless you open up to them on a personal note. In short, “You can’t be that associate’s friend if you can’t be mine too!”  Very disturbing.  Think twice."
bad,Jcpenney seems to have a lot of favouritism. There is no guidance or direction to what or where you'll be working at the time of your shift. They then expect you to do yours plus 2 other peoples job and responsibility. It doesnt make sense when you first get trained it seems as if everything will run smooth but once you are out there you feel lost and unappreciated.
bad,I hated working there not because the job was tough but because everyone there clearly picked favorites if you worked there for more than a year you were saved if you were hired seasonal they would try to take advantage of you overall management is so bad idk how they still work honestly they were so racist and creepy they made you feel uncomfortable about yourself it was an awful experience i always felt harrased by the management and other employees they were always so rude i still dont understand how anyone would want to work there.
bad,"Management.  They change your schedule without your knowledge, they yell at u in front of other staff when it should be in private.   The store manager treates the staff poorly"
bad,The company is going down!  The stock is trading at.50 cents per share.  Is that a joke or what.. management is so subpar.  My time at this job sucked the life out of me.
bad,This was honestly a horrible place to work. The management team sees that everyone is disposable and they definitely treat you as such. The pay isn't worth working there.
bad,"JCPenney changed my job sometimes weekly. Changed different standards frequently. They would schedule you 5 three hour days and then ask you to stay over everyday for up to 8 hours. If you refused to stay you were talked about by the leaders and management and made to feel you were not a team player.  I worked here 7 years and my pay went from $8.75-9.43. They would hire Christmas help at $10 hour then keep the good ones but refused to raise their long time employees pay to match new hire pay. "
bad,Hard to get work moral from under paid and or minors. No budget for payroll and or merit increases. Barely able to hire the headcount required. Bonuses are only obtainable through certain metrics that are impossible to make. Turnover percentage not an accurate metric with a majority of staff being minors.
bad,"A lot of favoritism, doesn’t matter how hard you work, the “teachers pet” will always get the promotion, if not, they bring new people in rather than promoting someone from the store."
bad,"Jcp doesn’t care about their associates!! The company will never make it, without any core values!! They treat their employees terribly. No job security, a lot of work for little pay."
bad,"Very Poor management, the supervisor don't know what to do In fact   they tell you one thing but in couple days they will have you do different thing which you weren't assign to do so. Most importantly for the same job you do some people get 18 and some will get 13."
bad,the managers are really terrible. they get into your personal business and make rude comments. they are inconsiderate people. there is so much gossip that you cant trust no one
bad,"Some get by with not doing nothing, hiding by sitting on floor or leave 30 minutes after getting there to not lose points and nothing done and others staying in trouble, called everyday to come in on days off and only scheduled 3-4 days anyway , need to change policy on tardiness,  absent days point system not working in hopkinsville ky."
bad,"Broken promises and unfair.           Didnt find the experience pleasing, there was plenty of favoritism there at the shop and they gave unfair pay to their associates"
bad,"I was excited at first but it became very clear, very quickly that things were not as great as they seemed. No organization, less management and more like bullying, low pay, and my manager threatened to fire me when i called off."
bad,I liked working here but you barely get any hours and they don’t ask you if you can work on Black Friday because you only get paid if you work in the morning or at night
bad,employees were lazy and didn't want to work just wanted to ignore responsibilities and talk on their phones . when customers were in the store employees focused on their own agenda
bad,Jc penny was a mistake to work there they lie to get you to work there then only give you 20 or less hours a week. Pay is extremely low also. Would not recommend this job to someone looking to survive
bad,This is a horrible place to work the managers and supervisors cuss and call the workers names they make fun of most of the workers they have it’s like you are in middle school all over again... they train you a day and expect you to no every single thing there is to no about the job and they will not work with you if you need a day off.... I would not even think twice about working here again.
bad,It's like working for high schoolers. The drama and unprofessional behavior is ridiculous. I know of multiple people who have had to get on anxiety medication because of the stress they cause. The management backstabs and throws the lower team under the bus for their own faults. They discuss personal issues with other managers who do not need to be informed until eventually the entire staff becomes aware. Its humiliating.
bad,Management did not want to hire me due to not enough credit cards. Human resources told me that they would call ONLY for the holidays. JcPenny is Santa Fe only hires who they want.
bad,Great people were treated poorly.  Poor people were treated poorly.  Integrity was removed as a core value as we all were made to witness. JC Penney should have never changed the Stafford undershirt.
bad,Do not apply it’s terrible wouldn’t recommend it’s not fun managers are terrible hated the job don’t apply it’s not good for you zero opportunities would not recommend
bad,Jcp manager treated ppl unfair and the store management was unorganized. The pay and hours were not good they make it difficult to get benefits. I recommend anyone not to work there. Be aware they cut your hours
bad,"I hated this job and the people, didn't like them, didn't trust them and I am glad that I don't have  to see there faces ever again  in my life. Never"
bad,Management was abusive and awful. IMPOSSIBLE to reach commission. Everyone is crazy!! Lol worst place to work ever - you will never grow and you will NEVER be appreciated for all your hard work - you can do better keep looking!
bad,Videos for training were down not available so could get training finished. Tried again and again and again but was unable to get it to work. Management count get it to work either.
bad,The GM and Sr. HRM are terrible leaders in the facility. The culture is broken and the morale is low. They lack engagement and don't know how to treat people. They don't follow processes and make up policies as they go to fit however they feel at the time.
bad,"I learned how to use a cash register and how to push credit, but the work environment in and of itself was very stressful and demeaning. management could of been more cohesive as well."
bad,Poor customer service and staffing. Horrible management. Promotions went to alcoholics and  drug addicts. Store was never recovered or cleaned. It was hard to even take a bathroom break due to lack of coverage.
bad,Not enough teamwork. Lack of staff. Lack of communication. Not enough hours.  Working late. Not enough security guards.  All Fitting rooms should be in use not just only one being open. All recovery should learn how to do cashier incase of short of staff.
bad,"At first I really enjoyed my job. However once the “newness,” wears off, management stops acting so “nice.” It is very toxic, and it all comes from management. There are so many supervisors and they all hate one another. They all give you different tasks to do, and get frustrated when you don’t complete them, and act like the other task another manager told you to do is not important . Management does nothing but sit in the office and go outside for a smoke. They only help out when you call for them. There is little to no training, so you are stuck in difficult situations by yourself. The pay isn’t fair. You could be doing the same job, or even more than someone else, and receive up to 3-4 dollars less. They pick favorites and honestly the managers are just a bunch of bullies. They believe they are so high up and important. When all they do is manage a store that will probably be shut"
bad,Management was terrible. SiJcp was a complete joke. Gratis was only really given to management. But wouldn’t even be on the floor to sell to products. Management made their own schedule regardless of what they were scheduled
bad,"22 years I worked there and in the last 5 things got really bad. We couldn't keep salon managers, the store manager was horrible, and the company kept taking benefits away and changing what they wanted from us. Our salon was in such bad shape that it was embarrassing. And there is no room to move up because they will not promote from within./"
bad,I was lied to about the pay and compensation. I wasted a year of my time and would never recommend anybody to work there. I had issues with stylist very unprofessional to say the least and ghetto.
bad,"Training is useless, doesn't relate to job and system doesnt load 80% of the time. Same with all their computers, I could carve stone tablets faster."
bad,"Managment is horrible! It's like your back in high school. They dont promote or acknowledge hard work, unless you in with the ""in crowd"". Management and supervisors will put you on tasks alone Segergaedted from the rest of the crew just because they can. Never consist with scheduling, you voice will NEVER be heard. Always Drama or gossiping. Definitely reccomend finding employment elsewhere."
bad,"Long hours. Dressing rooms were always trashed. Understaffed. Lazy coworkers. The customers were very very rude when we tried our best. If you do not sell enough credit cards, you will not get a raise. The store is usually trashed."
bad,Some of my coworkers were great. Groups of people got away with not doing their jobs while others were constantly watched & told to do EVERYTHING & you never received anything for it. No thank you no pay raise nothing!
bad,"Was not treated well as an employee. Even though I worked very hard in my position the store manager kept on insisting that I stepped down from my position. That was after I explained to him many times that my department desperately needed more employees in order to get the work done. He did not care about that fact and constantly refused to hire more people. Because they discouraged people from getting overtime they went to great lengths to erase overtime hours legitimately worked by me, daring to delete a few hours that I  knew I had worked but was never paid for."
bad,"I’ve worked at the JCPenney Logistics center in forest park as a Detail Assistant for three years and was let go over the most ridiculous reason. I was on lunch break and I had an extremely loud driver outside my door so loud to the point I could hear his whole conversation with another driver. I told him to lower his voice because he was disturbing other people in the office. After my lunch break I assisted him with his paperwork and he asked for the phone number to the office to check and see when his trailer will be ready. He literally called the phone two minutes after he left to check on his trailer after I told him it could be ready anywhere from 24-48 hours. The next day I come in and my coworker on first shift told me she had to change the signs outside the office because this same driver called that morning and complained to my manager that the signs on the door, which have been there before I worked there, were unprofessional because it stated that drivers should disturb others in the office if the sign shows we are on break. After going through my day I talked to my supervisor about the situation and was told I should send my manager an email about my side of the situation which I did. Later in the day I was told the trailer from the driver was ready but the lead of the department didn’t know how to dial outside the building so I told him I would do it myself. I called this same driver to let him know his trailer was ready and he asked me why I was calling his phone and unless I’m my coworker from first shift or my manager I shouldn’t be calling his phone. Mind you"
bad,Store manager has her favorites. The dynamic of the store completely changed. Moral of associates came down. New second in charge came to the store and things just got worse. The encouragement and wanting to see you succeed  became nonexistent. Store manager always very one sided.
bad,"I’ve worked at one location 5 years. Before my kids I had tons of hours. After I came back, because of the kids my availability shortened but I still got hours. This year however for no reason verbally expressed to me I’ve been cut to one shift. If they like you, as in your chatty and friends with management, you get hours. If you keep to yourself, even if you are good at what you do on the floor or the registers, you get sidelined. Hard. Its disappointing to realize the company doesn’t care about you whatsoever. It’s the first company I’ve ever worked for that’s made me feel that way."
bad,"-Managers are terrible and lazy they don’t care about their workers "
bad,Horrible place to work at. Managers don’t care about you. They cut your hours like crazy and only give it to those that they favor the most. You don’t get enough pay. It’s been 3 years since I’ve been working at J.C. Penney’s and I only get paid $12.20 per hour. It’s a waste of time! DO NOT APPLY!!!!
bad,"I worked for 6 months and was doing good. Had a new manager come in, wanted to hire her own team so let me go. No paperwork no nothing, shady company, be careful."
bad,Go out of business everybody at J.C. Penney's you dont know what your doing at all never did this company is horrible in just full of hot air glad I am not there
bad,I was able to work early morning to help my family while my children were small. This is a typical retail job and requires customer service and use of cash registers.
bad,"This place was awful to work at. Trying to get any verification of resignation or even working was a runaround. The moment you quit, they treat you like a second class citizen. The management is rude and they give you dirty looks. They dont give you enough hours and complain when the work isnt done. I would never reccomend working here to anyone. It was the worst thing I've ever done."
bad,Don't work here if you want a drama free environment. The managers just sit around and talk all day. If you have a problem with your co workers the managers  will just shrug it off and blame you for it. The managers never do anything about any problems here. you're co workers will constantly be rude and treat you like garbage but again its your fault. you would think being in the managers position they would listen and fix problems but instead they will cut your hours and talk rude for bringing up a issue because its to much work for them to deal with. No wonder all the stores are closing from being poorly managed by managers
bad,Horrible job. You aren't properly trained when you get hired. The managers are extremely rude and not helpful. There aren't enough people on shift when closing
bad,"I loved working in the call center with placing orders. Did catalog orders , put out stock, put up displays in women and men department. daily cash handling . All other dusites as signed ."
bad,Not paid your worth and you work sometimes without pay. This is not a job that anyone should really want. You have little to no support from upper management.
bad,Only want production out of you. Don't care about the quality of your work. Will write you up for just about anything. Supervisors are constantly leaving to go work at Amazon or other warehouses. They currently have 8 openings in the .com area. One opening in the pallot build area. Constantly changing your hours.
bad,"They didn’t give me hardly any hours.  They didn’t seem to care about training new people. All they cared about, was if you got any customer to sign up for a credit card."
bad,If you are not with the new crew they will get rid of the old crew. They are now on the good boy kick. If your not with the click or new click you gonna get got!
bad,"Now I’m just going by my experience at the location i worked at, things could be totally different at a location that has enough money to hire more help and not expect 1 person to do the job of 4 people!! I have never in my life experienced any type of management like i just experienced. I will never ever recommend jcpenny as a company for anyone to work at. Poor management (micro managers) that honestly have the worst attitudes and tempers!!!"
bad,Jc pennys was the most hardest job to do with very little benefits and customers were very ungreatful when you help them management was so demanding on getting things done.
bad,I worked my butt off to become a supervisor and when i did i was not even trained properly. The person that was my mentor looked at me ans said what do you want to know then left and only said hi when she saw me. Then i wasn't given the tools i needed which everyone else did. The Worst part is that i was Told i wasn't developed enough at the end to have a permitted spot as a supervisor. Was told i was going to get training so i could move to something and its been 6 months and no one has sat down with me. They sit and lie to you about what the company is doing and it's changes and tell you it was for the better.
bad,No foot traffic. Only scheduled 4 hours a day. The other stylists were nice and very helpful. I didn't like that We that we had to supply everything. That got expensive.
bad,The male workers would harass and yell at the females with little to no repercussions. Managers were slow and rarely did their jobs during the day. I would not recommend.
bad,"I was harassed, denied a promotion because of my pregnancy (I was told this behind closed doors), asked to work during my break, and part of a very hostile environment, especially for women."
bad,"I work in this company for yrs, in 2 different store. I learn to work in different departments I think that was the only benefits I take with them, management was rude in my second store and they treated employees bad."
bad,One only advances if you kiss managers egos. They don't let you get to 40h so they can keep you as part time that way they don't have to give you overtime or any other benefits. The managers only stand there and do nothing while the associates take care of everything.
bad,"Awful management , rude people. No one is helpful they are in no way , shape or form flexible with scheduling. Incredibly rude to teenagers even if they are their employees."
bad,"Trust me when I tell you, working there was aweful!"
bad,"They have terrible management. They only care about their credit cards and their money. They use the customers and employees to get what they want. The managers get mad when you ask them for help. They never come to help even when you’re calling them on the loud speaker (multiple times). They sit in their offices or talk amongst each other and let the employees do all the work. They would drain you until your energy is completely wiped out. When the store manager is in the store, that’s when they want to pretend to work. As soon as you get to work you feel that negative energy everywhere. They would have 1or 2 people in one department to do everything and they claim that you can’t leave until everywhere is zoned properly. Some might have better experience than me but this job was my worst nightmare and I had to leave it."
bad,"I have worked for this company, altogether, 7 years. Even transferred, coming back to my hometown store. It is not the most employee-friendly place to work. They tell you everything they want you to hear to get you on board, but your hours are based on how many credit apps you can get. You are replaceable, not likely to give you chances. What applies to one person or more, does not apply to the next. They will hire 12 people and work everyone 6 hours a week. My manager hardly works in his store. He is not here half the time. He does not like hiring big people because it does not look good for “his” store. So much childish drama. If I didn’t have to pay bills, I would not think twice about walking out and never returning. The sad thing is, I don’t believe it has always been like this. It’s stress upon stress."
bad,"Your hours will change at the last minute and they will not tell you. You are always working by yourself, no matter how busy it is. If you call for help or call for a manager, expect no one to come. The new manager is completely clueless, and refuses to get off her cell phone and actually help the associates. Plan to always stay until 11 PM or midnight if you close the store, the manager will not let you leave until every dust particle is gone,  which she watches over you and refuses to help. "
bad,Would never recommend to anyone to work here. They dont even stand by what they schedule you. Horrible company!! Managers never helpful get ticked off if you ask for help
bad,"It is a crack the whip kind of job. If you are just starting out fresh out of high school then this is the job for you. If you have goals, want job stability,want to promote with in keep searching this is not it."
bad,They train you in a different section from where you will be working at and just throw you to the front and expect you to do everything they ask. Will always want you to stay late
bad,"Get out while you can. This company is ridiculous. Yes. It's TRUE they lie to customers to get credit cards. Yes. Its TRUE they dont train, they just throw you in. You are just a body,  not a person to them. Never thanked. Never recognized unless you are a top credit performer. They will cut your hours if they dont like you."
bad,The managers only promote and give good evaluations to the people they are friends with. As such it makes hard workers want to work less because they know they will never be acknowledged unless they are in the clique.
bad,Pay is awful. Being a licensed hair dresser you only make $8 an hour and get commission but it still isn’t enough to live on. They keep hiring new stylists when the old stylists aren’t busy. Walk ins don’t go to the old crew but instead go to the new crew. Making it hard to make any money u less you have a full book
bad,"Bad pay,,,bad policy ,,just horible,,,, will bad experience for me,,,,little to no security or maybe it was just the position i was under probably was different for someone else"
bad,"I spend most of the day opening boxes or putting boxes into the cardboard baler, collecting hangers and recycling, stacking and palletizing outgoing merchandise and recyclable materials. I learned effective improvisation due to poor functioning equipment and poor logistics and management. Workplace is full of either stressed, overworked, and underpaid employees, or overly cheerful management. Hardest part of the job is dealing with management. Most enjoyable part is being left alone to do my work."
bad,"I worked as a Cashier for 3 1/2 years at the Greece Ridge Mall location in Rochester, NY.  After all these years of dedicated, hard work I was let go.  Poor management and unfair treatment of not only myself, but many other staff members."
bad,"Manager was so terrible. She definitely had her favorites. Very hard to work with, she constantly talked down on her employees. I stuck it out as long as I could."
bad,"there is no manager, no one to help or someone to help with schedule. low stock on everything do not have products to do job with someone might walk in, also no heating. so you are always cold"
bad,"Matter of time before the Greenwood Indiana location closes its doors. Regional, District managers and staff have emotional problems. Not a career place"
bad,"I really did not enjoy working here because I was in the jewelry department and it was really slow and you had to be on your feet ALL day, Management was great but did not like being in the jewelry department"
bad,"The only good thing about this job was the other sales associates i worked with, that taught me everything else management failed to teach me. The management never followed the company guidelines. They also told me my job was permanent when in reality i found out years later i was seasonal. I hated my experience there so much i didn’t even care about being let go, because instead of telling me they stopped putting me on the schedule and let hq send me a pink slip with no warning."
bad,If youre the type that wants to learn everything and grow within the company then good luck. ... They pick and choose who they want. They'll pick a lazy person over the hard workers anyday. The leads get employee of the month every single year for doing the same thing they did the year before. Theres leads there who sit on they butt all day and aren't willing-to learn a tugger a forklift or anything. I applaud the leads who do more.
bad,"I work with jcpenney warehouse for 10 years,I used to like place, people was nice, my supervisor always nice to me, it was good benefits and good pay, only I don’t like there management, it was very poor management."
bad,"If you dont get atleast 2 credit apps a week you get a warning, and you are treated like nothing, they only like you when you get credits apps. Raises are a joke, .14 cents really?"
bad,"They. paid me 8.25 an hour . I would have to Clean the cash wrap , put clothes back and management was never on the floor. The workplace was very slow paced. Most enjoyable part was lunch ."
bad,you can call for management help and they do not come some are to busy on phones taking pictures posting on facebook or smoking outside.they need  more training
bad,This job was really boring and depressing. The salon is so not up to date and there aren't that many shoppers. the pay is horrible i wouldnt recommend this to a college student
bad,"The entire holiday season, you will not see your own family much. You get injured on the job, they deny all medical Bill's. Would not recommend working here."
bad,My older coworkers would choose to bully more than half of the others including me. The people there act like they are back in high school and it is completely unprofessional and ridiculous.
bad,Worked retil for 20yrs. Easily the worst organized management team ever no organization no training and a very mean store manager that does not value her employees life balance in any way
bad,"It was a job, its not a place to start off at the bottom and work your way up. this is a job for part time work, there was no full time, only if you was a supervisor."
bad,"Terrible company, terrible pay and terrible upper manangement. They close tons of stores every year and your job is always in jeopardy. Corporate don't care due to they leave and take half of their staff with them to the next company they work for."
bad,"No training in place."
bad,"This was the only job I have ever disliked. There was no routine, no benefits, no team work, nothing. I worked there for 2 months and the best decision I made was leaving."
bad,Pay is sucks work schedules it's various to business and very poor management team not very friendly don't work for this company unless you are in need of money. Bad place to work for. Not enough hours.
bad,"Management is horrible, if you work here be prepared to have your job threatened everyday. There is alot of favoritism if you dont suck up to upper management you are treated horrible. They expect you to know what you are doing without proper training. They talk down to you and dont treat you like a person."
bad,"I liked the people I worked with very much.  The hours and inconsistencies with the schedule were inconceivable.  Would work 9 days in a row, have a couple of days off then work 2 or 3 days.  Would work closing shift one day and the next opening shift.  The best thing about working here was that I now shop in a different way - if I have to stand in line, I understand and don't complain at all since I know firsthand what it's like to be behind that cash register."
bad,"If you need to go to JCPenney it would be worth it to make the extra drive out to university park mall. The one in Elkhart is run down, messy and seems abandoned. Not to mention it's much smaller than the store in Mishawaka. I'm surprised this place is even still open."
bad,"abysmal management, no one ever tells you what to do, you're left to figure it out all on your own. avoid at all costs i wouldnt even subject my worst enemy to working here"
bad,"The mangers at sephora at jcpenney are disrespectful, verbally/ mentally abusive, unprofessional, mean, and act like they are in High school. There is favoritism amongst managers and some of the associates, and if your are not in the clique expect to be treated less than humane, regardless if you do your job to the best to your ability, give the customer's excellent customer service, always get to work early/on time, And Never Call Out. "
bad,"JCPenney is struggling to find it's way.  There have been multiple senior leaders leave the company over the past year.  With the change in management, the hierarchy seems fragile and non-attentive."
bad,When I first started work there it was good but then we lost  very good management  and after that it became so bad I would quit but I can’t because I don’t t have an other job lined up
bad,Management runs the store so poorly from both a local and corporate standpoint. They've made it impossible to do my job and they don't work you enough hours to even really afford gas money and food. They reward the employees that are rude to customers for making credit even though they are on a register and not doing their job in their department.
bad,"This company is a disaster, one step away from insolvency. There is about NOTHING I would recommend about JCP. Have watched its trajectory over the ladt few years. Just keeps getting worse and worse!"
bad,One customer a day for the whole salon. Extremely poor management. Policy said if you don't start commissioning by 6 months that you're fired. Which was impossible gove the one client a day. I quit after 3 months. Not worth it.
bad,"Jcpenney, in Houma La is the worse place to work every body there figures you owe them something, there unorganized, the MA gossip about associates as if we’re in high school, the pay is 8 dollars, like how far can you really get with that working 10 hours a week, the petrify I don’t recommend this job unless your at your lowest point in life!!! JUST AN HEADS UP"
bad,youll constantly do jobs that are not in my job description and you wont get paid more for going the extra mile.Its almost impossible to move up and the schedule is constantly changing.I will head to work and they will tell me that my schedule has been changed and ill have to go home or wait hours to start work which is very inconvenient.None of the management is on the same page for anything and they dont communicate anything.The management doesnt value your time.The hours arent consistent and job security is always a problem.
bad,I have worked at jcpenney in Lexington twice. First time i worked there for almost two years. I had to leave for family reasons. I eventually came back this past August while i attended college and while i was there i was considered a lead associate. The managers and team i knew before welcomed me back with open arms. And in October we got a new GM. She is the worst human i have ever encountered. While i was there she had fired multiple people for her own doing. She didn't schedule multiple associate's and fired them all because the did not come in to work black friday. I watched her threaten and demote great supervisors for no reason. The end of December she decided to stop scheduling me for the start of January and when i confronted her about my schedule she told me that is was because i was a seasonal associate. I was not a seasonal associate. They don't even put out seasonal positions in August because its too soon. I looked up all my info she completely lied and pushed me out of my job. A seasonal associate can not become a lead associate so there is no way i was seasonal. But thats just a slice of my experience. The place is ran horribly. The pay is the lowest in retail. And the hours are only good if you one want to work 3 days a week with 5 hour shifts. The only time the hours are good is Christmas. You can never get full tkme unless you are a senior that has already been working there for years or if you are a supervisor or manager. There is NO benefits except a poor discount. The Lexington location is the worst jcpenney store to work at. They treat their employees
bad,They have no manners they don’t care they over work you they don’t pay enough they are racist and much more management is bad manager is not even able to be a a manager because he does not have what it takes to have that position and Human Resources is trash she doesn’t know how to do her job at all that’s not how you treat people at all
bad,"I've worked this company before in a different town and thought very highly of it, that's why i decided to work at the one in greenwood. however, to my surprise, it has the WORST management. There is an extreme lack of communication and lack of professionalism. "
bad,I hated working here they made us stand for hours and yelled at me to clean up a section again after I once cleaned it up and then they aren't understanding at all and paid me very little and gave me less hours
bad,"JC Penney was a horrible company to work for. I barely had any hours, and the management team was awful. They accuse you and try to fire you before they hear both sides of the story. Worst company ever."
bad,Had to buy new clothes for a job I was at for a short time (seasonal). Managers were rude and acted like they were better then everyone else. They don’t pay fairly considering you’re selling credit cards for them.
bad,"No team player, everyone works against each other, gossip, horrible energy, not worth the stress, hours are silly, complainers for everything, badvibe"
bad,"Working in retail is often dependent on the culture of the people you work with as any day can be stressful or not at random due to customers. Working here, however, was absolutely awful. I was a seasonal employee and though I worked well and was complimented for my duties, whether you are kept on is purely based on credit cards earned, even if you aren't on register. Their technology was often not working and getting hold of management nearly impossible. The training was a joke, even though I began well before the real push for the holiday season. Often ""management"" was having a party and unable to be reached when employees needed them. It may have changed since then, but it was awful then."
bad,"JCP Where to start. They are a dishonest company with the worst leadership anywhere. They can and will fire anyone for no reason and lie about it ( right sumer roderick seattle) she is the worst leader ever! Company is the titanic going down fast."
bad,"They were fair and flexible,i felt I wasn't appreciated  i worked various departments when needed, pressured us to do credit cards ales clients very demanding and pushy had to do customer service with a smile and the customer is always right. customers failed to read fine print on coupons it was dis organized store i got certain departments in order"
bad,"No long response but the Treasure Coast JCPenny location is the worst job I have ever had, would never work for that company again or shop there. Not recommending this place"
bad,"Expectations are too high for poor pay! You are hired as a ""cashier and end up cleaning the store after it closes"" so they add more time after the shift. Mgmt is condescending and rude which adds to the stress of rude customers. Breaks not long enough to eat// it's a sweatshop...multi-tasking for low pay//hours cut after holidays/work every weekend...culture inclusivity creates issues. Horrible just horrible!"
bad,The establishment is geared toward adults under twenty-one years of age. It is fitting for a summer job but not for professionals seeking advancement into management.
bad,Some days were good and some days was stressful being on the register and there is a long line. And you don't have anyone to help you. The managers and some customers were rude.
bad,"Never ever ever work there."
bad,No money and they want to work you like a slave.8.50!Ha!Worst part were customers and their bad attitudes.Best part was when it was break time or clock out time!
bad,Terrible training rude managers discriminated with a 8.00hr rate after being offered 10.00 they need to hurry amd shut down dont work here u will quit
bad,"Associates are treated very poorly at the JCPenney in Novi, MI. Most of the management is highly racist towards anyone that is not white. Several of my coworkers and I go above and beyond, doing what ever we are asked to do, never call off, and always pick up shifts if we are called in but receive no recognition. In fact, we are treated with less respect than associates who do not do anything and choose to hide in fitting room stalls."
bad,"-Picking up clothes and ringing up customers"
bad,"The management was very disrespectful to employees and acted unprofessional. I have had a conversation with my manager(s) on the floor a couple times that should have been held in the back. I was never properly trained for things I have to encounter every shift. If I did not complete the task appropriately, I was mistreated and spoken to rudely afterwards. It was a place full of bullying. The store was not kept up to par. Food had been on the floor for a whole week! The staff was great but the management needs to be completely redone."
bad,"I worked in the maintenance department for 2 1/2 years."
bad,"collect hangers from quads/ cashier post"
bad,"is responsible for providing courteous, efficient, and accurate checkout service to customers in a manner that meets Our Brand of Customer Service expectations while meeting"
bad,"My experience as a sales associate at JCPenney of Freeport was brief, stressful, and honestly, miserable.  The training from management was lacking, and unfortunately the store manager was short with me and made me dread coming to work each day.  The only positive were some of my co-workers who made me feel welcome and answered my many questions."
bad,"the Altamonte location is great, I started out there and transferred to the Daytona beach location. I was there for a week before I walked out. Management talks to you like your their slave, I was told that because I chose my schooling over a shift (that I had requested off two weeks in advance) that I was an awful employee who didn't have her priorities straight. When I came in next that manager looked me dead in the face and belittled me infant of customers."
bad,"Extremely poor and disorganized management. I never felt like I received proper training, I was thrown out on the floor on my very first day with no guidance or help. Many of the supervisors/managers are extremely rude, have horrible attitudes, and have on numerous occasions publicly raised their voice at me and put me down/humiliated me in front of other employees/customers. Little to no flexibility with schedules. You basically have to be a slave to this company. You are required to work on all holidays, all weekends, you are required to work even outside of the availability that you request. Sales floor/back rooms/break room/offices are always horrendously filthy. My health has declined significantly since I started working here and I always cough and get sick often since working here. But you are not provided with any sick days and being unable to come in due to illness still counts against you. Outdated and dirty fitting rooms (most of which are closed down), outdated registers, confusing price signage, no price scanners, poorly stocked, over-priced merchandise, broken television in the break room, and never enough available lockers for employees. Little to no recognition for good performance. Management is very negative, I only ever receive negative attitudes, negative feedback, negative energy, and no positive or constructive criticism or suggestions. Tools necessary for performing my job well (such as hand-held price scanners, printers, etc.) are always scarce or broken and I never received proper training on how to use them. Ghastly underpaid for the amount of work"
bad,not my best job I have worked before but I would work there again of they were a better company to work for but they are not so I did not try to stay there.
bad,"I worked at the JC Penny in the Aurora Mall in Colorado. I worked as a seasonal sales associate. "
bad,Does not care about employees. They hire so many people that end up leaving. Pay is very low and hardly get hours here. They give all the hours to the newbies.
bad,This is the worst job I have ever had. I don’t mind the hard work but hard work is not recognized and slackers are not let go or disciplined which is bad for morale and makes everyone feel like not caring. The managers are all happy but no one else is. Saying anything doesn’t result in anything. Management really doesn’t care at all about hourly workers.
bad,"SUDDENLY AFTER 2 YEARS I FOUND ,,,,,Please review your Timesheet for system generated FTR,  If you have any questions or don't agree with the change, please see your Superviso;;;;;;;REALLY .I BELIVE NOW THE SOLUTION IS THE Workers' Guild .After working two years,  came without an alert or a tip"
bad,Easily put management does not truly live up to the company's core values. When my morals and integrity is questioned I have to walk away I pride myself on the well being and compassion that a manger should have for associates and this is not something that I think Upper management value.
bad,"I love to shop at this store so I thought, Why not work here?! BIG MISTAKE. The night management at the time was horrendous. Yelling at us to move faster to clean the store faster, since the morning crew couldn't clean. The employees were always mean to each other...very low class people. It was a complete soul sucking, slave job. I will never work for this company ever again. I will only shop here."
bad,"This company is going down the drain do not work here. the management was terrible their HR department does not give a care about employees, and there is little to no chance for advancement or pay raise."
bad,On a average day work was  good . This was a seasonally job. The work was easy and enjoyed  serving my customers. The hours was flexible and management was fair.
bad,"The management need to be trained how to treat associate correctly and also work."
bad,"Company is getting very greedy!!! No raises but more work, taking away full time which will cause you to lose any benefits you had. Managers are very lazy!! You call for help numerous times were even customers are telling others theyve called but no one is responding."
bad,honestly JCPenny is not the best place to work. The management is the worst. They all show favoritism to certain employees and make the rest of us feel like we don't do our job good enough. they expect you to do so much in so little time and get mad when it isn't done. the hours they give are so bad fro the people that work on the floor. when you ask the management for more hours they never give you more.
bad,i was a high schooler when i had the job and worked there for about a minute and it was okay if you are looking to make a little extra money on the side
bad,"dishonest management!!"
bad,"Poor management, little pay, don't hire you even if you have been working there for months. Company would do combined shifts due to only having so much work for employees."
bad,"Sadly the store that I was working with had a really bad management problem. They even didnt give the chance to people inside the same store to go up. There were always silly reason why other from the outside had the oportunity and not the other way around. Sadly instead of penalizing the supervisors or leaders that were guilty of stuff that happend they prefered to move the leader or supervisor to another store. "
bad,"to many managers and no one knows what is going on. always looking to hire, not busy so the time goes by very slow. most enjoyable is working with the customersa that  come in and the regular customers that come in often"
bad,They didn't train me correctly they are very hard to talk to the mangers you are almost always by yourself they tell you they are are gonna do something then it takes a month to do it
bad,"great job for college students needing a flexible schedule. The pay is terrible and usually not enough hours for those needing full time work. "
bad,Very poorly run company. Have no idea what is going on. Can't understand how they can stay in business. They will go under. Management has no clue on how to treat employee's or the customers.
bad,I worked in the Women's Department making sure that the department was neat and tidy at all times.  Making sure that the customers needs were met especially in the dressing rooms.
bad,"Working at this store was awful! I was there for 5 months total but after the first month I knew I wouldn’t be lasting too long. The managers are very unprofessional, they will bully you on the sales floor over the number of credit card applications you open. That’s all they care about is credit cards! I had like 4 people I loved working with and that was it. No one speaks to you unless they are harassing you. They also expect you to clean all the fitting rooms, be on register, and helping people at the same time!  Customers are rude and feel entitled to discounts!"
bad,A typical day at work would be sitting around hoping someone saw our sign for haircuts out front and actually walk into the salon. I learned that the Lead on duty system worked until they did not want to come back to the salon to help considering our manager was never there. The culture of the work place was laid back for the most part but stressful when the manager was there and took her home life frustrations out on every one in the salon. The hardest part of the job was re organizing the shelves and inventory. The most enjoyable part of the job was putting a smile on someones face just by their hair or even seeing a smile back on someones face once you restore their confidence just by cutting or coloring their hair.
bad,"The management is awful. they do not care about their hourly employees. They will throw you under the bus if a customer complains about them they will tell the store manager it was you. they are unethical and no matter how many customer service awards you get and positive feedback if you work there long enough to get the benefits they will cut your hours and hire new people give them more hours because you will at that point cost more.When I left 3 other employees left as well for the same similar reason.It's a great job for a young person living at home still or married, retired and doesn't have rent or bills to pay. But if you need to work to make a living and support yourself or family don't waste your time."
bad,i did not like it here.  customers are rude.  the dressing rooms were left a mess and people leave very unneccessary and sometimes disgusting items in the dressing rooms.
bad,A generic retail department store with a policy of not keep a full staff on hand. While some managers were wonderful most were less than so. Little to no cross trail and too large an emphasis on credit cards over customer service.
bad,When i was team leader i had no support. I learned my job myself without any instruction from my supervisors.  People hired were not ready to work in a warehouse atmosphere.
bad,JcPenney is a store I used to enjoy shopping at. Ever since I stopped working there I stopped Shopping there. The management is not all that great and the work environment is stressful.
bad,I worked 16 hours straight one time and then had 4 hours off and had to go back. And thry clock you out at 8 hours even if you worked more and you are very unlikely to actually get breaks
bad,I understand that sometimes there's not hours for employees to get more that 4 hours a week but taking away hours out of retaliation from a small argument or taking away hours because they don't like you with the excuse that your performance is poor us unfair and awful. They don't seem to care that people need money in order to take care of responsibilities.
bad,all management cared about was credit. having people sign up for credit cards. they changed policy by having cashiers needing to get  credit a lot more often and threatened to fire people who had trouble with getting credit. threatening peoples jobs that get paid 8.00 and hour for bad hours is horrible and shows the character of the managers and there greediness.
bad,I was scheduled few hours and instead of more hours they hired more associates. The pay was very low and the schedule was changed without notice making keeping track of it complicated.
bad,Over work you and poor pay it’s unorofessional that they don’t schedule enough people to and people are always calling out the management sucks they don’t always come when you need them most
bad,"Don’t work here. It’s terrible, what management I’ve ever encountered. Terrible pay. Coworkers were drama, fake, and mean. They would go out of there way to try to get you in trouble"
bad,"Management is useless, AC has been out for several weeks with no attempt to fix it, always picking up the slack of other employees, locked in till everything is done during closing, which is illegal and a fire hazard, but management doesn’t seem to care. No flexibility with scheduling you can ask multiple times and management with ignore it. Customers are rude and get upset about there not being enough associates on the floor but still wanna pay extremely low prices for items."
bad,"Terrible management, can never find a supervisor when you need one, very sarcastic and not very helpful when you need them to help, take their time coming to assist in any task. Higher placed workers talk down to the workers lower in the ladder, openly talk smack about customers, ignore customers when asked for help. Tend to pile on multiple tasks on already busy associates. ""Do it my way or leave. We don't need you"" attitude"
bad,"They promised me a job at a lower level district job, then shut the Asset Protection Program. I was then made into a cashier and my hours were then cut from 35 hrs to 15 hours just about."
bad,"This JcPenney does not care about their employees, they give horrible hours and basically want people who will live the lifestyle of “JcPenney or die”. If you don’t have a perfect flexible schedule they will only work you one day when you can work 5 or so days."
bad,"There is virtual no training, management just throws you in to recover the floor. When I asked for training, after three weeks, they said I should already know what I’m doing by now. Really? In fine jewelry? There’s so many procedures there’s no possible way I could do my job to the best of my ability."
bad,"When working with JCPenney, it was great in the beginning. When the time came to putting requests in for time off, or for availability change due to school and/or any kind of family matter, they were never approved. The manager in charge of working out the schedule was unfair. He had always made sure that the days needed off were the days employees received the most work hours. The store manager did not want to cooperate when it came to an issue with another employee."
bad,Start fresh with a whole new management team so that the employees that are working can feel more secure like we are treated Farley so that the work can be more productive.
bad,management there is absolutely ridiculous they cant keep associates out on the floor or in the stockroom everyone talks about each other bad there management is the worse I worked in the stock room you couldn't pay me enough to go back there your hours suck and so does your pay not worth it they cant keep the place clean and just about half the associates are on drugs nobody listens to management and vice versa that place is a mess def recommend never work there the crappiest job ive ever had
bad,I thought it  was a good place to work but honesty the management treated their people very poorly.  Do something else other then this awful place. I will say however it was good at first but then went down hill.
bad,This is the worst APM was very racist he told me I was not productive but he never trained me on anything worst company dont ever work here. Average day was terrible I was left alone days not knowing what all to do within the store management terrible worst job ever
bad,not a good place dont care about new comers. the job isnt for younger people with big ambition . it limit your mindset to just want they want you to do in life. cant put your own creativity in the work plae.
bad,"This store is a poor environment to work. You must be young a student and needing part time hour only."
bad,"Working at JCP is not fun! Management is completely focused on the credit card goal and not the well-being of the associates. The associates are all great people, and hours get cut if you get on the bad side of HR. Former associates don’t work as well as others, and the associates who do work get all of the workload while the ones who don’t just get smaller jobs."
bad,Management was terrible to the employees. Didn't care about our well being. I have lots of stories about this place. Very unprofessional. Rarely allowed any breaks.
bad,"A typical work day is stressful, fast paced, and full of complaints. Managers were most often only worried about completing their credit card goal and not necessarily what the employee needed, they almost always prioritized the customer. The hardest part about this job would have to be that there was never a respect for availability, meaning one would almost always be scheduled at the non preferred times and dates that were given and having to deal with verbal abuse by unhappy customers."
bad,"All they care is you have to constantly try to ask the customer to signup for store credit cards, they hardly train you on the cash register and you have to be slowly working on that till you pick up, all that management cares is signup customers so they get some commision out of it, and if you don't, slowly but surely your work hours shrinks to nothing and make you quite, really a sad place to work management rate is below zero. If you smoke you have 3 breaks otherwise just 1."
bad,Would not recommend to anyone. Not understanding and will keep you well after your shift was supposed to end. I stayed up to 5 Hours after my shift ended.
bad,"Working at jcpenney was one of the worst jobs I have done. The environment is very pressuring and all of my coworkers thought they could get away with anything. At my store specficly, it was infested with roaches and ants. It was very disgusting place to work."
bad,Worse place I’ve ever worked at . Terrible lying immature management. The Peabody MA location has mice running around the store & has dead mice in the break room all the time. There has been some unbelievably disgusting stuff found all the time in the dressing rooms. Save yourself the stress & underpaid checks.
bad,"The management need to be trained how to treat associate correctly and also work."
bad,Awful company with awful management. The company was inconsistent and often put blame where it did not belong. This was one of the worst professional experiences I have ever encountered.
bad,They don’t treat you right at all never have never will they help sometimes but not reallly you have to figure a lot out on your own managers don’t care to help you what so ever
bad,Poor managementI was let go over a medical reason then head to seek legal action for wages.It was that corporate customer cost center everybody was all over the place and didn’t really know what they were talking about
bad,"Not a fair place to work, Management is not stable. No growth potential . Doesn't provide raises. The pay doesn't amount to the pay. Management is not professional."
bad,I would not recommend working here. I worked there 2 years no raise and no advancement. When I went and asked for a raise they refused. The management was terrible everything was terrible
bad,"Like most companies, too many managers and not enough help.  Managers didn’t seem concerned with issues that ultimately affected the customers.  They were too concerned with meeting JCPenney credit applications than providing service to customers"
bad,Was hired as contract IT support for corp office. Over 1 year time they replaced many career positions with workers from other counties to save money.
bad,"Lack of hours. Lack of direction. Understaffed. Stressful. Crying children. Sweaty hot camera rooms. Low pay. Rude customers. I was assaulted by a customer. I was not told I was fires or laid off they just stopped calling me to come in. Am currently suing lifetouch for providing an unsafe work environment. Hopefully this helps anyone looking to apply. You're not a photographer you're only allowed to photograph on auto and edit with what they choose, parents will get upset over their coupons, unrealistic sales expectations which is mostly what you'll be doing; selling to customers and basically lying ""oh I can give you this coupon so you'll save so much!"" ... It's not a coupon. It's always 40% off."
bad,I was expected to work as fast as possible all day long and the environment was very hostile.  I was yelled at several times for not working hard enough or fast enough even though I was doing my best and not even taking any breaks.  I had a horrible experience working for this company.
bad,The only thing worthwhile were the doctors I worked with. Prescription accuracy and quality poor. I had 4 different people telling me what to do. High stress low pay. An Optician with certification is not compensated or even encouraged to work there.
bad,They will make you work until you drop.  They do not care about the type of damage you could be doing on your back until something happens.  Management sucks in JCPENNEY'S.  Will allow customers to break store rules.  Treats employees very badly.
bad,I came up with an idea to change the way they calculated productivity for the detail checkers and I told the idea to my manager. My manager presented the idea to his boss as his own idea and they implemented it without giving me any credit. So I essentially quit and and became a claims adjuater
bad,Worked at a Little Rock location and was harassed everyday by the salon manger. stylist fear for their jobs every day. She fired people all the time..
bad,"this job you can not make a living with. "
bad,Did everything from snow removal to working on conveyor belts. Help paint office spaces and break rooms as well as work on small machinery. Plus did random trouble calls.
bad,I would never worked for big corporation anymore. They do not really care about their employees. the turnover is super high. The management is terrible.  Company morale is low.
bad,"just not a good place to work not too many off days , worked on holidays no room to advance no raises cutthroat environment management sucked underpaid"
bad,It was my first job. I worked many many hours and quit after a month. The work conditions were terrible and hours were insane. Highly suggest no one to apply here.
bad,Its a ok place to work for a kid that doesn't worry about paying bills and a budget. Hours get cut without warning and managers dont seem to stick around long.
bad,I work with a manager that is completely bipolar. I improved my management skills. The upper manaagement they always stick together. There isn't any workplace culture.
bad,"Your bothered every single hour to get a credit card application but none of the managers could bother to get one themselves. They seem to hire anything that breaths, so if your terrible with no talent don't worry jcpenny will hire you in a heart beat. Expectations are wayyy to high for a company going out of business.  Be prepared people and them begging you for a discount and to make your day a living nightmare. It's a great high school job, but not a career. It's a dead end job, and has no growth improvement do not recommend for someone with prior retail experience."
bad,"JCpenny was a very strict place to work, lots of standing around. Nothing good came out of working here. The managers were mean and very disorganized.  I worked in the shoe department, that place was always a mess and unkept no matter how much we organized it.  Not a lot of great benefits. If the company doesn't like you work ethic or just plain doesn't like  you; then they will start cutting your hours. then eventually they will fire you without telling you."
bad,"This was the worst job I ever had. You are expected to do 3 things at once and when you don't get your main job done they aren't happy. I believe they wanted me to quit from day one. A lot of the time I was the only one working fitting rooms and had to consently had to stop what I was doing to go help ring customers and would get stuck up there for at least an hour and couldn't get all the clothes from the fitting rooms put back. I had never received a name tag when I was working here, and my hours were always getting cut. Finally I changed my availability for a baby sitting job I was getting and that was the end of me working here. I just wouldn't do it. Management sucks here too."
bad,"The managers never worked with my schedule. I had horrible hours and pay. There were so many cliques that I constantly felt excluded. One manager, never remembered my name after working consistently  for 7 months."
bad,The General Manager at Boise Towne Square is AWFUL. Do not expect to get a pay raise! I never received one in 3 years and was considered management...
bad,"The only thing I learned from working here was how to deal with very difficult customers. I basically taught myself how to do everything. The management was poor, they never stepped up to help and they did not care about the employees under them. The pay was awful for the work required. Not worth the effort."
bad,"The managers for this company are the reason it is failing. There is no money in the budget for part time employees to work, so all the full time employees can keep their insurance and PTO. So the full time employees pick up the slack. Then the full time employees are stressed because they are working the part time shifts and in turn take it out when they finally have money in the budget for the part time employees to work. No room for promotion or pay raise."
bad,"everything from managment to hours sucked, the managers were all just terrible people and there are racist coworkers so be careful and too much work for little pay"
bad,"The management sucks, the morale sucks, the pay sucks too. You get worked like a slave with no appreciation. None of the employees are happy there and the management barely allows you to talk."
bad,"Not enough coverage on the floor, too many supervisors running around like chickens with their heads cut off. "
bad,the most enjoyable part of the job is that I did lean how do different jobs that can get me a better job to better my self like helping people l lean how to work fast
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone join this workforce as JCPenney is closing most if not all of the stores they have due to slowly going out of business.  Work life at the stores are very stressful as you  repeat your steps and job duties over and over again.
bad,"the customers where good, management was another matter. they played favorites all the time, usually the ones with attitude got all the praise, and the ones that worked hard got worked harder ."
bad,I was totally miserable working here. Employees were very passive aggressive and rude. Manager is a child and doesnt know how to talk to employees. Absolutely dreaded coming to work.
bad,"I was only hired on for temporary Christmas help and the job was very stressful for me. I had a difficult time up-selling to the customers.  The job didn't fit my personality. If you are creative and know how to make fun and interesting photo packages and have a background in taking photos, the job will be interesting and fun."
bad,"There are horrible managers at JC Penney's. JCP pays you low wages $7.50/hr, plus they give you NO benefits like insurance (medical, dental and vision). Yet they sometimes will work you only 10 hrs in one week and then next schedule you 25 hours for the week, so a true average you are receiving is approximately 17.5 per week yet they promise you 25-32 hours per week!"
bad,It is a nice company . Store was not managed well. They would hire sesonal people and cut the hours of the ones that had been working there as part time Associates.
bad,Store closed. Expected good customer service but not ever enough help to provide it.  Did not really appreciate the associates that has been there for years and worked hard.  Sad but true. I was ok with the job due to the fact I worked part time and really appreciated my superiors and would help them when I could
bad,"You will not be able to make any money in the JCPenny salon unless you have clientele. JCPenny Salon is a great place to work you have constant clients coming in for you on a daily basis. If you do not have any clients coming in then you will not be able to make any money at all. "
bad,"This place, along with the fact that they don't care about their employees at all, pays next to nothing. Management came from outside and had zero clue as to the actual reality of things."
bad,"The pay, management, and hours are all terrible. Do not work here unless you are 100% looking for a temporary job with no possible future to be turned into a career"
bad,Don’t work here. This job is trash. Managers don’t care about you. They can all smd. Never again will I work for this ship wreck. Close down. I will personally close this establishment down. Definitely filing a complaint to Corps.
bad,Management at JCPenney was horrible. Management didn't care about you which made work days miserable. They never really seen how hard I worked. I never got rewarded for the good job I was doing especially when it came to signing people up for credit cards.
bad,"Manage don't care about employee, that just want you to make money, customers can threaten you and nothing done, you have to know somebody to get a promotion"
bad,"Company is in obvious turmoil and falling apart by the day.  They have very bad management, poor communication, don't know what they are doing and don't know what to do.  They also promise you things that they themselves are not educated about and don't bother to educate you about it.  "
bad,"All JCP cares about is credit card applications, they don't care what else you do, if you aren't getting applications you're dead to them. all the managers are bafoons and cant tell they butt from a hole in the ground. Horrible scheduling and requests off. Horrible treatment of employees and inadequate pay for job expectations. they think we're all stupid."
bad,"I worked season during Christmas, and it was very hectic, steady, frustrating because I wasn't taught everything i needed to know because I was only a seasonal investment.  Managers were very good at delegating & watching employees closely to watch for shrinkage.  I would not want to work that job again or on a full time basis.  There is a lot of standing/walking required.  Customer were very argumentative for discounts"
bad,this job was just something for me to do until i got the job at Walmart i did nothing but stand around and do nothing all day long like i said it was so boring i would not wish this job on anyone
bad,There are a few managers who don't seem to care or don't come to assist you at all when you call them. The store manager doesn't seem to care at all either and only there for his benefit. The pay is also terrible and they never or give you less than a few cents raise. I would never work here again. The only bright side is the other employees they're amazing
bad,Cut your hours to the bone once the holiday season is over with very bad management if you wanna change your availability have a very bad attitude towards people from different countries and cultures management hires and gives hours to people that they know like family and friends can't use the bathroom if you are a cashier you gonna catch uti holding yourself
bad,If you are a high school or college student do not work here. They are not willing to go around school hours and if you are sick they still expect you to come in.
bad,Overall its not a good place to work for . No hrs. Management don't care about there associates . You would say goodmorning and they would say goodmorning back . They just dont care
bad,"The JCPenney I worked at, has horrible management, very low hours for all associates and terrible benefits. Mainly the General manager and other operations managers are the main cause for all the negative atmosphere. They push for unreachable goals and then blame the employees when those goals are not met. If only they gave more hours and more coverage on the floor, then those goals would be reachable. Very stressful environment and almost no hours to be given. Highly not recommended"
bad,"Management was horrible and made it obvious they don’t care about the employees. Only cared about us getting customers to sign up for their credit card. If you didn’t, you were barely scheduled for the following week. Could definitely tell who was favored by the managers and who wasn’t. Some customers were nice and made the job tolerable, others made me want to quit that same day. Payment stays the same unless you get people to sign up. Some days they wouldn’t pay for overtime. Breaks were only 15 minutes and during busy days, it was cut to 10 minutes. Horrible experience."
bad,Orientations East bad. Work schedule was not good.  States should be loaded every Saturday. I looked show nothing. I looked on Sunday still no no days for following week.  Bad communications.
bad,"Terrible store manager. Not professional. No opportunity for advancement unless you are attractive."
bad,"Working retail was not enjoyable to me. Being the bottom of the food chain but experiencing extremely angry customers on a daily basis. I was there while JCP was trying to change their image to a younger clientele. This frustrated many of the life long customers, as many brands they always preferred began to disapear. It was a depressing job. I did learn alot about patients in this job. How to listen to what the customer was feeling, let them get out what they are feeling and address their concerns from there."
bad,Worst experience ever!!! The managers could never agree on where to place an employee and the employee was the one to blame for the confusion. The MOD was always so rude and never was up to speed on the position and employee was working at. And they are horrible people to work for. Pay sucks and hours sucked even more.
bad,"The staff was very messy and unprofessional, the management never wanted to listen to any problems. They forced us to make credits if we didn't get any then we would lose our job."
bad,The management I horrid. They do not care about their employees for a second here. I have never experienced so much unprofessionalism at one place in such a short amount of time. defiantly needs some improvement.
bad,"They had me work hours that I was not supposed to at 16, not only did they break the law but during my time there no one trained me and the customers got angry. It was only seasonal but it was stressful."
bad,"But the one I worked at was a zoo. People gave up on their jobs within a few months. People were lied to, and if they didn't like you they would come up with some impossible task to make you quit."
bad,"It was a fun place to work at first, but the managers were not the most organized. The other employees were nice in the beginning, then some ""hazing"" and drama completely ruined the fun atmosphere."
bad,Be aware of this company. There is nothing positive about it. There was a lot  of associates job lost and the company did not care.  The benefits are not the best.
bad,if store would not have closed i mite have stayed on as maintenance there but the outlets closed and i did not want to work in the main store in the mall
bad,"poor management, unfair environment"
bad,not enough hours. great place to shop nice people to work with but not able to provide for a family on so little hours. the holidays was amazing. but slow after
bad,"I would never recommend someone to this job. The management is HORRIBLE! The managers are not held accountable for anything, the store is always a mess because no one recovers until there’s a district visit. Managers literally sit in the office on their phone 90% of the time. They hide product they don’t feel like processing. If you want to move up in the company you have to tear every other person down, no ones promoted based on their qualifications it’s based on favorites AGAIN why the management sucks. It’s easily the worst company I’ve ever worked for"
bad,"No repect for enployees, the manager didn't know what they were doing. The head manager was clueless and did not do anything to help their employee and they cut hours making one cashiee per register."
bad,Just use it for an entry level job then leave. terrible management and policies.they will look to ire an associate for anything and even created false charges to fire associates. terrible products and overall would not recommend to a friends unless hey just want their first job.
bad,Jcpenney is ok for someone who is looking for their first job but they do not provide you with enough hours and enough pay daily the emplyees get harassed about getting customers to open up jcpenney credit cards that was my first retail job it was ok when I first started until I started to see how the management was treating the employees I would never recommend anyone to work there
bad,"Worst place to work, Your job is based on others credit reports on top of being treated like nothing.My supervisor was awesome, the others were garbage.Absolutely terrible.None were doing their jobs but found time to lie on me"
bad,All u hear is customers complaining about prices and shipping because they never receives their orders on time. They need to raise their pay. They pay MA 13.50 a d they sit on the phone all day on hold and .Com gets paid 11 but we deal with all anger customers.
bad,"If it was not for the staff itself, I would not have made it working for this company.  The pay was low, management was weak and the hours was crazy. The great part about it is that staff really helps each other out and get along well."
bad,"JC Penney is a company just like the rest, they're only looking out for themselves. There's no room for growth and advancement, and the culture needs a MAJOR shift."
bad,"worked in the salon and it was an awful experience "
bad,"not a positive experience, very demanding, great people, management was a little poor, the warehouse itself is huge.. early morning shifts which meant you had the day to yourself."
bad,I wouldn't work for that company again if my life depended on it. The environment wasn't at all what i expected from such a large company. unfortunately it didn't work out for me.Working as a Cosmo was hard enough but having a client stolen from you isn't professional at all.
bad,The department head was not very easy to get in touch with when we had questions and concerns and the decorating staff and installers never talked and created issues for the customers
bad,"never enough sales people scheduled to cover the whole store plus checkout."
bad,I find that the JCPenney in Oak Ridge has very little structure not the managers know what’s going on there is lack of communication between all the employees and it’s all a big joke I would never suggest working here
bad,"Don't work there. Discount Is great but overall not a good job to work. Stressful and management sucks. Good for a teen job, not to stay. Jcp is not worth your time or all your hours or days there."
bad,is always busy the scheduals never mean what they say. sometimes had to work overtime last min. not a good place to grown in retail. hours aren't any good.
bad,wouldnt let anyone applied unfair pay and hours and benefits mangers have favirotes some mangers make you feel bad about your self i learned not to trust anyone
bad,"discriminated for not being able to speak spanish"
bad,"Typical day has you working in the freezing or burning hot stock room on several trucking pallets opening up boxes and organizing the merchandise inside by either kids, women's, men's or accessories on karts and you have to finish before you leave usually scheduled 5-9:30AM or 5-11:30AM and once you are done you are assigned to take the merchandise to the sales floor where usually there isn't any where to put the new merchandise because either the racks are stuffed to the maximum or the tables have no room so the merchandise then goes back into the stockroom and sometimes you get yelled at because the managers don't want anything in the stock room even when you tell them there's no where to put the merchandise. The sales floor is always a mess and big pain to recover when assigned to it. Managers are very disorganized with hiring, hours and instructions on what to do therefore employees are constantly confused on what to do and often waste time and on top of that are very rude. Now on the hours THEY ARE TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!! very inconsistent sometimes you have fantastic hours like 27-30 hours a week usually if its a big sale or holiday but usually they use you on a on call service only giving you hours based on if they need you or not like 4.5 to 9 a week at a rate of $12 per hour. Definitely one of the worst jobs I've had would not recommend any one to work here they are users and abusers and don't care about you or your needs"
bad,I wouldn't recommend working there to my worst enemy. This company doesn't offer any advancement and they aren't professional at all. They will change your schedule without warning and they won't tell you that it's changed. Management is a joke because half of the time they don't even show up for work which means you are locked out of the building.
bad,very low pay and not even 20 hours a week. Sometimes they only give you 3 hours a day. you dont get to break any 15  min breaks. They will call you in only to work  few hours and cut your time another day.
bad,"management sucks 100%.  no matter how well I did; if the management don't like you, you will never get a chance to grow. even though you know more than the management that is on hand. its very stressful because you cannot make it."
bad,Everyday was different depending on how many customers we had they would move us around where there was more work to put in either I was in customer service or I was a cashier
bad,Wouldn't work there again because I felt I was being over worked and my checks were very low of what I expected. I wouldn't recommend working at JCPenney.
bad,Typical day of consist of managing associates and making sure all departments were kept to core standards. Learned excellent managerial skills. Workplace culture was typical retail. The hardest part of the job was store recovery after holidays.
bad,Managers were not professional they would give raises to their friend co-workers and not acknowledge others workers that were really working hard everyday.
bad,"Very poor management!  They do not treat their employees well AT ALL!  I would never work for this company ever again.  I was pregnant when I worked for this company, they didn't let me take my breaks or relieve me to use the restroom when I needed it, whenever I did I got in trouble for it.  Overall a terrible place to work.  Was very stressful and emotionally draining."
bad,"Credit cards were more important to management than an employee's own daily work. If you did not get a certain amount of credit card applications in a day, then your hours were cut and you may be forced to quit."
bad,"Aboluetly horrible company to work for. All they care about is credit cards and working you to death. I drove 140 miles each day for a year working towards a promotion for them to hire someone that I trained, giving them the store I was qualified and have exceptionally put in hard for for."
bad,I wasnt taught as well as i needed to be and my manager would flip out when I made mistakes. I wasn't allowed to interact with other employees at all during work hours.
bad,Do not work here it is one of the worst things you could ever do. Now im going to just type a bunch of stuff to hit the wrd count so i can continue dd
bad,typical day at the store trainnig for a team leader fork lift driver. worked other departments. learn how to interact with all people. being on my feet for more than eight hours..
bad,This is a very stressful place to work and there is no type of communication at all. Any issues or problems that you have will go on her when speaking to management about it. You are consistently forced to ask customers to apply for a credit card. Staffing is very short and things are very unorganized.
bad,"jcpenney in first colony mall in sugar land, tx is a terrible work. management is the worst of them all. corporate needs to step in and see why they have such a high employee turn over, and the pay is not enough for what you have to deal with!!!!! if I could give a negative it would be -8. and if you are in school stay away cause they do not care...."
bad,"Terrible place to work at , labor you to clean everything when you are understaffed always in every department. I would never work retail again after working here"
bad,It’s too uptight and the hr office and management where rude and very messy. The also look at the employees and less of them because of a title. The team was disrespectful
bad,"Company is being run by people who have no clue on Clothing Business/Golden Rule set forth by Founder.   They also have placed people in VP positions that  do not know how run Departments.  Big example is Asset Protection.   Shrinkage is out of hand and all new programs are running Department and Company into ground.   Board of Directors/Share Holders forgot we are a clothing company, not Apple or Home Depot!"
bad,"I worked my first retail job here for the winter. Was the worst job for me, the manager was never around. I had no training, the portal was never updated with hours so I got scheduled for days I was not aware of so I wasn't able to make them. Coworkers were not helpful, watched others fail."
bad,"If you didn't ask EVERY customer, returning or knowingly already has one, to apply for a cc through them they would treat you like dirt! i was yelled at, had hours cut from me, and treated like i was 12 years old. i hated this job and the management!!"
bad,"I couldn't enjoy my job there, it was an uncomfortable work environment. Always understaffed so my dept which got the worst treatment had to fill in associates for the other understaffed depts. We worked hard for hardly any recognition. Some employees were cutthroat and really bossy for their position. 5 managers with big egos and different ideas. The worst job I've had."
bad,"Back in 1997, my manager was very prejudice and did not give me the opportunity to grow. She was never at work and did not communicate well. She was awful."
bad,Management vary childish if you tell them a mouth ahead about a  doctors appointment or anything really they will get up set about it. The rules say that if you give them 2 weeks in advance it should be fine but they still get upset with you
bad,"The entire staff was ghetto. Poor management. The entire store was ghetto. The customers were cheap and rude. No one had respect for others or themselves. Hair stylists are paid minimum wage of 7:25 an hour. The company Rob license professionals of their talent. They lie and tell you you'll get commission but you never do. Jc penny get all the profit the stylist get nothing.  A lot of the stylist that work their have their own salon suite building/suite and use jc penny to build more client base for their business.  Others are older retired stylists, teachers with a state cosmetology license and beginning license stylists."
bad,Poor Store Managment there is a lot of retaliation and the store shows favoritism there is a lot of criticism and cutthroat in the store I would not recommend anyone to work in that store
bad,Unstable culture and processes. Lack of job security. Training is lacking for employees. Management team tries to do the right thing but they can only so much with what they have
bad,It started as a great job when I was hired in 2009. With cutbacks and so many different ceos and their different directions things have gone downhill. They expect you to do the work of 3 with no pay increase and then tell you you’re a failure when you fall a little short.
bad,"Woorkinf for the salon by instyle in JCPENNEY WAS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE I EVER MADE if I could get those years back I would. The false promises from way up in corporate down to in store management were underwhelming and heart breaking. Being told ""we will bring you on full time with Benefits one you do a level jump in the salon"" and then DOING THAT JUMP and not getting anything for it so heartbreaking. I live paycheck to paycheck as do most of my coworkers because corporate does not care about us. Complain and your hours get cut. No wonder this company is doing so poorly. 3 months with almost no color on back bar we had to FIGHT to get corporate to send it to us and it was a struggle it shouldn't be like that. Clients come first. THIS IS NOT THE SAME COMPANY IT WAS 10 YO YEARS AGO. It's a. Dying company!!! Low low pay (our top stylist makes under 40k a year) our salon manager makes 45k a year.  It's a joke. You won't get PTO/MTO health insurance until you're over 30 hrs a week and they will keep you list below that so you don't get it."
bad,"Managers kept useless employees, expected those that actually worked to make up for the lack of help.  Scheduled till 10:30, get out at midnight.  Always picking favorites and managers vanish during the busiest hours."
bad,The management does not know how to treat employees. They think as employees as tools not humans. They seem to forget the fact that we have a life outside of work. I went into work everyday just to be nagged at by my manager and hurt my back.
bad,I believe the company sells a quality product but is not the best at treating their employees who are loyal and dependable across the state. They could benefit by choosing stronger leaders and teams.
bad,It is a terrible work place under staffed and under supervised. I would appreciate direction and clear expectations of work. And that isn't something you get there.
bad,"The management at this store where I worked was so poor  I did not feel as if my work was valued at all, I felt targeted by fellow employees and the managers made me feel bad about myself and only told me I was doing a good job when I got a credit card application for them. That is all they seemed to care about. The people are not friendly and seemed to always talk negatively about each other. Therefore not a positive working environment nor a fun place to work. The rules that applied to the lower associates didn't apply to the higher up's. If I were to ask a fellow employee they would tell you something quite similar. I later got a job somewhere else and had no idea management could be so kind and helpful. JCPenney did not  honor the times I could work and didn't give me many hours to work."
bad,great job if you are looking for something temporary. You learn how to interact with the customers and how to solve certain situations where the customer is not happy.
bad,"No chance for advancement. 4 hour shifts. No breaks. Rude management. Minimum wage. No medical, dental, vision benefits. You will work holidays and weekends."
bad,I didn't feel welcome at this store. People were very rude and never felt like I got super close with anyone except a few people. The work load was over the top and too stressful for me. Plus they always asked me to come in like 3 hours before my scheduled shift.
bad,"My short time working at JC Penney was stressful and discouraging in every sense."
bad,"Shows favorites toward other employees, drastic hour cuts, care more about the ""budget"" then employees. Hardest part of the job is taking directions from managers that don't communicate at all and have no knowledge of the departments they are over."
bad,It was my junior year in highschool and I got this job to help support my family. As they are on the poverty pay chart. I had to quit because I moved cities for college.
bad,"Favoritism only to African American people, the management could not answer questions nor did they like you asking questions  about your job title . Being a Caucasian worker at JCPenney's you would always get accused of making racial slurs towards African-American employees. It was the worst place I've ever worked in my life don't even think about getting a job here it's poor management poorly ran not enough pay for the responsibilities given. If I could rate this place a zero or minus 10 I absolutely would."
bad,"Horrible management, messy store, very unorganized. Dirty bathrooms and dressing rooms, poor choice of employees. Clothes all over the floor in dressing rooms, and by cash registers in the children's department. Recovery was not done at all, which resulted in the build up of piles of clothes by the cash register, constantly had clothes on the floor hanging off of the hangers. Ridiculous"
bad,Poor place to grow and contribute.  Company can't change to be competitive with other retailers and Amazon.  Operating model is very flawed and requires drastic change to become employee and customer centric.
bad,"The environment was hectic, unorganized and the management was unprofessional. People had inappropriate conversations that the management ignored, and management preached about us doing better but did nothing to help provide criticism that was beneficial. You're on your feet all day, and only got a 30 min lunch for days that were sometimes 10 hours long."
bad,"management is what ruined this work experience for me"
bad,"hours were horrible, some nights we were there until after 2 in the morning. no one was ever recognized for good things they did, only bad. you had to push the jcpenney credit card at every transaction. management was absoluteluy horrible."
bad,"Although it could've just been my location, it was horrible. I was being stalked and my managers didn't care. They didn't do anything when I was grabbed in the store either."
bad,"The manager at the time was awful, the benefits were non existent, there was no leadership or learning, they just throw you out on the floor and expect a new hairdresser to survive on minimum wage."
bad,There was training every other month and if I was able to promote myself more I would have been more successful. The manager would tell me when I didn't have a client in my chair that I would loose production and loose my job. She would expect me to go into the store and find someone shopping to do their hair.
bad,Fired me because I'm black they look at you like you stink no body works there black but two an they act white an kiss butt all day poor place to work its nasty in there bathrooms are gross floors are dirty seats old an dirty they have Rats
bad,"A typical day at JCPenney is full of unexpected events. A shift can consume a customer pooping or peeing in the fitting room. A customer cursing and/or yelling at you. Customers steeling and no security to do anything about it. Co-workers that refuse to take part or help with clean-up and putting back clothes. Inappropriate behavior from co-workers. Oh, and racial slurs from co-workers and customers but when you tell the manager they state ""no, everyone can just be like that. The race has nothing to do with it""."
bad,"good first job, but not more than two months. the management did not care about the employees well being. the only thing i liked was meeting my best friend."
bad,Don't pay well and expect above and beyond performances. Pay raises are a joke. 20 cents. They do not punish lazy workers or associates who constantly call off. They do not take care of their good employees. Very high turn over rate.
bad,"I explained to her multiple times that this was my first job, she was very rude every time I had to ask a question and she would not work with me on my schedule"
bad,The staff was poorly trained. the few of us that knew what we were doing and how to do our jobs were treated poorly. Store Manager left a lot to be desired.
bad,this is ridiculous. I do not want to write about an old job i hardl remember just to submit my application to find a new job now. I wish it did not to be thi llong.
bad,"Mean management, under paid, too much work. High expectations, but pay does not match work load. Managers are mean and inconsiderate. Overall, bad experience."
bad,The management is very horrible and does not allow you to progress in the workplace. to be a clothing store it feels more like a bootcamp. stay away from here.
bad,After the recent collection of retiring employees the company has gone down hill. I would advise against working here as it will become very stressful.
bad,They did not utilize my talents or utilize me or help in assisting further my career. It was led by a group of poor management that did not care about problems or situations that their co workers had.
bad,"The jewellery department is the worst I ever worked. The day usually starts with total mess. The worst management I ever faced, total lack of knowledge and competence.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with incompetent management. Employee come and leave all the time. The most enjoyable part of this job is when you leave. Decisions are made depending of your ethnic or other .... affiliations !"
bad,A typical day at work was ok. What I learn that the company hired poor management therefor the store had to close. The most enjoyable part of the job was styling the clients.
bad,Management was not fair and the work environment was horible the only good thing was the workers made good friends but other that they don't give good rise
bad,"Tukwila JCPenney is understaffed, over budgeted, and managers are a pain to work with because they like going on little ""power trips"" to ensure that you know you are lesser than they are. They don't listen to your needs as an employee nor do they take in mind any of the complaints that customers make. It seems like JCPenney only cares about getting their credit card applications and everything else is unimportant. I would not recommend this place , not to shop and not to work either ."
bad,Poor leadership at the Director level leads to creating  chaotic work environment with timelines and project goals changing almost daily. VP management level would not address Director's poor management style after the entire department brought concerns to their attention.
bad,"My department manager stressed me out so bad over our required sales that I literally started fainting at work and wound up leaving for medical reasons. Left the job? Perfectly fine."
bad,I was working at Jc Pennys as i was getting out of High School. I thought it would be a good place to work but i wasnt there very long. The holidays were horrible. They werent giving me hardly any hours so that is why i had to quit.
bad,"The managers were very bad at acknowledging who was actually working. In a retail environment, you work as a team, but thats not what happened. 2 to 3 people throughout a whole day, would actually be working and make a difference in how the store looked."
bad,"this jcpenny was truly a horrible place to work at the staff was lazy and unattentive i never received proper training and the pay was below minimum wage. further more i barley got more than 2 days a week to work, and suddenly the stopped giving me HOURS!!! outta no where i entered a new month and my calendar was completely empty and void of any work days they never truly trained me and all they had me do was organised clothes this company is truly HORRIBLE"
bad,"the only good thing about working here is the employee discount, management and hours are bad, favoritism ran rampant at this location most managers would treat employees unfavorably"
bad,"They are so behind in the call center world with how information is passed down, equipment, systems, and management style. Working for them is like stepping backwards into 1900s. They are not helpful with scheduling and family issues."
bad,"No career advancement opportunities and no assistance in developing your skill set. Managers do not rate you on your skill set, but on who they prefer to have a job (buddy system). Constant talk of change, owning your career, or employees opinions matter but no follow through whatsoever. True issues within company never addressed though brought to managements attention. Poor management and no issue throwing you under the bus to save their own image. No employee motivation and company moral low at all times."
bad,Not a good company to work for.  Management is biased. Pay is low and employees are overworked.  Very stressful work environment need stable employees
bad,"you don't get no hours, short breaks, no time off "
bad,"Jcp Rockwall is lacking in bussines ethics, poor and dirty managers.  play favorites all the time."
bad,"A typical day at work involved stocking product, assisting customers, restocking products, supervising associates and encouraging customers to apply for charge cards. I learned from this job how to stay calm under pressure, even when you are short a person and have 20 people in line during the holiday season, and that is really the best thing i learned from this job. The management I worked with were adequate, but the associates I worked with were, for the mot part, wonderful. The hardest parts of the job were the super rude customers trying to scam us, and the endless pressure to get charge card apps but the best part was the associates I worked with."
bad,Next its boring i wouldnt reccomend it to anyone just my opinion.very happy on my next adventure  and am liking where iam at in this very point of life.
bad,"First off This isn't a real job , what Kind of place doesn't want full time employees. It's such a struggle to work here . You only get some ""great job"" and thumbs up if your fake, kissing butt, or getting credit apps so the man upstairs sitting in his butt gets his bonus. While the employee's  are constantly struggling. If you need some work experience straight out of high them maybe this job will work for a couple of months."
bad,it was great it work here before but the new management is awful. There is one supervisor who doesnt know how to speak to people and does somethings that the management just lets it go.
bad,"Nothing to report I left for a better opportunity, with a stable company that is growing and profitable."
bad,"I did a lot for this company, however I was not respected in regards to my work ethic. It's long days of management telling you that you aren't doing your job correctly and putting mass amounts of stress onto you."
bad,jc penny had high expectations for their employees with now reward. expected a certain amount of email applications or hours would be cut. associates can not make a customer sign up for rewards
bad,This place is a terrible place to work & I would not recommend it to anyone. They are looking to pay their people as little as possible & their quality of everything they have to offer has gone down hill
bad,I would never work for this place again.  The management was terrible and they promoted the suck ups.  Hard work was never appreciated there.  I know not all are like this but this one was the worst.
bad,"Bad hours, Bad managers and horrible pay!! Nothing but poor communication between the managers, they will always each have you doing something different and get you in trouble for listening to a different manager. The hours are horrible and I actually moved to a full time position and STILL only acquired about 28 hours a week. the make sure to under schedule you being full time so they do not have to provide for insurance."
bad,"At the salon i worked at in rochester mn, the stylist were mean nasty old lades, that did not appreciate their receptionist. they had an issue with everything that didnt go their way. I would not work here. There is also a large clientel of elderly women in these salons, who tend to be extreamly crabby, want what they want when they demand, a receptionist at Jcp is a peasant in the eyes of the stylist and the clientele."
bad,The company wasn't organized and didn't have any benefits for their employees. There wasn't enough staff and the environmental was stressful to work under. The management had poor communication skills.
bad,"J c Penney was my first job ever ,  i learned how to manage inventory with in a year , manage counting , and also keep up with my area , help customers and stock as well ."
bad,"the environment is not professional, too many family members and close friends that work together so nothings ever done fairly. managers tell personal business to other co workers. if pregnant better hold vomit and urine because they don't allow you to hurry to the bathroom. I guess they would prefer for you to vomit at your desk."
bad,"The worst company I have ever worked for. "
bad,Very poor management In the salon. The pay wasn't the best. They don't put customers first and that's always been the number one rule on customer service.
bad,"While working at JcPenney, I hated every minute of it. It was like being in high school again. The managers are all immature and will talk about you behind your back. I was constantly getting back stabbed by them and they tried to find any excuse to write me up and get me introuble. So if you looking for a job full of mature fun loving people, this is definitely not the place to go."
bad,"While working for JcPenney, it was very unorganized and stressful. I met great people. I left JcPenney because I was only getting paid minimum wage, and that was not enough for me to help pay for bills."
bad,"It was a very fast pace work environment, some managers are respectful.  A typical work day is crazy but that comes with the job. I was a seasonal employee"
bad,The job is really hard on seasonal workers. Hard to  get hours and even harder to impress them enough to want to keep you. lots of on your feet work which is great I do not like idle time.
bad,"there's always a unexpected training, we always have to take the fault of the store associates. the management here is nit picky & lie to your face..."
bad,This was a horrible place to work at Sephora inside my JCPenney's they have the wrong people in management and also the wrong people inside of JCPenney's as managers. When I was hired at Sephora we had one beauty manager I had been there for total of 5 months and there have been one beauty manager to leave and approximately three girls to leave as well and now I see why that is there is a lot of underlying issues inside of that Sephora as well as one manager taking things to her head and being very racial It's a Shame & Scandal all inside of one if you love drama not working as a team then this is the job for you it's just ridiculous and I feel bad for anyone who loves makeup and enjoy being around good people because this is what they have to offer you good luck if you apply there especially the one in Fort Wayne Indiana
bad,terrible pay and hours. the management doesn't really care about you or your needs. they schedule you the worst possible shifts that are the opposite of what you say you can work.
bad,"Good company to work for until the CEO retired then the company started to go under they started to cut jobs and change things trying to have you do more for the same pay. They changed upper management it was really hard for a lot of people because they had worked there for years and years and a lot of them lost their jobs. So at one point, I loved this company and I thought they cared about their employees. Now  It is just business."
bad,jcpenny is not a very good place to work because they dont care about their asscoiates. they treat them like dogs and are very rude. do not work their.
bad,"Terrible management, The hardest part of the job was keeping up with managers expectations. The most enjoyable part of the job was the discount. A typical day at work would be cleaning fitting rooms, helping customers and operating P.O.S."
bad,"By far the worst environment Job I've ever had. Supervisors are very unprofessional, things that are suppose be confidential are spoken in the store with no regard. It felt like high school x10 with adults."
bad,"Management is shady, Pay is horrible for the work you do.  Some of us were required to maintain a state license which cost money.  COntinuing education. which cost money.  and  you recieved minimum wage for the work yo udid"
bad,as being my first ever job I was not the happiest working here as I did not get a chance to excel in this job field and being a cashier was the greatest experience here as they did not treat you with enough respect as a person
bad,"I wish I didn't have this bad of an experience as my first retail job. I wish it would've turned out better, but the ""team"" is very unprofessional. Very underpaid because you end up doing the work a manager should be doing."
bad,"Horrible company to work for. I will NEVER go back.Not only does the store look horrible. Our team would go through and completely re work an area for set week, only to return a day later, finding random putbacks placed where ever the floor associates please, because their too lazy to do it right. Management is absolutely aware of it (not only do they get complaints, it's obviously hard to miss the mess) and they still do NOTHING to actively make things better. Support team gets treated terrible by direct supervisor who pushes the team to work without lunches and degrades them. No matter how hard you work you will never be doing a good enough job and she will talk down to you and the entire team whenever having no regards for anyone's feelings what so ever.. Saying anything about it only makes her retaliate cutting your hours and still no one does anything...  Even other floor associates and supervisors don't care for the support team because they don't contribute to getting credit apps. The team works extremely hard to make the store a better place and should be receiving a HIGHER WAGE THAN FLOOR ASSOCIATES because they do everything that makes the store run! Unfortunately things will never change until they gut the management, find people who treat their employees with respect/appreciation for their hard work and dedication. And also management who have drive and good work ethic. Instead all the management sits in their offices doing NOTHING 80% of the day. Lower members of the support team actually know more than all management about things that make the store run on a daily"
bad,"Salem center Jcpenney is not a good place to work. It is very unorganized. The store always looks bad. Worse then any store I have seen. Most sales associates are lazy and place go backs on any and whatever rack they want. The managers don't do anything at all. They all sit in their offices, fall asleep at their desks, or take a 2 hour lunch. I got treated like a dog and got paid NOTHING for what I was worth. I wouldn't recommend Jcpenney to anyone."
bad,Managers treated employees badly. Co-workers didn't do their part in the workplace but rather went to the dressing rooms to chat and gossip. It was not a good experience and I wouldn't wish this job on my worst enemies.
bad,"Very difficult to have a schedule to make it to class and actually be able to pay for school, the company does not care about the worker especially if you aren't part of the favorites. Always demanded to be available to work weekends."
bad,The company has a stressful work culture. The employees are underpaid and management does not care about you when you are sick. The most enjoyable part of the job was not being there.
bad,I was working there for a month and I was fired on my day off. A day they knew I couldn't work. With no warning at all. I will never recommend this job to no one especially the one in Albany NY at Crossgate Mall.
bad,"tiring never had breaks it was very tiring. learned to use the cashier, got paid very little, wasnt satisfied with my check, looking for better opportunities."
bad,Penneys is not a good employer. They are more worried about profit and the bottom line that there workers. Management was cold and unwilling to be flexible.
bad,"The management here is horrible, the supervisors are very biased and show a lot of favoritism. There is no communication. Work load is not distributed equally and there are never enough hours to get the job done but we are still expected to finish."
bad,typical retail store. don't have a set schedule. This job is for high school students who are looking for their first job or if you want a part time job they most likely will hire you.
bad,Working at jcp is very stressful. I really wish they would of told me that we wouldn't be leaving the store till almost 11:30 if you close when I applied. I get home so late if they have me closing. The management is terrible. I always felt like they had their favorites and just yelled at their non favorites about credit. I wouldn't recommend this job to any high school student or college student who always has tons and tons of papers due late at night.
bad,"Jcpenney is one of the worst company I have worked for. First time job good experience developers,  for experienced people lack of motivation and recginition."
bad,"A typical day at work would include fixing up the department you are working in. Folding clothes, straightening racks. Some of the managers are way nicer than some of the others."
bad,"This is a good place to first know what a job is like. Management could be a lot better, scheduling wise, but great people to work with. They do get busy but most of the time it's relaxed and slow paced."
bad,"Working here has been an experience in being ignored. The culture is unlike anywhere I have ever worked. As call centers go, this one is low paying and low responsibility, but that's the thing. No one cares about anything or anyone. Its like when I walk into a room and say hello I am looked at like I have two heads. No one speaks to each other here. Its like everyone is disconjointed and lacking any caring for this company or one another. I cant wait to find a different job. Its too bad because I am great as a coach and I work hard when I'm appreciated."
bad,"The company culture is terrible, in the Coeur d Alene Location. Some of the managers should not be allowed to work with people. A lot of yelling at staff, in front of other staff and customers ! Never enough hours given to complete tasks and overall a horrible place to work. Beware"
bad,"Hostile environment.  Poor management.  Expected to clean store. Empty trash, etc.  Hours were too long.  Working until 1:00 or 2:00 am not satisfactory.  No escort to car when working late hours.  Forced to work in areas I was not trained for."
bad,"Very poor culture. Very stressful environment. Management was not effective, and often harassed employees. Everyone in the entire company was stressed."
bad,"I didn't enjoy this job, it was part time, seasonal work during the holidays. Management was not concerned with employees needs at all. My 8 year old was sick in the hospital and I was written up for call offs."
bad,"Like the summary says, take this job, and throw it in the garbage. It's all it is good for. Do not work for a company that has such poor leadership, and is slowly going bankrupt."
bad,Some of the managers are hateful and uncaring but love meeting new people and like the 25% discount love helping people find things that they can't find
bad,Horrible Upper Management. They do not care to invest in you. Unreal expectations. Not willing to do any work what so ever. They will reap the benefits of your success without acknowledging you for your work. No home life balance. Working every weekend and every holiday. The benefits are horrible. High deductible health insurance. Dental is no better.
bad,I worked on unloading the company truck and placing merchandise on sales floor managers always moved stuff around before you were done. Not enough hours to  complete tasks.
bad,No one worked together and seemed sketchy. The management was rude and highered people at the last minute lacking the screening process. Employees would kick and throw merchandise while the store was open and in front of customers. Told management multiple times and simply ignored.
bad,It's really hard iPAQ they want you to pack 100 items in an hour.. But none of the stuff come down on time that you have stuff sitting around your station waiting on missing pieces. They want you to work the day of and the day before trouble at the end of each period and be on time. If not you don't make production
bad,This place seriously is one of the worst places I have ever worked. The store owner was terrible and not friendly. If you so much as take a breath you will be scolded. People are cliquey and immature.  Good luck trying to get hours that are consistent or a day off when you need it. the online scheduling is unreliable and all around sucky.
bad,"Terrible company, terrible pay, only made worse with recent changes. I don't even shop there anymore, JCP is not the place to be. You won't get much if any raise."
bad,i did not like working for this company. its all about who you know and that is how you get results. if you are new its hard to learn or move up. they fired managers because they dont want to pay them. its alot of this i really hated about this company.
bad,"job is gone, no JC Penney stores anymore. high price no young brand names no one shops only returns and low pay not live on very well at all so look  for"
bad,"No room for growth. No flexibility, very strict work environment. Family emergencies, doctors appts, etc means nothing within this call center. Usually the supervisors get all the daytime shifts."
bad,please take your hard work somewhere else if you're struggling to find a job and decide to work here go for it just don't stay long it's not worth your hard work pay is poor barley any pay increase staff shows up to work late but you're on time waiting in the parking lot lots of work no hours starts at 7.75 which is only a quarter above minimum my supervisor quit I was offered her job but they didn't want to pay me what they paid her now I'm stuck until something better comes along don't work here if you can help it!
bad,"My experience as a CSR was poor and disappointing. This was mostly due to ""the typical retail life"" of being part-time, minimum wage, high turn-over rate, and no stability. I was not impressed with management either."
bad,"horrible schedules, i only worked there for a couple of months and i swear my managers never knew what they were doing. they didnt care if your shift was up if your replacement wasn't there yet you couldn't leave. when it was closing time you also couldnt leave until EVERY other department was finished organizing."
bad,"This job is disrespectful, they don't care about you. You get treated poorly. They change the rules and regulations up all the time including the dress code. It just a bad e experience period."
bad,Management doesn't know anything about the business. Commission sales dependent on leads that are given away should you dare take a day off. Too many decorators in certain areas while others are allowed to earn a six figure income.
bad,this was the craziest place I've ever worked in my life! they hired literally any body!! I hated working night shift because there was always some creeper outside!
bad,"Why even apply at the Macomb,IL store, they are going out of business very soon..Its just a complete waste of time to even think about getting a job there!!! Do your research...."
bad,very unorganized salon manager as well as head store manager. This is a very hostile and unfair work environment that doesn't pay enough for what you deal with.
bad,"he company doesnt care about their associates. they dont give enough hours , told them i was having problems with another associate they didnt do anything about it"
bad,"Working at JcPenny sucked, they're all stuck up little witches who talk about everyone. Most of them are so disrespectful and rude, worst job ever. They have no humor, and they are constantly thinking they are superior even the boss. shes a douche"
bad,"Days at work have a tendency of dragging, management have problems respecting employees, i left my lost job thinking I will see better and earn more, but it just shows me that it was the same thing."
bad,don't work here they do not pay well and they do not treat their employees with respect. They will promise you hours but then cut them just so they do not ave to give you benefits.
bad,"The JCPenney salon does not supply their stylist with  products to service their clients. The training classes that they offer are equivalent to beauty school courses. It is a minimum wage job. If you're able to bring in $1,000 a week then you qualify for commission.  They take  half of that and then your taxed on the rest. It's better to work  independent / booth rental. I would not recommend anyone working for this salon."
bad,I wouldn't go back to this place if I had to. They were always understaffed. I never could get a hold of my manager and they over worked their employees. There were nights i was getting out there past midnight and I had a newborn at that time!
bad,Managers are rude. They lie to you and they treat you like your their maid. Not long enough breaks. You will be lucky too leave on time and they don't properly train you.
bad,"One manager accused me of calling her a rather harsh name behind her back and wouldn't accept that I never said anything. There was no such thing as respect unless you were the store manager, or a customer, terrible hours, no breaks, no leniency whatsoever."
bad,"Took customer's measurements for eyeglasses, cashiered, verified customer's eyeglasses, performed good customer service, customers were generally elderly, Adjusted eyeglass frames for customers."
bad,Management does not care about hiring from within the company.  There is no room for advancement.  Associates are not valued for their thoughts on improvement.  I worked there for 10 years and was only making $9.00.  You are not valued or given any praise for work well done.  The work must be done so fast that it is impossible to do it right and therefore the store is never truly up to standards.
bad,Didn't like it.  Lack of communication.  This company show no respect  for any of their employees.  The pay was awful.  I wouldn't recommend  this job to anybody.  Only good thing  what is it with flexible schedule.
bad,Worst company I've ever worked for. Awful management team. Never able to find help when needed. Employees don't take the job seriously and just mess around for hours. Computer system is too slow.
bad,A typical day at work is basically the same over and over again. I come in to work and the supervisors don't seem like they are on the same age. The hardest part of the day is having to do my job and everyone else's job. The most enjoyable part is helping customers and having my felloe co-workers help me as well.
bad,The managers were all very rude and disrespectful to all of us. We were literally made to get on hands and knees to clean the store and were spoken to like dogs.  Breaks were insufficient. Our stations were 3 floors below the break room but they started our breaks before we could even really begin a break. Many employees were unsatisfied. We all felt expendable because we were told directly that we were. I really hated that job. I only enjoyed the customer interaction.
bad,The only good thing is some accommodations for doctor's appointments. They aren't fair in the equal treatment of employees. Working with the public has it's moments.
bad,"Poor communication"
bad,I had many negatives surrounding this place but it is retail and i suppose that is a given. The management was horrible and the associates turnover rate was high. Many young associates led to drama and issues.
bad,"JCP is one pretty much a store where they pay their workers the minimum salary and cuts the associates hours just to keep it self from going down the drain. Four years i worked there, and i dont know why. I mainly think it was due to classes i was taking and some people i meet there who kept the store running while the managers did nothing."
bad,"I was hired as a seasonal worker"
bad,This place I worked with for a while. They had horrible management and very bad communication skills. I asked for help in my department and got told to learn how to do it myself. I knew absolutely nothing about my department.
bad,very stressful and unprofessional stresses on credit applications management is very unprofessional they do not help with anything they are very disorganized and belittle employees
bad,"My store didn't care if anyone stole, we had a manager OK people to return free gift cards for cash, was asked to clean up vomit with no bio hazard materials multiple times, would work me 8+ hours and only get a 10 min. break and a 30 min. lunch. Terrible place."
bad,"First job out of school was horrible the stylist were totally rude because wasn't from that area."
bad,First off I am very disappointed because I was excited to work at a place that I love to shop at. But the management sucks and the associates are very messy and the confidentiality rule apparently doesn't apply to the management team which is beyond disrespectful. The managers talk behind associates back as if they do not understand anything and as if they won't find out who said what.  There is so much miscommunication in the Rosenberg store and I do not refer anybody to come work at this place but if you feel that you have a strong personality that will fit this job I greatly encourage you to try it out.
bad,"Run!! Do not even think about looking back. Only 1 day off a year, Christmas day. A point system is used like a club, if you are in a car wreck it's a point, if you have a medical emergency, to bad, it's a point. After 3 you get a PV (policy violation) and are put on a form of probation, there are NO exceptions. Upper management is concerned about their paycheck and nothing else. The motto for this company should be ""The beatings will continue until morale improves"""
bad,This job is very disorganized I will not recommend working here to anyone I had a horrible experience working here this place will stress you out and the pay is bad and so are the hours they don't know how to schedule and everyone is very rude I wouldn't recommend applying here.
bad,"Working for JC Penney is a lost cause. "
bad,"The management was out of order but the employees did a good job at persevering, because of the consistent miscommunication when someone had a closing shift it was expected to leave 2 or 3 hours after the shift was scheduled to leave."
bad,"Jcpenney is a great place to work for as long as it is not the gastonia location. The store manager is the worst ever! She will call you names, lie to you, and on you. If you need a job go to a charlotte location. She has made two h.r managers quit in less than a year. NOT WORTH IT!"
bad,This company has been in business for this many years due to the fact that their support employees who re tag merchandise will raise prices to provide the appearance of a sale. They go through lawsuits all the time.
bad,"This company is only good to work for if you are looking for part-time. I worked there for 6 years on and off and was not treated well, not even making $8/hour."
bad,"Walked around the store observing customers, looked for suspicious activity. Detained shoplifters and handled all store emergencies."
bad,The hiring manager lies and she doesn't follow your availability there is also absolutely no room fro growth like they say and they have some very rude customers
bad,I will never work here again or shop after working at this place we would change the price of items before they even reached the store and over price the item
bad,They can be more like costco and pay their employees better. At the same time there are too many employees who aren't doing their jobs
bad,For High schooler or College students. They treat you like nothing the one in bel air mall. They rude and manager always talking about you in a negative way to other mangers and even co workers. They will not give you a break. Managers sitting on there behind laughing at you when you in need of help. Not a good place to work. For the one in Mobile at the Bel air mall
bad,The managers were horrible. They were always so rude. The employees weren't any better. Never wanted to do their job but boss people around. It's so disorganized there too.. not fun at all.
bad,"Overall they are a standard retail environment. They claim to have flexible schedules, compensation is competitive but not enough to live comfortably on. The team was fun at first but then turned to HighSchool like behavior with ""stories"" being told about every one. A lot was expected of you without giving a lot in return. Computer systems had been updated too many times for the hardware and cause very slow transactions, creating long lines. There was no feeling of job security."
bad,The organization fails to deliver on several key commitments made to its people.  I do not recommend this employer to any job seekers.
bad,"I worked in the operations dept. getting merchandise ready for store floor and replenishing merchandise on floor. First, the store room is so hot and the work is so fast paced. They dont have enough help and we all have to hurry up and finish unloading boxes and merchandise. We are usually scheduled 5-9am. But we never leave at 9, they always make us work later. Lucky if we get a break."
bad,You work incredibly hard for no recognition. Nothing you do is ever good enough and the management is selfish. the customers you deal with and the manipulation from upper management is not worth  risking your mental health.
bad,The hours are terrible as well as the people that work there.  I strongly dislike.  I will not ever work there again.  Especially this store.  Please don't apply unless you are very desperate.
bad,"Flexible schedule. For the company, not for you. Working thanksgiving also. One of the big 12 companies. Avoid them like the plague. Does not work with families or employees."
bad,The hours are horrible and the pay as well. The training for new employees isnt not descriptive and many employees have found different jobs due the training.
bad,The management is ridiculous. It's all about who u know not on performance. They say one thing and do another. Half of the department managers don't know what they are doing. The assistant store manager does not know what she is doing and the store manager is a judgemental kid hating fake. It keeps getting worse and worse.
bad,I learned how to deal with customer complaints and problems as well as inventory management.  The hours of the job are very long and there is little to no advancement within the company.
bad,"I feel the pay is low for the job description, employees are unappreciated, benefits hurt your paycheck, commission-based departments get paid well, hard to move up."
bad,didn't like how the upper management didn't care about the patients and how they treated their employees.................................................................
bad,"The manager in the salon can't do hair she is horrible at what she does but she produces numbers so they keep her. She treats her staff horribly if tney aren't top producers, calling them fat and telling there business."
bad,I enjoyed working there but didn't enjoy the fact the the supervisors were so one sided. I had a co-worker treaten to kill me beat me up in the parking lot all because I did my job while she sat around and did nothing she constantly hid for doing any kind of work. But yet that tok her side on anything she did. There no advancement opportunities with this store. And there is absolutely no way you get raises
bad,"Well being as this facility is no longer open there is nothing to say about my typical day, what I learned, management, co-workers, hardest or most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"There are no words to explain how much of I hate working here "
bad,"JC Penneys treats their employees like trash, they pay pretty low for how much money that company makes. The holiday pay if the only benefit."
bad,Upper and mid-management was constantly changing and I never truly knew my expectations and responsibilities. Poor business process and model. Constantly changing schedules
bad,"I'm been with JCP for just over a year now. I loved it until recently. We have new managers that are rude. They have also been cutting our hours even though we are under staffed, and giving the newer people more hours even though they don't know what they are doing."
bad,Productive and a fun workplace. I learned how to clean dressing room and put clothes back on the racks where they go. The management and co-workers was really nice. The hardest part is the holidays. The enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people.
bad,Is too many people trying to be the boss store manager only work Monday through Friday no weekends he never closes have HR person at don't nothing don't know nothing about HR it's a whole bunch of managers that don't want to train anyone and don't want to help anyone it's not a great place
bad,really really bad experience. it wasnt a great place to work and the management wasnt friendly at all. overall horible experience and id never return. seriously.
bad,"Very bad management. Customer do no live tip. Not clean if you have issue u do not have support. They do not use a rotation. Front desk give customer to their preferred hairstylists or manicurists U do not make money. "
bad,All work performed was based on our customers. Teamwork was our moto.  All departments are connected so we had to work as team members.
bad,"I HATED THIS JOB WITH A PASSION. I LASTED FIVE DAYS. Customers. Rude. Coworkers. Rude. I only made about minimum wage, and we weren't allowed to leave until everything was cleaned up, no big deal right? WRONG. We wouldn't leave until 2 or 3 am, and the mall closed AT 10 PM. No breaks besides lunch, strictly 30 min, unpaid. AFTER AN 8 HOUR SHIFT."
bad,Sweat shop environment that has no promise for advancement.  They either cut your hours of work or increase your hours on a whim.  They require their new workers to work as temps at a rate that is half of what they pay their regular empolyees.
bad,No payroll for the floor but they still want a million and one things done!! Usually on 1 associate at night for 3 departments!! If you say something about the lack of people on floor you are told to quit making excuses!! District Manager is a nightmare walking!!!
bad,Would not recommend. Decent first job. Would not return to this same location. Poor Management. Too much favoritism. Coworkers were enjoyable.
bad,Good starting point for new stylist. Easy way to build up clientele. It is exactly whatever you make it. Salon use top of the line products.
bad,"I did enjoy my employment there, the other employees were great.The management was unpleasant to work with, they were very unprofessional."
bad,"Jcpenney used to be an amazing fun company to work for and not so much anymore... The pay sucks. I was there more than 5 years and the new hires were making just as much as me. That's just wrong.. Then they cut everyone's hours so no one can have full time and trust me you can't live on 15 to 20 hours a week.. Management is terrible! Our manager would sneak around the store spying on people. She was absolutely rude to customers. The customers no longer will shop with jcpenney, walked out very angry.. They took away paid time off and kept it only for full time employees.. Funny thing is only management is full time.. Absolutely disgusted with jcpenney! They are cheap and only care about themselves.. So much for ""the golden rule"""
bad,I love the job interact with customer's to try out our merchandise everyone gotten along well and helped one another out it was great  fun helping customer's locate merchandise really make your day when they make purchase
bad,Not a good place to work. Low wages and no advancement. High turn over and poor management would not recommend it. Find a better place to work.
bad,"There is zero room to grow in this company. 5 years of blood, sweat, and tears and it got me NOWHERE. I would not recommend a job at this company to anyone."
bad,"This store is filled with internal drama, and mismanagment. There are many things that cause what would be a pleasant day at work, and make them nearly unbearable. Also unless you are okay with doing morally questionable things working more than 12 hours every pay period is nearly out of the question."
bad,"a typical day at work for me was enjoyable, because customers and co workers were pleasant."
bad,"A very good start in to the world of retail, just not a lot of training available. A great start in to  the world of customer relations."
bad,Full of unpaid t.o. you can get always keep you right at part time hours so you never qualify for full time benefits (but your full time) black out periods really mean black out unless you have credit cards opened everyday constantly scheduling when you request off very low pay took me almost 3 years to get 50 cent raise place Sucks
bad,"I hated this job.  We were constantly changing supervisors.  No one stayed there longer than 1 year.  this would be a good job for someone without kids, if you have children and a life outside of working...don't even think about applying."
bad,i would never work there again don't do it there is no walk-in's its slow will only work if you come with a book of clients not good for a new stylist
bad,"The management will make false promises to get you to do what they want, will set you up for failure, reprimand you with the office door open, talk about you where everyone can hear them. "
bad,"Very understaffed, overworked. Multiple nights staying late. Not welcoming to family or emergencies. Work and receive your bad paycheck. Never again."
bad,"I asked for one day off the entire holiday season and was told yes in my interview and when the time came around it was not allowed(it was Nov15th not even a big day for the holiday season) and when i tried to talk to someone about it they would tell me ""we willll talk about it later"" by the store manager and the HR representative and then they would knowingly leave the store! multiple times! I would go outside to try to talk to them as they try to leave without talking to me but they would just look at me and drive of fast as they could. They completely disregarded my schedule i had to go to church on sunday mornings and was told show up or quit even though i made it very clear could not work sunday morning."
bad,didnt like the hours never had anytime home hte managers showed favortism and we never got off at scheduled time wouldnt reccomnd to anyone
bad,"I rather not say anything since I don't have anything nice to say. "
bad,worst place I have ever worked. They cut hours and retaliate against people for taking vacations that are due to them. Nothing else comes to mind just a bad company to work for.
bad,When I work at JCPenney Warehouse as office assistant I learn so much about number and goal. Everyday is challenging at work and what I'm doing at work. I run all the report from different department and communication with different department supervisor. It's a good business experience for me at age 18. The hardest part of my job back then is dealing with many number but it's help me to learn many accounting skill in that aspect.
bad,"This company is circling the drain and the talent pool shows it.  Worst group of managers I ever worked with, disorganized, petty, childlike behavior"
bad,Do not work here if you do not have a clientele and do not mind NOT getting paid what you are worth. The things that I was promised at my interview were just said to get me in the door. The turnover rate is high in this salon due to the cons below. Keep track of all of your clients so that you can take them with you when you leave if you do decide to work at this salon.
bad,"Loved the atmosphere:"
bad,"did not like anything about this place, poor management no one knew what to do and it seemed like everything was falling apart"
bad,JcPenney was an okay job to work at its perfect for any young person that's in need of a job. Not very reliable on management side but its an okay job if its your first job.
bad,"I had the perfect personality to take on a position like this, I just would like to be in a much more professional business to put my skills to use at more!"
bad,They do not treat their employees like they treat their patients.  The patient are treated  better then the employees.  They always believe the surveys not what really happened.
bad,One year out of the year and a half I worked for this company were miserable. I felt as if I were in high school and my manager was a dictator who talked down to her employees as if we were three year olds.
bad,I'm very good hard worker and work is work. I like working with a team and be polite. It's good company to shop at and and I get a great discount.
bad,"This job could be a great place to work at ,but its the people that make the job a terrible place to work at. For instance, the management team need to be replace and their is no growth unless you are liked by the store manager. I thought it was equal opportunity for all despite race, ethnicity and religion."
bad,They need new management. It was a horrible experience. They gave me horrible hours. They only gave attitude to the people with color.
bad,"they care about no one but themselves, they will fire anyone for their own gains, they will cut your hours and days quicker than they gave them to you"
bad,Friendly employees on the floor however Horrible communication and organization from managment. Horrible pay from what they have you doing. Very unorganized from managment at store. Uncaring for personal problems and situations as well as favoritism.
bad,I worked in the stockroom on the early morning shift on shipment days. 6am to noon Tuesday and Friday. Management had their favorites. The women in the stock room have been there forever so they weren't very welcoming to new employees. Backroom supervisors spent their time gossiping and shopping and trying to catch people doing something wrong. There were a few great ones to work with but the rest were really horrible. Management had horrible control over backroom.  The job itself was fine. They give out hours to the favorites. They expect you to work on days you weren't hired to work and the days your aren't available.  I honestly don't know how anything ever got done. Definitely alot of room for management improvement.
bad,A job that is used to get skills and move on.  You gain what little customer service skills they teach and move on.  Its the kind of job if you know someone in high places it helps you.
bad,"Management was more interested in being friends with the ""cool"" kids than actually doing their job. It was a social atmosphere where all the kids just want to gossip and have fun while getting paid."
bad,"Treats employees horrible, talks behind their backs... ect. management only cares about their selfs. always someone stepping on your toes making it hard to do your job."
bad,"A fast paced environment with outstanding customer service skills, hands on training etc,on a day to day basic answering incoming calls, making outbound calls, greeting, sending out emails, offering products, great attitude etc"
bad,"Although there was good times working here, this job was not stable for work, there was never any hours to be worked, and I was often left a month with out work hours."
bad,"One of the worst companies to work for in my opinion.  I did not stay long.  It was so bad, it's the only company I quit before finding other employment."
bad,This job is good if you need a job to work around school. Not a particular good place for advancement or if you need to support a family.
bad,"You never really see management, most of their associates were young kids about to be out of high-school or just finished, and were completely unreliable. Calling out all the time causing you to stay later than your scheduled time until they could fine someone to replace them. No one really works there everyone's just standing around."
bad,"i was pregnant at the time and they were not really nice "
bad,"I worked for JCP for about three months. When I first started everything and everyone was very friendly. As the days and weeks progressed, all the promises made to me melted away. For instance, I was promised to become certified as a window specialist. After continually asking when I was going to be trained, I was told soon. After several weeks, I was finally given a 20 minute hands on training but still did not become certified nor had a login. I had to ask a manager to login if I had to place an order for customers!!  Very embarrassing!!!  Also, my HR told me that the Midland store was for high school students. In other words, they prefer high students to others to work there!!  Finally, my hours were cut and given to the high school students working there. When I asked why, I was told that's the way it is. I was dumbfounded when myself and a few others worked our butts off while the high students stood around and listened to their iPods or were on cellphones all the time!!  i tried to continue to have a good attitude, but after everything I won't even bother shopping there the way they treat employees!!!!!"
bad,"Provided customers service ,replenish stock on sales floor,answering multi-line phone to answer  questions from customer incoming calls,"
bad,"Good company, great benefits and flexible hours to work.  It was a very nice place to work with good co-workers and managers."
bad,"It is good experience but that's about it.  Very low salary and no raises is what I've been told by other workers And the manager. You only get commission for certain things you sell.  The amount of money they give you with commission is a joke. The managers throw you out there with little training to work by yourself.  They will make you do what a manager does without the pay.  Only offers 20 hours a week, maybe 30 if you're lucky enough. The manager I worked with was rude to me in front of customers. I would not recommend working here."
bad,"The little time I worked here, I saw about 5 employees at different times get humiliated in front of a customer for a mistake they did. Very unprofessional."
bad,sales associate at jcpenney just seasonal worked in the shoe department my Co workers were really disrespectful where I have lefted I couple days early
bad,the managers are very rude to the employees and do not care about their co workers they act as if they are better than you in every way
bad,"Cutting coloring shampooing styling of diverse clientele. "
bad,Refused to give raises and management and store manager were incompetent. Checks bounced irresponsible when addressing the issue refused to pay the money in cash.
bad,Very poor compensation for the amount of  work you are required to do. Many tasks asked to complete every day for minimum wage pay.
bad,"I really enjoyed my job as a Furniture Specialist  but I did not fit the   "" Culture"", Lack of hours, and opportunities as well as Poor Management and no formal Training on their System or Product. Co worker's complained daily about any and everything from the schedule, co workers to the Customer's which made it Unhealthy."
bad,"They are very set on their schedules, it is hard if you have something come up to get some one to work for you. The one manager is very rude. And they make you do the something thing for hours if business is slow."
bad,I really enjoyed the Job! Our work as employees was very well appreciated....I really enjoyed my job!!! I would recommend this job to anyone....my co workers were outstanding including management.
bad,It was a not the best place to work for I am surprised the company itself is still afloat nowadays. Either way though I still learned a lot from that place.
bad,I pointed out on my first day that they didn't have a sign for the salon. They had been there for three years. They hired me as a stylist but I ended up being a receptionist because none of the other stylist would do it even when I had clients of my own.
bad,The management needed to be more considerate towards the sales associates. It has been so long since I worked at JCPenney that hopefully it has changed for the better.
bad,"Sold window hard and soft lines to customers in a commisioned based environment. Also, assisted customers with items in our home department."
bad,I worked at JCPenney's for 2 months and didn't really enjoy my time there. I didn't have a set schedule and I felt underused in my position.
bad,"lack of hours, management does not communicate at all, not organized. "
bad,A typical day at work is going in signing in on your phone and assisting customers with the needs and placing orders of the phone.
bad,"they only care about credit apps otherwise you're irrelevant to the company. terrible place to work unless you want to be treated horribly, no matter how hard you work. i had to find a new job, with a much better atmosphere."
bad,"I would never go back to this store as an employee or customer. The work environment is horrible, and the managers and mean. Well the one that I worked in. The work I was doing, it was fine. But over all? the people in charge there make it seem like the store is all that, and if they see that you're slacking off just a bit, they will set you aside and have these ridiculous talks to about your performance. Ugh it just sucked over all. The communication between employer and employee was not good, too many bad misunderstanding.  The pay sucked..... DO NOT APPLY HERE!!!"
bad,I do not wish to leave any info. Poor management and poor working conditions. Had to force people to buy furniture.To many problems and management was rude to work with.
bad,A typical day at work would be a lot of customers comming in to the store and ordering clothes and shoping. Also I was responsible for counting down the drawers after every work day and organizing merchandise.
bad,"horrible place to work at. no one appreciates you or your work. hostile environment, no room to grow for opportunity. unfair management. no one listens to  your concerns or attempts to fix them."
bad,"Great for temporary part time work, but no chance for improvement. Employees are undervalued and mistreated. Scheduling is a joke, and hours are scarce. Would not recommend working there."
bad,16 years employed with this organization there was plenty of good benefits and pay were nice as time passed the culture changed and organization lost many great employees the organization changed for the worse
bad,"This was my first real job, manager got angry because I asked to take off for some school activities throughout my senior year of high school. Loved my coworkers."
bad,I have learned alot about retail businesses. I enjoy what I am doing. I like the fast pace and team work to get every thing done in the alloted time.
bad,"A typical day at work would require RFID meaning that I make sure every shoe that comes in is placed on display and place an RFID sticker on the bottom of the shoe. If there are shoes that aren't out, I have to pull them from the stock room. I communicate with my customers when they come in the store and ask them questions so that I can get a good idea of what the perfect shoe for them would be. I make sure I ask the customer if the shoe is needed for a special event or just a special occasion. I restocked shoes when help was needed. I would also take it upon myself to restock shoes without being asked to help the replenishment team out. I complete defective slips for shoes that had any wear or tear on the shoe. I scan miss mates for shoes that are two different sizes, or if there is just one shoe. I learned that it is good to go ahead and complete tasks that are given to me without being told what to do because its says something about the type of person I am. it also shows that I'm a hard worker, and a great team leader for my department. I  love all my co-workers.  They all have different personalities that makes them enjoyable to be around, but you also have some that just aren't people oriented at all. The supervisor that was over my department was very nice, but I didn't like the fact of how she would make me do tasks that other associates didn't complete. Even though I was done with my tasks, I still had to go back and complete their unfinished task. Every time there something to be done, I was the one she would tell to do it, why? Because I know the shoe department inside"
bad,"Help customers and the register help them find an item online make orders, recover floors of clothing, clean up dressing rooms, as with coworkers some are helpful and some work as a team member.  the hardest part on the job is dealing with loss prevention they seem to be hard on us employees as the ones causing the stealing and putting us down as we are nothing to the company. "
bad,"The pay and the schedules"
bad,JCPenney was a really great company to work for. I enjoyed the customer and employee friendly working environment. I enjoyed the professional culture that was shaped by managers and the encouragement that I received from everyone in every department. Our team really worked to help everyone stay motivated and excited about keeping our customers satisfied. It was a very worthwhile experience.
bad,"DO NOT work here if you are looking for a livable wage!! A typical day of work is usually pretty easy. I learned that most seasonal workers will be treated unfairly and will not be hired on full time. The management is rude and unfriendly. My co-workers were alright, most of them had been there forever and looked tired and as if they were beating the dead horse. The hardest part of the job was dealing with co-workers and management. Most unfriendly and judgmental group of people I've met. The most enjoyable part was helping customers find what they wanted, but most of the time what the customer wanted was not in stock so the enjoyment was minimal."
bad,"this is not a company to work for unless your desperate for a job "
bad,"I hated it, supervisor at the time was a rude, inconsiderate lady, who definitely had favorites."
bad,"I don't know who they pay to write some of these reviews, but they are WRONG! Ok, a typical day at work is like working in a dungeon where both co-workers and management conspire against you. Management is a joke, where there are more chiefs than indians. Your co-workers are all stone cold haters who like nothing more than to throw you under the bus so one of the said over staffed chiefs can chew up a new one! The hardest part of this job is not getting laid off after 20 years of service. There in absolutely nothing enjoyable about this job! If you get a job here plan on it being short term, because this company is going out of business very soon!"
bad,I hated it. simple. if you have ever been a waiter then you know why. Just working in this type of job id not okay. The tips were alright could have been better.
bad,"Did not receive a promised job because of ""to many good potentials"".  Was only a seasonal job."
bad,horrible hours horrible pay all they want out of you is to get people to sign up for credit cards youre required to ask which i  did everytime  most people would get annoyed even asking and when i didnt meet my goal which no one did youd get yelled at
bad,Not worth talking about. its a horible place to work. but maybe thats just my opinion
bad,I worked for JCP for four years only to end up making 8.04. They expect you to work every weekend and work through the holidays without any days off. The time and effort working at pennies is not worth the time or the money.  They work you for very hard with little pay.
bad,Blah. Is what Jcpenney gets. The company is not what anyone thinks it is. They underpay and have no problem making you feel like they dont need you.
bad,"A typical day at work is to set up work station, open arrived packages, organize product by size and brand, put on cart, set it up on floor ready to be purchased. I have learned the hard work that customers don,t see behind closed doors."
bad,"Worked front end register for purchases"
bad,"co-workers were very good people .the hardest part of the job was trying to find someone to take over you position when you left to go home. The most enjoyable part of the job was lunches were always free , and we got to see the new clothes before they went on the rack."
bad,"Received stock and helped customers on sales floor. Inventory control, replenished sales floor. Worked with management to push sales"
bad,Very unprofessional and did not appreciate the atmosphere at all especially when I was called and was asked to work there. I did not go to them for a job application. They found me. Was hired as a cashier and they expected me to do WAY more than what was in the job description.
bad,"gave best quality customer serivice to customers, performed receptionist duties, organized work place, folded clothes."
bad,"I worked at JCPenney one summer during my high school career. I was young and the management did not appreciate my hard work. The management was rude and quite frankly, mean. I learned nothing from this job except WHAT NOT to look for in my next job. The only positive part to this entire experience was my wonderful coworkers and the multitude of great customers I got to meet!"
bad,The management here was terrible and not to mention the hours. JCPenneys is going bankrupt. Therefore the pros is you don't have to wear a uniform because they cant afford it. They hardly have any sensors and Loss intervention is a joke.
bad,"-horrible place to work"
bad,"It was a great store to work for than it went all downhill. I was hired at $8 per hour and it took them almost 3 years to give me a raise. When they did they gave employees who have only been there a third of a time I have a larger raise. All in all, I used to love this store, but me and the other associates now resent it and all want to leave because we are miserable."
bad,"Co workers are very easy to get along with "
bad,"Learned many good things from my manager, used this as a learning experiance to my next job."
bad,"Salon services such as hairstyling, haircutting, coloring permanent waving, facial waxing and manicures/pedicures."
bad,The rate of pay is not enough for the job position. The co workers make it a fun environment.
bad,Customer service is the best job engaging with others also multitask learned a lot
bad,"I can ONLY speak for the store in which I was employed. I learned a lot while working there about retail, clothing, customer service and being a strong person. With this store it isn't a team effort. The team effort is established between only associates that love their job.With that being said, you genuinely have to love what you do to be able to get through a day. Most but not all of the management IS horrible. having a upset customer and having to wait for a extended period of time before someone even calls. I had some amazing co-workers and some that only cared for themselves. Whereas I wanted to make the store a comfortable and clean area to shop and also work not everyone cared the same. All some management and co-workers cared for were credit card applications and customer service. The way I viewed it is that if you have a clean and put together environment to shop associates would not have such a hard time convincing if the customers fall in love with the store and the clothing itself. Unfortunately on multiple occasions I was told to stop cleaning up the sales floor and try to get credit applications. The hardest part of my job was the fact that I loved this job and I worked very hard at every task that was given to me but some management ARE very rude, disrespectful, not understanding, and could care less for the people that drive the sales at the end of the day they just want to know that it was reached. I almost broke down and cried a couple of times because it became unbearable. The most enjoyable thing about y job was having some of the best people working with"
bad,Didn't like working for the company wouldnt go back. They dont care about there employees.
bad,A typical day at Jcpenny would involve me coming into work and heading to my certain department. I would put away any items left out and clean up. I would also help costumers. I learned to stay calm with crazy costumers. The management sucked. Most of my co-workers were very nice and I liked them. The hardest part of my job is the rude part. The most enjoyable time was breaks.
bad,No working culture..High with politics in between the team..
bad,"good for a summer job for students"
bad,"From the minute I started this job the management and other employees were rude. New people were quitting all the time because of it. They don't want to waste money so they only schedule one or two people in a department at a time, and expect you to handle everything and work so hard only making around minimum wage. The pay is NOT worth the stress. They tell you there's room for advancement when hired but really there isn't. Waste of time and stress."
bad,"Fun Place to work they take good care of the costumer, but they really bug you about credit cards you have to get a certain number a week, have to do more then other managers/supervisors have there favorites they are really picky of whatever you do."
bad,Picking up clothes that fell on floor assisting customers with locating a specific item they were looking to purchase either in store or at other company locations
bad,"typical day at work:"
bad,"No job security, when the holidays are in so are its workers.When the holidays are out so are its workers."
bad,"I was hired as sales support two months ago. Since that time, I've had no training whatsoever. I was just thrown out on the sales floor. A couple of older associates tried to help the new people but for the most part we were on our own. The stress level is incredible. They don't have enough associates to cover the store because they consistently schedule light. Yet the store is always a mess and nightly recovery is overwhelming. I've already given notice. I'm a hard worker but this is just back-breaking."
bad,"mangers dont know how to manage"
bad,Fun to work there. Flexible with school schedule. Friendly coworkers.
bad,Jcpenney was definetly not a good place to work at. They don't treat their employees right. They never gave you a set schedule . You had to work at all types of different times and they would expect you to even do maintance work even if that was not in your position. They never hire tyour pay and your job is never secure. You can be there one day thinking everything is fine and the next day you are out. The management team is no good.
bad,"I don't recommend working here. No raises, no promotions. many empty manager positions. favoritism. dumb."
bad,Typical day at work is very busy. Barely get a break. Management never there but 5% of the time. Management always on vacation or leaving early. Most enjoyable part of the job they always keep you busy.
bad,"I don't even know where to begin. First off, training was a joke. The second day, the SECOND DAY, I came in and the HR person was not there, and no one knew what to do. So I had to dig out the videos I still needed to watch, and an hour and a half later the HR person shows up. I should have known then something was wrong about the store and company."
bad,the store closed down. it was an ok place to work. terrible management though
bad,Management is terrible. I've trained more people that were going to be working above just being a floor associate. Most of the management team don't know anything of what they're doing. They tend to only promote the workers who get the most credit apps; which doesn't necissaru That doesn't seem quite fair. I've been threatened my job and my hours if I had to call in sick for any reason or if I couldn't stay late one day; when I've come in on my day off and stayed for 17 hours before.
bad,"My experience there was overall horrible! "
bad,"cleaning, hanging up clothes, loaded trailors, reticketed items"
bad,did like it but it was unstable with the temps running temps as in being supervised by a temp when your a temp.
bad,"The management was not very respectful of employees. "
bad,I loved working for this company and would like the opprotunity to work for them again. I had to leave due to a divorce and relocation.
bad,"Unload truck repetitious stock ..."
bad,"An ok place to work, I loved working the CHA sites, but the company lost the contract to the site I was assigned so that left me without a job."
bad,I don't really have anything positive to say about my experience with this company. I will not speak down but I will say this was not a very good job for me.
bad,the hours were very erratic and there was no chance at full time unless in a management postion. Your pay was minimum wage with no chance at a raise.
bad,Workers are good to get along with and customers like the things in JC penney good mens suits if they market it right. and ties and shirts.
bad,you can be injured on the job becasue they dont schedule enough people to make sure that you are covered and when injured at work and subsquently get and injury from putting off an important and needed surgery to work for them they will fire you
bad,They did not put people on the schedule for 2 weeks at a time. They also had a lot of favoritism.
bad,"BAD company!! All the prices change, and everyone in the company changes!"
bad,"keeping The stores an easy and exciting place to shop for our customers. (Tulsa , OK)			"
bad,"minimum wage job, retail environment, messing store from customers hate cleaning after them"
bad,we cleaned all over offices canteens etc. all training was given. we worked great as a team
bad,"Despite the oppressive and eventfully destructive culture that persists at JC Penney (that is why their stock is so low now) I managed to not only gain very useful experience, but thrive there.  Due to wages and incurred vacation hours senior team members were targeted for systematic termination.  Finally, their disregard for what people wanted or thought eventually spilled over into the stores and affect customers and this spelled the ultimate demise for this once great company.  Now, if I was able to flourish in this septic work environment just think what I could do for your company."
bad,"Little diversity within company -- the haves and have nots..."
bad,"Love working with the public?  Meet great people in a fun and fast paced work place.  Opportunity to advance in the company.  Great discount, insurance, paid vacations."
bad,this is not a good place to work............. worked for them over 4 years. stay way if you can
bad,Run cash registers. Helped in the floor when needed. Assist customers with questions they  may have.
bad,It maybe the store I was in but there was no organization.  There were a great deal of wonderful people that worked in the store but they were poorly treated.
bad,I didnt like jc pennys work me k\like a slave and I been askin them to put me on full time. But a girl came after me and got moved up to a new postion. I wasnt getin no hours. So I found another job
bad,"The managers are awful and mean, and the employees treat the work environment as a chance to socialize. It feels like a high school work environment. Also they will change your schedule without telling you and make you work awful hours, or even all night."
bad,"J.C. Penney was originally a good place to work. However, things quickly changed with the turnover of ceo's."
bad,"Co-workers were great, but that's about it.  Working here was miserable.  No work/life balance whatsoever.  They expected Penney's to be your life."
bad,"Poor management . Co workers were great  . Enjoyed working with customers ,"
bad,"Alert, this is not a real position....do not apply,  they will assign you another job instead. Horrible bait and switch tactics."
bad,It is an easy job but when the managers act like high school girls it is not worth working there.  After working there almost 1 year and getting credit apps as well as find mores they reward me and others with 12 hours or less per week.
bad,"Working at jcpenney i learned that you should not be friends with very many of your co workers. "
bad,"On a typical day at work I will do some hair, answer phone, sale products, clean and stock the salon."
bad,"worst place i have ever been hired at..most disorganized company. went for training and the so called trainer was disorganized, had no plan, didn't know how to deal properly with people. the trainer just placed you in front of a computer( if he could find one) and have u watch tutorials on how the register worked..never given a job discription, nor even told who the manager of the store is. had to ask for the phone number of the office to call in sick or if running into problems pertaining to work. no schedule given to anyone in training,just told to come back two days later or what ever was convient for him. no 10 min. breaks given. i am over 40 and thank god don't really need to work. just wanted a few hours for xmas so i wouldn't use my savings. i was put into training with 18 year olds who have more computor experience then i do. i actually read all of the tutorial ( even though i was moved to 3 different computers and had people talking loud because they were leaving for the weekend.) the print on the computer was blurry making the keys of a simulated register hard to read. no reference booklet even given out to help u go over the material pertaining to the register. this place was a disaster, junk laying around in every office( it was like horders at the workplace) papers and food pakages in the offices just thrown with no organization. I have management experience from past employement...This trainer/manager doesn't really no how to talk or deal with different types of people. If you speak your mind he tries to pull the old ""attitude card"" on u. i see jcp just wants 18"
bad,"My day at work was pretty enjoyable. As time went on I got faster because I knew where everything went. The management worked with other employees and myself as a team, so I felt comfortable day in and out. We played as a team and everything ran smoothly. Nothing was really that hard and the most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers to complete the task so time flew."
bad,It was a miserable experience! The management was rude and stole merchandise faster than the customers. The staff became smaller as a result. The leaders didn't work as a team. They were very unethical and didn't lift a finger-but had the staff 2hrs after closing almost all the time. It was the worst experience!
bad,"horrible management, horrible pay, more drama than a high school lunch table."
bad,"Everyone was fantastic! the whole entire structure if how the company set up everything was too good to be true.! even though I wasn't able to stay here , I would recommend a lot of people who have a strong mentality of entrepreneurship. This would definitely would be the job! I really miss working here :("
bad,Worst place to ever work. Got layed off with out a heads up like everyone else.
bad,"My training was a joke.  I had 3 days of training in 2 days.  The day I started training the person who was to train me was not there.  After completing online training  I was then thrown on the floor with no register training.  Thank God for the co-workers they were friendly and helpful.  They were the best part of the job."
bad,They do not value the more experienced older employees and are replacing them with people who lack skills in Customer Service. The pay they gave me was NOT indicative of my skills.
bad,NO MONEY AND NO HOURS AND NOT MUCH ELSE TO SAY.. Maybe if you don't have kids a great place to work
bad,"I worked here briefly a long time ago and I imagine things haven't changed since I left. I was an associate, I manned the register, did recovery, and helped customers. they had stationed me in the men's dpt. I remember, which was fine, I am a man and I was in a dpt. with products familiar to myself. When i worked here i was hired for the holiday season, and of course as expected it was hectic and busy, the lines were very long. I was only there for a bit for reasons having to do with school. I later resigned, but it was an ok experience, it was my first job in retail."
bad,"They pay only on low-end side of pay scale, no room for advancement, and no appreciation for work done."
bad,No growth at all. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this company.
bad,"You clock in have a morning meeting and open your department "
bad,"JCPenney is a good retail store to work for as in getting yourself in the door of knowing and feeling as a starter. I've worked for JCPenney for seven years, and I feel like its not a place that can benefit the needs for me as a single mom. We do have a good managers but their communication is kind of off. As in working with others, I get along with my coworkers and we get the job done as a team, and we always make sure to help customers in need. The hardest part about working in JCPenney is working with coworkers who doesn't work and it will fall on you to work their jobs as well. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that the customers know how hard you work and give you praise for it."
bad,Very low pay for how hard me and the other employees worked. Benefits were terrible. I would never work there again. They treat their employees with disrespect.
bad,its a job that you could survive but i need more hours.its a very good working enviroment.
bad,"Perform housekeeping duties, including washing and drying towels, sterilizing combs and brushes, maintaining workstation."
bad,very unprofessional failure to thrive usually not enjoyable 
bad,It is usually a huge crowd on fri & sat .. that's the only time they care about you. sun - thurs they don't care .. they'll keep you there until 3 am because they don't have a union
bad,A typical day at work was a constant challenge. Every company initiative went against the company morals and values. I learn to be resilient and adaptable to every modification to work load and to company expectations. Co-workers are a hit or miss. Every team is different. The hardest portion of the job is setting a monthly SET to 45% of is capacity. The most enjoyable portion of the job is hard to see from time to time. The negatives out-weigh the positives on a daily bases.
bad,The most horrible part of the job was the Store Manager. The best part was the customers and co- workers.
bad,"Everyday was stressful there was so much emphasis on what we already knew. We were talked down to, belittled, offended, racist comments, and treated like children. I could say my coworkers and customers were the best part of the job. I learned how to work with customers assisting and handling their needs. The hardest part was keeping up with all the tasks given when one manger says ""yes"" to the same thing that the other says ""no""; communication was not given there."
bad,A typical day at work included coming in a working with customers to locate clothes or jewelry in their size and style.
bad,"I am qutting JCPennys because my management has clear favorites and they pick out hard workers and then once they request time off they are cut hours and looked down upon you. Right now they are cutting back hours so they firing new hires on the terms they did not meet standards in the 60 day probation period. Management was always hard to work with, rude, inconsiderate, rejected all of my 4 days requested off the entire time I worked there. They cut hours so bad that I was working one 6 hour shift a week so I had to get another job and then when I went to change my avablility(sp) because of that they rejected that as well. I've never had a management treat me so poorly all of my bosses except pennys have praised me and my hard work. Sales support gets no recognition for hard work and treated like they are stupid by other sales associates and management. Poor pay, too much work for what we are getting out of it. No benefits for sales support. Long work days (if you get hours) with little to no breaks. Sales support works in hot conditions while sales associates stay in nice parts of store. Told I wasn't smart. Told I asked too many questions. Told I was too quite and needed to be loud but when talkative told to be quite. Salon is treated terrible in addition to sales support.       "
bad, 
bad,did not enjoy this job or how management treated most of us. i was just the receptionist but i did a lot of work. i did enjoy the computer system they used for bookings though.
bad,Managers are always changing policies and rules to fit themselves and make special individuals feel special.
bad,"my job was very stressful not lot of benefits..long hours and no help..I would have to do a job by myself which, required at least two employees..complained to managers/supervisors many times..they would not do anything about it...never again in my life will work for this company"
bad,"What a joke, I got hurt outside of the job and they cut my hours.  If they don't like you they work you only 1 day."
bad,"If you are looking for logical answers to your questions, Fo' get about it. If you are looking to advance based off your hard work and doing the right thing, Fo' get about it. If you think Integrity means the same thing to a multi-billion dollar company as it does in the Websters dictionary,  Fo' get about it. JCP is going in the wrong direction. Logical, high school graduate, obvious common practices of retail sales does not apply here. Instead of keeping things simple they confuse customers with creative, but hard to follow,  advertising. They change their sales strategy too quickly, before the customer can fully understand it, and all this during a recession is ridiculous. "
bad,"Did this during my first year of school. good hours. no benefits, no time off during week days. "
bad,i learned to deal with rude cumtomers. I had some great co workers who would take there time out to teach me things i didnt know at all .i enjoyed our xmas party and the discount every co worker got .
bad,A typical work day is boring and the management sucks and is unorganized. Hated this job.
bad,"ran reports and researched all discripancies and shortages,data entry and kept logs of all in going and out going inventory. In charge of 60 sku's including homeware,big n tall, nike and watches & jewelry."
bad,"When I first began at JCP everything was great. The company was doing well and the management team actually cared about their employees. When the new CEO took over things began changing, and it wasn't  just the policies and look of the stores. The entire mentality of the management team also changed. They seemed to have stopped caring. All of a sudden no matter what you did it was never good enough. Instead of positive comments and praise you got negativity and put downs. I did however enjoy my time there for the most part. I learned a lot about the inner workings of a large company. I also learned many different jobs that I feel will help me advance in my future career path."
bad,"It was very stressful at times , You would be scared to make a mistake you can get fired at anytime. And the managers had favorites"
bad,I would submit my availability at least a month in advance and still was scheduled for times that I had classes. The managment was not understanding about me going to school and the companies values are little to none. They force employees to harras customers into taking out credit cards and tricking them into it.
bad,"I have been working there for a few years and have gone from a dispatch into management. I have learned many different techniques on how to schedule and use the new computer programs to keep information flowing, how to read and convert sales to schedule for different advertisements, and how to keep track of received products."
bad,you r wasting you time with this company no money they get all the money and u do all the work and the management's are the only one that get the praises
bad,i would not recommend this job for anyone who wants to work more than 15 hours a week. do not work there
bad,• Responsible for counting money in register
bad,Some managers are not friendly. Promise you full-time then reduce your hours.
bad,"Mangement walks all over you because they ""are higher up."" Sometimes you never get a break because your boss has better things to do with their outside life. So they make you skip your break to finish the rest of the days work. You are asked ""where are you going"" and ""what are you doing"" all the time. Even if it is just to use the restroom. There is no excuse to anything in JcPenneys. If the store I'm currently working in for new managers I think my co-workers and myself would be much happier. We would feel a lot better walking into the store knowing we were not going to be talked down on that day. I am just trying to put a heads up for someone. Some stores may have great store leaders and mangers, but some have ones that let the power go to their heads. Good luck."
bad,"A typical day at JCP includes various start/end times. I enjoy working with people, and there is a variety of them that come through the door each day."
bad,"Used to be great place to work, with values and respect to its loyal employees, which it nurtured to have, when the Penney family was in charge. Steadily went downhill over the years after they quit being in charge. The latest CEO has destroyed the company and its values for its employees and its customers. He fired all long time, over 10 years +, full time, employees and hired only part time, giving them only 10 to 12 hours a week. NO ONE CAN LIVE ON THOSE HOURS! Also, wont let part time employees work another job, says it conflicts with their ability to schedule, thus keeping everyone poor but himself. No hours, No healthcare or benefits."
bad,"might just be the penneys at saratoga but it was terrible. terrible hours, terrible managers. i had to do the managers job for less money, and if you didnt shove credit cards down throats you didnt get more hours at work."
bad,"I would go in and I worked in catalog so I made sure customers with orders were informed they were there. Wait on customers and size the cloths. None of the management was on the same page, so your questions got three or four different answers. The hardest part of the job was simply keeping yourself busy. I found it unbelievably boring, so time seemed to take for ever. I really did not enjoy anything about this job other than some of the employees."
bad,"The clothes are very poor quality, they don't pay their associates enough money."
bad,I hate this store. No real management. if your an associate you'll always be an associate.
bad,The staff wasn't encouraging. They were very demeaning. I have heard since then they no longer work there and that was in management.
bad,"Worst job of my life. It's dusty, boring and no one shops there!"
bad,"There is very little good to be said about this job. My job required my team to be at work at 5 or even 4 AM sometimes, then working until 3 PM. When I first started, my team was only responsible for unloading shipments and restocking. The shipments gradually became larger and the team smaller over the course of about a year. This was expected around the holidays, but come the same time the year after, the shipments were regularly about one and a half to twice the size as they were the year before, with only 5-6 people on our team, despite the fact that company policy dictated our team to have at least 10 people. So of course, we would not be able to finish our jobs on time, and would end up working 12-13 hour days. This resulted in my supervisor being laid off, and all of my teams hours being cut down to practically nothing after the holidays (because it was apparently ours and her fault that the job wasn't getting done on time, despite being understaffed and overworked). Occasionally, people on our team would miss work, including myself, due to the managers who make the work schedule changing our schedules at midnight (which is when the JCP website shuts down for maintainence until about 4-4:30 each night, rendering us unable to check these changes in time) the night before we were re-scheduled to work and NOT contacting us to tell us that changes were even made. Apparently, this is also our fault. There is plenty more to say about working at JC Penney, but aside from the above, I'd have to say the worst part is my co-workers. Working at JC Penney is like being in high school."
bad,"worst job experience ever. they do not pay well at all, the products are complete garbage, the glasses you get back from the lab are laughable, in horrible condition, scratches, mangled, etc. feels like you are working in a kiosk in the mall. if you have actual experience in optical, do not apply, you will not be paid what you deserve and your knowledge will not be appreciated. many limitations on the products that are available for customer relationship between lab and store is horrible, they are rude and obnoxious.you have no one on your staff,no hours to hire anyone on, the drs are independent and could care less and you have to abide by the jcp return policy. manager is just a title you make no decisions without approval from corporate, you do not get paid for overtime the incentive package stinks."
bad,"Worked for my local JC Penneys here in Valdosta Ga. I was hired approx. 7 months ago in the shoe department. My fellow associates were paid 9.50 a hour or more. They started me off at $7.50 a hour. My job was to do theirs , my department manager and my job as well. I was never acknowledge, offered a pay increase, or offered a promotion. I was actually let go today because of that very same reason. I was yeld at by the Store Manager and told I wasn't doing my job because I asked my department manager to speak with employees who weren't doing theirs or for a pay increase. It is beyond me how companies treat their employees. The ones who work the hardest , get degraded and the lazy , unreliable ones get rewarded."
bad,"Cashier, stock, inventory, customer service, i like working with many different people."
bad,"they will treat you like a child, and stab you in the back. Once the remodeling started taking place it ruined the work"
bad,"Checked out customers, cleaned area up, opened new accounts for customers. This is the first and last retail job i will ever work! I loved all of my co-workers and my supervisor but the general manager was a nightmare! She said things to her employees that were very unnecssary. Such as calling me a coward and telling me my clothes didnt look good with my hair color. Saying rude things that were just completely unrelated to work. And forget about taking a break because she will ask you if you cant handle working that long without one and threatens to cut your hours. I wouldve loved that job if she wasnt there. She makes her employees dread theyre jobs including the managers who were open about their hatred for her."
bad,Dear Lord
bad,"I was a lead service expert. You have no support and are at the mercy of unethical, untrained store managers. You have a supervisor title but no real power because the store manager will not back you up on associate discipline. Worked 40 plus hours and nothing was ever good enough. If you complain about anything you will be gone. They will make up a reason to fire you. There is no support from internal employee complaints. Run very fast from this company"
bad,"assistant manager of store wanted every position filled, so some days only service was an eyebrow wax. over staffed for traffic. did get paid per hour. hard to build clientele with one service a day"
bad,It was a good company until all the unnecessary lay offs. Some of the processes should not have been moved especially since those processes were saving the company money and now any & everything gets paid and it might not be owed.
bad,No value or loyalty to employees. The managment team at the westminster mall co are cold and unwelcoming. Would not recommend employment
bad,Not a good place to work. No recognition. No balance between work and family. Little room for advancement.
bad,"Having bled for the company for quite a few amount of years I had the pleasure along with many other people of losing my job this past year. Some stores in the company didn't loose people we however weren't so lucky. The company is going in a really bad direction and they've restructured three times in a matter of six months. Be warned, stability is not guaranteed."
bad,not a fun place to work. you are not accepted as an individual. There is little room for advancement. low pay and no benefits.
bad,"assiting customers via telephone/ web with products, services, suggestive selling products etc."
bad,Not an comfortable work environment . managers watch your every move more than customers .
bad,a typical day at work with bad workers in the stock area
bad,Probably one of the worst jobs ive ever had. Never had enough people to help around. Employees were nice. Management sucked.
bad,"The lodi stores store manager loved to sit in her office and drink starbucks, and when she felt like it she would come out and bark orders and blame everyone. The crew that worked in the stock room had a terrible manager, and she created a hostile work ienviorment."
bad,"Liked working with coworkers.. wouldnt give benefits, would work people to the bone.."
bad,"stock stood for long periods hung cloths walked very hot,only temp job"
bad,"A typical day working at JcPenny for inventory would start by having the managment straight off ignore the new emplyees, then throughout the whole day, unmannered demands were given, by the end of the day there was screaming being heard and opinions ignored. I was a high school student at the time and the school i attended gave out hours of home work, and none of it was possible to be done right because the managment would keep us over hours without pay and very late when it was illegal to keep under 17 of age employees at work after certain hours."
bad,Setting up displays before the store opens
bad,"standing all day, interacting with lots of customers. There is nothing else to tell. I was a cashier hired to help out for the winter season. Some of my co-workers were nice others seemed a bit prejudice. the hardes part of my job was standing all day long. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the customers."
bad,"I learned all aspects of a busy office in my 24 years with the company. I handled all daily cash deposits,sales media and payroll."
bad,the work Work Hard All day Like Working i am Hard worker Put Merchandise Help Customers
bad,Nothing much to say. It was a job that ended so that I could work for Verizon.
bad,"lakeforest mall most the old management is gone, one more person to go. not fair and square to the thousands of employees that were either eliminated or their pay was cut."
bad,management didn't know which way was up. projects they had us do never got complete right because they never really gave us guidance on the matters.
bad,Hated this job. the pay was horrible and working conditions was bad. They have no real benefits for there employees.
bad,"At JCPenney, you spend your day doing EVERYTHING. They are the slave master and you are the slave. The staff is expected to ring up customer, replenish stock, clean the fitting room, straighten up the disaster area they happen to be working in, watch out for potential shop lifting, and anything you can think of. The have really cut down on staff so the little they do have they milk them for everything they can get. Management is horrible. They let the customers do whatever they want even if it'll cost the company money. They always side with the customers and don't support the employee making them look like fools. The hardest part was dealing with management. Even customer felt we were treated horribly. The most enjoyable part was working with my coworker. They were some of the coolest people I know and to this day I still keep in close touch with a few of them"
bad,Not very appreciative of employees hard work. Advancement depends on who you are.
bad,"Everyone walks on eggs afraid for thier positions. Employess are being dismissed over conference calls. Management or leaders are working hard to eliminate all full time positions. Also eliminating high salaries with younger smaller salaries. Stores are empty, salon are empty. Every day employees are being sent home for the lack of business. So many great associates gone. Health benefits are not good and will go away after a year or two. jcp has added a big burden to the country's economics. So many things happening that,s just not fair and square. So little integrity!"
bad,I think the salon is overlooked and ran as a corporate institution instead of a salon. Needs to be restructured to fit the needs of the public to be able to be in competition with other Salon's in the industry. Management not good in my opionion.
bad,"A well lighted, clean, and lively workplace. The youth were much friendlier than the older workers who were a little set in their ways of doing things. Customers were pleasant with the exception of one or two. Management was uncooperative and would not provide enough hours to work when asked. I was fired from my job with no explanation or paperwork."
bad,assit customers in taking orders by phone. Also help tracking orders and upselling the customer.
bad,Meeting and assisting customers with jewelry purchases.
bad,"I lost my job at JCPenney after 19 years of service. The new CEO is cleaning house.....my entire work group is in the same boat. Worse yet, no one was given any kind of previous notice before the ax fell. Bottom line: it's all about the money. Loyalty is unimportant, it's about the buck in the pocket. I'm sure Mr. Penney is turning over in his grave as he never intended his company to take the course it's now taking! Really sad to think about."
bad,"Don't work here. It's a horrible place. If youre thinking about doing security here DON'T DO IT! My fellow co workers were the best, but everyone outside of my little lp office were not. The management except for my supervisor does not know how to manage anything. The store manager is a ""deer in the headlights"" type of person. The pay is absolutly nuts! You're risking your life with nothing on you but a pair of handcuffs and you get paid like $11.00 an hour! TRUST ME, DON'T DO IT."
bad,I enjoy working at Penney's but feel that I need to return to Banking and use my skills there.
bad,learned to work with other coworkers and costumers in different moods.coworkers were nice. hardest part was working with costumers that were angry but that's in every job. the enjoyable part of work was helping others.
bad,unload trucks work as a team mangement was shady metting new people
bad,"Four hour shift, I would not recommend anyone to work there."
bad,I was in charge of the daily schedules of 40 stylist. Each one was very particular and demanding. I helped maintain inventory.
bad,"Associates high on the job, talking of getting high on breaks and when they got off work, I felt like the only one being ""straight"". I was even offered to buy drugs from certain associates, this was no place for me, I quit."
bad,"I was verbally assaulted only after one week of employement. Management tolerated it. What an embarassment for them. I left after one month and my innsurance was never converted to COBRA. It wasn't even offered, but my deductions were taken regularly for insurance that I never had. The hours I was hired for were never scheduled. They are the worst company I have ever worked for."
bad,Jcpenny's is a great company with great oppurtunities. There's alot of interacting with customers. Great place to make friends. Everyone's friendly and respectful.
bad,JC Penney is not the ideal place to work if you have any sort of bills/family to take care of. They dont listen to their employee's when concerns are involved and the hours are very very limited. You would be lucky to even get 10 hours during off season. The management is very poor. They play favorites when it comes to scheduling and the people who actually work when they are there are the ones who are left in the dust when the schedule is posted.
bad,"I was a great employee, hard working always on time and always showed up. All was well until I got pregnant. The management staff treated me like dirt, made very rude comments about my pregnancy, kept cutting my hours down and tried so hard to get me to leave, which I eventually did. They even stooped so low as to accuse me of stealing! I still cannot believe how horrible they treated me and this was years ago. I refuse to shop there even to this day."
bad,This place is for some one thats not looking for much out of a job the start is very low pay and they want you to work so hard for pennys. They run the salon like a retail store
bad,I would not recommend this as a part-time job for anyone. You will never get promoted to a full-time position
bad,"They do not care about their employees. Only do things for tax purposes, minimum wage, ""based on experience"" which is not true."
bad,"If u are Working under the current Beauty manager I wish you luck, Be prepared to have her ""life problems"" become your ""work problems"" she is a terrible manager in my opinion. they make it seem soooo fun. Well if you want to stand around and hear her complain all the time and dust dust dust then this job is for you!!!"
bad,Management was unprofessional and training was a joke. Management didn't seem to care what employees were doing or enforce rules. Some employees were very rude and not sure how they got hired.
bad,I wouldn’t recommend working there in any department . Management doesn’t care about anyone accept the sales . The hours aren’t flexible and the moral is really low and associates are very caddy .
bad,"I’m sad to say that in my seasonal time working with JCPenney Clearwater I felt overlooked. Not only did I have 2 days of hands on training I was not told multiple procedures. (1) being a important part of closing registers (2) being how to request change the correct way. I was grab by the wrist and pulled back by a follow cashier and was told I need to listen to her go over how to sell credit cards, as I walked two feet in front of her to help a customer"
bad,"JcPenney is a great first job for someone, but not a good place for anyone looking for career advancement or recognition. You can work your fingers to the bone but unless you meet credit goals, that doesn't matter. Employees are disposable and there appears to be no real care for the workers or their wellbeing."
bad,"The main goal of this company is getting people to apply for credit cards. They dont care if you never call out, if you go above what's needed or if you get good surveys. If you're not bringing in credit applications than you're not worthy of employment."
bad,There was no support from upper levels of management at all. I worked in the Home Department and we didn't have a supervisor until 3 weeks before I walked out. Barely any hours were given to new people. I once worked only 8 hours in a week. Asking for time off was a race against the clock. The new store manager came from a rival store and was replacing employees with her friends from the other store.
bad,I hated working here! The management was horrible and we had no idea what to do. We didn't have a manager in the salon for six months and no one knew what to do in her absence.
bad,No respect for the employees. Management so poor. Racism and discrimination everywhere. They have good discounts for the employees but that’s it. Nothing else. It’s a waste of time. I don’t know if every one of them is like that but I can talk for the one at Wellington.
bad,JCPenney can't decide what to sell or who the target market is. They are constantly adding new products at a great expense and then deciding it was a mistake and removing them. This is most evident with their Martha Stewart line as well as big ticket items such as furniture and appliances. They have been through many CEOs and none of them has been able to stabilize JCP. They are constantly hounding you for not getting enough credit applications. It is like working in a pressure cooker. Much stress.
bad,"Yeah that pretty much sums it up. Bad pay, they only want pallet builders, if you're trying to take a day off they won't let you unless you ask like 3 weeks out and even then complain. Management is a complete joke, ask anyone of the veteran employees. The company went down hill years ago."
bad,"Do not work at JC Penney's, that is as simple as I can put it. The management sucks and no one wants to work here as the company will be belly up in under a year. Employees are either stretched too thin or there are too many and you get left with 10 hours a week. The entire management team at at least at my specific store needs to be replaced. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking with customers and you don't get to do that often other than helping them find what it is they're looking for. The only culture that is at JC Penney's is a sexist one, the entire company brand revolves around helping ""her"", this is constantly brought up all throughout training as the only thing that matters are the female customers. The stores are dying and rightfully so, I don't know what kind of company JC Penney used to be but in 2019 it is not a good place to work or shop, so stay as far away from it as you can."
bad,"Too much ghetto people working, when ur a cashier in the morning on weekdays it’s very slow and it’s just u. They expect u to fold ur area & also watch ur register? Managers had favorites. Dress code was annoying nobody followed it but again managers had favorites so u’ll get called out but others won’t. Discounts was great always found stuff on clearance while working! Again for me it was too boring, too slow. Great if it’s a first job"
bad,"poor  management- constant change and uncertainty.  Unless you are a JCP employee from high school/college, you are treated like an outsider.  Very little work/life balance."
bad,"They demand too much from you considering what you get paid. They are very biased to employee's they like and prejudice against the one's they don't. They pay new employees more than employees that have been with them for longer. The managers hated me for some reason. A friend of mine didn't believe me until he saw first hand. The scenario played out like this. Just got done with a customer, me and him were talking for a second. Manager came over and told me to stay near the register because there where more customers on the way. He went to do work and I stayed in the little kiosk thing that they have for registers. Started cleaning the area and heard an ungodly screeching coming my way. My manager was yelling at me for being where another manager told me to be..... Nobody in management is on the same page and it's discouraging. Do yourself a favor and save yourself the stress. The $200 you get every two weeks is not worth it."
bad,"Horrible experience- outdated processes"
bad,JC Penney was a part time job for me.  It is unfortunate that they closed the store.  they led us to believe our store was doing fine then dropped the ball on us that they were closing the store.
bad,Each year of working there became worse. The employees were completely stressed and saw little of their families. I would not recommend this company to a friend.
bad,"This company is going downhill FAST! At my store in AL, our new GM is running things differently than I have ever seen in a retail environment. I was offered a promotion with a raise, but when I asked when I would be starting my GM said he was unsure if the position would continue to exist at our store. However, he admitted to saying, in a meeting I did not attend, that they needed to find someone to fill that position. They don’t promote within. They hire brand new people to fill advanced positions. They take advantage of their employees. I was responsible for FOUR jobs (merchandising assistant, cashier assistant, managing jewelry, and pricing/signing) for the same wage I was being paid as a merchandiser with no other responsibilities. When I told my GM I felt taken advantage of, he said, “Taken advantage of is the perfect way to put it!” He didn’t offer a raise or any solutions. JCPenney doesn’t mind abusing their employees and getting as much work out of someone for as little money as possible. Do yourself a favor and find a different place to work!!! Plenty of other retailers out there that pay better, value employees, and promote from within!!! Especially if you’re looking at the Tuscaloosa store for employment."
bad,"Pros - Associate Discount"
bad,"So many cons and little to no pros. The recent change of management directly affected the employee culture. It wasn't great before, but it definitely got worse. Normal employee behavior include gossiping, laziness, lying, backstabbing, theft, and obvious racism. Employees and customers of color are treated like garbage."
bad,I applied for part time so i could find a full time job that would pay me what i wanted. I took the job under the assumption that it would be 20 hours or less but turn to be close to 40 hours a week. They were under staffed.
bad,"I have three years under my belt at this place I let me tell you don't waste your time nor energy! The management is sad, when an associate need a manager to do their job, they don't and pass the buck on to you/others. But let something go wrong then it's the associate fault and they want to micromanage you and talk to you and treat you like a child."
bad,The perks are 25% discounted items.  The con is that the Company is hurting really bad thanks to on-line companies so they can't afford to keep their jobs
bad,"cleaning restrooms and pick up trash on a day to day basic, it was all okay but it wasn't working for me. there wasn't nothing hard about it. it wasn't what i wanted to do"
bad,Previous management made it a great place to work! During that time store performance was highly regarded by corporate. Since management change employee moral has  taken such a beating as to prompt a mass exit  of long time employees and especially assistant management staff. Many felt betrayed and let down.
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, poor management, only considered a good worker if you sell a lot of credit, not flexible, toxic work environment, and no appreciation for hard workers. Training was also very poor, managers don't actually train you, either other sales associates do or you basically have to learn on your own. Your hours can change at any given time, they aren't consistent at all. Managers don't even give a heads up if the change something on your schedule last minute, I have gotten 2 fail to reports for that. Just overall, no a good working environment."
bad,"Absolutely loved this job and the work environment when I began over a year ago. One CEO turnover ,3 GM changes and 1 HR management change later and now this is the absolute worst retail environment I've encountered in almost 25 years in retail. Associates with over one year and some with 15 years experience in this location are leaving in a mass exodus due to strictly seasonal employees earning a starting pay rate of up to $5.00 more per hour and management indifference.  Leadership also shows little to no accountability."
bad,"As a designer you worked 12 hours per day, 3 appointments per day, commissioned with turned out to be about $ 10 per hour; for an educated designer this was an insult; training not good enough, customer service not good enough."
bad,I have worked for this company for almost two years and they were giving pay raises to people who just came into the company and not giving a lot of hours. the people who worked hard was the ones that wasn't treated fairly. I'm soo glad I have left that job.
bad,"Very unorganized, no set scheduling, didn't register train which hurt them in the end, they would call me and say ""u we're supposed to work today but I know nobody told u so it's okay"" and then give me my schedule"
bad,"Not a safe nice environment."
bad,"the custom decorating division is run very haphazardly and inconsistently .  They change the offers mid stream, do not reveal the actual pay levels. those who go out of their way to do good customer service are penalized and their salaries cut.  the support system is run by poorly trained and incompetent staff who only assist those decorators they like.  If you question operations you are docked in your commissions without recourse."
bad,"Dying company with rats all running from a sinking ship.  Then you have the fantasy people who think the company is going to come back in all it's glory.  "
bad,"This job was my very first job , it was quite challenging at first but once you get the hang of things your whole day of work would be smooth from work and to dealing with coworkers"
bad,"This JCPenney operates on a skeleton of a staff, the store has always been severely understaffed leaving a heavy work load for employees. There is little to no variation in scheduling, except when closing some employees are allowed to leave earlier than others."
bad,"I worked there 3 years. All management is hired outside without exception. I never saw an associate promoted. You will be responsible for duties that never crossed your mind and would never be part of a sales job anywhere else. It actually does provide a lot of good experience but you will not be appreciated for the extra work and a shift could last as much as 2 extra hours, no breaks. It is truly thankless."
bad,I say I loved my job thats because I love to help people. I love to be able to put smile on peoples face and know that I love the type of work Im doing.
bad,"Lots of equipment broke frequently including the A/C during hot summer days. HR specialist left and no one replaced the individual during my time there. No regular hours, so a second job was impossible. Lots of 'you work this day or else' kind of attitude. Lots to do, not enough time allowed. Injuries were fairly common here. The pay was alright. The job would've been great if corporate and management were better. The interview process had some interesting games."
bad,I worked in operations they expect you to work at a fast pace at all times there was little to no breaks given management doesn’t care about your days off they will call you to come in anyway. When corporate or district showed up they would make believe everything was running smoothly but when they are not there it is a total mess. The turnover was ridiculous.
bad,I didn’t make very much money and during that time the management was very unfair. I started with the company right out of beauty school. The team was not very helpful as a whole in helping new stylists learn.
bad,Fast paced and customers will yell at you for anything and everything.very stressful . Low pay for the job that you're doing. Very pushy get credit applications.
bad,"The job in itself is very demanding and their is no sense of accountability between the experienced associates and the new employees. Also, their training program is based on expediency rather than understanding the actual rules and policies."
bad,"There arent too many good things I can say about this place. A lot of micromanaging as if you dont know how to do your job. Late hours, you cant leave until the store is clean so you may be stuck there til 3 AM."
bad,"It was my first real job, but it would never be my last."
bad,The job was not great. the pay was very low and they did not offer raises. Management was not great. Very pushy to get sales. However time off requests were usually approved
bad,"You never know when there is going to be a change, realizing that it is a fast pace job/career, training is never giving properly or equally to all to distribute to their staff/team. This cause for a great overturn in employees."
bad,A typical day is usually slow-paced. I learned how to cashier. Management was terrible and unprofessional. Some co-workers were kind unlike management.
bad,I dont have anything to say. Everything continues to go downhill with a lack of hours. The people that get promoted hardly know anything about their jobs.
bad,"They find ways to give lack luster reviews, and does not report all of your work to save money on raises.  Very stressful and quick to put the blame even after you go and tell them issues.  No matter how much you work they list you as part time so they don't have to offer healthcare."
bad,"Jcpenney used to be a pretty good place to work, with various walk-ins and great education. In the last 2 years we hardly receive education and the walk-ins are scarce and you need to be cut throat to get them. Receptionists only give walkins to their friends. Jcpenney is no longer a company to grow with in fact it's not a place you want to stay with. Other Stylists gang up on each other and the culture is all around horrible. When approaching management they don't want to be bothered and tell you to discuss the problem with the stylist who is giving you a hard time. That is just completely unprofessional. I'm a little concerned why management wouldn't want a happier work place.That would make for more productive stylists and all around better environment. Also they want you to do the Sephora teams hair for $15 dollars. That includes all colors and haircuts."
bad,"Customer service cliche. Smile and be nice, push credit cards onto EVERY CUSTOMER. the only way you get recognition is if you get at least 2 credit apps a week AND get customers to fill out the survey on the bottom of the receipt. The only manager that will kind of care about you is the one that heads your direct department."
bad,"The hours are typical hours but with minimal staffing day to day, the job is made much more stressful then it should be. Only recommended for high school/ college students as a first/ temp job."
bad,They dont care about their employees. They have terrible benefits. Their management lacks professionalism. They don't acknowledge hardworking people. Poor work place!
bad,"Honestly, the hours and pay are really good. The managers are really fake and talk about everyone and each other. The management is really screwed up, they need to hire a new team a.s.a.p! JCPenneys in Corpus Christi, TX is one of the most unorganized and messiest places I have seen and worked at. The people who actually stick around working there for years is because they really need the money, other than that everyone ALWAYS quit."
bad,I hated working this job which is the reason I only worked here for 6 months. The pay was horrible and unreliable constantly. The main plus side we got was a discount on what we bought there.
bad,"The last 3 months that I've worked there, I've worked less than 10 hours a week. The management poorly judges every worker and thinks that everyone who works there should always be polite to them, even if you never get a chance to see customers. I work the hours before the store opens and leave at the same time it opens, but according to the management I am never polite to customers."
bad,"They are very late of getting back to you about your schedule , customer service is horrible and the supervisors and managers do not help you with anything."
bad,Management at the time didn't work with my needs. Felt overworked at times. Work days were unnecessarily long and ill planned. Overall not the best of experiences.
bad,Everyday I would report to the dock and start replenishing the Men/Young Men's department. Report back to the dock around 5am to start unpack the product. I've learned how to be more of a team leader and dependable. I got along with all associates in the store even outside of my area. The hardest part of it all was dealing with the management and the supervising team. All the managers would gossip and create drama all around themselves and rub it off to their employees. I hated working there since no one wanted to stand up for our team; I was the only one who was the voice of my team. I didn't care for the attitude and ugly comments when I was doing my job just as they asked me to do.
bad,"Management is terrible, company has no budget for employees nor do they care about the people that work there! They terminate good employees for no reason and keep low paying associates! Store environment always looks like a garage sale"
bad,Too many Chiefs to please not enough Indians; a lot of favoritism and nepotism. My training came from previous jobs and my education. The experience while working  there has helped me to venture other jobs.  My customers were my great reward.
bad,"They brought in a assistant plant manager to get rid of employees in Stead, great job ""cutting cost""  no hours, take away weekends, Didn't work 40 hrs all year."
bad,I'm not to crazy about the management there they choose favorites which I don't like. I also don't really care for how late they keep you at night it's not right to be there till 11.
bad,Management what management. Very high school. You know their clicks. If you don't make their credit quotas they don't get their bonuses and then their not happy. Employees don't get squat only people that benefit are the Managers.
bad,"Customer Service and online returns"
bad,I worked for Jcp for 5 years never moved up and never appreciated no benefits only made it to 9.00 worked hard and had to work holidays no more family days for me. You were over whelmed in fitting rooms and there was never enough help the only thing I did enjoy bout jcp was the coworkers
bad,Busy not enough employee who want to wk . always over whelm when you get left to do other team members jobs all the time. management have us do there job. I Left
bad,"I've been working for this company for 10 years now and used to be fun and everything until new management (4th and current store manager) came in and everything slowly changed and the majority of the people who been there with me from day one started to leave for jobs that'll pay more and give out more hours. I only wish that the current store manager would let the employees know what's really going on as far as if the store will remain open much longer due to the lack of customers coming into the store. At times, it can be fun along with the typical customers who want everything and more. The hardest part of the job is the fact that most of the time, customers scream and holler at you over things you have no control over such as their online orders either being late or having some of the items in the order missing thus blaming us for it. Most days it's slow while other days it can be very off the wall with hardly any employees on the floor. Me personally wouldn't suggest anybody to work here due to lack of hours given to you and sometimes the reduction of them on your schedule without any reason"
bad,i worked there for over 17 years.  During my time there the company has gotten harder to work for and very hard to make production.  Some supervisors were ok but most generally very nit picky.  Very hard to advance
bad,"While working here I folded clothes, put up merchandise and was occasionally on the register. However, I am a college student who needs a flexible work schedule because education is first. In light of this situation, staff and the corporation thinks that  my education does not matter because they were inconsiderate of how they scheduled people within the workplace.However, I did like the employee discounts and some of the staff were pretty nice."
bad,"The management at the particular JCPenney were not for they're employees. They hounded us about peddling credit applications, policies were frequently changing, etc. fast paced retail environment where the customer is always right"
bad,"5 am to unload truck.  All item are opened, and sorted. "
bad,"poor management in the salon, talks poorly about employees, harassment from manager in salon because she either didn't like me or because of race/ethnicity."
bad,"I was in charge of the bedding department . I made sure the sales floor was filled up as well as executing customer service . In jcp the customer service was a big thing there so I made sure to that. I would then organize the stock room and get ready for the next work day ..I Learned customer service is the key to everything and I learned how to be more organized and break down a load .. All my co workers were a great team so that was pretty cool "
bad,Always be near the cash register or near somewhere the customer can see you on the floor. Always keep moving and always straighten up the areas.
bad,"I've worked for the company for about 5 months (in downey)-(this only pertains to the jcpenney in downey) and I must say it was horrible. I worked the holiday season and the back to school season. The managers here don't care about you as an employee, more as just a way to get  ""ICAPs""(credit card applications) increased. Every five seconds all I would here were about how they need to get their icaps and it would become very stressful."
bad,"Cashier, maintained cleanliness of store, ensured quantity of stock on hand. Had to open and or close store based off schedule."
bad,"Managers are the worst!! Sales associates and customers are great, but will never work here again. Save yourself the anguish and work somewhere else!"
bad,"Place to work when your 16 , not good pay , not good management , employees are intolerable. Place needs to be rectified or shut down."
bad,JCPenny is just another regular job. Most enjoyable part is the customers. Management is not all that and they only care about coverage and making sure enough people are there for closing. If you have an emergency they rarely care.
bad,"Jcpenney is not a great company to work for, unless it is your first job. "
bad,"had no training for my job. the management didn't help with reports or showed me how they wanted them done. this is the only place I have ever known where they wanted loss prevention as a seasonal job,"
bad,Management was placing more work on their employees and expect it to be finished in certain time which was some times impossible because external factors slow down progress. Their was lot of call offs.
bad,"I would assist customers and fellow employees with tasks."
bad,"Normal day of work would be driving all the way to Nampa for about two hours of work wasted more in gas to work there, they had way to many employees and wouldn't stop hiring people started there for part time but got way below 10 not what they told me it would be. I would refold clothes help check in merchandise in catalog and call customers tell them ready for pick up etc. Also handled money and ran the register. The hardest part was not enough hours and trying to make a living with that. It was a very drama filled place with high maintenance people and I dont believe anyone is better than anyone I didn't fit in there very well. The customers were my favorite part of my job seeing the kids etc helping people making their day better."
bad,"no life"
bad,"If I could give this JCPenney store 0 stars, I would! I went to work there a few years ago with a part time schedule and they said that it would be fine. At first the job seemed fine. I rang up people at the cash register and folded clothes. It seemed like a nice part time job at that point. I learned how to fold clothes better. The co-workers seemed like friendly people. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with people. Then they tried to give me way more hours to work than we agreed to. I was also being called to come in on days I was scheduled to have off. I was nice enough to come in at first on these days. I realized that I did not have the time to do a full time schedule at this point and that is when I put in a request to make some changes in order to have a part time schedule. When I put in a schedule request, the supervisor came up to me in front of customers and rudely said ""I can't allow that!"" I understand the need to change the schedule but that is NO reason to be publicly rude to me. There was also a weekend we agreed for me to have off and I was called at least twice to come in and work even though I was not scheduled to work that weekend. They also scheduled me to come in and work the Monday following that weekend we agreed for me not to. However, I was nice enough to shorten my trip to work that Monday. For a month I worked a reasonable part time schedule that seemed fine for everyone. After a month, the supervisor and sales manager met with me. The supervisor said I was not learning the job fast enough and that my schedule was flaky. She also"
bad,JC Penney is difficult. The managers re all for themselves and they only insider advancing their favorite associates. Perfect environment for a 'pushover.'
bad,"You won't get anywhere unless you are the favorite. The workplace has became extremely childish and nobody took the job serious. Management offers ""management"" titles to their associates without the pay or the official title and always finds ways to make their job easier."
bad,"Working at JC Penneys was a horrible experience for my first job. Management always tried to discourage employers not to call out by leaving them on hold for what could turn into an hour hoping you will hang up and just come into your shift. "
bad,"I've learned that you can have the worst job in the world but when you' re working with people with integrity and they have the fear of God in them, it makes your job more enjoyable. I don't like the fact that you don't get your schedule for the next week until the end of the week before and it can change after it's posted."
bad,its not for someone with real responsibilities more for someone starting out with no kids
bad,"I was picked on, on a daily basis by management for five years. I tried to get into different areas of the store and was denied, because the store manager didn't like me for whatever reason."
bad,The management is horrible and they don't have enough people working so they expect you to come in on your day off when you hardly get days off anyway
bad,"Due to the performance of the 2012 year, the company has not yet recovered.  As such, it's a tough place to be and progress is difficult in many areas."
bad,"Visual Merchandiser/ Men Department "
bad,"good place to work ,Though I wasn't there very long and really don't remember much about the place, other than it was a paycheck."
bad,"Extremely biased place to work, no chance for advancement unless you were a ""favorite"", and not based on personal work performance. Management was terrible. Co-workers were what made the job bearable."
bad,"Manager was not honest and did not support emoloyees"
bad,"When I first started at the company, I was very thrilled and excited to be there.  However, with the major changes they've been through within the two years I've been employed, there has been a major lack of respect for the employees that work there."
bad,Management played the favoritism role with people. They defiantly were biased rude and I hated working there 
bad,"I started working for JCPenney in Buffalo New York. At that time the store had a clear vision of what it's mission statement was. Unfortunately this is no longer the case. I went back to work for Penney's after staying home raising my children. By then it was a completely different company."
bad,Work with customers to resolve different problems. Also counting down the money at the end the night
bad,I've heard a lot has changed since me and some of my fellow co workers worked there. I know that when i was there management were bad to discriminate against you and cut your hours for a variety of reasons.
bad,It was a temp job but the job was by far the worst one I have ever done!
bad,"I prep the truck, the next day I put out the merchandise, I do the pricing along with my co-workers, and I work about 7-9 hours a day."
bad,New management places no value on associates. I would not recommend working for this company.
bad,Store was not ran efficiently and management showed excessive favoritism not based on work ethics or performance.
bad,"Working here took a mental toll on me seeing as none of the people I encountered were very pleasant. The management refused to allow me a change in my availability and refused to allow me to make any requests for time off for family events. The work was very mundane and tedious and went unappreciated by both customers and employers, as all the customers cared for was destroying your work and all the employers never considered your work enough. No one seemed too eager to help each other or work together, it was a very survival of the fittest mentality. I apparently was not the fittest, but I can't say I'm entirely too upset about that."
bad,"you were expected to be there even on your days off and your time off. I missed one day in two years and was written up for it because I was expected to be there - I was in the emergency room with strep and a fever. I am happy the store went under and I was laid off just before or I would have never had a family life. I was there two years - started at age 21 fresh out of college. They gave me 7 depts that were all losing money. I turned them all in to profit making depts and their sales were up against the stores losses. Still, the Manager said I wasn't really J.C. Penney Material.??? Probably why the 12 million dollar store went belly up."
bad,It is hard to advance in the company unless you are young. I wouldn't recommend working there.
bad,"I wouldn't work for this company anymore, because they lay you off within your 90 days, so they don't have to hire you full time"
bad,Overall not a good place to work unless desparate. Can't ever recall any employees being happy with their job.
bad,"While working there I encounter have a numerous incidents with the manager who seem to be very races and very sexist towards women of color there was times where I was spoken so disrespectfully where he Noticed that he needed to apologize only after speaking to an assistant manager recognizing his behavior on three separate occasions this incident took place first time ,second time we have a conversation there was always an apology but then the same behaviors I was playing I felt like this job with a longer place for me"
bad,"A day at work consist of watching customers and if needed ask them if they would need assisting. I learned deals are more likely to happen depending on material at the job. The management was trained poorly. The workplace culture was fun being that it was mall connected. The hardest part of the job was organizing shelves of clothing multiple times, the most enjoyable part would have to be having a discount for the job."
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend anyone to work here. The pay is $9 an hour. Don’t expect a raise or to be promoted. I know a girl that was working there almost 2 years and only got a 50 cent raise. The management is terrible. They barely train. Have you watch some videos and then you’re on your own. They’ll have other sales people train you but not management or anything. I’ve had multiple issues working this job from having a supervisor chasing me out to my car for a bag check that was already checked & then to have my phone stolen by another associate & having management not even care until everybody had their things stolen. It’s just too much drama and a terrible place to work at. They don’t even respect the hours that people need to work. I told them that I’m a student and can’t work too many hours but they put me on the schedule to work 8 days straight. Just a terrible place to work. Also, if your not a supervisor please expect to be disrespected or treated less than from supervisors. If you were thinking about putting in an application, don’t. Not worth the $9 an hour with a 15 minute lunch break."
bad,"I did not like working for JCPenney. I only stayed for 3 weeks and quit. I had a horrible experience because they pay you like peanuts, but I expected you to understand everything. I would NOT go back."
bad,"Very hostile work environment, verbally abusive, expected to work 90 hour weeks, no work life balance does not care about employees nor rewards loyalty."
bad,The store is closed now. There is really not much to tell now since the store closed down. The ones in Little Rock and North LITTLE Rock are still open.
bad,The employee needs to leave there perfume at home. They  should let full  time employee have a holiday off of work. They  don't  let  new  employees go there own speed.
bad,When I worked at jcpennys it was one of the greatest jobs I've ever work when I first started. I made plenty of friends and the managment was very nice to but as I started getting used to it and confirmable I went from working 5 days out the week to almost no days. It was like I wasn't even need anymore and that's was a waste of time so applied for a better job and got the job it's been smooth sailing
bad,"A sub-par job. Okay if you're looking for someplace to be on the weekends with minimal training and interaction from managers. Unusually high expectations for inexperienced workers - can be intimidating but fun if you're a favorite to some managers. Often have to adopt the ""grin & bear it"" mentality to not go utterly insane most days."
bad,They do not value their employees only saving money on their employees backs.  Every two years they restructure an fire  a group where there are long term so they can save money
bad,"Low level staffing. Company has no moral or integrity, and does not care about employees whatsoever. I had low standards for working here...just wanted to pick up extra hours near by my home, but didn't know how low you can go...I wouldn't recommend working this location specifically. I have never been treated as poorly as I have here at ANY job even at 15 at Wendy's. Management needs help."
bad,"“Forgot to pay me” , didn’t give me or new co workers any training .Very rude, and singled me out for being young and wearing makeup. Kept me in the building after I clocked out. I folded cloths for 10 hours and still felt like I was doing everything wrong."
bad,Coworkers were friendly but always had a trick up their sleeves. They closed down the store without any real warning to the employees. Very laid back.
bad,"There is no future here. The pay sucks and the managers just want you to run away with customers' wallets."
bad,JCP didn't care about you as a leader it was all about sales sales which i completely understated. But when you work for someone that is dis honest and only cares about self it makes it hard. I cant to work and get the job done not kiss someone butt to get ahead.
bad,A complete waste of time the salon is slow no walks in I worked for maybe 1 week and then I left. Manager is lazy lies and tells you they will help you build clientele to meet sales goals. The short time I did work there I didn't do anyone's hair all I did was pass out flyers to solicit customers. Don't waste your time.
bad,"I have never been treated so poorly at work. Management is inconsistent and disorganized. They are very focused on what their employees are doing wrong and do not seem to appreciate when things are done right. They do not always enforce rules, like the dress code for example. Communication is awful. For example, I would be trained by one person to do something one, but then someone else would come along tell me to redo it differently. The culture there was stale and idle. Texting, gossiping, and slacking off was common behavior there."
bad,"As a salon Receptionist, the duties are very simple but somewhat tedious! The staff and higher management are very RACIST; unprofessional and rude! Stylist are allowed to be rude and bias to clients without being reprimanded! Complaints can be made to management; however there is nothing done about it! Management show favoritism!"
bad,"Worked in the Parks Mall. Management is nasty there. All the nice managers and lods have left. You will have good hours and days off if you are a brown noser. Managers favors the lazy employees. "
bad,"If your a temp they will not tell you when they’re gonna let you go they just stop giving you days and never talk to you again. I had to ask my manager why I had no days about 5 times until he answered, I had lots of sales but I guess that wasn’t good enough. Also they always talk about having a diverse environment but all the black temps were let go and they kept everyone else."
bad,Hated working there barely any hours and always understaffed so we had to do extra work for very little fricking pay and dont even think about a raise cuz it wont happen.
bad,Management Is Awful. People In There Never Take Responsibility For Their Actions. They Always Blame Everyone But Themselves. The Assistant Manager Has A TERRIBLE Attitude & It’s Too Much Drama With Everyone In There .
bad,You don’t actually get close to anyone. The managers have favorites and if your not one of them you can go days without being talked to other than hello. They lie straight to your face. Tell you everything you want hear in an interview and then don’t do any of it. Double standards if you aren’t a favorite by one of the mangers. There are like 12 managers and they don’t communicat. I was favored by one manager the way I was treated by other managers was horrible and I watched the one who favored me be horrible to other employees.
bad,I learned several things throughout this position. The hardest part of this job seemed to be trying to please multiple managers that have requested things at complete opposite sides of the spectrum and then dealing with the fallout of having to complete their work for them. Gossip and rumors were a daily part of working with this company and that is not something I personally believe anyone should have to endure in a professional workplace setting.
bad,"Interview process leads you to believe that its traditional work environment. It was for hourly staff. I was a salaried Area LP Mgr and it was far from industry standards. Although the salary was good you are expected to perform basic entry level LP Associate duties such as shoplifting cases and preventions. Tools, equipment and training into their specific forms and practices were not explained. "
bad,"I helped unload truck and merchandise to the floor, afterwards push daily sales check all store mannequins according to store theme! The environment was ok. Hardest part was doing my job then turning around having to do someone else's all while keeping a good attitude about certain situations."
bad,"This is a dysfunctional and unorganized place to work.  A horrible operation.  If the truck is cancelled you lose those hours and aren't allowed to make them up at a later date.  One week you work 30 hours and then the next week less than 20.  There's too much merchandise in the store and everything is in piles on tables and racks are overloaded, nothing can be back stocked.  The aisles are always cluttered with fixtures and it makes it hard to move around with carts and rails. Supervisors are never on the same page.  They always want things done there way and as a result you have to rework the same areas twice and too many people not doing anything at all.  Just walking around pretending to be busy. Management states they know there are problems but the problems are not solved.  It's not hard to see why this company is in the situation it's in."
bad,"Harassment "
bad,It was a good experience over all but you there for a while a people get position you think you should have been asked and never was and you go out your way to help them out but dont get credit when credit due is not fair
bad,"Personally I disliked this job. The managers don’t inform employees about coupons, or sales, or any store information. The managers are nosy and ask many questions about your personal life. The pay is not worth the horrible working conditions."
bad,"The job title details for a warehouse associate seemed very great UNTIL you got in to do the job in person. The job was like a down hill slippery slope, just like how management was. Everything was great and dandy until certain low level workers got irrational and there way for WHATEVER they wanted for themselves. On top of management becoming power hungry and power tripping and not really doing what there suppose to ACTUALLY do. They say keep your friends close but your enemies CLOSER. In the case of working here at JCP warehouse you wanna keep your enemies really close. They will always get there plan done and sway management like a kid in the sandbox. I was surprised with how things were happening until i realized that this company is practically going for broke."
bad,Lost a CEO and 2 facility mangers in 2 years. Blind leading the blind. No job security. Worked like slaves. Schedule is always changing and poor management.
bad,Management sucks and are known for making you look stupid in front of customers. When you call for a MOD nobody respond most of the time. Mind you there can be a customer waiting. Until eventually the customer says forget it and leaves. Managers are very unprofessional and dont care about your life beyond the job. But expect you to get icaps each day which are jcp credit cards. Rules only apply to certain associates. Not fair. And sadly when you work 6 hours you sometimes get a break. And when you dont management gets mad with you when its their responsibility to make sure you get one.
bad,They’re all terrible and are bias. HR is corrupt as heck so if you don’t kiss up to them you won’t get many hours at all. The management just gossips about associates
bad,"This place is a train wreck. There is no loyalty to valued employees. The starting pay was recently increased so there are people coming in off the street making as much money as people that have worked there for years. "
bad,"Management was the worst and communication sucked. There was alot of favoritism and if they didnt like you they give you the worst hours. There were no real position they just throw you where ever. They only like you if your selling those little credit cards,  which are a total rip off. Oh please dont complain or you'll be blacklisted and treated like you have the plague. Some coworkers are like high school cliques."
bad,"While the discounts are great, that's the only thing that is great about this job aside from the few coworkers you'll meet that are fun to work with, the job itself is not worth it. I was harassed by one of my managers who still works there, after at least 5 different complaints against them that are formal from employees, there have also been customer complaints against them and they still work there. This job is unreliable. You can go from working too many hours to working maybe once a week. They were expecting people to get paid only $9 to work for 5 hours on one day a week. It is not worth it. They are terrible about raises. They don't appreciate their employees. I worked worked in the portrait studio and the store itself. I've got to tell you, I've dealt with some of the worst people and some awful managers. They do not train you properly. You literally get thrown on the floor and learn on the job from the other people instead of going through actual real training, then you get treated like an idiot if you don't know what you're doing. They would rather cut a reliable employees hours and hire an inexperienced person for less money. I can't tell you how many people I've seen circulate out of that place. It's atrocious. Not to mention, they will skip over even the best employees to put a favorite person in a management position. It's no wonder why the store is trashed all the time, because the people that care are leaving for not being treated well enough. If you're able to become a favorite real quickly, have absolutely no life and are willing to have open availability and"
bad,"JCPenney is a great place to work as a part-time employee, but there is no room for full-time employees or advancement. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and helping them with their needs and wants."
bad,"Business isn't great, stock price volatile, sinking ship leadership strategy. Dirty carpets, ceiling tiles, cubicles. Money recently ""invested"" in lockers."
bad,The store was very devisive and had an unwelcoming atmosphere. The pay was bad compared to other companies.did not practice inclusion. Training was not good.
bad,"When business was slow (all the time) work could get done fast but instead of sending people home early, they give hours of pointless busy work. Management was very strict, the best employees are treated the same as the worst. UNDERSTAND you will be scheduled every week for every hour you put on your availability. Felt like the teenage equivalent of a dull office job. Oh and while you work your 4-8 hour shift 30 mins of pop songs(or pop holiday songs) will be played on a loop.Their targeted customers are middle age and older women so the environment is suited to best please them, I should have realized that me being a teenage male, wouldn't enjoy spending long periods of time at a place like this. If you apply for only sales associate or only cashier they just make you do both."
bad,There is nothing good to say about this company basically they use you until they get caught up with the work you was hired for loading trucks and then they lay you off
bad,"Work site is an okay place. But it gives you unrealistic hours to work. The supervisors never try to help you learn to do your job, they just expect you to know how to do your job. Overall it is a very unfriendly work place."
bad,"-Over the past 2 years of working for JCPenney, the customers have been great getting to learn more about them and communicate with them, many come back and are considered family to me and some of my co-workers. "
bad,"The place was poorly managed to the point most of the people I knew were fired within a month after I left after a corporate investigation. I wouldn't work with them in the future or recommend them to anyone. they underpaid a lot of people and put a lot of stress on its team members with ""poor management problem solving"""
bad,Since I have worked at JcPenneys I have had more issues then anything else. Management is terrible! They are rude and disrespectful to their employees and to employees' family members. They do not know how to schedule employees for work and they don't notify you if they make any changes. If you tell them a set time to work they do not follow it. You may work one week then none the next.
bad,"Bad company they more worried about profit not their employees the managers and supervisors are very rude,flip floppers bipolar smile in your  face talk behind your back ,favoritism, racist DO NOT WORK THERE I REPEAT DO NOT WORK THERE!!!Brice Rd location thumbs down!! They also time you how long your in the restroom as will just stupid to me"
bad,"Unless you have a drive for creativity and a love for photography, this job can be very stressful and not worth the compensation. Unless you have years of experience"
bad,The job would not have been so bad if there were more things to do and the cameras actually worked. I felt there was a lot of profiling. This job did not teach me anything.
bad,"Pros:"
bad,Workplace culture needs work. I have learned that you cannot think that management is going to treat you fairly because in this store there is no fair treatment.
bad,JCPenney is not a place I would recommend some to work. They undervalue their employees. They have zero consideration for family and work life balance. They are not forth coming with laws that are in place to protect employees ie. FMLA laws. Not a good place to work
bad,The management is the worst and they recently changed to commission and reduced pay for Home Specialists.  The commission is only 1%!  I was told this is the industry standard by I know appliance salespeople from Sears that they earn 3%.
bad,"Don’t work here. Literally pick ANYWHERE else to work. They favor employees and you are not paid well enough to deal with what you will be expected to do. They hire in at minimum wage , if you have some retail experience you’ll be lucky to get $9.50 an hour. Most of the people who enjoy working there only do because they have been there for several years , and get paid a little bit more."
bad,"If you're closing, you're stuck picking up the slack that other employees who don't feel like doing their job at their assigned section. You are stuck in the store until every department is tidy for the opening shift the following morning."
bad,Management does not appreciate anything the sales associates do and they are ungreatful. Too much work and not enough pay. Management definitely plays favorites
bad,I left because I was getting too few hours and the work was super slow and boring. The shoe area was never organized and in order for me to actually have something to do every time I worked I would have to pace myself with what I did every shift because no one ever suggested What needed to be done on that shift.
bad,"Lousy management, terrible non competitive pay. Just a body to the company. They dont pay you a living wage. Only upside to working here was that I met some of the best people there in my coworkers. that kind of retail isnt something i would wish on my worst enemy."
bad,"Their turnover is high for a reason, it's the most un-professional employer I've ever had in my life.  The training is terrible and doesn't prepare you for the phone. the supervisors will often either ignore you when you have questions or pass you onto someone else!!!!"
bad,"The management is terrible, they overwork you, don't want to pay you overtime. Benefits aren't worth it. They look for reasons to fire the older employees, just to bring in high school kids to penny and dime them. I wouldn't recommend working here if your trying to pay pills, or stay at a job for a long period of time."
bad,"Management was extremely unhelpful and could be rude and hurtful at times. This is probably a result of the store I worked in being within a mall, so the company may have been going out of business, and everyone was accordingly stressed out. "
bad,Only part time jobs that don't pay a living wage. They expect you to work hard for little pay.  The company has bad management skills.  Corporate needs to let local stores way in on the needs of the community instead of a one size fits all approach.
bad,"When applying i was told i would get a minimum of 20 hours a week, i got 8. I was constantly told to do impossible tasks such as; breaking down and entire palette of boxes (about 21 boxes) within 10 minutes and putting the products on the racks. This was all to be done before customers came in."
bad,Manager played favorites and put some people on the back burner. Gave terrible hours and days that we're slow which made it hard to build clientele. Would not work with me to make a schedule as to where I can build. and didn't  help me with my productivity like promised . Also had no clue as to how to do her job and makes some employees do it for her.
bad,"If looking for growth and you want to move up to learn something you have to beg and you still will not learn more things. There low energy here at this place. Sometimes you will get 40 hrs and sometimes you will 4 or 6 hrs, hours really pick towards end the year.  This company do not grow the economy. Some of these mangers don't care about you as employee. Now for as benefit's they do have all of that but they will change Health ins but it will be high because you can't afford it but you have to get it because it's the law. If you expect a future or retired at this job Lol"
bad,"Management was always changing, and the next one that’s hired is always brand new to the company and has never worked in a supervisory role (how they get the position is beyond me). I never felt supported or appreciated. It was hard to advance within the company and even if you did, the salary wasn’t enough to deal with the nonsense of the position, company or customers you deal with. When I first started I loved working there, but as time went on, the company’s true colors began to emerge."
bad,"After working here for a couple years, I'm extremely disappointed with how things work. Management is very unorganized and do not know what to do half the time. Hours are not consistent, ranging anywhere from 18 hours to as low as 6 hours a WEEK. Pay raises are rare and you need to get on a managers good side in order to secure hours."
bad,"Poor lack of management, don’t care much about they’re employes, managers don’t respond to your calls when you need help they hide in the back office doing nothing most of the time looking through the computer while your on your feet for a while working"
bad,"Job started out great... Until the manager that hired me left.. Everything went sour.  I dont even think I will shop there. I applied for 40+ hours a week.. They just feel they can cut hours whenever, then gets upset if you moonlight.. I cant tell the bill company my hours got cut.. That's crazy.. It was a waste of time... Looking for a decent career is not here!!"
bad,Managers are highly incompetent and unprofessional.  There is a total disregard for customer service.  Leadership would constantly give customers an attitude and were generally nasty to everyone.
bad,Management was horrible. They rarely worked with my school schedule. Old team members gave you all the work and never did their jobs. I only enjoyed working with a few people.
bad,I think the company needs to care more about its employees and stop always worrying about making a dollar.  Management needs to be train about having more compassion and understanding for its associates. The company does not take into consideration that people have a life outside of work. The company needs to do away with opening at 2 PM on Thanksgiving and let their associates  spend time with their families.
bad,"Was hired to work 7:30 to 4pm, after hiring was told to come in at 3am as it was a way the shipping department was able to ""cook the books"" to meet daily piece count levels."
bad,"awful company, very unorganized, no training programs, low pay to hourly employees, no accountability, poor structure, awful processes in place, all around a bad place"
bad,"I opened and closed, my shifts were bad, pay was horrible, they go off experience, which in my case i know I had more then a year of experience in retail and i still got paid 7.50 but some of the other coworkers got paid more with less experience. my coworkers didn't work as a team and the managers were awful. their very pushy about the credit applications and rewards sign ups, they only cared about the credit applications and rewards sign ups and always favor the ones who gets more and look down the ones who doesn't get any. some coworkers are very rude and were hard to work with, the only part that I like was helping the customers and working on the floor, folding and organizing the store. only one of the managers was good. she was very helpful and always worked well with everyone and was very big on team work, she was a better manager then the main managers."
bad,Don't work here  every time I see it I sing to myself burn JCP burn and I don't even care to use correct grammar bc I don't want people working there I feel bad if you work there now get out while you can
bad,"Great first job for high schoolers. If you want to get anywhere in this company you have to plant your lips upon a managers butt for the rest of time. There is no employee loyalty and unless your lucky enough to get a full time position as a supervisor and or manager prepare to have your hours cut like the slash and burn of the Amazonian rainforest. You will work holidays (There is only two days that you don't work Christmas and easter) Thanksgiving will consist of working 12 hour shifts on thanksgiving day. They will work you to death and then give you two days of work per week for a month. The corporate masters will only care about the bottom line and cut everything they can including retirement and pension for those who have devoted their careers to them. There is nothing about this company that is worth while except the paycheck. "
bad,"Used to be a good company to work for but now they usually do not have the hours or advancement opportunities that they used to. They had financial issues a few years ago and it greatly effected pay, benefits,  overtime ect."
bad,I do not recommend anyone to work at Jc penny unless you are elderly and retired and just want something to do when you're bored on the house . With the low pay that you will recieve for all the hard work you do you would be highly upset getting your check at the end of every 2 weeks like I was for the past 8 months .
bad,"lower management was unfriendly and had severe clicks, talking about each other like children. upper management was the same, and bully like. spoken to and treated employees like children."
bad,The pay form the stylist is not fair. They should get the majority of the commission because we do the work. I love my coworkers I have been threw 4 managers in 4 years
bad,I worked here as a seasonal position years ago. I do not remember my time at this company other than the late night hours during the holidays. Nothing further.
bad,theres always something to do at jcpenney.  the employees were great when I worked there.  they were always upbeat and we all got along well. its a great environment.
bad,"During my short-lived time at JCPenny, I was not trained by any manager or supervisor. During my orientation, myself, and another associate that was hired with me were given a one day tour of the entire store, forced to memorize it all that same day, and had to tell the manager where each department was located. During my personal training, I was training on the register. I was given a book by the HR manager of the store and was told to go to a register and practice the transactions in the manual."
bad,"I was very professional, but my co-workers did not have the get and go in them. There was no room for advancement at all, even tho i made stylist of the year there was no incentives to the revenue i brought in."
bad,"Constant uncertainty if you are going to have your job next week or not. No matter how vital your job is or how good you are at doing it. What ever position you have or career path you are on can be changed by management and you will be doing something that is completely  unrelated to your current career path or skill set."
bad,A typical day at work involved not knowing who you would report to being at the time there was no permanent manager for my department.The GM and her assistant liked to micro manage the employees even if you had a mgr to report to and belittle you with their remarks and criticism.It constantly felt like you were walking on egg shells.They did not do a lot of job advancement.One you were in a position they kept you there and would just pile more onto your workload.Most of the employees liked to gossip and there were clicks.It seemed like a very childish atmosphere.The hardest part about working here was trying to please everyone.The most enjoyable part of the job was the friends I made along the way and what I learned along the way from a few decent people.
bad,"They're all about credit apps. Hours and appraisals are based solely on how many instant credit applications you get. They push, push, push credit. You won't get appraisal if you don't get ICAPs."
bad,The team and associate are awesome but higher management is horrible. I didn't like working for Jcpenney. They do not care about associate development at all.
bad,"I love working as a team. Working at JC Penney is pretty chill, as long as you don't panic if you're on your own for hours with no help from anyone. Over the holidays it can get pretty hectic like in every retail store and we get hours like crazy. However, when the holidays are over, good luck with surviving if JCP is your only job. We get lucky if we even get 8 hours a week to work. I'm not sure if it's at every JCP or just at my location but there is a lot of favoritism. Meaning that in order to move up you have to be the supervisor or manager's favorite. That's the only way to move up and to get more hours. Also, there are no benefits or raises so good luck."
bad,"When i worked there the management was terrible and the staff was very young and inexperienced. Things may be different now,"
bad,"Have you ever worked at a second chance place? Well this would be it. Imagine all the degenerate people in a city radius in one place. This is JC Penney. The call center that is. This place is unorganized, the people are unprofessional and the current program they have isn't going to last at the rate they are going. I would never recommend anyone to work here for longevity."
bad,"I was here for roughly 10 months. Hired full time, worked full time.  Was given not a single hour of vacation or personal time!  No health benefits either. My G.M. and H.R. said it was a mistake. I called corporate and they said my store keyed me in as part time!!!  Never enough coverage on the floor, yet there are numerous people on the morning team and far too many ""supervisors.""  I trained, in part 2 people that were my superiors lol. Very clique oriented and gossipy too. Avoid at all costs!!! Loss prevention is a joke here too. Equipment for register VERY outdated and their computer system sucks almost as bad as their I.T. team!  Half of the time, our store had little to no air conditioning which irritated customers daily!!!  Poorly run!!!"
bad,"All they care about is taking your picture and shoving you out the door as fast as possible. They constantly over-schedule so they are always behind. Prices SKYROCKET during Christmas time. An 8x10 went from 8.99 to 14.99 during Christmas. They only care about making money. There are only 5 ways they let you take pictures, which makes everyone's photos look the same."
bad,"It was a good learnig experience as it wass my first job,"
bad,"work is great i love my job, lots of unfairness and very poor store manager, everything there is personal, nothing abouit the bussiness"
bad,"I was a senior beauty education manager for Sephora inside JCPENNY. The job by description was fantastic! However in my new store location a poor initial staff hiring was done. The immaturity of those staff members, their unprofessionalism and trained use of hr hotlines undermined all management. Very sad and unfortunate 2 managers in 2 months, says it all.  Be so very cautious of  Traverse City Mi store!"
bad,"Low morale, poor new hire training and extreme work overload makes for stressed out staff and high turnover. Most of the people I work with haven't been there more than 6 months. I'm leaving after 4 weeks -- I don't know how anyone stays longer. "
bad,"JC Penney's at this time is in the rebuilding stages. There is quite a few benefits to work for the company however poor morale, high turnover and extreme workload overwhelms the benefits the company offers to its employees."
bad,"Going down hill, stay clear, will soon be out of business, used to like to work here but new management has created turmoil."
bad,"I worked for jcpenney for two years, helping run two different departments, without being given a supervisor position or salary.  Numerous supervisors passed through during this time, but I did their jobs for them, as they could never be bothered, and never learned the nuances of each department."
bad,J.C Penney was a great place to work for until new management took over. They promoted people who have only been there under a year as manager and never had any experience in that department
bad,"did not enjoy it there they let me go because I had a bad hip and could not work 12 hours a day on my feet, I was doing my job very well"
bad,"Gave out accurate cash balance in drawer,  kept a cleaner environment for customers. stayed organized at my drawer, Assisted the customers in finding merchandise"
bad,"A typical day at work I was required to display fine jewelry and inform customers of up-coming mounting events. Perform jewelry repairs, offer credit, meet daily quota, and build customer relationships."
bad,"I have been with the company for seven years. When I got hired, we had an outstanding leadership team, the hours were great, and we received recognition and promotions on a regular basis. After a change in CEO's, the business went down hill. Our customers did not understand what the changes were all about, so sales dropped, the leadership staff was cut down, and our benefits were stripped away. Now we have a leadership team that is overwhelmed, a budget that gives very little room to expand, and moral is suffering because of this. I no longer look forward to going to work any more."
bad,"this job is very bad. from the store all the way to the way its managed. we are under paid and asked to do more work then any other jcpenny's store. the managers don't care about there employees. All that matters to them is getting the work done, whatever the cost and no matter who it hurts. Everyday i come in at 7am and i replenish the sales floor then around 10am I have to go the dock and break down plates until 1pm. i do this by myself even though its suppose to be a two person job. the best part of my day is helping the customers whenever they need help."
bad,Setting signs for current sales and assisting with the display of merchandise. Working with customers and other associates to see that customer service was our primary goal and always came first.
bad,J C Pennys in southaven is the worst place i ever worked.One minute you have hours the next you don't.The management team have picks  so they get hours over the other people. They will sell you a dream to get you to accept the job then you see it's all a lie. They will work the mess out of you for 8 hours then offer you a 30 minute lunch break. You have to train yourself on a lot of things.Have of there managers don't know how to do somethings then if you get it wrong you get wrote up about it.They also will say they don't take doctors not so if you have to call in to go to the er or have kids this is not the place for you because it will still count against you.
bad,"Didn't last long, only a few months. Never enough hours. Good job for students."
bad,"Working at the JC Penney in my area was probably the worst employment I've ever experienced. I've worked there for a year and at first it was okay. The people in my dept. were pretty cool and so was the manager. It was the only time throughout my employment there that I felt part of a team. That didn't last at all. Probably my biggest issue there was the previous HR manager. Due to confidentiality and respect, I'll leave names out. She was notorious for having a nasty attitude and talking down to associates. I attempted to speak to her once in regards to a scheduling mishap and I got nothing but rudeness and sarcasm in return. Because of this, I never felt comfortable voicing my concerns or problems. Yes, there were ""department managers"" but they didn't have much authority. There were often problems with the schedule, which she and the assistant HR manager were responsible for, but whenever they were confronted about it, both would deny making the schedule. The environment was almost always harsh and unwelcoming. Associates and managers were miserable which was clear when they all started quitting left and right if they weren't losing their jobs. Even our store manager was terminated. The store was always short staffed which resulted in long lines, angry customers and a loss of business. There was no such thing as privacy or confidentiality within those walls. Both managers and associates gossiped heavily. There was an extreme lack of professionalism in the workplace. The company itself isn't in good shape. There was absolutely no room for growth there. From my short year of"
bad,"This company,  speaking primarily of the Mansfield, OH, location has gone down hill very quickly since the new store manager took over.  If you can play the favoritism game, don't mind being lied to, and/or thrown under the bus for untruths, this is the place for you.  There were great associates to work with, unfortunately, the morale is very dismal due to the non-leadership and games of the store leader."
bad,"Worked here more than 10 years, was ok for most of that. Last year and a half have been horrible. New DM has cut hours to the point that customers get ignored to get any administrative stuff done. Like checking in orders. I predict this company will fail within next 3-5 years because of upper management's inability to cut costs other than cutting the pay of the  front line people who actually generate the income. Very shortsighted (no pun intended). They would rather spend millions of dollars on flyers that are useless because we have no time to hand them out, than pay productive people."
bad,"A typical day at work was fast paced, never was a down period."
bad,The co workers there where very friendly and respectful they were great help when I first started
bad,My job was to make sure the department was clean and also worked with dressing room area.  The job was only for tax-free weekend.
bad,"JCPenney is a horrible company to work for. The ""supervisors"" are extremely disrepsectful and hypocritical. They enforce that if you can get and ""ICAP"" or a ""Great Day"", which is getting someone to sign up for a JCPenney credit card, you will get hours and if you do not, your hours will be cut. At the time of hiring, this is unannounced and the employee is unaware of these circumstances. The ""training"" is barely training. They throw new hires into the department and let the people with some or little experience train them. They do not implement everybody having a task to do. They will put all the work on a person they can depend on, then allow the other lazy workers to stand around and not do their job. I have been employed with JCPenney for almost two years and have not received a raise. They also announced raises are based on how many ICAPs and orders a person gets. I would NEVER recommend this job to anyone."
bad,Everyday you will come into a messy workplace from the closers not doing a good job. Not enough budget to cover so you're always short handed. Too many managers and each one tells you 3 things to do on top of what you already have to do on a daily basis. Your direct co-workers are the only people who will make your day better because they are friendly and help each other out. It's not a hard job by any means but the amount of work expected on a less than fitting budget is outrageous.
bad,The management needs a lot improvement. To much favoritism
bad,"dealing with customers and ringing up merchandice,not a hard thing to do. Keep steady ours was something they didn't do. My co-workers were awesome and management was cool too."
bad,"Managers are very disrespectful. I hate to say it because I was so excited when I started. After 2 weeks I felt as if I was being treated with little or no respect and as if I couldn't manage day to day tasks. I do not recommend this as a place to,work."
bad,"A typical day at work trouble shooting any errors with loading of the trailers or departure of the trailers, help locate merchandise to ship in the uni-sort department, data entry, DMS/YMS  entries done properly. make sure that all my associates are meeting the proper standard, if they were on an production job"
bad,"During the 8 months that I worked here, there was no management. There was divisiveness among the supervisors and the employees under them were treated unfairly."
bad,"Hours are very early in the morning, co-workers are nice. Management does not help. The most enjoyable part is helping the customers."
bad,"JCP has recently returned to commission but at a much lower rate (42%) at the low end & the high end (60%) is very hard to achieve within most stylists scheduled work hrs.Stylists are tiered by title of designer,senior designer & master. The two lower titles make less commission for bringing in the same amount of service money. Commission is figured weekly but pay checks are every two weeks. Instead of combining the two weeks, percentage is figured weekly,so commission pay varies from week to week. No full time insurance under 35 hrs & JCP does not give any stylist that many hours. Stylist must meet minimum productivity standards hourly or be terminated. Must also meet productivity standards of their title (designer,senior or master).Must attend classes or not be able to be promoted.Which is only twice a year.Every month offers give away services & doesn't pay anything for performing the free service or the time spent.Has pricing that is the same nationwide regardless of economic demographics.Front desk has been eliminated. Replaced by a position that has to be a licensed cosmetologist. Doing front desk duties,assisting stylists,selling retail,can only do hair if requested or a walk in & no other stylists are available,must build a clientele & move to floor within 1 yr or be terminated. Retail commission has been eliminated for everyone. With Ron Johnson gone & different CEO changes are likely.Very little stability with JCP in this state of constant change.Moral is very low at most JCP salons.Many are likely to quit soon."
bad,Part time job. Low pay. No benefits. Easy work. Like dealing with customers.
bad,It used to be a wonderful fun place to work.
bad,"sad is, things aren't going very well with the company, according to hrs and i wish management would work with my availability too... management is bad really bad, no matter how hard you can work and do your best as a reward you get no hrs... there is no consideration towards most of employees i love my co workers they make your day go so well... what i sure do love the most is the ambient we as the floor employees make it happen every day at work no matter how many hrs we get we always try to make it a good one for everyone including costumers."
bad,"Terrible, a very bad company to work for. Don't work here unless you wanted to be treated like cattle."
bad,They have migrated from an employee and customer focused
bad,Do not work at Sephora in JCP at Flowood. I was the Education Coordinator and had to resign on my basis bc i was being bullied and retaliated on by senior part time associate and management staff that were friends. Very very unprofessional place to work. NO integrity or accountability. The cleaned out new team before i started and since i left theyve lost everyone again. Big turnover!
bad,"clocked in, morning meeting, checked in catalog orders, helped customers get catalog orders and check out in store purchases. I learned it is better to ask forgiveness than permission. I didn't like that the ""management"" couldn't even run the pos systems and could never answer questions that I had. I loved almost all of my co-workers and remain friends with them to this day. Hardest part of my job was having to find answers to things my managers should have known."
bad,This was a seasonal retail job. I was in the fine jewelry area and mostly sold watches.
bad,Everyone is rude. I dreaded coming in to work. Too many coworkers gossip and lie. I was uncomfortable around certain people. They work you like a slave.
bad,"When I first started, I though this was the place I was going to make a career. When the new company president began to change every aspect of the store and salon, I saw the place fall apart. They took away commissions and instead, pay an hourly wage which is less than most of the sales associates are paid to run a cash register. I find it rediculous that they expect licensed Cosmetologist to work for less than a sales associate with no education in the related field."
bad,couldent pay my bills with the amount i was paid and the hours i was given and they dident communicate with me when it came to the schedule and when they layed me off i had to go in and ask about my hours b4 they said o im sorry we meant to tell u last weekend we layed u off
bad,"I worked at JC Penney for about two months. I applied for a cashier position in women's or to work in the catalog department. I got put in shoes (which is a commission position) and was told that was the only open position. Right after I got hired, I told a friend to apply and they let her choose between the two positions they had told me there was no openings for."
bad,"A typical day at work was always exciting and fun, always challenging some days were tougher than others. but overall working there was a great leaning experience for me."
bad,"sales associate was in charge of coats, part of the womens sports and junior department."
bad,I worked for jcpennys....hours are not good. Pay is poor. They do not treat u like family. You are just a number to them. Management is very poor....
bad,Penney's at one time was family oriented. Now the company comes first. Family second if there is time. I think it's all about the stockholders.
bad,"JCPenney used to be a great place to work, but with the unprofessional staff and their policy of forced retirement and edging out long term employees. I say this is a don't waste your time place."
bad,This job is mainly for people entering the workforce or those who are retired. Minimum wage. Management plays favorites. They push credit applications. You can be a stellar employee but if you dont get credit applications they hound and harass you and write you up. You will never get full time unless you are management. They dont want to pay for benefits for full time employees. Only thing I enjoyed about working here was the 25% discount and days we had donuts and pizza.
bad,"Hours and pay are awful, they do not give raises like they should and your hours are not guaranteed. New employees make more money than some of the old employees. They cut your hours for not succeeding in getting credit applications."
bad,It was a never ending battle working at jcp logistics they never had enough staff or good enough equipment to run efficiently.  It made everyone's lifes harder.
bad,The store manager lacks appreciation for the leadership team and blames others for her incompetences. The environment is full of favoritism and inconsistent expectations. The store manager is very manipulative and will lie to make herself look good.
bad,Too much favoritism from the manager down a toxic environment it's a hostile environment to work at a lot of foul language from the supervisors not a good place to work at
bad,"Stylist run the Salon.Master stylist Notoriously Over charges and Hogs Walk in customers. 80 yr old clerk Gossips and doesnt allow Spanish conversing ,states it is rude.stylist stand at  door and steal customer from eachother.Lwr level/New stylist are required to promote throughout the store and Masters take Customer generated by lower level  stylist.Required to promote non related store items."
bad,The interview I had with my manager was full of fake smiles and lies. She had promised me a culture of change and that I would be able to be the associates advocate. I was excited about the opportunity and promises of supportive management. After week two my manager changed and would not help me learn what I needed to in order to successfully do my job. But still lashed out at me because I was not sure how to do tasks asked of me-even though I was given zero training.  If you needed time off she would punish you by messing with your schedule or ignoring you completely for days. She was harsh and cold and all of the talk she gave about “serving and caring for the employees” was a lie. Associates are afraid to talk to her and her supervisors all have one foot out the door because they are disrespected everyday by her. She is one of the most heartless managers I have ever worked for and she should not work with people. Honestly they need to offer some taking of sensitivity training or demote her. When I gave my two weeks notice the last week of work was the worst I have been treated ever in a business. She made it unbearable and I would never recommend anyone works at JCP and especially never work at store 1455.
bad,"JCP is a nice place to work in regards to people (fellow employees), and work life balance. However, management is less to be desired, as the company has chosen to save money by cutting off their heads to spite their face. Most employees are PT except for management and supervisors. With that being said, that makes it extremely challenging/impossible to get any actual work done, to include scheduling is done by use of a workload planner, which when it comes to operations, this planner is a horrible tool to use as there is never enough time in a day to accomplish tasks like pricing, clearance, and complete dock procedures like truck. The operations team is mostly scheduled 5-6 hours a day, as well as the task team. When a person visits any of the competing stores, there are employees from the task team scheduled all day, but not at JCP. Management never listens when a supervisor presents an issue, and when they do they retaliate on the supervisor by telling them that they are making excuses. To turn the company around, I suggest for senior leadership and store leadership to listen to the employees. As employees are always on the front line and see where challenges are, and have good ideas to fix those problems. Secondly, make all positions full-time except for the voluntary part-time positions, therefore there will be complete coverage of the stores and ensured growth in productivity, which in-turn means increased revenue to the company. Third, stop ""overstocking"" the stores by making them dumping grounds for stores that have closed. Fourth, update the technologies and systems,"
bad,Unless you are a Barbie type it pretty boy you will mean nothing to this company. If you're shy you will be irrelevant. The only people who advance are the pretty ones.
bad,Expectations are beyond reasonable. That are in DEEP trouble. DO NOT work for this company. Favoritisms is rampant and store leadership has no problem lying to your face.
bad,It's pretty mindless work.  The business isn't doing well and they constantly try to get you to sell credit cards which is no fun.  The pay is low and turnover is high.
bad,literally hated working here. schedule you 3-4 hour shifts a day or two a week and very inflexible with hours. expect you to come in when your puling your guts out.
bad,"I have worked in the Dulles location for about 3 years now.  There has been little advancement for my position, and what advancement that had been made was pushed back due to the cutting of the Appliance Sales.  I make a semi decent 10.47 an hour, for part time, but it's not enough.  There's also no full time advancement from part time, even after working for the company for such a long time.  That and JCP doesn't offer full time of 40 hours a week, either.  Full time to them is 32 hours per week.  Part time is in the ballpark of 15 to 20.  The Employee discount is hardly worth the price you pay for the product you receive, and we don't sell the best products to begin with, not to mention sizes are so difficult to find that you'd have better luck finding a needle in a haystack."
bad,Constantly scheduling me to work on days I had school even after letting management know that I can't be scheduled at certain times. The only thing that made working here worth it were my coworkers.
bad,"They’re all about getting ICAPS ( instant credit application), they lack human empathy, and most of the managers are lazy and expect you to solve your own problems while they sit in the back and do nothing. If you don’t get ICAPS then they don’t like you. They’ll even cut your hours if you’re not getting ICAPS. This is not a job for you if you have real bills. This job is for chump change, nothing more nothing less."
bad,"Unable to make a review for this company"
bad,Training material was never available as liable it was down for what I needed and know looked into fixing it no training made it hard to sale appliances and mattresses.  People dont want to be told we dont have it have to order it. They could have ordered it themselves at home.
bad,"Monday’s were spent reviewing the prior weeks results, trying to get through 50+ emails forwarded on Sunday by the buyer, and attending an all-afternoon meeting with the management team to discuss the action steps that would be taken."
bad,"This company JCP I would never want any of my friends or family to ever work there. The point system is DUMB and unless someone dies then your absent will be excused.  Forget about it if you have to have surgery or have complication before or after your surgery.  You will get points for that.  Heaven forbid that there is an emergency in your family and you have to take them to the ER and you will get points for that too. The manager, asst. manager or even HR will do nothing about it.  Also, they want an associate to come into work for at least 3 hours when you are sick or you will get a 1/2 point against you. They really don't care how sick you are.  I went into work because I was afraid I would get in trouble, and I could only make it 2 1/2 hours.  I then, went to the Dr. and I had extremely high fever, strep throat and the flu and they still didn't care.  Remember, no Dr. notes are allowed.  It's a JOKE and  IT'S NOT A GOOD PLACE TO WORK, unless you don't mind being treated like a PERSON. and If you NEVER get sick!  I have never worked for a place that didn't except Drs. excuses even saying that you can't go back to work at a certain time.  They don't take Drs. notes anyway.......BAD, BAD BAD PLACE TO WORK. They don't appreciate good associates at all unless you are robot and NEVER miss work."
bad,"The company was once great and a great place to work but in recent years it has gone downhill from its ill fated appliances mission to removing furniture, removing coupons, and removing window treatments. I don't know if JC Penney will survive or go the way of Sears."
bad,Terrible SALON management. Can’t sit watsoever to reset your feet. Manager are fake and phony. Don’t get paid what your promised during interview. Please don’t fall for the dream they sale you.
bad,Company is going under quickly and there is an intense pressure to commit 24/7/365.  There is absolutely NO work/life balance.  You will get called frequently off-hours to perform work that is not your responsibility.  I've seen numerous upper-management resign rather than work there.
bad,I worked for jcpenney in Brighton Michigan for a short amount of time; it felt as if I was back in High School. The manager who had hired me was very immature and I had perfect attendance until one day while at work I almost passed out. She told me to go get seen at the hospital and she didn’t want me driving because of what state I was in. The next day she fired me for not being reliable even though she told me to leave work and be checked out. Do NOT work for this company.
bad,Meet a lot of cool people however the managers were very rude and not understanding. They really didn’t want to work around my school schedule. Which I didn’t agree with because school comes first.
bad,The company has been on a steady decline for many years. Management is terrible. Lots of favoritism and butt kissing. Workload is either never ending overtime or short hours.
bad,"All employees were afraid they would be terminated without notice. "
bad,"it was very far from home I liked it. Management sucked never told you about write ups, always treated people who got credit better, overworked hours always left me tired bus ride home"
bad,"You expect there to be no work-life balance as a retail GM but JCP takes it to another level.  You are told to work the weekends but my DM never (not once) worked a Sunday. However, you had to be in countless conference calls through the week even if you were off (since good managers work the weekend!) Profitability was ignored as a metric that mattered unless you missed your profit goal. The company had no clear direction and ignored Net Promoter Score as a true indicator of customer service."
bad,"In our facility there is no leadership.  We lost our CEO and CFO in the spring.  A new CEO was just hired in Oct 2018.  In the Atlanta building the building manager was let go, the 2nd in command resigned, one of the area managers resigned, an OPs manager has resigned,  multiple supervisors have left the company and this is all within the last month and half.  And this is only in the Atlanta facility.  Also the Regional Manager was let go last month.  We are a ship with many holes and sinking fast.  This used to be a great company to work for but I do not recommend it at all.  It's days are numbered."
bad,"I have a degree in the area I work. I make LESS than the 16 year old out returning merchandise to racks and cashing customers out. I make less by several $s per hour. The goals in my area are unrealistic and very low pay. No management system, multiple managers who all have different answers to everything. Even though my area has nothing to do with the main store were obligated to push credit cards on everyone."
bad,The local store management was great. It was the district and up management that was horrible.  No matter how hard you tried it was never good enough.  They did not care about the individual people in the store. The company is struggling to stay afloat and it's easy to see that. Extremely stressful work environment.
bad,"PROS:"
bad,The company is a sinking ship.  Not a lot of advancement opportunities.  Management constantly cutting hours to save payroll.  Employee engagement is nonexistent.
bad,"Never a consistent schedule. this is a great job for teenagers in school who are looking for nights and weekends, however, a adult with a family cannot survive on the income working in this environment."
bad,"It was an ok experience. Management could have been better. They weren't very fair at times, especially when it came to hours. Not a great place to voice your opinions if u have some."
bad,"Working in Jcpenney was a ok job, I had to deal with customers which was the brunt of my duties at Jcpenneys. I was incharge of mainting the front desk."
bad,Much needed upgrading at this job when I was there. The management was horrible and the pay wasn't good at all. Its been a while since working there. Hopefully its better job now
bad,I think jcpenny needs a lot of help in the management./ company needs to train its employees better. The lack communications skills is unbelievable. The employees were fun and friendly.
bad,The whole job was overall awful. Management was awful and only liked you if you kissed their butts. All my coworkers were nice and the main reason i stayed at this job for as long as i did.
bad,"The management at the Poughkeepsie, NY location is absolutely horrible. They show no acknowledgement of hard work and there is no communication between management and associates."
bad,"As a supervisor, I would arrive daily and my plans for the team would constantly be changed. Rarely able to complete tasks due to management changing plans for the day. Management constantly changing schedule without notice."
bad,its a very bad place to work they don't care if you are good or bad i make a lot of money for them they're not even say thank you or good job not even a penny more for your job.
bad,"JCPenney is not a good place to work. Between favoritism of management and the poor leadership in general, JCPenney was a very sour working experience and is gradually getting worse."
bad,"I'm going to start off my review by stating this, I've worked retail for over 10 years now and use to the ""retail life"" and all the pro's and con's that comes with that said life style, but heed my warning when I say this, they only care about that darn credit card application."
bad,If u are looking just for experience and a part time job this is an ok place to work. However u end up doing multiple jobs most that you don't get paid for.
bad,there was never any satisfying the store manager. Nothing was ever kept in confidence and the gossip about everyone's personal life was horrible. Lunches and breaks were often missed but still deducted from our time sheets. . Lots of shady things happened.
bad,"During my few weeks here I learned that the management is below average, I was not properly trained. A couple of days into working I was left alone for 7 hours straight without the proper training."
bad,"This was my first job and I learned about gender bias, not getting a raise. I did work most Sundays and got time and a half. Also worked the floor in the ladies Dept  helping customers find clothes. Worked the boys dept when the boys jeans were very popular and many many were sold. My non blood relative Aunt worked  in a different department and hated it."
bad,I loved the people I worked with but the pay was terrible and it was a very stressful environment. To much responsibility not enough money. Expects one person to the job of 10 people.
bad,My goal when I first started with Jcpenny was a great start. I put my best foot forward in moving up and around to learning different position. I amaze myself. The only thing that was missing was management. They were terrible in helping other continue in working in a good environment if you were the type with no back bone to keep yourself together management screw you over. It would been a great job to stay with a grow but management needs to be reconstruction all again.
bad,"Overworked and underpaid. People are expected to do way too much. It's not that people are lazy and don't want to work because the store I work at has some really hard working associates, but management tends to burn us out. Most of the management is a complete joke anyway. JCPenney used to be a decent place to work  but has rapidly become a terrible environment to be in. The one good thing is the associates you work with (well some)."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of opening and closing procedures, greeting customers, organizing dressing rooms and assigned areas of the store, and cash register work."
bad,"My boss wor ked with my schedule.  However,  he was unconcerned with the abusive environment that was created by the lower management.  People are promoted on the number of credit apps sold.  If you are concerned with giving great customer service, giving the customer a fair value and having a clean orderly work environment,  don't walk,  RUN, far, far away. "
bad,"Overall the job itself is fine, you stay pretty busy with your work in  stocking and replenishing but the Collin Creek location is extremely unorganized, they don't have specific job titles for their employees they're all over the place with the work load. For example, stock team has to help replenish what wasn't done the night before, also has to help the visual team and also helps the pricing team which makes everything that stock team has to do become backed up. They have favoritism, they only promote those they favor and have MEN working in the back doing the simple things and the woman overall do the most work, putting out merchandise, processing, everything else the store needs to have done. So NO I wouldn't recommend working there."
bad,This company ruined my life. I wont go into the details but they blammed a suicide note on me and got me sent to a mental clinic which began to medicate me against my will.
bad,"Jc penny custom decorating is a joke. As said in another review their prices are so outrages that it is almost impossible to sell and they won't. Do a thing to help you like advertising.  They take. O feedback from decorators. As to what might help us sell yet, they want us to do all the work.  Door to door prospecting in any weather condition with our vehicles and milage pay is not good. If you note the job description claims robust of professional job resources and tools to help you. My manager was the most unprofessional manager i have ever met and knew nothing about window treatments. They hired her because she had sales experience. How can a manager be helpful to her employees when she has no idea what their jobs entail?? Needles to say this was just another one of the companies stratigies to save themselves money while expecting us to do all of the work to make them more money. I will be surprised if they surbibe another 5 years"
bad,Worked at the sterling va location lots of chaos not enough employees! Was a supervisor for appliances bad place to buy appliances and work environment was not ideal and was setup to fail
bad,"They pay you minimally yet make you do labor intensive work. Its not just taking pictures. You are timed and graded for every session and have to be done in 15 minutes,  this included moving couches, ottoman for customers to sit on in pictures, props and deal with kids who cry and run away. They want you the lay on you stomach, get on your knees, then squat, then be up on a ladder for each picture to be different for every session. By the time you finish one session your hot and sweaty and only get paid 9 dollars an hour. They also make you sell all your pictures and get on you about sales averages yet they give you no commission. Plus i only worked there like 2 weeks and they started sending me to other studios i had never been to by myself to open and close them alone and told me if i didn't know how to do something i could call the manager of that site who when i called would never answer so i would call my manager, the district manager, and the 50/50 trainer and get no one or no call back after i left a voicemail. Its totally ridiculous, plus the manager of the plainfield location is extremely demeaning and talks to you like you're an idiot all the the time. I worked there 4 months and got a lunch break twice. And 98% i didnt even get to go to the bathroom all day. Don't work here."
bad,"The GM at this location is well known to humiliate his employees, management included. He sends to be in a power trip causing him to make people look bad and in the process making himself look good. I had to deal with this humiliation directly on a daily basis. The time and effort you put in is  never recognized. I felt as though I had to watch my back constantly. Because of this never ending harassment, it made it impossible for management to work as a team and employees began losing respect for store leadership. Overall this store had horrible leadership and a very poor environment. I would not recommend this position to even my worst enemy."
bad,To many long hours and longer days where there is no costumers. Fun place to work if you looking to stand around and fold the same clothes over and over again.
bad,"The Beauty Leader (fried bleach-blonde hair and hideous Lisa Frank-colored eyeshadow) is the worst manager I have ever had. I received NO training for the Operations Consultant job as well as no brand training. I was left on my own a lot before I knew anything, and I have grown very frustrated because I cannot do my job properly. The current Beauty Leader has no people skills and does not know how to teach. She is extremely rude and abrasive in her demeanor. The SEC is pleasant though, but I only worked with her for a short time before she went on maternity leave."
bad,"JC Penney, became a horrible place to work for. Managers are all blood related/family, therefore we have no room for advancement or have a chance of growth in the company. There is too much favoritism going on and they play petty politics. Management ignores comments, ideas, and requests made by employees. We just filled in the blanks on the daily to keep the store running. BIG PROBLEMS WITH TRAINING.There is no full training and if you mess up, they hold you accountable, 100%."
bad,store management is more concerned about their own positions than they are about making the store run well.  They will pull customer service reps to do menial housekeeping tasks in order to improve the appearance of unimportant things just because a corporate visit is coming instead of improving the customer experience and ensuring customers have an experience they want to come back to.
bad,"Pude aprende a trabalhar com todo tipo de relatórios e isso me ajudou bastante, pois a área de qualidade nos proporciona esse trabalho com documentação. "
bad,"Coaching – You know how important it is to a) provide the team with ongoing feedback b) make yourself available to the team you support so they can grow."
bad,"Low pay, poor management, no health benefits, very rigid corporate structure. Management would constantly add to my work load without ever giving me a raise."
bad,"In a typical work day, employees are expected to help customers and maintain a clean sales floor. This being my first retail job, I learn a lot about the retail environment. The management was terrible. There were only 2 or 3 managers that helped on the sales floor. Most of the management were extremely rude. Overall, my co-workers were wonderful and I made quite a few lasting relationships. They were by far the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"you wont get the hours you ask for even if during your interview the days you asked off were a part of the deal. no matter how hard you work, bad criticism is all you receive. if I ever did something wrong, the main manager would find something small to pick you apart on. its a very hostile environment when the general manger is around. they will tell you some things are okay to do but if someone from headquarters notices your work, its suddenly been preached as bad from day 1."
bad,"Talk about a flounder. Big talk in the hiring process, but ultimately fails to follow up on anything they tell you. Raises just don't happen, and haven't happened for a while. They were promised at hire for ""hard workers who stick with the company,"" but it doesn't seem like they intend to keep them. "
bad,Slow work days.I learned how to handle money. Great family like co-workers.
bad,management not understanding at all. co workers were great. making sales was the best part.
bad,they worked us like slaves 7 days a week then fired us all. The mangers made everything hard and they expected to hit a certain number a night and it wasn't possible unless you had been working there for years. The way they do things are very unprofessional! The pay check is no worth working there. Temps and J.C.Penney works are completely separated and treated very different.
bad,"Typically associates report to stations and sign into our phones. We then read our daily updates then start taking calls. What I learned was how to appreciate customers that were good and sincere, and the bonds that are made. Some co-workers are fun, and really educated; however, the rest are inconsiderate, rude, and lazy. The hardest part of the job is knowing everyday I report to work I'm going to let 90% of my customers know that they will not receive there orders because our inventory system is not accurate with our website.The best part of the day is when you know that you handled every customer as if they were yourself. Differences are made just by doing the little things to make the customers happy like, free shipping or 20% off. They really appreciate all the money they save."
bad,"Liars, backbitters,jealous,gossipe,and poor management in errors of department store. Be great job if they pull together an work as team an move people around in store beside sale floor team."
bad,I won't judge every Jcpenny the same but a typical day would be coming in to work greeting everyone listening to the managers and employees talk among eachother about other employees. I learned not to be a part of drama among a work place and to try to make peace while on the job. I did not like coming to work listening to all the gossip but I enjoyed my customers hearing positive from a customer was a good thing.
bad,"A typical day work open store put out money in registers check call in log to ensure a full staff, plan for the next days shipment then you are responsible for a management duty shift this time is used to manage employees and customer focus then the last part of the day is used in your department setting or straitening. The hardest part of the job is lack of communication from higher up management and the very little training our new hires got after being hired. The most enjoyable part is getting to manage and drive customer service and working with the public."
bad,"This place used to be a pleasant place to work but as time changed, they hired managers and staff on that were not for the workers."
bad,"Retail is retail, and I used to enjoy my job at Penney's, but now with all the changes, you never know if you 'll have a job tomorrow or not. I have been watching my co-workers and manager get laid off one by one lately, while other terrible, lazy employees are kept on. We work with nothing but a skeleton crew every day. We have been harrassed every day by district managers to make our goal in getting credit applications; leading by FEAR is not the way to run things. You'd think that after 100-plus years, Penney's would know that a happy employee is a productive one! Oh, and the pay is bad; you can't make a living there. If you ask for a decent salary, they'll just get rid of you and hire a newbie at minimum wage. And yet, CEO Ron Johnson make FIFTY-THREE MILLION dollars a year. I can;t afford the gas to get there. When the company stopped caring about me, I stopped caring too."
bad,"Gm never addressed issues in the salon, salon stylist were treated as second class by the management staff. Computer system is horrible and very slow,customers would complain all the time about how slow it was , went on for years,never resolved. Manager would not hire receptionist,phone would ring off the hook because you couldn't answer while doing a chem.Service. Base pay is $8 an hour if you do not make commision which is less than most fast food restaurants. Horrible unprofessional toxic work environment."
bad,Never work here thre spoken are very petty and vindictive they lie to unemployment and don't help you with hours no one should work here!! They need new managment
bad,You are not paid what your worth. You will be over worked and under paid. Maximum responsibility and no pay increases- no matter how well you do your job or meet expectations.
bad,I was not paid for work I have done 5 weeks ago! The managers made me feel unimportant. Work is tedious and it never feels done because as soon as you fix something customers mess it up and you have to do it all over again. A lot of standing and walking.
bad,"I was hired in May of 2019, the first day of work which was training day I was told not to stand around or gaurd the cash register, but I was supposed to be training, I had no idea what to do or where anything went. The manager s we're all under the age 21, I felt uncomfortable being bossed around by children. The company is ran 3rd party. And there was no store manager. Terrible experience"
bad,Worst manager I’ve worked for in my life. The whole experience was just awful and would not recommend to anyone. He gives new meaning to the term “bully”.
bad,"Honestly its just good for a paycheck, not really fun to work there nor easy to move up. People have worked there forever and haven't moved up an inch but new people work in and get moved up with no problem. Kinda stupid but whatever."
bad,"Great company, not so good management The manager is required to work on the floor, instead of hiding in the office, certain duties that the manager should do is done by employees , instead she stands up front ,arms folded watching you , staring at you , just hoping you will move faster , Always a mix of stylist, some great, some not so much..."
bad,"I learned the company is so results starved, it didn’t matter how you got them"
bad,"Don't waste your time. Management is sloppy, inappropriate and cruel. Disrespectfully beating around the bush, don't expect to be heard. The company isn't bad, however, this location is terrible."
bad,"Truly the worst, most stressful job I've ever had.  Horrible management, worked 14+ hour days every day.  I know it was different for others, but that was my experience."
bad,"Not impress with this company at all to much drama, management didnt care about you or what you do! Always in you personally life! But not caring for your needs"
bad,All of the managers stick together even if one is wrong I got transferred to another area in the store because one person said I didn't have good customer service... I worked in retail for 3 years under 7 different managers before going there and always got complements on my customer service the store managers don't know what's going on in the store only he say she say
bad,"This company is going downhill. Very stressful, lack of competent employees and everyone there is miserable. They don’t care for you unless they want something then it’s all about the employee."
bad,"I worked in the corporate office in Plano, TX as a Designer. I was terminated for no reason (work at will, right?) I later discovered that all the lines I was working on were outsourced to the factory in India. They no longer needed me. Can't blame them but it was an overall negative experience. Almost everyone in management is a horrible person to work for. Backstabbing and throwing people under the bus left and right."
bad,"i work hard and push credit to make goal or more , also do more then whats expected and im still getting paid unfairly . ive been there going on 3 years now and still getting 10.75 . Ive gotton paid more for doing much less as customer service or att. manager ."
bad,"This is a company in free fall."
bad,Job security is the worst at JCPenneys the closing of too many stores and not training within or promoting within is a horrible situations for individual
bad,"Poorly and insufficiently staffed due to financial instability "
bad,"Management is demanding and actively gaslights employees, many of the tasks are not completable in the time given because corporate does not give you what you actually need, but you are still expected to finish on time. Management denies the existence of glaring issues with the process and blames the team instead, which creates a hostile and divisive working environment where everything feels like employees vs. management. Upper management will pretend to be receptive to your concerns while denying everything you brought up in front of other members of management."
bad,The management is HORRIBLE.  Good employees are generally treated horribly and overworked with no raises or accolades.  Management is very VERY hostile and always looking to let go of associates.  I wouldn't recommend this job to ANYONE.
bad,"I gave the work/life balance 5 stars because you are never scheduled to work. They offer like two 4 hour shifts per week and you can't really survive off of that."
bad,There were many issues that happened during the very few years that I worked at this company. Many compliance issues and many things reported that were never taken care of. Very horrible place to work.
bad,The management at this place is awful. Instead of talking to you about what you have done wrong in private or calmly they will get onto you infront of the customer and they will be very rude. Power hungry supervisors.
bad,"I would NOT recommend working here. Not sure if it's just the location that I was at, but supervisors and management are HORRIBLE. On my first day someone stole a black trash bag full on levis and Nikes and they were not stopped because security was sitting in the breakroom the whole time. Also, shoes and electronics get stolen all the time and we were told to just throw away and ignore the empty boxes we found. I was told on multiple occasion to hide merchandise behind clothing and saw many employees doing so, in order to avoid putting stuff back in its place. They promise to work with your school schedule and pride themselves on that but they don't. All in all, it was very awful."
bad,"Jcpenney in white oak village "
bad,"Long days on your feet folding and sorting clothing.  A phone that never stops ringing, yet you are expected to answer it and help customers and make sure that your department is presentable at all times.  You work yourself nearly to death and if anything is wrong with the department, it is you, not your fellow co-workers that get written up because you are the new guy and the manager is friends with everyone else.  Being passed up for promotions in spite of the fact that you have a college degree and stable work history (unlike your coworkers who do get promoted). Seeing know nothing, spineless, passionless kids get promoted instead of you (despite the fact that you work harder than they do).  Ultra bleeding heart liberal culture that looks down on you for your conservative views.  A culture that ""promotes diversity"" so long as it is in no way conservative. Putting up with all of this for a measly $8 an hour and watching people with less experience than you get a promotion and make 30K a year."
bad,"5am to 10am unload freight"
bad,"job is a nice place to work but the pay and management is not so great, the company is okay to work for the customers are very  nice, no benefits for parttime employees"
bad,"There were some really nice managers, but the store manager and a couple other managers were not pleasant to work with. They created an unhealthy work environment, would punish camaraderie, would punish you for getting sick or needing time off by cutting your weekly hours. Even if you were a hardworking employee, if the scheduling manager didn't like you then your hours would be cut to one shift a week. It's an ok first job for someone looking to get retail experience but it could have been more enjoyable with different managers."
bad,I was a full time employee with the company and was cut to part time with no benefits after 10 years with the company.  Every year they make someone who had benefits and full time into part time with none.  Good place for part timers but not a real steady source of income if you need it.
bad,"Management was never happy, customers were never happy. No one was happy. It's a minimum wage job meant for high school kids, not the kind of place most people would want to make their career."
bad,"Stylists would fight with receptionists and other stylists. Management is terrible, refuses to listen, will lower hours for no given reason, picks favorites, blocks numbers so co-workers can't get ahold of. The only benefit of the job is a free haircut every months and $20 hair coloring."
bad,They treat you badly when they eliminate your position and the severance package is ludicrous. No longer a viable long-term job opportunity.  My direct supervisor was great though.
bad,work was not enough pay. hours went up and down a lot of the time. I got a lot of hours some weeks and less the other weeks. I didn't get a raise for a few y ears either
bad,"I worked in the shoe department. The department was very organized, but the management changed frequently and wasn't effective. The pay was not worth the amount of work you did."
bad,"By far the worst job I have ever had. The management at the time was horrible, I'm sure it hasn't changed. The only manager they had there that cared about the store or the employees was the sales manager. She creates personal relationships and understands her employees. All the other ones show up and use their title as an advantage. Don't help, sit in office all day."
bad,It is a environment in which you can move up within the company however the culture isn't the best horrible benefits and lack of professionalism and lower on the pay spectrum.
bad,The jcpenney in rome ga is the absolute worst place to work. It is nasty and the things that go on is crazy.I enjoyed working here until I realized this.
bad,The management is young and Stupid. They can fix the young. If you are not one of click that runs the store they treat you like dirt. They have no clue on customer service yet they shout it all the time. They treat customers as a problem. I found it a horrid place to work with out much benefits. They were very bad at communicating  changes and policys. Most the manager only objective is to get promoted or get money for college
bad,"A fun place to work and a good company for part-time employees. As a merchandise assistant, I have been required to perform duties that are not listed in my job description with no additional pay or benefits."
bad,H & R person has a very nasty attitude and you dont get many hours. if you are part time you get no benefits. some managers talk to you any kind of way.
bad,"While the pay was decent, there was no room for advancement and the managers were not very supportive. The hours that they had me work were all over the place and while the worked around my school schedule I had to practically twist their arm to make it happen. The management and my fellow co-workers were lazy."
bad,"If you like having an entire week off and working less then 20 hours a week, go for it.  They want open availibility for trash hours.  By far the worst company I have worked for."
bad,This place is not a job I would recommend to anyone. I worked here for about a year and was treated bad by management for a long time. I was continuously lied to by the managers. I also was forced to do other employees jobs while they were rewarded with the option of leaving work early.
bad,"Boss was lazy and unprofessional"
bad,Another retail company with an extreme lack of management skills. I couldn't stand being under their management. Their scheduling was terrible and unfair. They just hire you to fill in a gap without telling you.
bad,"no one treats you fairly here. you are discriminated against, no matter what. certain people can do things you can't do. management can practically get away with anything & there is no punishment. high turnover rate, horrible absolute horrible company."
bad,The managers were horrible. Made us all feel stupid. I didnt like having to force sell things to people and having to be all in customers faces all the time.
bad,Scheduling is always last minute and an inconvience for everyone. Managments main focus is getting customers to sign up for credit cards and to act as top flight security for theives
bad,The managers play a lot of favoritism. It is hard to get help from anyone there. It is not a warm or welcoming environment. The managers are all very rude.
bad,"I would usually work mornings in the summer and nights during school. I would have to go to my assigned designation. They had the Levis/arizona, graphic tees, suits,socks and boxers,big and tall,recovery,cashier,and shoes. we would usually stay on that section unless another section really needed help."
bad,Customer service and sales were highly recommended and tracked. There was no appreciation for a job well done. Management style has led to high turn over.
bad,I've been working at JCP for over a year and it is the most horrible job. The managers are horrible and punish you for not making credit goals. Constant complaints from customers due to how poorly organized the store is. Customers are frequently rude about coupon exclusions and are very disrespectful towards associates. Do not recommend!!!!!
bad,comapny was good to work for up until we got a new manager from Washington. Only people that are being promoted are the ones that came with him from Washington even though there are more people qualified for the position...the manager from the SSC treats the employees like garbage and if you bring it up in the monthly meetings they just look the other way...lots of people are quitting. Hours are being cut and now that they moved to a 4 ten hour day shifts is ridiculous when every day you work only four. Glad I left this place
bad,"I worked here for awhile, and the place was a good training ground for me.  It gained my confidence in customer service, and gave me tools to further myself in.  Management at my store was not the greatest, we had a lot of turnover in that area.  I would recommend this for a young person starting out, but that's about it."
bad,"Although I had started at the bottom and worked my way up , I found in the end that with  a new managerial staff we had a large turnover of employees, most of the time we were short staffed and many employees were given more responsibilities than they had time to complete, wich led to a hostile work environment!"
bad,"This is a pretty dull place to work, can be very boring at times, very stressful at other times. Not very flexible work schedule, and (in my experience) very anxiety inducing managers."
bad,hardest about this job is the manager there rude to the workers but you just have to get the job done to they over plie work on the workers but doesn't offer overtime
bad,"Overall, the benefits are great as well as the people. With IHCW, they could advertise more which would bring in more business. A lot of people do not know that we exist."
bad,Jcpenney was the worst retail store I ever worked for.  The management was so bad.  Treated me horribly  like I never worked retail before and I worked retail for SIX years before I started working there.  Communication amongst managers was bad and so unorganized.  I would never go back to work for them let alone shop in any Jcpenney store.
bad,The worst thing about the retail store is that it is very understaffed and they make you work the job that 3 people should be doing and obviously you do not get paid enough to be doing those things.
bad,"Schedule was mostly fixed, duties were scheduled throughout work day. Management was very rude, as were co-workers. Hardest part of the day was trying to find work. Most enjoyable part of the day was leaving, unfortunately."
bad,"I have been with JCPenney for over 20 years, and for many years it was a great place to work.  However, recently all that has changed.  The company now seems to be trying to have as few full time employees as possible, and almost all associates work less than 30 hours a week (which is the cutoff for benefits eligibility).  Also, new associates receive only a day of two of register training before being assigned to the sales floor, and no effort is made to try to have them work with a more experienced associate.  In other words, you may be alone in a department on your first or second day at work."
bad,Jcpenny Logistics Center has to be one of the most unorganized company's i have worked for and a lack of communication between managers and supervisors to keep their workers informed on production of the day.
bad,"I'm not a ""glass half empty"" kind of person, but I have to say that this was the most unpleasant job I've had. I've read some good reviews, but my particular location was terrible. I worked here for a year and was miserable everyday. The pay is horrible for the work that is expected. The managers are only concerned with the amount of credit cards you activate and are always pressuring you to get more. The work is exhausting due to a lack of scheduling. Many employees are scheduled to work in a dept. solo which leads to messy dressing rooms, long customer lines, phones ringing, and messy merchandise on the floor (and you are responsible for handling it all). Customers were rude and nasty. Don't EVER plan on having a weekend off unless you ask for it 3 weeks in advance. And don't plan on spending any holidays with your family if you work during the holiday season. It is an incredibly thankless job. The only things that made this job bearable were the couple of friends I made connections with and my immediate supervisor who was incredibly sweet and understanding. If it weren't for them I wouldn't have made it."
bad,"co-workers weren't friendly, they were rude and gossiped about other more than they worked. they weren't understanding when it came to family emergencies. very unprofessional."
bad,"Its a fairly easy job to do but they are always short handed and managers don't listen to their employees. They take advantage of the most hard workers and they only care about sales and credit cards. They compensate the employees working front line than on the floor and they give 30 min lunches only to those working more than 7 hours, unpaid of course. They allow only a 15 min break no more. They hire mostly high school students all the time with little or no training. They are always short handed and we always get customer complaints for long lines."
bad,"The management was terrible, Employees were fake. The job was terrible to me. I liked it at first. Then they started overworking me, making me train new employees & I wasn't getting paid for it."
bad,I dislike this company and they don't care about their employees.  You work for more than you are worth.  This company does not like to give raises and they don't care about your opinions.
bad,"Only a daily base, we are unloading the truck in a timely manner. After the truck is done we are having a little huddle to go over what need to be done that day. We go off into our specific area and put away the merchandise."
bad,Management is terrible. They have no idea what they're doing.  None of them could be trusted.  The newest store manager made the old one look like a saint. Big on favoritism and treating people who have seniority better than the newer people.  Wanted SOME people to have open availability and no other jobs while others could have a full time job outside of jcp. Always understaffed so expected their employees to work like slaves. You could start out getting 30 plus hours a week and in the end end up with 5 depending on how they felt about you.
bad,Store can not seem to keep employees due to huge demand on work load and not enough associates.  Leaders are hard on associates.
bad,"I went to work early one morning in May 2012 as a soft-home supervisor.  I was told by my sales manager that I had a meeting with the store manager after lunch.  The meeting I presumed was to go over new merchandise or employee incentives.  However, the meeting included the elimination of my position with the JcPenny corporation.  I was also told by the store manager that if I leave quietly I will not be escorted out by security.  I had worked for JcPenny for 3 1/2 years and had never done anything that would have warranted an escort by security.  I was single and now jobless. I found it hard to find another supervisor or management position with the 20 years of retail experience. I ultimately lost everything and became homeless.  After a year of job searching, I was finally hired at another location in the JcPenny corporation due to my former sales manager now becoming a store manager.  It was a stock person replenishment position.  I worked only 10 to 20 hours a week. Since I was now homeless, I had to move back in with my parents at 40 years old.  The job position was over 40 miles away one way.  Thus, it was costing me more to drive to work for part-time employment than what I was making.  I ended up quitting having to quit because it was costing my parents to give me gas money for the week.  Therefore, my employment with the JcPenny company cost me everything.  It cost me when I took a lower position than a manager position.  It cost me when I got laid off with no warning.  It cost me my home, and my way to support myself as a single divorced woman.  In addition, it cost"
bad,I would not recommend to work at this place. The manager treat the sales associates and support team poorly. They cut hours real bad.
bad,"I enjoyed working there when the old boss was there before she retired, once the supply chain got involved when the company moved and hired a new boss and was under new people in management, the professionalism was horrible, probably the worst I ever worked with. Overall it did pay my bills for 3 years and the hours for me were steady. A typical day at work was getting daily tasks done such as helping Receiving supervisor with unloading of the trucks, checking them in, assisting in the pick up dock, answering phone calls and overall, pricing the store and making tickets for items. Some of the co-workers were great sales people, but again the professionalism was bad. The hardest part of the job is feeling like I couldn't talk to anyone because I felt like I would be retaliated on and get back lash. Nothing was confidential there, not even with some of the supervisors, some were great. The only enjoyable part of the job was knowing what had to be done and dealing with the customers."
bad,"the compensation was good at times and bad others, management was never there and payroll was often messed up. The weather pretty much determined the day and the pay"
bad,"Recruite, hire and train new associates. Manage front desk along with regular paper work, do hair when needed, assist with checking out retail along with regular JCPenney customers. Inventory on daily basis. Safety and OMSA aproved at all times. "
bad,"Started working their May of 2013. Started out in the Mens dept a team lead complained about me their, then I got move to the womens dept. A great staff their up until you have certain team members that dont do work weather they talking about team members in spanish or english and get away with it. People need to get fired and they dont. Management is very horrible and they need to be on top of their job. Especially when it is closing time I am moved everywhere. Its like when you do good people take advantage and if you slack they wanna cut your hours or fire you. They need to fire the people that dont do work period. Even if you have a relative working their or not. Not everyone should have a get out of jail free card but it always seems to happen like this in retail. If you ask me if I was HR i will have a whole new team of team leads, executives and associates."
bad,the manager was the best ever but the overall job wasnt to peachy. Not very many hours were given and the pay want good either the coworkers were to competitive.
bad,"friendly environment great customers."
bad,"I can't begin to express how bad it was to work for this company. The Store Manager had the professionalism and manners of a pig. She was rude, uncaring and demanded 100% loyalty (which meant telling on other employees). The atmosphere was a mix of fear, loathing and mendacity. The managers were afraid of being fired or getting passed over for a promotion that they were not very friendly to new managers they perceived any newbie as a threat. "
bad,hours not so good but overall good place to work. this company will have you working for a few days then your off for a few weeks. not a steady job
bad,Jcpenney is a job for  students that are just starting out to work
bad,"Typical day was spent identifying fraud against company on both internal and external level. Also identified and targeting international fraud and fraud rings targeting company as well as internal theft. "
bad,This company didn't offer good compensation or enough work hours.
bad,"JCPenney, i have cleaned and vaccum all carpets, mop, sweep and clean the bathrooms, windows and mirrors. I have been there for a year . This was my first job before i even got to my second job. I work at Jcpenney Rockford IL,  at Cherryvale Mall.   we had a small crew . Like about 6 or 7 of us I think .  There was nothing hard about the job  everything was easy . Except  I get kind of tired for doing the same things over and over again. But it was also relaxing .  The most enjoyable part of the job is  it was relaxing again and also that  I spoke with my crew and became great freinds with them.  I have  worked there for a year  and then later on quit and got fire at the same time .  Long story .  "
bad,"I was hired as a Fashion Expert but they slipped the job to someone else a week after they hired me and left me as a Service Specialist. When I questioned whether or not they wanted me as a Fashion Expert I recieved multiple excuses. I lended myself to working with the Visual team ( being that I have tons of experience), they basically made more excuses to keep me as just a cashier."
bad,"I worked at the JC Penny in NLR,AR. Loved it at first until they had me closing every single night. The workers there acted like they were in high school still. Way to much gossiping for me. Some of the management was great,but there were a few that didn't deserve the job they had. I ended up quitting because they wouldn't work around my school schedule.,and I just couldn't handle some of the people that worked there."
bad,"Unless you are desperate, be careful about accepting a job at the new Timber Creek store in Dallas. The management is very unprofessional and totally insensitive to employees. After being part of a team that opened this new store, I was let go after six months without any prior warning. Came in one day and the store manager said he had to cut hours and let me and a few other people go. He had another co-worker in on the meeting, while my department manager (on site at the time) did not even come to the meeting."
bad,the experience was very unprofessional and mind bottling. The employment agency was unorganized and useless
bad,I felt like my co workers would talk behind my back instead of helping. They slowly just quit putting on the schedule instead of trying to help me to become a better employee for the company.  I actually enjoyed my job it was just the people I worked with. The last few days I worked I felt like crying when I left. It was just so uncomfortable.
bad,"Managers consistently ignore employees, lack of communication, made minors work over the legal time, They ignore the 6 month raise or wont tell you about it, Constantly ignore safety issues, customers consistently angry  at confusing sales,  Short breaks or breaks taken away or cut in half. Lots of managers giving multiple different directions leaving employees confused. Would pay new employees more who had less experience, Management ignoring harassment. Constantly making you stay longer than scheduled, throwing employees to different departments if short staffed knowing the employees are not aware of another departments sales or merchandise.  Customers would violate dressing rooms with their urine or feces expecting employees to lean it up, would expect employees to put themselves in unsafe or unsanitary conditions."
bad,They pick favorites and the manager cut my hours from 25-5 hours. Some Managers/ supervisors were rude af. Working this job has showed me I deserve better and to stay in school
bad,"The JcPenny store in San Angelo, Tx is unfortunately lacking. Most importantly with management. Very hostile and condescending management team, little/no advancement opportunity and inconsistent hours. I transferred departments and was shown very poor treatment throughout the store."
bad,"the loss prevention dept is full of ""arrogant"" ""college decreed"" do nothings. they openly discriminate against any one over 45 yrs old. Lazy managers who expect their staff to produce all the statistics and double standards is the norm. The retail side of Penny's was the real professional side. store management cared about their staff . The loss prevention side didn't care less as long as they looked good. Loss prevention is a dangerous job, and when your manager is to scared to walk out the door with you there is a problem. very sad."
bad,"At first it all seemed great. Then the veil dropped and it was a nightmare. Racist managers, constantly changing schedules. It's sinking, faster than an anvil dropped into the ocean."
bad,"The salon is an extremely unprofessional place. There’s the typical women gossip but that seems to be normal. I had one of coworkers swearing about me, in front of customers, saying I wasn’t doing my job. I am very passionate about helping people and I know I worked hard in my position. All of our clients loved me! Swearing is not allowed there according to management. Once I informed management about what happened they told me they would figure it out but it only got worse and I ended up leaving very unhappy."
bad,Management was very poor. Associates were open about their dislikes on homosexuals. Their customer service wasn’t always the best. Overall I just felt that most of the associates weren’t good people. But there were the good few whom I really enjoyed.
bad,The managers were terrible. I was accused of many things i never did. The work wasn't bad. Neither was the work place but the managers were not at all caring.
bad,"Coworkers are very nice and help you without asking, but management needs improvement. Since I have worked at JcPenney, management is terrible! They are rude and disrespectful to their employees They do not know how to schedule employees for work and they don't notify you if they make any changes. If you tell them a set time to work they do not follow it. You may work one week then none the next."
bad,"Low pay not enoigh to live, buy there were constant great employees"
bad,"Some associates make working there ok, that's it! Most of it too drama filled to be professional! Lacking in Professionalism in Management, too much harassment, potty mouth mgmt."
bad,"In the 7 months I worked there, there were 4 HR managers. I had to repeatedly tell them I didn’t want any cashier shifts because the scheduling people kept changing. "
bad,"Management now is not good. everyone does not work together. it's good about working with your if your in the military, or have another job. other than that it's alright."
bad,"I worked here for over 2 years. It progressively became a worse place to work over time. The management is awful, the pay is extremely low compared to other retail stores, and the work load is the same no matter how many people they have staffed. It’s either extremely busy or extremely dead. I had several co workers who were put down by management and went to higher supervisers and nothing was done. I would never recommend this company to work  for ."
bad,"Typical day at work is being dealing with upset customer, being nagged by management, cleaning your department, 15-30 minute break. Learned how to deal with customers and that I will probably never work retail cash register again. Poor management. Coworkers are usually nice, some can be aggravating. Hardest part is the customers. Best part is employee discount."
bad,Fun place to be at. Every one there was doing there jobs wasn't lacking off and playing around i had fun working there before i had to move down to zephyrhills
bad,"They give you flexible hours, and you can choose where you would like to work. (appliances, womens, mens, juniors, kids, furniture, home,). They're able to work with you."
bad,Don’t work here. Pay you minimum and have underage kids working late hours on school nights. You are doing way more here then any other retail stores.
bad,"I only intended to work there for the holidays(Oct-Jan), and I should have kept it as so. After the season, work becomes so slow. Hours get cut and paychecks get smaller. No huge position to move up towards."
bad,"Managers were bad and did not care most of the time. They would move us around and most of the stuff was left unfinished. Managers would get mad at you for no reason and most of the time they would expect ""friends"" while the store was slow."
bad,"A diverse work environment. My time at JCPenney was very exhausting. I was there for three years. Very unorganized staff, they treat their employees horrible. Plus the supervisors are nasty and if they don't care for you they will do anything to get you terminated. "
bad,"Shrinkage Program daily review. Staff Hours, Proactive walk through of Warehouse departments, Daily start up informational meeting with departments. Daily Safety Inspections of Warehouse departments."
bad,"Do as told, punch in and out do as told go home."
bad,A typical day at work includes you being stuck a register by yourself with a line full of people or folding an unreasonable amount of clothing for hours. Management at my JcPenny was terrible. The entire job was hard when it did not have to be and I was only a seasonal worker.
bad,"I worked in JCPENNY, Eden prairie, MN for 8 months and had to leave the job due to shifting from one state to another. It was really great  and learning experience. my job was of sales associate in Men's department. colleagues I worked with were really very helpful. Work environment was really very healthy and positive.  Store manager in the store was always encouraging and helpful . I learnt there about good team work, being helpful, hard work, neatness which at the end gives one a sense of accomplishment with immense satisfaction of achievement."
bad,Wouldn't go back due to personal reasons. Pushed people to hard to get others to sign up for a credit card that some people would get stressed becasue they felt they were not doing good enough even though they were trying their hardest.
bad,"I learned so many things and it's time for me to take my talents somewhere else, and grow. Management in this location (Dayton Mall) is horrible and they need to be fired. We barely have enough sales associates to work daily. The most enjoyable part of the job is making the customers happy and satisfied. The hardest part of the job is working with poor management. The management team does not know how to talk to adults. They treat us like were kids."
bad,Culture is every man for himself. Salon needs to be updated. Management is a revolving door. Long term stylist are in charge and new store manager is a micro manager.
bad,"Used to be a great place to work, but with the shifts in the retail world and all the retail giants losing the battle, it's caused the company to layoff team members putting incredible pressure and workloads on the remaining teams.  There is no work life balance anymore and leadership is spinning trying to grasp onto anything that might work.  Lack of real direction and communication causes teams to spin and rework.  Great place to work if you want no life outside of it.  One thing about the company is they have great teams who work hard and are like family.  The company also pays well, but they need to find better management.  People leave managers, not companies."
bad,"I never got a break when I was scheduled for one, the training was horrible, I had to learn everything by myself. The managers were friendly and so were most associated."
bad,Loved the co-workers and the management in all areas is amazing. They really do everything they can to make you comfortable here and  the perks of the job are pretty nice.
bad,"I loved working for JCPenneys. But, some of the other employees had bad attitudes towards customers, and i don't respect that. They were consistently having talks about what customers were wearing and its something i don't respect or would do. Its very mean!"
bad,"Extra hours without appreciation, no weekend life, micro management, no free/affordable amenities, no work life balance and NOBODY stands with you. Daily there is a risk of losing you job and I am talking about corporate job. Don't expect anyone to back you up."
bad,I love doing hair but this job was so slow paced and there was not a bunch of client traffic coming through.  I needed a change of environment.  This was when i decided to go to nursing school.
bad,working at JCpenneys  was my first job. at first I enjoyed it then they got a new manager and he just doesn't care. he treated his employees like dirt and drove most of his long term employees to quit the head of human recourses there after working there for 35 years retired early because she didn't like the boss. the only reason I quit from this job was because I wasn't getting enough hours to pay  my bills.
bad,I loved working for the company until they said after 11 years you are being separated from your position.  I learned a great deal about Customer Service and had terrific co-workers and supervisors and managers. Christmas and Thanksgiving were always the more stressful times but still enjoyed the work. Overall this was a life changing experience and I really do miss J.C. Penney.
bad,the mngmt is just low class. I was a stylist and I was treated like I was a criminal. place is awful. worse then working at wallmart
bad,NO good management. They separate you so no one can talk. Their very rude and not professional.
bad,"A typical day at the workplace was easy I helped customers pic out clothes and accessories, I learned how to deal with all kinds of people and personalities and how to organize a clothing store, management was ok, my coworkers were great to work with anything that required team work they were quick to help, there was nothing hard about the actual job, creating outfits for the customers"
bad,greedy company dislike employers. typical day was depressing and tiring..
bad,"A typical day at Jcpenney, was okay! working with fellow associate was fun. interacting with different people and learning new things at the company, i learned that you pretty much  have to self train yourself.Not knowing rather or not if your job is being done correctly, until you find out a week later they are doing it another way lake of communcation for this company. It use to be nice when the company would have a cook out  at the work place for all of the associate, and giving out door prizes,etc..."
bad,working with customers was very enjoyable.  Great people to work with.
bad,a typical day at J.C.Penneys is bothering people for cards losing hours if you dont get a certain amount of cards. It should be about work ethic not about opening cards. my coworkers were great and i enjoyed working with them. management needs work its a job not a prison .
bad,I want to work and be professional not a professional place to work in
bad,Fast paced and busy work environment. Friendly customers and friendly staff
bad,"poor communication at all levels, little coperation with anyone, everyone on thier own page, dancing to their own tune"
bad,Penney's is a great place to work. For all the discount price and the sales. overall some of the people there arent so friendly. But in returned the hours aren't so good too. But then it helps out to sometimes because i family times.
bad,"lazy managers, bad communication form manager to the associates."
bad,"Typical day at works is helping put things away, cheacking and opening JcPenny cards! The best part about my job is the peope I work with they are all great people to be around! There really is no hard part about my job is a easy going job. Cant really say there is a enjoyble part things with Pennys uper mangement has gone down hill, and really is no job security now."
bad,"Right now things are not so great anymore at my current workplace. They are not giving me enough hours. I can not survive on three days a week or even two days. When I first started I was working five days a week all the way up to this year as of February 2012. My hours got chopped as well as everyone elses. They said we would get our hours back as soon as business picks up cause it is always slow after the holidays. But now they are saying if customers want the low low prices that they had to cut somewhere. So, they cut everyones hours. I have always loved working there. My hours were good and pay wasn't bad and loved the discount."
bad,"I had a bad experience here. I had told the store manager multiple times (including twice during the interviewing/training process) that I could not work certain days due to my other job, but I was continuously scheduled during those times I said I could not work. When I would tell them I can't work because of my other job the insisted they did not know about it."
bad,"I feel that I am losing job security, we closed 2 call centers since I've been working and experience 3 major lay offs."
bad,"I worked there for a seasonal gig and I was ready to be let go after it all BUT what I wasn't ready for was to be thrown into the floor with NO HELP I was not trained correctly, favoritism was a huge role played working in this facility the women who hired me would constantly try and downplay my successes and make me feel Inferior on purpose I can't be in an environment where the ""leader"" is constantly bringing down the workers just so she can stay at the top I was dead on my feet everyday they will work you to the Bone and then wonder why you are tired ...highly DONT recommend working here I have a very long work stamina but working here was just to much"
bad,"at jcpenney literally all the managers care about is the associates getting card sign ups. also, when they hire new people on for seasonal work they cut other employees hours back to 1-2 shifts PER WEEK. absolutely no reason to ever work for this company."
bad,"At the time I was a college student, and JCPenney really worked with my schedule. I liked that the job was very fast paced. There were no bonuses, no weekends off, and no incentives for employees. I often worked up to 8 hours without having my hour lunch because  was scheduled for a 6 hour shift not for an 8 hour shift. I felt that my rights as a worker were violated. The company would make us stay after hours to clean the store, as this was required for the next business day. As soon as the store would close, the AC was turned off (being that outside it was 100 degrees) and we would work under really hot conditions without taking breaks. No employee should have to face this. Would never work under those inhumane conditions."
bad,Mucha presión y responsabilidad para lo q pagan. Los supervisores y superiores no tienen ningun tipo d empatia con sus empleados. No aprecian tu trabajo. Hay un ambiente laboral super pesado. No volvere a trabajar para esta compañía. Lo único bueno es el descuento de empleado y q son flexibles con el horario.
bad,We need more money. Merit mean NO production. To much going on in here. Too much favoritism racist and bias. The work that we have it's not hard it's very easy to do
bad,Management is very unprofessional! Customer service skills need to improve within all of the associates! Not a career job! People can’t live and feed they’re families off this type of income!
bad,"The JCPenneys in Minot is lacking in a lot of ways, especially in the way they treat their associates, they are very rude and a lot of the managers can be very disrespectful and demeaning"
bad,The management is the biggest negative drawback. Most of them have favoritism. They are not flexible with schedules. The pay is okay. It can get boring during slow days. It is often understaffed because employees leave.
bad,"The first day I was put at the front desk, alone. The actual receptionist was in the back gossiping with the manager. They seemed annoyed, as if it were my fault I didn’t have any training or knowledge of the system. I had to constantly run to the back when clients wanted to be checked out or purchase items. Everyone just sat on their phones and complained. The manager wasn’t even in the salon an hour into the shift."
bad,"They were extremely rude and criticized everything I did they were hypocrites and they did not even follow their own rules"
bad,"Management was poor they were not approachable or friendly, Never really helped out around the store. There was a lot of work to do, with not enough people"
bad,"Compensation and benefits were decent. Managers and other employees were pleasant. However the company overall lacks structure, organization and willingness to spend money to evolve and maximize employees skills."
bad,"Having to stand on your feet all day. Only 15 minute breaks and sometimes you don’t even get that. Dressing rooms gets super packed with clothes. Your left by yourself to put all those clothes away. The environmental was very unprofessional. I was told by a manager whom was HR at the time, if I don’t sale enough credit cards I will be written up."
bad,"Management was very poor, not fair, and would not work with schedule. I worked there for 2 years and leRned a lot, which I really enjoyed. I just didnt recieve that many hours and the management was unorganized"
bad,The worst place I've ever worked. Do not promote within. Do not make sure stylist have proper products to perform services. They won't remodel the salon to bring in new clients.
bad,"No leadership and organization. Good associates, there is an opportunity to do what is right for the company and the associates and refrain from biased decisions."
bad,They hire persons not qualified to train you.Had 4 bosses in 10 months.They keep people in positions just because they have no one.Poor training then seen you out to do a job and their system fails.Most stressful under paid job I ever had.I have 35 yes.experience could have thought them but they would have to listen first.
bad,Jcpenney was a great place to work but once we got a new store manager things have went down hill and a lot of people lost there jobs there because of the bad management. Like the managers wanted to fire people because they wanted to start over.
bad,trying to stay in pace with other companies and just not cutting it. over worked and under paid. hires many younger people with no sense of urgency. takes too long for everything unless you are in trouble.
bad,"All they care about is the stupid credit card applications you get. If you don't get to your goal for the month, you could get less hours on your schedule. I would never work here again."
bad,Management on SSC side is very rude The leads on SSC side is Rude there's  a lack of communication  Day by day you never know what you're going to do the management will walk right past you and never speak to you or knowledge that you're even near them they give you A 15 minute break but expect you to take a 10 min break it's like standing with a whip on you all day long stay away from the SSC side at the Lenexa JCPenney's distribution center
bad,"I worked for several locations throughout central and south Texas during my time with jcp, and I had some great managers.  This rating applies to my last couple of years and specificially my time in the Corpus Christi location.  The District Manager transferred me there as a punishment because he did not like previous GM.  The fact that I had a positive relationship with my previous GM was held against me throughout the rest of my employment.  The DM was best friends with the GM in Corpus.  The GM in Corpus was masoganistic, out of touch, inappropriate, and demeaning.  I was great at my job, and the only manager that was growing their business, in the store but since I was a young, female manager, I was left out of social gatherings that only included the men in the store. not allowing me to create professional relationships and grow with the company  Overall, the DM encouraged this culture, and my time with the company was awful."
bad,"I was here for almost 3yrs. At the beginning it was great. As the years went along, management got worse, people became lazy, didn't matter who you were, you could be hired. This job has a huge turn over rate and they don't keep any of their promises. Temp to hire people would come in as seasonal and then all get put out of work once the season was over. Even though, they were told it was a temp to hire. Management only care about themselves and there is no room to advance in a career. Bonus' are not given out and it's very hard to plan other events around your work schedule. They are very bad at telling when work is mandatory in a good time frame"
bad,It's ok for a part time temporary. Or if you just need a few dollars on the side. No matter how much you like it unless you become a manager which is unlikely you're pay won't be sufficient.
bad,"After a decade with the company, I've seen it go from a place where you can progress, earn days off, and make a decent wage, to somewhere that doesn't value it's employees (even management) enough to pay them for a vacation. I've made friends that will be for a lifetime, but the last few years have not been memorable in a good way!"
bad,Heavy work loads. Not much hours. Very little pay. No appreciation. No organization. No teamwork.  It's ok if you need a starter job for experience. But not worth sticking around.
bad,"Aside from the above issues, you get decent hours and decent opportunities to advance, fun staff, usually a great place for young people to work. Needs better management training and stricter harassment guidelines."
bad,"Was hired as a supervisor, received 10 hours of training before being sent to the sales floor even though my previous leadership was from a different company. Most of my work consisted of playing catch-up while remaining in the dark as to how the company worked. Held to the standards of people that have been with the company for a long time, then treated with disrespect when they discovered I had no idea what they expected of me. When they finally gave me constructive criticism at my 35 day mark, and had a gameplan, they released me at 45 days because I wasn't a good fit. Management had no clue what they were doing, everyone was short staffed and snippy with each other. Overall not a great experience. Employee discount was good though."
bad,"While Jcpenneys could be a ok place to work I would not recommend it. under paid, dirty offices. you can request a day off months in advance and they rarely ok it, They schedule for 10 plus hours a day but you get no extra breaks . CSR processes over 250,000 calls and black Friday while chat only processed 50,000 but get paid 3 or more dollars per hour more."
bad,"There's never any work going on , I'll be at work at 5am and as soon as I get there they send us home claiming there's no trucks on the dock , management couldn't even call and let us know that we shouldn't come in , waste of gas and my time , stay away from this place"
bad,"As a part timer with a open availability expect to work five days a week, six hours a day with one 15 minute break.  Sometimes you'll work seven to nine days in a row, and do not expect your scheduled times to have any consistency what so ever."
bad,"I was harassed by the girls my age, and no matter who I went to nothing happened. I felt unsafe, and hated working there. "
bad,"The girls that work there are awsome, but this job requires you to dress to the T and be a cover girl. You can work very hard and do a good job but if you dont look on point that will straight tell you and let you go."
bad,"Back in the 80's & 90's I worked for JcPenney & they were ok to work for.. I jmade some friends.. The managers were ok. Busy work constanly on-going.. aggravating at times. There is short breaks and lunch and salary not good. typically I worked 15-25 hours . Christmas busy than afterwards in Feb-march not at all busy and hours diminish. I stuck with the company 5 years and got burnt out.. needed a change after that.--pretty much happened with my co-workers as well. "
bad,I enjoyed coming to work everyday because the customers and associates are wonderful. I learned this business has no heart or loyalty or respect.
bad,provide customer service dust and clean area help customers find products to best suit them count and empty register at time of closing proceed to clean and recover the store before clocking out for the night
bad,It takes dedication and hard work to maintain a job at JCPenney. If you do not enjoy working with others and with the public this will most likely not be the best fit for you.
bad,"filling orders, scanning merchandise back to stock, getting orders in a timely manner, learning new people"
bad,scan various item that came down the belt and assign to various pallet and wrap pallet and move aside for forklift driver
bad,"The education is very good. I learned that this was the toughest salon to ever work in, in my history. The salon management belittles and back stabs behind each others back. Plays co- worker against co-worker for competition, causes some friction I mean not with a competition, but everyday work. I think that is their strategy. Salary is posted to all, nothing is personal and statistic information is posted to all, which are personal. Salon management was a little distrustful, she would go into your computer info and change it up. The salon manager let the monthly books on productivity go undone for months. Then call you in for catch up. It will go back 6 to 8 months.They ask questions that relate back too far to remember what was going on that month to answer about productivity. Some receptionists would purposely punch in the wrong color info in the computer files, so you would purposely mess up.You had to watch everything like a hawk.  Customers would be deleted out of the books.They would come on the wrong days, and some didn't come in on the right days. Co workers were good to work with, except for the thieving and harassing ones. Some co- workers would give new people the wrong advice just so they'd mess up or get in trouble. The ones management let do what they were doing. I loved the job that I did there I love to make people feel good about them selves. I also enjoyed making the clients look their best.The environment is very tough and stressful. The benefits and the education will keep you there if you can survive ."
bad,"customer service, suit altering, sales and cash transactions. worked with a team and interacted with the public on all levels. Audits and restocking of clothes from shipments daily. Best part of job was helping others in there decisions and helping with the security of area."
bad,being a hair stylist is very rewarding and working for JcPenny salon allows you to use your creativity as your gift. Managements changes way to often so its a little difficult to keepp up morale for all the constant changes.
bad,"They are never in a hurry to fix what is broken so you can do your job properly, let supplies run out and dont give enough hours to make it worth your while to work there if you have to travel long distance."
bad,"Management is poor .There is no support from manager , no guidance, help , motivation or nothing. Leadership skills are not good . Manager is rude . For not want to listen to ideas of the other Stylist. It's only about what's best for her ."
bad,"This was the most boring job I've ever had.  Hardly any customers even during holidays. The shows department is always lonely. Minimum wage,  you get $2 if you open a new jcpenney credit card."
bad,The company has had many challenges with support and teamwork.  Management believed in stating the opportunities but never congratulating you on successes. It was very defeating towards the end of my work relationship. The company is in distress and blamed the associates.
bad,"working there was great at first had a lot of opportunities to advance within the first 6 months and it was a good work place but then it went down hill, I started off on the docks unloading the trucks, and then I got the opportunity to learn the cash register which meant I could work more hours, then I was asked if I wanted to move to the appliance department and get a raise from $10hr to $13hr, and was going to be able get more hours (which disn't happen) but I still liked working there and about after 10 months working there the manager asked me if I was willing to work in the shoe department and I'll be keeping my pay and I would work every weekday which was great until about a month later the reduced my pay to $11.75 without notifying me then they wanted me to help on the docks again and take over another employees duties while getting payed less then he was, so I decided to stop working there"
bad,"This place is not the best for an interesting and fast paced environment. You can definitely learn a thing or two about working in retail but as for any sort of reliable skills for another job, you might as well go somewhere else."
bad,I worked in the shoe department. I had base pay plus earned a commission based on sales. This was a difficult task due to the shoes being high priced and out of style. We really didn't get any action in this department and when I tried to help in other departments I was told not too. It is a good job for student or first job.
bad,"I don't wish to leave a review, This is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. I do not recommend anyone to work for this company.  Ahorro story"
bad,"My days at working at JCPenny was a seasonal job, from working there was working in a fast pace, checking out merchandise , and innovatory. what i learned was working on a fast pace, being multitask, and working together. the management at JCPenny was not really around. i cant really say anything about that. the hardest part about the job was supervisor gives assignment out and not giving any direction. and finally an enjoyable part of the job helping the customers with answering questions and show directions"
bad,All JCPenny's no matter where the are located in the country only follow brown people around the store. It is very stressful job because it is implied that only certain people commit crimes. So customers are constantly coming up to you asking why is this person following me and you have to come up with some lame answer to tell them. Over all my coworkers  were nice.
bad,"The title says it all, and she is still there causing problems for other stylists. Going to human resources does not help either. They are best friends. I was practically blind and she had the guts to leave me a threatening voicemail to fire me if I did not resign. I even had medical leave forms. Also, the girl that was supposed to train me, wouldn't be cause she was always in a bad mood. she would ignore me."
bad,"My experience at JCP was horrible because the managers thought they were better than the workers beneath them, and were super rude. It wouldve been a much better job if there was better management. Still had lots of boring & slow days too. Not my cup of tea, personally."
bad,"The people who work there are rude to their employees and customers. They need to be more friendly, they scare away customers. They need to give their employees more help when they first hire them."
bad,"A typical day at this job differed frequently. Some days were very busy and productive, where others were slow and would have very little if any clients."
bad,JCPenny is just another regular job. Most enjoyable part is the customers. Management is not all that and they only care about coverage and making sure enough people are there for closing. If you have an emergency they rarely care.
bad,When arriving at JCPenny  in the morning I would start by either finishing putting out unfinished carts with merchandise on the floor or opening pallets.
bad,"After new company structure, there were company-wide layoffs. I got laid off on maternity leave. No one could seem to tell me why and many managers told me I was a high performer. My assistant manager even told upper management they made a mistake. They first laid everyone off, then offered the people they kept their new position (which they should have done the other way around). Now I see a new position listed because one of the associates they kept didn't want it. I could have had that position."
bad,"When I first started working for this company, I loved it! I was given plenty of hours and the managers were not as obsessive about credit apps. Now fast forward to now, (2012) and I barely get hours. I consider myself to be a good employee who customers enjoy coming too for service and I barely get 10 hrs a week (if anything). I just had two of my shifts cut and for a college student that is unacceptable. They also hired some seasonal people for permanent positions, which I will never understand b/c if you are so limited with hours, how can you just hire like 6 new people?? Overall, I would suggest not working here until they make a change, and I'm not referring to the new ticketing ""strategy"" they're doing now. The only thing I like is the 25% employee discount we have...but with no paycheck hardly, what good is it?"
bad,"1st impressions are big, called to interview, waited for almost an hour to speak with a manager and as she arrived she seemed to have 10things to do and she could not conduct the interview instead  assigned an associate to conduct my interview. Waited for almost 45m just sitting around waiting on her. Management seemed chaotic. No organization behind doors."
bad,"I dealt with verbal abuse, harassment and constant disrespect from my department manager. The department that I worked in was full of bullies and mess. My schedule was horrible."
bad,"When I first worked for JC Penney's (96-08) it was a great company to work for"
bad,"my overall experience started at Jcpenney in a very positive and productive way. As the years go on, Jcpenney has to do better with the company as far as communication, listening skills, leadership, and confidentiality. Jcpenney as a company needs better work ethics and really think about the people they invest in and not in a discrimination way, just invest in those that will make the company go far and not just because you need the work done but also have it done proper way"
bad,"Fair, work at your speed, gets busy on weekends. Friendly people. Awesome sales when using coupon book, small store always nice and clean friendly associates ""at the time"" department manager was great"
bad,"it was a seasonal position. No room for growth, stand on your feet all day, long lines on register & moves very slow, coworkers dont like to work & there's no team work everyone is on their own."
bad,"A typical day at work consists of working at a cash register, helping men pick out suits, sorting and making cloths racks neat, and cleaning. I learned skills to work in retail and with customers. The management is great, they are very helpful when I have questions about something on the job. The hardest part on the job is dealing with customers who start yelling at you. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing customers happy when you help find them the right cloths."
bad,"enjoyed the job, co workers not so much. worked at my own pace, built a good relationship with my customers. i learned a lot about window treatment installations. customer service the hardest part was trying to live to others expectations. i enjoyed the different areas i traveled to."
bad,"I have nothing to say about jcp "
bad,"The work itself was not too difficult to accomplish but the amount of work was stressful due to others not doing their part; so others suffered and the hard workers cleaned up their mess. Managers would not write up the under performing employees due to laziness. The employees, regardless of their non-performing behavior, were never dealt with and kept employed."
bad,"Schaumburg location, the worst store leader, a crook, thief, and prejudice manager. very uncomfortable working conditions for most employees, two faced, and out to do what ever it takes to see the numbers in his store to retire with the company comfortably."
bad,"Reinvention upon Reinvention. Jcp needs to figure out who their competition is. Terrible work life balance. Lack luster sales have caused further reductions in head count meaning you will do triple the amount of work and then asked to do more. It's a revolving door of leadership and company strategy. HR is also the worst in the industry. Pay is good but be prepared to sacrifice your personal life. Also, at any given time you could be let go. Job stability here is nonexistant."
bad,"Working  at jc penny was a good experience for me , as I was my first work in the us. At work I would attend to the customers ring up their items help them find what they are looking for etc"
bad,"Retail sales.  No benefits, Only give part time jobs, you can't have a good schedule, they always change the hours.  During the holidays they hire more people and give you less hours to work."
bad,"i used to work there as temp. The treatement is not good for temp service. the pay is not good,the send you home when they want and it is not easy to get 40hours."
bad,"Stock shelves, counters, or tables with merchandise. "
bad,"The company did not allow full time employees so there for no benefits for there employees, just management."
bad,"great doctor to work with."
bad,the hours where long and stressful. the company was good at recognizing your achievements
bad,"• Number one in sales for 8 years straight in family footwear,"
bad,"race problems are a issue they tend to watch the black employees more often then white. and it fustrates me. its like theres so much segrigation its not even funny,"
bad,"I am informed through email from my supervisor, when and what package I will be receiving (shipment invoices are emailed to me). When the package arrives, I am to inspect the package, and wrap it. Shipping labels are also emailed to me, and I print them and ship the package. I've only had this job a month and I have yet to get paid. My supervisor is very consistent when it comes to the orders and shipments, but not with the employee."
bad,"It was messy almost all the time, so most day we had to recover, recover, recover. And if I'm not working 6 hour shifts, I'm working working 8 hour shifts for 5 days straight, overtime sometimes. I would be exhausted, to the point where I began to start having mini seizures during work without my knowledge due to stress and exhaustion. The toll was one of my coworkers (who was not my higher ups) kept harassing me and telling me how to do my job, even though I've worked there longer. Horrible, will never work there again."
bad,I didn’t work here for that long but it was pretty lame the management has out rages sales goal store was very unorganized behind the scenes don’t really care about employees don’t empathize
bad,"Going Into Jc Penney Everyday Was A Very Easy Day ! Checking The Fitting Rooms , Greeting Customers, Stocking Merchandise On The Sales Floor. Working There Had Its Ups And Downs But Very Enjoyable Place To Work For."
bad,"how  to work with people "
bad,Some managers need more training and need to balance scheduling better
bad,"Over all the company use to be a good place to work years ago not so any more they have taken a lot of things away from their associates. No more recognizing individuals for their good work, and attendance So forth and so on."
bad,Working here was a great experience it showed me how to deal with the customers additude and also it shows how you should always have a smile on your face...
bad,"When I first got the job I was excited to work there because I got a 25% jcp discount card, but during training I had two instructors who were condensing and not very knowledgeable of their own material...The first thing I notice when I walked on the floor is how empty the place looked. It looked liked a ghost town. The next problem came when they made everyone use a sm clear bag to hold their personal belongings apparently they had a issue with online theft and you couldn't carry the bag with you, you had to store it in your locker. Who wants to go to their locker 40 times a day? On top of that you couldn't eat at your desk which meant that you would only eat about once a day because who has time to go to the their locker /bathroom/ locker on a 15 minute break? Immediately out of training  I was micromanaged by leads and supervisors. I felt so disgusted. On top of that they have weekly one on ones with a sup who goes over your stats. That is excessive, I'm use to monthly one on one's. Their call time is extremely low for a call center (especially since they know customers are extremely talkative) and they only pay $12 an hour. They push for you to ask customers for survey's but they don't even offer a bonus program for hitting your metrics. Overall I hated that job and I would never go back."
bad,Company going down overall  very stressful environment poor management poor training programs always short staffed constantly cutting hours over worked
bad,J.C. Penny always left the opportunity to return. Transportation was difficult and I depended on a great friend that stuck by me. I felt I was a typical hardship upon his kindness.
bad,Jcpenney was my first job after graduating high school. i enjoyed working there when I first started. Management wasn't very organized when it came to assigning work to the employees. the hardest part of the job was when they would assign the work equivalent to four people all to one person.
bad,"After I was finally hired, I worked there for just over a month. I was laid off in the middle of a shift. This is after working several 10-13 hour days in a row"
bad,"2 Weeks pay?! For 11 or 12$ an hour??? No ... Hours get cut ..When new people are hired! Don't waste your time working here!! . Mangers suck..They don't care about your personal lives . Like being in school ... They never  change schedules when your school schedule conflicts with it! Expects you to come in when you aren't even scheduled! Like what?! They'll even switch your scheduled last minute, managers promote anyone and everyone thats not even qualified ...Just a mess ....Pay sucks, hours sucks, if you don't get a certain amount of sign ups by register they tell u  ...Even by putting your name on a  list of who has many sign ups (whos doing bad or good) , u can get fired by it! ...Horrible,horrible company do not work for jc pennys!!!"
bad,My Boss wouldn’t stop trying to get rid of me. No one wanted to help me with him. I didn’t enjoy my job. When I tried to work hard to move up or move up to a different company. I felt my boss really just wanted me to leave. He wasn’t open to what I had to say. He didn’t look at my skill the way he should and no one could really help.
bad,"Terrible worklife balance, poor management and training. They played favorites no matter how hard you worked. Was happy to leave and never come back. Had really bad layoffs several times"
bad,Jcpenney is racist..they cater more to the foriengers and they always walk the line between racism and favoritism they have favorites the only people that advance are ppl they like or in their clicks.they bring in outsiders for u to train to be your boss.how would it feel to be there 11 yrs train someone and u answer to them
bad,Very poor management. All they care about is credit cards not their employees. Try to find ways to knock your annual raise even though store manager sits in office all day and never closes. Supervisors don’t get enough credit for what they put up with daily. It’s never good enough. Co workers though they are amazing and they make it worth it they become your family through all the chaos and high stress levels.
bad,"Tons of nepotism and favoritism. Not uncommon to see employees who kiss up or go out drinking with supervisors or management to get promoted and paid more. Don't expect any work out of management or supervisors, they only come out when a customer is upset, other than that they just hide in their offices for 8 hours playing solitaire and watching YouTube."
bad,low pay very little hours no raises no room to grow stores closing they'll give you a 10 cent raise every year deal with rude customers and ungrateful managers
bad,managers dont care about anything except them selves cut hrs all the time  i guess they wont be around much longer  they will a mark down if the customer wants it
bad,I worked at JCPenney's for my first job it was okay. It's a place that like to hire within the company. I worked 4 different jobs in the little time of 2 years.
bad,I love b security guard or 18 years. One to be a cop my age i can not. He my family is cop or army  is good. My b In work nervously super. Is good work jcpenney one chance to work
bad,Bad mgmt. micromanaging. Less than 18 hours. Bad pay. Drama. All LODS suck. Assistant mgmt is awful. Stingy annoying customers. Mgmt would have us doing stuff outside of our payroll and job description.
bad,"When I worked at JcPenny, I had a simple job to do, which was to clear out the stock room. It took me half the time that it would for the regular person to do it. Then, the manager that I had took me out of what I was doing and put me into her section without even consulting me about it first. I was not compensated for the sales that I made in her section."
bad,"Only thing I liked about this place were the co workers. Management was always in their office, its a lot of talkers and no doers. They expect a lot but do very little to contribute."
bad,"This is not a place for Massage therapist to thrive in their career. Ever!"
bad,"I had such a terrible time working there. The only positive thing there was my co-workers in my department. At the time, I was a full-time student, I had put down the days I was unavailable for, I told the lady who interviewed me and she wrote it down as well as double-checked with me, and then I informed the woman during my orientation. GUESS WHAT! I was scheduled during my classes! "
bad,Pays too low for adulta to live off its a great place to start for a young student. But hard to live with getting paid 10 an hour.. Need more full time postions
bad,The company talks a good game that does not live the values that they preach and do not take care of their Associates the way that they say they will.
bad,"low pay , no customer service , poor management , horrible hours, no advancemet, lack of team work , slow environment , had to travel for work , managent didnt care about anything"
bad,The hardest part about work is I feel like I have no life and what I mean by that is I only get one Saturday off a month! The training is no good. I enjoy the people I work with.
bad,not fun to work for this company! they tell people who are seasonal they might keep them then get rid of them after the holidays. they make every department stay late if one is not up to par
bad,Old ladies kept saying pickle this pickle that is this really anonymous? haha oh yeah okay the floor was gross and the building had spiders and like rats in the ceiling.
bad,"A typical day lacked in tasks. I was never taught what the salon terms meant which left me confused. After an error, I was not corrected and taught. Rather it was just done for me and I was left just as clueless as before. Co-workers were polite and kind. Management seemed to have no time for training and expected me to know the job anyway."
bad,"Was not willing to work with my college hours. Very rude, basically telling me it is either the job or school, instead of trying to help me manage both."
bad,"pushy managers, overly worked workers, not a good hiring process, not a good place to work. Schedules were never right, managers never got the same information,"
bad,A typical day of work would consist of counting the money   in my till in order to make sure u had enough for the day.  I was usually there in the morning so I opened up in the children's department. The workplace was a good one. the hardest part would probably have  the no teamwork atmosphere.The most enjoyable part was getting to see all the merchandise first.
bad,I would never recommend working there to anyone unless you feel satisfaction in misery. I had to leave there as soon as possible. The worst part was the Supervisors. Most of them were terrible. All they did was walk around and talk with others but when you were caught talking to someone theid get mad. It was stressful because most of the time it's just you in a department doing eveything and they expected it to be done before you left for the day. Employee drama as well.
bad,very focused on employee programs and really.....flexible scheduling wise. Managnent is pretty good at this location. Worked here during Christmas and lived it.
bad,"a typical day at work;  "
bad,worked the register and all management does is push for you to get customers to sign up for credit cards and the management was a joke they had no idea what they were doing
bad,Not a positive place to work if you don't fit in with the cliques. Not much positive to say about my experience there. Too bad they are closing this store as there are not many stores here as it is.
bad,"if I had another that would be a job to return to I really enjoyed working there."
bad,"I like the job for a part time gig, but at the same time it was enough hours for what I was trying to do. The discounts were good . They always had a high turnover but it was an okay job"
bad,I  loved the customers and truly enjoyed the other associates. But if you ever wondered where all the mean girls from high school ended up they are in middle management at Pennys
bad,Nothing to say about this job. net good people there. It will suffice if you need experience under a security title but this is a simple observe and report job.
bad,"It's retail, what else is there to say. Better than working at a Walmart but still not spectacular. The management and employees experience rapid turnover."
bad,"I had worked their for over 6 months. The computers and systems are very out of date, leaving it hard to service the customer correctly. Good people, not a good business."
bad,"It was very easy for me to get along with my co-workers, however, management was poor. The managers at the time hardly followed protocol and showed favoritism."
bad,"My experiences have enabled me to gain a deep and diverse understanding of mindset and skills needed to succeed as a Packer, These experiences combined with adoapt to a wide variety of circumstances and to ability to manage many responsibilities  nurturing while necessary lines of communication with others, make me a very suitable candidate for your open."
bad,"The management was rude and was never available to talk to. The overall atmosphere was dull and there were many confrontations between co-workers. Furthermore, despite working in one department, the management made it a requirement to learn everything for every department which was never necessary. Did not work with schedule conflicts and overall was a very hard place to work at."
bad,Working for Jc Penney was not pleasant. I did not enjoy working there. the company need to improve relationship with employees.
bad,"The lead HR manager and store director played favorites, and always tried to manipulate your schedule to work for them, but would never work with you. There was horrible compensation for outstanding work done by some very deserving and experienced workers. Some very good managers left the company due to the lack of cohesion and lack of respect spread through out the work place."
bad,"Horrible pay, long hours, not upward movement if you work at the store. If you are doing well in your position they will keep you there for their own benefit."
bad,"I'll say at least it was a job when I needed one. "
bad,"this job is not all what its cracked up to be  the management is poor and ratio between associtates is customers is low  I would not advise anyone to apply here  sometimes your on your feet 6-7 hours straight before getting a 15 min break if you even get one  depending how many available other associtates are there to cover each others breaks..."
bad,Extremely boring and monotonous work tasks that make you wish you stayed home so dealing with annoying customers and management would be avoided.
bad,The customers overall are a lot friendlier than management and show their appreciation more.  Sales associates are treated like they can easily be replaced.
bad,"horrible people horrible time not paid enough not nice people to work with horrible prices"
bad,This is not a good place to work the management is terrible and rude. They do not respect anyone that works there. I would not recccomend anyone to work there.
bad,"Management is a complete joke. They will talk behind your back, cut your hours back if you don't agree with them on anything. The only way to move up is by sucking up to them, and even then it's still a joke, I was there for two and a half years. Since the day I started to the day I was laid-off my supervisor tired to get me fired so many times. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST!"
bad,JC Penney is satisfactory work place.  The hours are long and is exacerbated by standing on your feet the whole time.  Not your ideal workplace.
bad,"Low pay, poor scheduling and they try to obligate you to stay extra hours that are not on your schedule to clean up, some times more than two hrs after closing."
bad,"I learned how to deal with unfriendly people"
bad,Very busy position and a lot of responsibility to assure the entire store is properly price signed and merchandise is accurately priced.  I have learned a lot about retail which is very interesting on what goes on behind the scenes.
bad,Very busy retail store from open to close. No benefits. Only part-time hours.
bad,Great first time employment job. Good place to learn the basics of work and schedules.
bad,no managers/supervisors seem to know what is going on here. They wander around lost and if you ask them a question they do not know the answer
bad,I worked in the back so the job wasn't to bad Christmas time was always a mess
bad,Management is horrible. They do whatever they can to make everyone look incompetent. They will cut your hours if you don't have the look they want. Work for 27 years and be forced out with no severance because management decided to change you to part time after 26 years. Company has no compassion for any employees. Please think real hard before applying. Lies lies lies run rampid
bad,"Since the economy for JCP is unstable, that means EVERYTHING about JCP is unstable. You walk in, and it's a whole new set of rules that you must abide in or else you're fired."
bad,"It  is  not  a  safe  place  to  work. I  give  them  a  zero (0)"
bad,Would not ever work for this company again. Not professional at all.
bad,Helping customer with there needs and cleaning the dressing room.
bad,order selector learnedf how to deal with my co workers the hardest part bout this job was the hours
bad,"I really enjoyed the company for allowing me  the opportunity to advance from a Inventory Control Clerk to A lead . I enjoy training new hires, and listening to many team members concerns and suggestion."
bad,"I was always climbing around on ladders, setting up wall posters, fixtures, and just detailing according to the company charts they sent to stores.  I felt like nothing I did was recognized, and it was just a very cold place.  I'm happy for the experience but, I wouldn't recommend this job at all."
bad,It was a nice enviroment but some days it was to slow for my liking. This job I rarely slow my supervisor compared to the others. I love to sell things and Customer Service as a whole but I would like to do more with a more lively company
bad,"it was ok. kept me busy. a tad harder to get hired there than what it should be."
bad,i loved working there if i could i would go back in a heartbeat i loved the staff and the customers even on my worst days i always had a smile on my face when i came to work it was wonderful job 
bad,"The customers were always so rude"
bad,This was a productive place we just worked not a lot of enjoyment but the pay was good
bad,"The salary is minimum wage, but the workload is way heavier compared to the tasks in other retail company."
bad,This job was really bad the staff is not friendly or really care about the customers need
bad,"a day of customer service, interacting with associates.In the short time of being there i to set floor plans for new mdse. management"
bad,"Horrible and unfair scheduling , low pay, run like a preschool ,"
bad,This was a promising company which is the reason I joined JCP. There are a great deal of changes which has made alot of good emplyees lose their current positions.
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company if you're trying to pay your bills. Very spotty hours and some of the supervisors are very unprofessional.
bad,"This is a fun place to work and will recommend it to anyone that would like to work with flexible schedules. "
bad,"It was so much fun at first being a season cashier I was promised easy opportunity to stay after the season. Turns out they only really cared about selling credit cards and even though I was great at every other aspect of the job and everyone loved working with me, management let me go, simply on the idea that I didn't get enough people to sign up for their stupid credit cards. Also management is insanely slow and lazy and will follow random employees around all day for no apparent reason. Super irritating in so many ways. It's a shame though, because every other part of the job was actually very fun."
bad,Commission is based on amount of money and customer prices. Hard to build up unless you give them a couple of years. They do provide free in salon classes with great experienced educators.
bad,"When I joined, sales was empasized, selling small policies.  "
bad,I work in the shoe department and it’s just me alone doing everything pushing everything out and also doing shoe on display and also doing sigining for the shoe department too. It is a lot of work taking care of it and I do not feel like I get enough hours to get everything done. The comments some people make are uncalled for and are very rude. Over all the job is very stressful. Ever since they changed the titles in the store shoes is lacking everyone’s attention in the store. No one really cares anymore where the shoe goes. To top it off we have to have a findmore goal now which is hard to do.
bad,"Sell appliances, clean them keep them tidy"
bad,"Walked the floor to make sure the store was presentable for out customers. Started out in Jewelry, moved to Home Dept. and then on to Training Supervisor Manager Trained and hired all staff during Holidays and off season times. co-workers could have not been better. Hardest part was having to pretty much learn the job solo. Training is something I love and of course the customers."
bad,It was not a very stressful job. It was even paced on a day to day basis. I learned how to handle difficult customers with ease. My management team was always willing to help you with any issues you may have with your position. Coworkers were friendly. Enjoyable part of the day was talking with different individuals from all over and the hardest part was selling the consumer packages at the end of the orders that were placed by customers.
bad,The hours aren't that great but its what you get for retail. Although worked with great supervisors and peers. I loved having the chance of being a lead and learning how to make schedules and planning floor layouts. It was fun at the time.
bad,Ive learn that there can be so many rude people but you just have to put a big smile on your face like nothing has borter you.Managers sometimes can be unfair and not understanding
bad,"Working at Jcpennys was a great time, Management was nice to the worker, they worked with you . Co-workers had great sportsmanship. The hardest park about being an order filler is they give you a time it has to be done"
bad,"Jcpenney was always a delight. Working thanksgiving day, cleaning little kids throw up.... ultimately good just some bad management running the store."
bad,Working with very nice people. Helping customers making comfortable decisions when making purchases. Getting customers to apply for credit loans. Working in different departments. Team meetings before work.
bad,"The Pennies I worked at was terrible. I couldn't get approved for day requesting off, managers only care if you get them credit cards and even then they still treat you bad."
bad,"At my jcpenny it was always busy and the manager promised a part time job , however put me as seasonal. I never got trained on cashier and when i asked they never got back to me."
bad,"I worked there for 2.5 years and advanced quickly. Despite being a full time supervisor, I was denied benefits. HR is literally the worst I've ever had to work with. She would change the schedule with no notice. Would say ""that's not my problem"", when presented with issues. Had the schedule all screwed up, frequently leaving you by yourself an entire shift with no break coverage. If you tried to get an issue resolved by going above her, you would be made to sit in her office and apologize. I took a two week vacation due to a family emergency and wasn't paid for it until I escalated it to corporate after trying to reach both HR and the GM multiple times. No support AT ALL. Upper management is never held accountable for anything. I've heard from newer employees that they felt forced to apply for the jcp card or else they were told they wouldn't get hours, however they're afraid to say anything about it for fear of repercussions. I loved my clients and the position I had, but it wasn't worth dealing with a bunch of power tripping crazies."
bad,"This is a stressful place to work. Every  thing, was up in the air. When I say this I mean, there is always a new manager who didn't have a clue, leaving most employees feeling lost and insecure as far as pay, and benefits. Paperwork was always messed up."
bad,General manager and management is TERRIBLE.  What company would allow a General Manager work 8 - 5 Monday thru Friday who sits in the office 95% of the day.
bad,"It used to be a good place to work, but that changed. To stressful to work there and no appreciation given. Had a great relationship with my team, loved them."
bad,"I really loved the people I worked with at JCPenney. I met a lot of my best friends in this work place, but I would not recommend this to a friend for a job. The hours were bad, and the shifts were short but felt like forever. I loved it at first, but the management got so bad to where no one wanted to even come into work with a happy face."
bad,The workplace was like High school everyone had their clicks and some of the people were mean and judging. The workers didn't help the new workers. The people who work on the floor didn't want to take the customers. The management was all over the place would get mad when the new workers would ask for help.
bad,"Manager and supervisors did a poor job of managing inventory and sales."
bad,Rats and cockroaches all over the place. Managers and shift leads does nothing but stand around all day and chat. They complained about accociates doing nothing but talk when they are doing the exact things. Told associates they cant wear certain clothing yet they do the same. Breaks where u work a 5hr 15min shift and you need to take a 30min break. Not making money
bad,It's poor organization and poor management. Some Managers help you out while others just leave you to fend for yourself. Questions go unanswered unless it's about Credit Applications or Customer Surveys. It was cool while it lasted.
bad,i don't have anything to say. I go to work to work then i go home. I wouldn't tell anyone to work there. It's just a good for now. It's not good for a long term job.
bad,"While working at JCPenney, the staff was very friendly at first, but once being informed about a health issue that I have they weren't pleased. Management at Citrus Park Town Center sucks! I got a lot of discrimination also. The hardest part of the job was signing. The most enjoyable part was going home."
bad,Upper management sucked so bad. Associates and Supervisors quit so often. They would be rude to their employees and just had horrible communication. I believe JCPenney shouldn't hire people that are like that. Temporary Associates had it the worse because they would take forever to tell the associate whether they need them or not.
bad,"JCPenney was not a good place to work, I was initially part time but was expected to work so many hours on days I had already told them I could not. The management was rude and did not care about their employees; it is not worth working more than you should for such little pay."
bad,"They are flexible with schedules. Crew members are usually really nice people. Work load per person is terrible, and you will not get very many hours working here."
bad,I have worked at Jc Penney for close to 6 years now and my original store was pretty awesome we had some good managers that were so involved it was amazing. I then moved to Louisiana and the store Im at now is absolutley terrible the management offers no help for growth you will only get promoted if you are buddies with the GM. Then there is the pay as a corporation it is terrible even the floor managers are barely full time otherwise you will always be part time and i started at 7.50/hr and in almost 6yrs i have only gone up 1.26 they only give you like 10 and 20  cent raises a year. It is absolutley terrible
bad,When  i was hired i was promised 30 to 35 hours a week working full time and making $12 hourly . Management hired me Feb. 8 and i didnt start work until the middle of march. They only gave me about 15 hours a week and my hourly rate was 8.25. Poor communication between management and staff and not enough hours to spread equally through all employees.
bad,Working at Jcpenny was a hassle and did a lot of work that was not included in your job description. Constantly had to call a manager over due to a customer.
bad,"If You like being treated like a dog than this place is for you .  No matter how hard you work ,150% ain't gonna cut it I Promise.  In 6 month time frame I was #4 at the top of the Seniorty list , Now That is Pretty Darn Sad Right There, And if that don't say enough they never take down there hiring sign out at the road .  Enough Said!!!!"
bad,"Workplace culture of bad behavior that never is resolved has corrupted this store.  Lack of management support on issues that impacted the store and negative attitudes with staff are a common philosophy.  The Home Store is now closed but the problems with unprofessional management continues at the mall store."
bad,"The regulations are far too strict, the managers are very rude and unorganized, and the pay and hours are nowhere near enough to survive on. The only enjoyable part of the job is making the customers happy."
bad,JCPenney is a company that promotes the customers over their employees they put rules in the place so that you cannot break them but management can to make you look like a fool to the customer. If management can not do something for the customer the customer just has to call the home office then the manager will have to apologize profusely to the customer + give them a $20 gift card and still give them the extra discounts that they were originally arguing for. It has no respect for its employees it is constantly being told that you would lose your job if you cannot make your credit applications goal.
bad,"About my experience working at JCPenney is they over work there employees. They only hire part time associates, unless you are in the leadership position you is full time."
bad,"I was hired for the holidays so its not like I expected to sit back and relax during my time here. I however, also did not expect to be thrown on a barely functional register to a horde of impatient customers within 15 minutes of clocking in. Those 15 minutes was my piece of training by the way, done by someone who also had no idea of what they were doing. The JC Penney card was to be pushed at every opportunity to everyone, even those who already had a card. We could basically not take 'no' for an answer because we had goals to reach and would be put on the chopping block if they weren't met. This made people VERY upset, reasonably so. And the misfortune to work the infamous Black Friday sales left me shell-shocked."
bad,"Support team is a stressful job, waking up at 4am just to work 4 hours a day and less than 20 hours a week. This job is for students not for a person who has a family."
bad,"Management was very poor. I was never able to get in contact with them, or give any restrictions to my availability. It was very stressful and not worth it for the minimum wage I was making."
bad,"The management was entirely corrupt. They showed favoritism to some associates while others were put under extreme pressures. Compensation was a mess, everyone was paid differently and that was entirely dependent on how much management liked you, not your ability to effectively do your job. I would not recommend working here. There is a reason this place shut down."
bad,This job is bad. They stay on your throat about selling their credit card. To the point that workers had to trick people into signing up. They do not care about how good you are at doing your task and getting them done on time. ALL they care for is the credit card sign up. The only way to get hours is to have people to sign up and if you do not trick people then you will never get hours.
bad,"Working surveillance camera controls"
bad,"Managers and supervisors don't care about customer service or the workers, all they  care is credit and sales. Folding clothe all day is a typical day at JCPenney. Be aware."
bad,"Managers would not understand your situation if you have kids, if you need a day off or doctors appointment. They would give you write ups no matter what."
bad,"I start working off the clock , otherwise you wont have time to finish what you need to accomplish for that day. once the store opens you start gathering online orders, packing and shipping. inventory is key to what you do, so keeping accurate counts is essential."
bad,The place is not well organized as far as its management. Managers do not treat employees with respect as far as over working the employees and demanding they solicit credit applications from customers no matter the cost of decency.
bad,The amount of pay you receive for your job compared to others doing similar work in our industry. Not sure if anything has changed with the company as I haven't worked there in many years
bad,"I love the people who work here but would never be able to make a living on this job. I had to get a second job just to be able to afford my car payment and the insurance on it. they don't allow full time to associates, only to managers and supervisors."
bad,"-Policies and procedures always changing"
bad,"They do not care who they hire.  No benefits, does promote from within or at all really.  Does not pay very well.  I do not recommend working here at all."
bad,you come in and clean up from yesterdays mess.  open tills and then help every customer to the best of your ability.  You must get credit applications you will be asked and told they are the top priority constantly.  Your working hours can change on a dime if you want to keep your job you have to keep an open schedule and not mind missing holidays with your family.
bad,"A typical work day consisted of attending clients and helping them find what they were looking for, operated a cash register, operate a computer to order merchandise over the internet if not in stock, persuade clients to open a charge card, stocking the floor merchandise organizing them on the shelves, also organizing and changing floor shelves and or merchandise display. "
bad,Working here is like working for free. The pay is so low ypu can get paid more at a fast food joint . not to mention all thw folding clothes zoning and work they throw on you.  Everyone competes to be better and managers act like junior high school girls with the gossip it is so unprofessional working here .
bad,"Overall I wouldn't recommend it. Management played favorites, gave hours to employees who did not perform, constantly hiring to avoid giving hours to already employed workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employee discount . The employees themselves were awesome but the management was in serious need of some guidance and restaffing. Laziness was a common trait among the management team, and things were not often done until last minute. Availability was often ignored, which caused conflict for anyone who was scheduled to work at times that they previously expressed they were not available."
bad,"Its one of those places you get stuck in for the rest of your life. Unforunately, the management doesn't care about their employees and the chances of you maintaining a schedule or getting more than 20 hrs a week (which is lucky in itself) when its not holiday season is slim. The amount of stress compared to pay and compensation isn't worth it."
bad,"JC Penny's is a great place to shop at, but while working there, the experience was completely different. While I worked there, there was little to no communication, which can make any job hard for a new employee. Most employees didn't do any work, leaving other employees actually doing their job, to get yelled at. I was in school while working here, and they changed my hour availability from around 9pm until midnight on school nights. After JC Penny's not agreeing to change my time due to the interference with my schooling, I hade to quit. There was nothing too enjoyable about the job besides some of he workers and the customers."
bad,"managers are rude, and disrespectful allow other employees to discriminate and harass certain ethnic groups of customers and other employees. the customers were great and the product is great but the employees are not so polite"
bad,"The hours weekly are unreliable especially if this job is your only source of income, new hires get all your hours, if you don't make ""credits"" during that time your hours are cut even more."
bad,"worked as a associate which was the worse, short staff always, poor pay, part time hours, messy stire to clean each night which keeps u back from lvn work the time you expected to leave"
bad,"I really did appreciate JC Penney's message but while working the management was just not the kind of leaders I was used to working with while in the service. My biggest issue is that they would change employee schedules without notifying the persons in question, so people (including me) would often show up late not knowing that we were late. But while I was there I did learn a lot about the world of retail and how challenging it was, I do believe that I got a lot out of it and I do not regret my time working there. It is just that retail isn't best suited for me and I would like to work in the world of tutoring. Working one on one with people is much better than working in retail."
bad,"Overall in a typical day at work, nobody knew what they were doing. I learned how to communicate with other by asking question and taking action. The management there was not sharp especially working in a corporation. Co-workers looked for my help when mangers weren't helping or being helpful. The hardest part of the job was hieghts, stocking clothes in difficult places. The most enjoyable part was dealing with customers and being helpful whenever needed."
bad,"This job was more customer service based with complaints ,returns, making orders and accepting payments and opening new credit cards for the customers. Also sending back merchandise that had been returned"
bad,"Salon environment. New experiences and never anything the same. The environment was very outgoing and a good environment, however can be hectic and/or slow."
bad,"The overall responsibility of the store has completely diminished due to the fact their primary concern is about obtaining Credit Apps. If you are not getting any you want get any hours. A lot of the associates are hardworking individuals who arrive to work everyday to give they all and that hard work goes unnoticed because we are not obtaining ICAPS like others who have slacked off on  other responsibilities of the store.  After working an entire year with no vacation I finally accrued time to only find out that they were no longer going to be giving us paid vacation time. They also have changed the way we as associate can make purchases by making us pay cash, check, jcp card, or gift card to make purchases just to receive our full discount. This job is  not for a person trying to provide for their family its only for teens and college students."
bad,"In the beginning I was happy with my job and the people I worked with. However, as time went by it became a complete nightmare.  When you show that you are an Independent minded person & posses the ability to exceed sales expectations, management sees this as a threat and makes it their everyday mission to punish you. I could spend hours writing down all of the abuse that I endured while employed at store #2386. Normally I would never talk badly about a former employer, but this experience was so dreadful that I must warn others. If you are applying for ANY position within this store, please exhaust all other options before making this terrible mistake."
bad,This job was fun you stayed on your feet very fast pace pulling orders I like the work place and the co workers and management the pay was great I do miss this job
bad,"I worked here for about 1 year while all the dedicated employees hours were being cut they were still hiring. At one point i had 8 hours for a week. There is only fulltime work with maybe 4 in the entire business labeled as such the rest of us where not even considered to be part time. no benefits, no job security, no appreciation and no care for employees. This place needs better mangement and better loyalty to their employees after all with out the employees there would be no JCP locations. Horrible Horrible Horrible place"
bad,"It is a great place to work for high school students or someone just looking for work, but not for a life time career. They need to hire more people to make the work flow better."
bad,"pricing and signing of daily sales. Changing sale signs for the current flyer, helping customers. Pleasant co workers and the hardest part of the job is the hours. You work different hours every week and sometimes you have to come in when the store is closed on holidays inorder to have the signs ready for the next day."
bad,Worked there for one month. they did not even give me a chance to gain some clientele. They let me go a month after starting and i had one person scheduled to return for a cut and color
bad,Co-workers very rude to customers and management hated customers as well. Not a friendly environment.
bad,I hated the fact that the management sucked and there was no room for growth. If you have a family this type of jib is definitely not appropriate.
bad,A day at Jcpenny was unpleasant. I've learned how to make signs for items and check prices for items. The management was horrible. The co workers were nice. Sale days were the hardest days. The most enjoyable part was seeing the smile on the customers faces
bad,When i was employed here the management staff was poor. There was no room for advancement and the hours were cut drastically from one week to the next.
bad,Never work at one of your favorite stores. You will start to hate it. Had some family issues I had to deal with and they weren't that understand. Could have been just me but I'm not sure. Jcpenny just wasn't the place for me.
bad,A typical day at work would be very busy always improving our retail skills by interacting with customers. Managers encourage us to do our best.
bad,"Typical day at work would consist of answering phone calls, making appointments, confirming appointments, taking photos, reviewing photos with clients and cashwrap."
bad,I was a sales assocaite in the kids department. I was getting like 30+ hours but when they did all the big changes my hours dropped I had alot of fun because being a mom I know alot about kids clothes.
bad,great place to work if your not looking for full time. slow. co-workers are great though
bad,my day would begin at 5am the supervisors and managers do not care about the workers or customers just as long as the store was according to the book and done on time they didn't care about anything else. We got a new supervisor who was very strict and wouldn't let us have our lunch break till 75% of our work was done which was torture! 
bad,i worked in the fiting room all day for four hours a day. i did not like management. co-worker was ok one of my co-wokers i me best friend now. the hole job.my new best friend
bad,Room for growth with team players. Unethical work management. Supplies was not provided for services needed in salon. Had to improvise with what was given. Competive work enviornment .
bad,"Terrible managers, no available hours."
bad,"I really enjoyed meeting new people at my job, for example, the customers. I also enjoyed working with most of my fellow employees and mod's. However, the Asst. store manager and Store Manager really need to go back and watch some video's of their own on how to manage their employees and the Store Manager needs to take a sensitivity course on how to deal with customers and staff. He also needs to not stay in his office almost all the time and get to know his store, his customers and his staff and be able to help customers find things if they need it and know how to be able to run each department, if need be. I also felt that their was alot of discrimination going on as well as playing favorites on all parts of the management team. Most of the departments were also not very well organized either."
bad,"It was a excelent company to work for but now it doesn't care about its people anymore.............. The associates are great, mgment. doesn't have time for you."
bad,"Wasnt there long. I wasnt scheduled for a whole week and then got a call asking where I was, told them the schedule didnt have me on it and they saud I had to check every day? So I let, because I needed reliability and a steady schedule."
bad,"Management makes or breaks any position within this store. You can be happy doing whatever, as long as you're happy to be around the current managers. When management is in a bad mood, everyone in the store is."
bad,"Everyone talks about others behind their back, never to their face. "
bad,"Staff was isolated, everyone always did things separate instead pf together, I got my work done and went home. Management was never present on jobs always doing their own thing"
bad,"It was fine at first then when I had to pick up my nephew and watch him on days with no school and the like. I got extra hours that I couldn't do but needed the money. My sister still doesn't know that some days I had my friends watch him. I was so stressed that my hair was falling out and I kept getting sick. I couldn't take it anymore and quit right after I got a new job."
bad,"JCPenney: Welcome to Fear Factor! Sadly, this company looks like it has one foot in the Retail Graveyard. Stocks are down. Promotions/raises are a forgotten thing of the past. Senior leadership is out for themselves. The morale is at an all-time low. Workloads have tripled, while head count has diminished. When someone is ""let go,"" their vacant positions are rarely filled. Sadly, there's no one to talk to about current culture or conditions. I've known colleagues who complained, then were ""let go"" soon after. All hail to the Golden Rule. I see the writing on the wall and would not recommend investing one's life in JCPenney."
bad,"If you’re in school and looking to just make a little bit of money to make it while being supported from another main source this is a good place to start. The pay isn’t that great, but you get enough to at least save and make it by. The managers were okay, a bit lazy, however. The employees were okay as well. Like any job, you’ll have your favorites. The building was old, so a lot of mold and rust everywhere. You will get experience working here, however. You’ll have a chance to slowly build clientele as well, but again, the pay and managers aren’t that great, so don’t expect much, but experience from working here"
bad,Certain people and certain managers made it enjoyable but others did not and some stuff was not worth it. They job mattered more than the people doing the job sometimes.
bad,"Jcpenny is good if all you care about is money. but other than that they work you like a slave and if you can’t work one day or 2 ,they will fire you."
bad,"Management did not care that I was the sole caregiver for my children for a short time, so I had to call in while short staffed, so no one to cover, no matter how hard I tried to get it covered. Had to find a new job before getting fired. Had doctors notes, phone call page, message, ect to prove I tried to get my shift covered still received points. Horrible point system."
bad,"Management was poor, with business "
bad,"The management was horrible you always had a continually changing schedule. You could never get days off, you would ge called in and told you were placed on the schedule a few hours before your shift."
bad,"Would not reccomend working there.Have to work holidays and weekends and if you are sick and need to stay home, you are penalized."
bad,"Didn't have an easy environment to work in. Everyone was competitive and bossy, no matter the position they were in. Other than that, I got my job done and done right each and every time."
bad,"As an employee here, you are seen as just another employee. It is a place made to make you feel like you owe the company something and you are just a number."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Managers are constantly on your butt for simple tasks, penny raises, no chance of moving up, no hours, I could go on and on. Please do yourself a favor and look somewhere else. The place is going under anyway. Not worth your time."
bad,"So The ST Pete location I was treated like absolute garbage , they have an attendance policy but they can fire your for less at any time. The HR doesn't explain anything to employees, I worked 17 of 24 hours on Black Friday and the day after, and called out the next day and got fired.  The HR has no consideration for physical limitations as they would schedule ridicolous hours , they would also be just very condescending. The manager at my location and not talking about the store he was alright, but my direct supervisor was horrible she was the most bitter and sadistic 21 year old I had ever met, she eventually got fired for a reason I wont mention but noone was too sad about it. One night I was pressured into applying for a credit card to hit our quota for the night, and the people dont lat there very long. Jcpenneys in Saint Petersburg represents a failing brand just like the company in whole the store is a failure and so is the company."
bad,"A waste of time.  Not able to be flexible.  Manager always in his office, never saw him until something went wrong.  Never came out to give praise to the teams"
bad,"The biggest problem i had with JCPenny was that my manager was trying to get rid of me, instead of working with me or making me better at the job i was titled to do."
bad,I liked working here only because I had multiple friends that also worked here. The management was horrible for us workers. One manager made my friend cry on multiple occasions.
bad,"I can’t even explain why it was so bad. It may have been factors in my life but having to run around an entire store when there were designated people in the departments made no sense. The customers didn’t care and just threw close everywhere and they constantly used the restroom in the dressing rooms. The carpets smelled horrible of course because of this. There was a time that I even touched an item that had urine on it. Let’s not even discuss how messy the entire environment was. Everyone had something to say about each other behind their backs. I didn’t want anything to do with it many times but of course just to not really cause a stir I just went along with them because all I could think is that I’m leaving soon and I don’t want any mess with anyone. I don’t know what it is about JCPenney’s customers but I came back from school and every customer had an attitude with me. I’m ok with the occasional 1-5 customers with bad attitudes, but this was nonstop. I kept the same attitude as I did before I left for school, but for some reason, the customers were extremely agitated and I really was depressed from school so I later realized that if I didn’t leave at the time I did, that I would start treating them the way they were treating me, so sorry for the essay, but JCPenney isn’t the place to make money and not be stressed out."
bad,"The majority of those who work here play off the system and load their work onto you. Staff is not friendly, tons of high school type drama between coworkers and managers. Managers pick out what you’re doing wrong but offer no solution or help to fix the problem."
bad,I enjoyed working here overall but the management is really hard to deal with! They stress you about working and people call in constantly putting pressure on the people who are there. I would not recommend!
bad,"Management doesn’t know there employees, days are very boring, not enough staff memebers to fill out one shift. A lot of call outs, some employees doesn’t like the managers, it can be a mess sometimes, the hiring process is way to long"
bad,The reason JCP stocks are at a all time low is they do not have any clear cut vision on who they are or where they want to go. They hire management that do not have great leadership skills and it fuels a already disgruntled employee environment. Upper management restricts the store management from being effective in merchandizing and encouraging their staff. They limit the staff hours so much that it appears to be a ghost store....or help yourself store. If they added self checkout they would be more explainable to customers that they really do not want to serve you and you should serve yourself. The great employees who do care are frustrated daily with management who shows a complete lack of knowledge or again...vision to lead. Breaks my heart but it appears JCP will be the next big store to shut its doors and management failure owns that.
bad,Lack of management help. Management have degraded and will not help with customer issues. Also they let other associates degraded you. No room for moving up.
bad,"This job is good, but for a short term only. After a while of working there i got to see how it actually worked. Hours were super bad. Currently have 1-3 day a week shifts, maybe 4 at max. Apparently is because of budget cuts, but i don't get why they hiring new people if there isn't no money. Besides that, my co-workers are really nice people. We get along very well."
bad,"Management was negative and cutthroatenlisted other workers to sabotage and lie on my character and job performance was written up and job threatened for years. Sales and commissions were constantly stolen amd rewarded to others who advanced in company ahead od me and received pay raises I should have rwceived but was passed over for.    "
bad,"Stressful all the time, always asking for credit aps, always moving you around from department to department covering everyone's lunches, the managers are so unprofessional, some of the employees smell bad, the building is so old and don't get me started on the stupid elevator, always breaking."
bad,At this time JCPenney St. Cloud is a toxic work environment. I know of no one that is happy or content with their job. Turn over is at a all time high.
bad,"The management is horrible, communication is terrible, hours worked are always changing, strict attendance policy, managers show no compassion towards employees. "
bad,"Bad.management not a chance of growing with the company, you could be stock working in one position for years, they put people in position without experience and education"
bad,The job was nice in the beginning.  I was working part time and was never given a full time position.  At the end of the day you will have to stay and fix the store for the next day.
bad,"JcPenney is the same as any retail department store, however, the company has been suffering massively in the last few years."
bad,I would have never left if I wasn't forced to. It's been a blessing in disguise to lose my job. Went back to school and doing something I'm passionate about
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of everyone running around doing other peoples job, or trying to help the ""new"" associates  because they were not properly trained. I learned that retail is more complicated then it would seem to be because, ""the customer is always right"" well that is not always true and you simply cannot please everything, although my store manager thought you should do so. The management at my JCP was awful. No one was ever on the same page and there was so much miscommunication. They were not always friendly and sometimes just flat out mean. The workplace culture was never fun and always seemed depressing inside our store. I was miserable when I knew I had to go to work. The hardest part about working here was not losing it because nothing ever seemed to go the way it should. The most enjoyable part was being able to make a couple of friends working here."
bad,"In the interview, I was told not to worry about the pay because it was easy to get incentives from selling portrait packages. That was not true because a) you need hours at the studio to take photos/sell packages, b) the overall quality of the photos vs the cost are a joke, so it was near-impossible to sell the packages that gave you incentives, c) the environment isn't conducive to getting people to spend $100s on cheapy ""canvases"" of knock-off Photoshop collages. My manager was more interested in doing what she wanted, scheduling who she liked more and generally not being very helpful. She'd schedule 1 or 2 people on a busy weekend and then ask you why no sales were made. The schedule was put out with no notice and sometimes you'd be ""on call"" with little to no notice if you were needed. My hours were eventually cut down to 4-8 a week with no explanation."
bad,Jc penny is a terrible place to work the only thing you look forward to is talking to the people around you. If you are a seasonal hire they will keep you just under 32 hours because they dont want to give you benefits. When the holiday rush is over they will give you less then 20 hours to start off. If you are like me and become recognized they will put more responsibilities on your shoulders put you back to just under full time and they won't promote you to full time. What that means is they will use you and not provide benefits if this bothers you dont apply. If you are a high schooler looking for a little money on the side and dont plan to stay here by all means apply. It's not a super hard job once you figure out what you are doing. If you are literally anyone else though you are wasting your time.
bad,"Management was lazy, managers will see you with a long line, and walk pass it, an wouldnt jump o n the register to get the line down.  no hours,until thanksgiving,so after thanksgiving your back at 10-15hrs a week, no benefits besides employee discounts, no raises."
bad,"during my time at JC Penney i would go into work early in the morning and could feel the bad energy of my fellow coworkers. i would go and start sorting my signs for the day or prepare for a truck. i would have to finish my signing of the children's and sometimes the women's and children's shoes within a 2 hour time limit. after that i would unpack or place merchandise on the sales floor. i was always afraid to talk to a manager because i would then get singled out and told how bad of a job i am doing when i was working my hardest to complete many tasks. constant drama between the sales associates and operations associate, constant blaming or pointing fingers to who did what wrong. the hardest part of my job was trying to deal with my coworkers drama and keep a smile on my face. the most enjoyable part was helping the customers find specific items and clothing."
bad,"I think working at any store depends on the management and employees that they have, and the benefits they provide. My former manager was racist and very rude to new hires and was very slow training them."
bad,Company is really good at keeping employees in the dark about what's happening with their livelihood. I do enjoy shopping there but would not recommend anyone else working there.
bad,they dont have good communication skills with there employees and rude to customers and they dont care of the inconvenience of the employees . they weren't understanding or caring.
bad,I can't believe JC Penneys has done it again. Managed to put aside dedicated employees  for  body's that have no drive or love for service and commitment.  I knew it was coming when they hire outside the company. There is no longer  a caring staff just people wanting a check. 20 + years  means put me out. Eliminate  any vision of longevity and passion and you can work here . Only real positive  is  you get a discount.
bad,At jcpenny the manerger is not a people person hes very negative and dose not show respect for others. i broke my thomb and broke three toes and he desided to pick at me about it so that made it a hard pace to work at. then he fired because i had to take of my sick son. not far at all
bad,Typical day was hard and stressful. I learned at JCP know never how hard you work you are not recognized for your hard work.My co-workers were great and help working. They were helpful and dependable. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with my co-workers. We always worked hard and late to make the store run smooth.
bad,The employees are rude. The management is terrible. I knew the job was temporary but I didn't know when it would end and they didn't even call me and tell me that I was no longer employed I had to call them and ask them about it. Then they said that they were so sorry and would give me three coupons and I told them no thank you. I will probably never work or shop there again.
bad,they are always short staffed which leads to me being pulled from my department to help in other departments which makes it so that my department ends up being a mess. There is a constant pressure to get customers to open up credit cards and the associates who excel at that are treated better and allowed to get away with more. It is very stressful and I do not recommend working here.
bad,no communication to its associates as far as daily duties are concern. management does not respect its associates. stock associates look to each other for help  to get things done on daily basis.
bad,"JCP has been a great learning experience overall, I enjoyed working there even though it was a temporary position. I have quickly learned the ropes in the retail environment."
bad,"Although I had flexibility on days I could work, I was never guaranteed hours. I didn't receive any benefits or health insurance or benefits when I had my baby either."
bad,"Terrible scheduling done by one manager who favors employees. "
bad,"Whenever you needed a manager, they weren't around and instead of actually showing up, they'd just call the quad so they wouldn't be troubled to actually handle a situation. Another thing was that they encourage associates to call out for assistance when needed but no one actually shows up when you do. There was also the fact that you could show up on time every day and do all the heavy lifting yourself but if your coworkers were buddy-buddy with the managers, they'd get promoted even if they've missed more work than they're allowed to. Terrible."
bad,"There is never enough employees working. usually they have 2 or 3 people running the whole store. it is very stressful, the tasks that are required and be a lot for one person running there section."
bad,"it was too much work and so stressful ."
bad,"great sales team and coordination with delivery teams, once again drivers get no benefits, paid vacation, sick time or anything remotely close to any type of incentive package"
bad,Management often favored other workers and never appreciated the associates. They often scheduled students out of their availability and LOD's would often sit in their offices and make the associates manage the floor
bad,Working in retail is difficult. High turnover in employees. Many employees are not concerned about the quality of their work and management distrusts everyone
bad,Management will tell you hours depend on credit sales but hours go to preferred employees as managers play favorites. Managers will discuss personal matters of employees among each other and other employees.
bad,"I'm 19 graduated high school, I need to provide for myself and JCPENNEY'S is not a great job work for two weeks and possibly 3 days a week not enough hours for a shift only 3 hour shifts I need more."
bad,"it is stressful and not paid enough and no benefits"
bad,One of the worst places I have worked. I have never felt so scared of taking a misstep and being fired in my working career until I was employed here. The management made you feel forced to take credit applications and would yell at you for not doing it their way when a different manager told you to do it another way.
bad,"The managers are very rude and strict, especially with the company doing so badly. They will be very disappointed in you if you do not open multiple credit cards a week."
bad,"This store has the reputation for giving hours unfairly and creating an unpleasant work environment. I wouldn't recommend this store. They pick employees at random which makes it harder for some who are strict about the job they do; when you have someone who doesn't want to work you have to do their work also. Their are some days when employees have one day of work for the week, how is anyone able to survive with that? However you see some who are close friends with management and they have 4 or 5 days. Its very unfair."
bad,"I started at this company as you would any other job, hopeful. As I was filling out new hire paperwork one of the documents was an agreement that you would not and could not sue for any reason. That was a red flag for me. I absolutely loved the actual job part of it, I was morning truck. We moved quick and it was about team work. That quickly changed though when I became aware of the micro managing. You litteraly can't breath without permission. They time your breaks down to the second. If you need to go to the restroom make sure you clear that with a supervisor first. The dress code is ludacris. Office attire in retail?? Overall this place was like high school all over again."
bad,"Not ideal for anyone wanting to continue their education. They won't work around your hours, & hardly work anyone at all. My location had a bad problem with over hiring."
bad,Nothing is ever enough. They overworked me and the other associates take they're job a little too serious. I felt as if certain associates harassed me. The customers were also very rude.
bad,"Basically, this job will consume your life. You will buy props for the studio and they say you will be reimbursed but you will not get any of it back. They will ask you to come in when they know you cannot come in and then proceed to get angry. I have literally worked 14 hours with no lunches at this place. You are expected to get 15-20 different photos that must follow a set line of poses (unless you can think of better ones) in ten minutes. This is expected for infants and toddlers as well. Oh and then you have to make 10-12 live edits for the customer. Clients are scheduled ten minutes apart and even on busy days you can be left to fend on your own. You also have to create personal growth goals and maintain a sales average.  You will only get paid minimum wage unless you have a facebook photography page where you take.pictures with your iPhone of your kids and then you'll get paid $12.00/hr. But, if you have actual photography experience, expect minimum wage.  You won't even learn how to use the camera, just point and click."
bad,"Few hours, post holiday sucks. Easy job, anyone can do it. Great if you're in high school, okay for college. You work cashier all day or recover the store floor. Not a lot of hours."
bad,You load and unload trucks at a fast pace. Depending on how long you work you get 2 to 3 breaks. The work week is short you barley get 40 hours
bad,"Jcpenneys Is a hard environment to be in. I was support staff meaning I unloaded the truck and it was very high stress, and difficult to have a good day at work."
bad,"Min wage task oriented job with no real advancement "
bad,Worked with a team to eliminate shrinkage by conducting internal and external loss prevention cases. Apprehended shoplifters. Used both CCTV and floor surveillance
bad,Your job is never secure and the CEO has no idea what he's doing.  They're banking on appliances right now to save the company and they make you push credit cards on customers.  If you don't get enough credit cards in a month they will eliminate you by constantly lowering your hours until you're no longer on the schedule.
bad,The work was good because you met a lot of great people.  Customers were very nice.  The hours were not consistent.  They didn't treat people fairly.  Management could be rude and obnoxious.
bad,"It was a better environment when I started. The company moved some people around and now it's just a mess. I don't recommend working there. However I did get a raise every year, I had coworkers that had worked there for years with no raise at all. These people had much more experience but still did get recognized for it. The company gives no respect to your schedule. I really wanted to like my job there but management has made it unbearable."
bad,it was fun getting to see what new fashions were coming out. it was also fun getting to know what deals were coming for seasonal items. It was a very fun job but demanding and not enough pay.
bad,"Was like being in high school all over again and the pay was nice at one point at 14 an hour then they changed it because they could never figure out who they wanted to take over the company. For all the work and the nuisances, they give you the pay is not worth it at all"
bad,"A typical day in the call center consisted of non stop call volume.  I learned that JCP is not a career place of employment, there are extremely unprofessional management team & never witnessed favortism until this office.  Also misleading of customers telling them they are speaking with supervisor, when they actually speaking to customer service reps, as management tries at all cost not to take calls, even irrate escalated calls."
bad,Sales were reasonable for customers to appreciate. Shop lifters were left off the hook most times which I did not like. The company should rethink some issues.
bad,"At first it was really fun, they always had holiday parties and good promotions for the employees, and then all of a sudden the management did a 180. They were very rude and degrading. they made me absolutely hate coming into work. They werent nice to any of the employees, they were hardly even nice to the customers. They acted all high and mighty and made the sales associates do everything. It was hard to get any help from them and they disappeared off the floor all the time, and can you guess where? To the break room. One time I walked back there because I needed help with a transaction and I kid you not they were saying rude things about the associates. This was not a healthy environment to work in, and i definitely wouldnt recommend it to anybody."
bad,The managers are unkind and quick to cut you down. They hate to work and often blame the support team members about their areas of the store to be unflattering and unorganized. Many of the managers sit in the front office and do nothing and do not take responsibility for managing the sales floor associates. The sales floor associates do nothing and everything revolves around the credit app numbers.
bad,Corporations have no idea how to deal with Salons in my opinion. Compensation of the employees should be first and foremost in business. It makes your company run smoother and helps keep people in your chairs.
bad,My manger was like hilter. Some of the employees were not nice at all. They would talk about you in another language. And the upper mangement would harras you about getting credit card applications. The only good things about this job was the percentage off you got as an employee and the nice customers.
bad,"I've been working here for 9 months now(). Anywho, I've been employed here as a member of the pricing and signing team and in the beginning, things were great."
bad,"email, track orders for my department, check orders in, get with dispatcher on jobs ready for install. set up appointments for decorators, various reports, problem solver."
bad,Great for a summer job but nothing else. The management was beyond horrible and unprofessional.
bad,"I enjoyed the people I worked with however, the management is horrible"
bad,This was a pleasant company to work for. They had work bonuses and even paid time off when needed. This job really helped me with my communication and organization skills as well.
bad,PACKING AND UNPACKING MERCHANDISE. The job had a real good team environment didn't really get much hours the job was also threw a temporary service
bad,There is a high turnover rate at this location and it is definitely for a reason.
bad,"Management as well as Loss Prevention supervisors hold staff responsible for handling day to day issues,as well as other job requirements but are not willing to coach or train staff, very unprofessional, no job security at all."
bad,"Was a fun job for the most part. The hours were a bit much sometimes. Management was nice. Co-workers were ok. I learned that not everyone is as cheerful as you. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving at the end of the day, knowing that I helped at least one customer smile."
bad,"There was zero communication, accountability, or ladder of management. The company was going under and it showed on the way they handled things."
bad,"Work in cubical on phone entire shift, maintained friendly work environment."
bad,"As a product consultant I have learned a great deal about prestige skincare and cosmetics as well as client services. My makeup application skills have improved greatly from hands on experience. However, there is extreme favoritism from the management, while this has never directly affected my job, I have seen it interfere with others. Management will purposely alter schedules of those employees that they do not like to try and make the employee quit. They also promise promotions within the company and do not deliver. One of my co-workers has been fulfilling the duties of a management roll for 3 months and the company has not been compensating her for this work. They will make you do extra work, promising you a promotion, but then do not change your title and rate of pay in the system.   If it weren't for my co-workers I would have transferred to a store closer to my home. My personal experience with this company has not been horrible, but  I have witnessed a lot of faults in the way the management works at this location."
bad,I work only for the Christmas Holiday. I was a cashier/sales associate at JC Penny. It was good working there for the holiday for extra money. I was able to improve my customer service skills. My manager was easy to work with and so was my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and working with the public.
bad,was not a great place to work. people are always talking about you behind your back
bad,"this store location is very shady, your job is only safe depending which managers you are friends with, the store manager has no real control and allow certain managers to run the real show, the assistant store manager is also doing things that benefits her and will use her power to achieve this goal. everyone is in everyone business, gossips, and very catty. its a unprofessional company full of daytime drama inside of a store."
bad,"This was the absolute worst store I've ever worked for! The job itself wasn't bad, and the customers were about the only good part of it, along with a few other employees. The management is unorganized, they constantly show favoritism to either their family members (which come to find out is half the store) or their little cronies. Yes, I used the word cronies because the staff has a click problem. Managers are constantly walking around in pairs, smacking on gum, rudely barking orders at the employees in front of customers and giving special privileges to their friends, such as being able to walk around talking on their cell phones and carrying soda cans around while ""folding"" clothes with one hand. On numerous occasions they would gossip about difficult customers in front of the customers at registers. The biggest problem in the store IS the management. They couldn't even tell you how long breaks were, everyone takes different times depending on how much your manager likes you, and they only work with some people's schedules not others. They also never out right fire anyone, I've watched numerous people just get taken off the schedule, then when they ask they'll lie and say they're putting you back on, but don't. They try to force you to quit or wait the 30 days until youre fired. They just reopened the new store and yet they're bringing an air of trashiness to the place. It's sad really, I like the store but I had to quit this mess. It's sad when you don't even want your name associated with a store because the management brings it down so much."
bad,"I've been with this company for a little over a year now, and I wouldn't recommend anyone to apply for this job, location specifically. The associates are extremely underpaid for all of the work that they are expected to do including loss preventions, and supervisors jobs. Poor communication among the management team , they also micromanage each associate, almost feels like you're children in elementary school. This job has taken a mental, and physical toll on me. The only part I like about the job is that my co workers in my department are awesome, if it wasn't for them and the fact that I need this job, quitting would have been an option a long time ago."
bad,"No room for creativity. All replenishment team must complete all work at designated time, otherwise are reprimanded by manager. No room for advancement within the company."
bad,"Too many backstabbers, phony people there. What I learned there is DepartmentManagers cannot read, nor follow the Company ""Set Cell Planner"". The stock replenishment team does most of the work. Budget cuts should start at the TOP not at the bottom, where all the real work is done. The hardest part of the job is incompetent department managers whom cannot read, nor understand the ""Set Cell"" Planner. J.C. Penney Corporate IS Clueless.They give their real employees chicken feed for pay, use,abuse,neglect them, yet C.E.O.'s etc. get thousands, if not millions, for coming up with REALLY silly ideas that are really out of touch with EARTH!!! Most enjoyable part of the day was the end of the day. A VERY SAD SORRY place to work....( Plus the clothes are cheaply made and lousy styles.)"
bad,JCpenney is an ok place to work at but not the best.While working there i made some great friendships that i still have.
bad,I love working with customers. I have worked all over the store.
bad,"I would recommend that true designers and stylist that want to go places inside JC Penney realize you have to be very extroverted and love gossiping and giving people the stink eye--because if you are introverted and they decide they don't like you they will allow those in your sales group to bully you out of your job with mobbing and harassment all the while telling you that they ""JCP""will not tolerate it."
bad,learned how to manage people better
bad,You can't wear sneakers or clothing with logos on them for fear how the customer feel while shopping there but it's alright with management if a male employee wears copious amounts of makeup on the face. Don't ask for support on the floor because you won't get it. Don't ask for more hours because you will not receive more even though you go above and beyond. Management is pretentious.
bad,Managers and supervisors were not fair in giving job tasks. If they like someone then they will ask them to do this and that. Managers were fake towards people dont like.
bad,Power happy. Unorganized. Very few hours given per week. Schedule errors.. Having to clean up all day instead of working as a cashier. Chaos disorder and just not a good location. I do not reccomend this location.
bad,"If your looking for a career"
bad,I worked unloading the clothes truck & sorting the clothes by gender. It was hot & stuffy up there. I went in at 5am before the store opened sorted then took clothes to there areas.
bad,I was extremely bored every single day I was there. The pay SUCKS. They didn’t give me the hours the guaranteed me. A lot of standing around. BORING BORING BORING. This job is for old people who have nothing better to do. I don’t understand how they’re still in business.
bad,They are very very selfish and don’t  care about their workers .very contradicting and racist. They should get better work ethics. Supervisors that I had was two faced
bad,Sometimes you had hours and other times you didnt. i would put in the days i  was available to work and they would still schedule me. Management is a mess dthey think they are better than you. When I  quit and put in my two weeks TWICE they still scheduled me
bad,Low chance for advancement in the company. Managers are only chosen based upon their age and years they’ve been with the company. Most managers are incapable of successfully doing their job
bad,The store I worked for didn't seem to want to actually train their employees. So I suppose I got a bad experience. Would not reccomend to anyone actually wanting a part time job.
bad,"management was the worse, they didn’t care about their employees. very little hours. only good thing about this job was my coworkers and the customers."
bad,"Working At Jcp was something I started out loving. Once I got my foot in the door, things weren’t as laid back. My manager didn’t like me at all. There were days that she would only have me on schedule to work for 3 hours. That wasn’t even enough gas for me to come. I definitely felt bullied."
bad,The only good thing about working there is the 25% discount in the store. Management is so ignorant and unprofessional. Was talked down to and humiliated by the manager of the whole store and the salon manager never stepped in to defend me. You don't get paid enough for all the bs you have to do there. I had to compete with 32 other stylists to get any walk ins and because of that and people booking my clients with other stylists I did not have good numbers for productivity so they fired me after telling me what a horrible person I am and how I can't even take care of my kids because I can't make enough money. People there were just two faced and it was a horrible experience for me!
bad,This location keeps hiring GMs that want to run the store as other companies they have worked for.  None of them try to adapt to company policy and standards.
bad,The culture of JCPENNEYS is changing In lieu of the company failures and sales not being made. Customers are having trouble purchasing in large quantities  or big ticket sales when company is declining
bad,"I used to love working for JcPenney and was proud of our stores. Our standards were high and we truly tried to uphold the motto. Sadly we are hanging on by a thread. In my opinion, the reason is because we have abandoned our core standards and our focus on customers. Now we are asked to do more with less people, less time, and less work hours."
bad,I worked there for over a year and I did not like my experience. Some people that were hired were definitely not qualified. Low pay even mangers made no more than $12/hr. Most management did not care and they would even include other positions in your job that would not be in the job description
bad,Good if you’re going to school and don’t need to work a lot of hours. Definitely not something you would rely on to pay your bills as they don’t provide you with enough hours.
bad,"Lenexa Logistics Center -- Certain areas are better to work in.  Immediate supervisor was great.  Higher ups not good.  Not guaranteed full time hrs except during peak time (Nov-Dec) when it's required & demanded that you work every day.  Zero communication.  Not much chance for advancement.  Majority of facility managers are not pleasant and only come into the area to stir up trouble.  When he'd come into the work area, it was very hostile.  Once he left, workers were able to do their jobs.  Dept had some great workers but were unappreciated and unfairly treated.  Most workers are able to form great friendships and work well together.  Unfortunately, the company does whatever they can to stifle that and create an unhealthy, hostile work environment.   It has not always been that way but has become that way in the past year.  Sadly, it doesn't look to get any better any time soon.  "
bad,"Never received any training. Was put on opening and closing shifts without any information about their rules. An example is I never got the password to enter the store for morning shifts. Was never told procedures for dropping off the money for the day (which if you break will get you IMMEDIATELY fired/investigated). Never really had a set manager I was supposed to report to, ended up in the wrong section and just stayed there my whole time working there. Was often told to do the opposite job of my shift. Managers didn't pick up their phones. I reported multiple dangerous persons/safety concerns, and management never did anything. Security was always slow to respond, even when I got complaints of a fight with a possible deadly weapon. The fastest they ever moved was to follow you off your shift while shopping because they could fully prosecute you if you stole. Was told to walk out of the store after my shift was done if I wanted to shop in my time off and reenter as a customer, after them searching your bag."
bad,1st we start with clearance pricing at 5 am while waiting for the truck to get here then we unload truck and get ready to go to the mens store (we have 2 stores in our mall) we unpack and put ething out in storethen about 11 am we take a break 10 mins and off to the mens store and unpack and put away the mens store. then about 130 pm we may get lunch and then at 2pm we go home.yeah its crazy
bad,"Horrible set up as far as commission. If a customer comes in to make an exchange on your sale, another sales rep can return the sale against your commission and then run the new sale through their own number."
bad,They don't follow your availability whatsoever and will try to pick at you even when you are doing your job properly. I definitely do not recommend working here because the managers also can't do their job properly
bad,"I worked for jcpenney for 7 months and my experience was awful and very stressful, management does not coordinate the work environment properly and always was very demanding despite the fact that most of the time they didn't have adequate or consistent work. l wouldn't recommend anyone to apply for jcpenney; their leaders have very poor leadership skills."
bad,"A typical day at Jcpenny  was to come in around 5 pm or 4 pm. I would clean the fittings rooms, usually by myself for my entire shift, and help out at the front cash route when needed. I had a lot of customer interaction and my co-workers were wonderful! The management had very poor skills in every way possible, and when they do schedules, there is usually only one person scheduled per shift so if you needed to call out, you couldn't because they were short handed on staff when scheduling. The many of the managers never help with anything or barely did any work themselves."
bad,Lenexa call center(fcc) was very unorganized and a stressful role to fulfill because there was never any set policies everyday something changed which was very bad for business on both ends. Then Call center did random lay off out of nowhere as of march 14th no heads up or anything.
bad,"SAYS ONE THING BUT NEVER FOLLOWS THEOUGH WITH AGREED UPON ARRANGEMENTS MADE WHEN HIRED. Pay is not excellent. Job security is always in question. Never trains you for the job, as they should."
bad,"It's pretty much fine, but you're underpaid, undervalued, and you're expected to take advantage of customers. It's pretty much gross, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do."
bad,JCPenneys is a good place to start but they will work you till the brink of exhaustion. They will work you to the point to where you can not move forward in the company at all. You have to fight tooth and nail to get the hours you need to make a good living. They are always short on workers and the hard workers could never get a break or any thank you from anyone.
bad,"At the beginning of my short two years, everyone was friendly and willing to help you. At the last couple of months of being there, everyone kind of turns on you. Don’t even think about going to one of the managers to help you resolve the drama going around. They’ll basically sweep it under the rug or add on to it like children. The whole store is very unprofessional. I’ve never seen anything like it. They need to clean house with their people and start over."
bad,"Holidays at JCPenney is stressful and one if the reasons why I refuse to go back. On a daily basis, you will be lucky to get ten hours a week and make sure you can work night and weekends. Too many responsibilities for one cashier to handle and not given much back up. They will cross train in some areas but most managers have their favorites. A lot of phoniness and back stabbing females. If you like drama, this is the place to be. They are watching to see you ask customers to sign up for their credit card constantly."
bad,"The worst thing about working for this company is that they haven't given the majority of their employees raises in well over a decade. Not even a penny. They make a lot of promises to employees that they don't really keep; there's always a loophole. Some of the management is okay, but there's a general culture of ""I don't care anymore"" from a lot of people because they're tired of being treated poorly and not getting raises. The work/life balance is totally disrespected and communication is terrible."
bad,First I wanna start with my manager. She’s 54 and one of the very first things she said to me during my interview was that she absolutely would not tolerate workplace gossip and let me tell you I’ve never met someone who gossips more than her. She would constantly tell me personal things about my coworkers that obviously I wasn’t suppose to know or else they would’ve told me themselves. She would lie to me all the time about work to get me to stay. Whenever she was hiring other people she wasn’t even looking at their skill level she was just picking the people who wanted the lowest pay then she would complain when they would do their job poorly. Now I was a full time employee and I didn’t get any benefits like I was told I would. All I got was a JCP associates card. I was on call every single day because my manager wouldn’t make a schedule. The studio would open at 9am and she’d call me at 8:27am and say I need to open the studio at 8:45 when she already knows I love 30 minutes away. The coworkers were all so nice I loved all of them. Hardly any of the customers are satisfied because we have to take certain pictures and certain poses. You can’t be creative at this job at all or else you get written up. You have to really push sales too. If the customer says they don’t want the $250 package you have to try to convince them that they do want it and make a bunch of collages that they don’t want and they get really mad and end up leaving you a bad review.  I wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone. Also side note jcp is going bankrupt so watch out where you apply.
bad,This was just a basic retail job with lots of organization and putting yourself out there to help the customers. The management wasn't mice and they didn't teach me very well so I had to ask a lot of questions and figure things out on my own.
bad,"A typical day at work was clocking in at the back register, or finding one in the store to clock in at. Then find which department I worked in for the day. Typically, I worked in the women's department. I would work the register, fold/hang merchandise/clothing, and check the dressing room etc. Most work was common sense and actually pretty enjoyable for me. I was allowed a 15 minute break each shift, which I was not accustom to with any other job. I will say the tricky part was learning all the different things on the register, but that was only a matter of time. After work, or on a day off I could use my 20% associate discount or 25% with my JCPenny Credit Card."
bad,"Horrible management, no one communicates or is on the same page. HR supervisor is actually the cause of many problems in the store, not qualified for the position, and even going so far as to bully/harass employees. No real training or company standards provided to employees. ""Full time"" is 32-38 hours a week so they never have to provide health care. Part time hours are not consistent and are subject to how much HR supervisor likes you at any given time.  Many employees have had to seek out alternative second jobs or new ones entirely."
bad,"JC penny has great clothes, as well as, awesome low prices. JC Penny's was great to their employees. As a high student at the time of employment they did not once fail to recognize my outstanding customer service!"
bad,I was consistently disrespected because of my age and I was never treated like an equal employee. The management was a nightmare and they treated the associates very poorly.
bad,Wouldn't recommend working here at all. The company is quite a mess and management at multiple stores I have been to are incompetent and do not follow policy any time a customer makes a fuss.
bad,I left JCP because of a fear that the company may not survive much longer.  JCP has too much debt and has not found a way to connect with its core customers consistently.  The company has slashed payroll so significantly that stores cannot provide the service or standards that the customer deserves.
bad,Management and human resources skill were poor and the call in service was poor the management was betting on when I would quit once I was hired no st hour and sometimes the would and would not give me hours
bad,"good place to work for a student, flexible schedules are offered and management is understanding. Not a good place to try and make a career. No advancement opportunities are offered they mostly hire from outside."
bad,"Very poor almost non existent communication.  Coworkers are obnoxious, rude and stupid.  Very stupid.  Some get recognized and paid to do nothing.  Some employees get credit for just being there and others do a lot of work and never get credit."
bad,It was very tough! Hiring manager left out of no where! Store manager quit as well! New store manager went out her way to make sure former employee wouldn't get a high level position at another company! Horrible management.
bad,they were pretty cool however they were not good at giving hours and they only call when they needed you to work they were inconsistent with the hours
bad,"The management was okay when I first started working there, but by the end of my time there it was terrible. They did not care about their employees, they barely treated us like people unless you were a favorite. If I requested a day off because I was out of town and wrote it down in the schedulers book, they still scheduled me and would not take responsibility that it was their fault that they scheduled me. I loved the people I worked with but that was the only thing I liked about working here. The fitting rooms were probably the worst. They would be filled up non-stop. I worked the evening shift and when I would get there for my shift the morning shift did nothing to help, and when I would tell management they would blame it on the evening shift, and say we were ""slacking"". I wouldn't recommend working here to anyone."
bad,JCPenny pays their workers unfairly and are very unfair with their raises and how they treat new workers overall. Someone with less experience and who was younger than me got paid more than I did and it wasn't fair considering I worked there for almost two years with only a 13 cent raise while a 16 year old working for the first time was getting a whole dollar more than I was because her family member worked there so she got more of an advantage
bad,"HR and the company is not there for there employees. Company very secretive about happenings and no advancement opportunities."
bad,"Worst place I have ever worked. Management staff can not be trusted. Treat employees like they are stupid, yet they can never answer a question. They have their favorites, who get more hours each week and are allowed to take extra breaks while on the clock. I have COPD so at times I need to use my inhaler. One day I was so busy on a register I was unable to take my 10 min. break. After I rang everyone up that was in my line I leaned up against the counter, used my inhaler and did my deep breathing. A manager came by and said I needed to fold the towels on the tables instead of just standing around. Where was she earlier? She could have helped ring up the customers."
bad,"JCPenney gives great discounts. Employees are happy when shopping. Different shifts throughout day are good sometimes, but interrupts life. I learned a lot about how to work with different kinds of people."
bad,They really don’t  cooperate  With me and the days I need off. They keep lying about what position I’m going to be next schedule but that never happens
bad,Work and keep to yourself. Alot of favoritism goes on in this company. Pay attention and learn fast. It's a continuous changing environment. Remember to always have a smile and pay attention to customers.
bad,"YOU WILL BE OVER-WORKED AND UNDER PAID! Do not work for this company you will only get 4-5 hour shifts unless its Sunday, sometimes you will have 3-hour shifts. If you are working the ""closing"" shift goodluck and sometimes morning shift is worst"
bad,the lack of proper training left a lot to be desired especially when starting out during the holiday season. I was scolded for certain things that were never even explained to me
bad,"I would only recommend this job only if you have no other choice. The management is very unprofessional, pay is extremely low, and they expect you to HARASS customers to apply for a credit card."
bad,I was responsible for sorting clothes in various departments and also organizing. I had contact with the customers guiding them to the right places in the store and selling the products.
bad,"When I first started working at JCPenney in Culver City it was great. Management was good, and everyone was treated fairly and with care. Recently however, management has gone to trash. They move you departments without consulting you, and expect you to know how to work them already. They don't care that you have responsibilities outside of work, like school or a family. They schedule you when your availability says you can't work during that time. Then when you can't work because it goes against the availability you gave them, they cut your hours. The supervisors don't know how to properly train their departments, which is why there are constant lines and it's always a mess. Like this one time, a supervisor went 90 hours over in a week, so they had to make cuts in other departments so that they're not over budget. This causes for only one person to be scheduled for the whole department, which doesn't allow for breaks or lunches to be covered. Ive seen many coworkers skip over their breaks and lunches because the managers couldn't find any coverage at all. Overall, a horrible place to work at."
bad,I've only been there a few months and i've had multiple store managers. Every day a policy is changed. And its annoying. I hate working there. There are no advancements in the salon
bad,Working for JCP give you a basic experience on how to individual job run. The workplace culture is great for new hire employee but there is no future in career wise.
bad,"I was very disappointed with my job at JCPenney. It was my first job in retail. I only made $7.75/hr for working in a fast paced, uptight environment. I recently went back to shop, and they had ALL NEW staff. I saw one or two people still there from when I worked there. The store was a mess, and no one asked if they could help me."
bad,I liked working here from the beginning. But after awhile the atmosphere changed and didn’t feel welcoming with the new management team. so didn’t like it after awhile
bad,"Poor lack of communication with employees , never was told when my last day of work was , just put off the schedule without being informed on my last day ."
bad,"I love my co workers, but managers are lazy, hr if you can’t work on a day she needs you to come to work then she will cut your hours back. You only work 1-2 days a week if you are lucky then you get 3 days. Only good is holidays then more hours and more pay."
bad,We worked way too hard to be paid less I think the workers their that does the heavy lifting deserve a raise and benefits on the job. I absolutely hated it and could not stand how fast paced it was .
bad,Bad management and Favorite played between managers. Hours were always given to new employees and management always had an attitude with employee's and mistreated employees.
bad,"The management at JCPenney was very unorganized. I have had interactions with customers where a manager was needed. Some of the managers would tell me something different every time one was called. Also, the recognization within the job was not up to par. Too much work was being asked for the little I was getting paid."
bad,very competitive poor management plays favortisms towards certain employees they go by point systems for absents if not liked by management it is used against you to get rid of you
bad,Very competitive with  contests for selling the most credit apps and jewelry care plans.  You were competing against other team members.  Made you strive to accomplish more since you were in a competitive environment
bad,I worked for JCP for twenty years and I left because I was tired of having no benefits and getting paid very poorly for being there so long. I am looking forward to a new challenge.
bad,"I have learned that the only thing that matters for JC Penney is to have the work done.  They don't care about the employees."
bad,"but i can still remember my experience .. too much favoritism, not enough hours, never got a raise, never got offered full time etc.. moving to another store made a it worse.. instead of firing me they cut my hours and i eventually quit"
bad,The managers of that particular store are inadequate of managing correctly. JCPenny's leaders at the Lynnhaven store ask too much of the people that work truck. They either need to get more people or high the pay because what we do is too man for only eight people.
bad,Stressful and low wage job. Typical retail job. High expectations with low benefits and very little help. They basically expected miracles without giving us the help we needed and begged for.
bad,when I worked at jcenney the environment was very stressful and the managers did not help the situation. whenever you tried speaking out they wouldn't hear you.
bad,Working here wasn't for me. They focus way too much on getting people to apply for credit cards. I won't be going back to Jcpenney to work any time soon.
bad,"Minimum wage, and required to do everything but manage. Will have no meal on most 6-7 hour shifts. Will move all over the store, might be hired for a specific location but will be moved to diffrent ones through out the day"
bad,"Customer Service/ Cashier Experience"
bad,overall JCP is not a good company to work for.  The hardest part of the job was being happy while you are there because management does not communicate effectively with the associates and the company tends to pass up good workers for raises.  They do not care about their employees and the job itself is exhausting and stressful on your body.
bad,"Work life is nice, friendly as long as you like customer service.  My job was a bit different with this company and management for my position was terrible."
bad,"On a typical day I'd sit in the optical department of JCPenney and hope someone would walk in and purchase glasses. I'd probably sell about one to two pairs per shift. I'd also check in glasses shipped to our store from the lab and verify insurance eligibility for our patients. "
bad,The people working here are fun and all. But other than that it's not. Hours get cut out of random and then they will say the store isn't doing a good job selling stuff that people aren't receiving help but there's nothing we can do since they aren't scheduling us to work . If you're looking for a stable schedule don't even apply. They will change your time almost everyday and won't tell you. Also they keep their doors closed with alarms after closing and won't let out employees to go home until they aren't busy anymore. The wait time to just get out the door varies from 5 minutes to an hour.
bad,It's great if your working during the holiday season because you stay busy. But if it's not busy it's a pretty boring place to work especially if your working an entire department alone!
bad,Terrible experience. No complaints in the two years I worked there. My last review was probably one of the best you'd ever see and then they fired me.
bad,"I have worked for JCPenney twice.  Years ago in CA and then again in St Louis.  I wouldn't go back for $15.00 per hour. With raise freezes, some people have been there more than 5 years at the same pay. They also may have you working near full time, then start cutting your hours to 13 or less per week, but expect you to be on call."
bad,Retail is very hard working with very little compensation.  They don't even let you get 40 hours a week. A person could not live on what they pay. ....
bad,"This job is very long and boring. We had the worst duties and it was very repetitive. I did not learn anythin, just the same work everyday. this is good for if you are a student"
bad,"high turnover, low pay, doesn't work well with single parents, or work with you to work around your children or home life. Very cold to people that have very little help and need the job the most. Hours are more for students, elderly, or people that don't mind not seeing their family or being there for their children."
bad,"Very poor management, Employees usually don't last more than a month and its usually incredibly understaffed no matter how many people they hire. Not a job I'd ever see myself going back to. The staff was kindhearted but the management is garbage and the LODS play favoritism."
bad,"Being therefor a year is really a trial. The management is really poor. there are only one manager who does their job correctly and also understands that life events happen. The work ethics of most is very High School. A typical day never starts correctly without it being drama or confusion. I learned however to have more patience, and BETTER customer service. Employees do what they want when they want. Employees always have an attitude when speaking to a customer. It is a good FIRST job to go to so you can learn what NOT todo."
bad,Not a good place to work with poor management and overtime work. Too many meetings that not allow working. NOT a smart manager keep changes decision and makes you stay late for no reason.
bad,"Typical day at work consists of working the floor and helping customers, cleaning the fitting rooms, stand on feet for long periods of time, no paid lunch"
bad,"Hired young high school college kids, put them in management what could go wrong...  Just be prepared to be doing everyone's work while they sit in the back smoking and playing on their phones."
bad,"Its not what I wanted as a stylist, its also not the best place to start out as a new stylist, they could offer a lot to stylist that have a small clientele."
bad,"Working in retail is probably one of the worst experiences ever, especially at JCPENNEY. The managers and supervisors have no regard for their employees as they over work them and then take credit for THEIR work. This company also has no regards for people's lives outside of work. An employee would have an average of 1 day off a week after working 35+ hours, and the flexibility is terrible. As a college student, it is not that easy to balance work and school life especially if  you have classes running from the morning into the night and/or extracurricular activities. Supervisors will constantly blow up your phone in order to make you come into work."
bad,I was hired for the season. Thanksgiving through Christmas. When I informed them that due to my childrens school schedules I couldn't work the late hours they let me go.
bad,"JC Penney was my first job ever, I really enjoyed working there until the CEO changed and management went down hill. I started with the company in 2010 and couldn't get a raise, which I though was a slap in the face because I worked hard Day in and day out on my part. They simply do not care about their employees."
bad,Terrible place to work. They are understaffed and management only cares about themselves. Pay is terrible and there is no room for growth. Don't do it.
bad,"Productive environment, however, it was never easy to get time off.  Employers did not care about school and even though I was only 16 at the time, they thought work should come first over anything, including school.  A typical day included cashing out customers and folding clothes.  My co-workers were pleasant and easy to work with.  The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
bad,Management was terrible. Manager was never there to talk to or to inquire information from. They also don't get that much clientele. One lady there has been in the industry for many years and does not know how to do lot of the latest trends and will even tell the clients that JcPenney salon doesn't do the services.
bad,"This company is going down fast and hard. They waste money on stupid projects that don't yield results. For example Sears has gone out and shut down several stores so what does JCP do to get out of debt, spend the money to remodel and put major appliances into 500 stores to pick up that business. If Sears had the business they wouldn't have shut down stores. The company is pushing stores to save money by not wasting water, turning off lights, and not ordering supplies, employees are paid bare minimum, no chance for advancement unless you are buddies with the manager, and no benefits for anyone who isn't a manager. There may be large volume stores in major metro areas that aren't so bad, but the corporate leadership is just running out the clock until they can collect a golden parachute. Just look at the JCP stock price of $8 compared to every competitor with a price of $60 to $100."
bad,"too many changes in leadership, too often"
bad,"8 hour days"
bad,"Without getting too personal, work experience was not the best. I learned lots of leadership skills as well as communication skills but at the same time, i believe there was an unequal workload distribution to equal paying associate in the same departments. Not the most organized and rather frustrating as well as rude supervisors. Only recognition is given to associates selling credits cards while those maintaing core or standards of clothing, were ignored and even given heavier workload."
bad,When its the holiday season the hire a lot of people but with that influx of a lot of people comes a lot of  favoritism as far as shifts and hours per employee.
bad,I had several tasks working at JCP. I was hired as a sales associate but many times I would find myself doing much management work. Many managers would look to me to complete their assignments even before I became a supervisor. I have learned that I can succeed in a management position and earn the respect of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was to deal with irate customers. Many times they would say very mean and hurtful things out of frustration and keeping a smile is the most difficult part but I have learned to master this skill. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers. Everyone had fun while working and true friendships were built.
bad,I haven't worked here for quite a long time but when I did it was very fun.  I worked with a few people so we were all like a little family.  The hardest part of the job was during holidays when merchandise piled up but we always found a solution when we worked as a team.
bad,It's ok. The pay isn't all that. Ranstad is the temp agency. they only pay $9 and hour.. It depends on the department your working in. It's hotter then ever.
bad,"A typical day is dealing with customers. They pressure employees to get customers to open store credits.Some  of the managers are very rude and obnoxious. I do not recommend this job to anyone, unless in high school, college. or retired. They ask for your schedule when hired and when you can not work a certain shift they cut your hours, not very flexible."
bad,"Good place to first start off out of beauty school. But you have to make monthly ""goals"" which are nearly impossible to meet if you come in as a ""Salon Designer"" if a new client walks in the girls that have been there longer automatically get that client first. It was frustrating and a lot of drama and hard work for VERY little pay. I would do a $200 service and get paid minimum wage. Started off with a lot of hours and dwindled down to 4 hours a week. Management was never present. Spent a lot of my time working front desk (which I didn't mind) but hardly getting to do hair. Get ready to fold A LOT of towels if you're the new kid on the block. But I loved my coworkers and still keep in contact with them today! Will never work for this company again, they have even reached out to have me come back, no thanks! Just as fast as they would hire a group of girls, another group would get fired or quit. It was a sad place to work! & the salon needs a major face lift!"
bad,Managers lazy and very dramatic work place. Managers would sit in break room for hours on end and would start drama with other managers or employees. Would write up employees very unfairly.
bad,"There is no ""typical day at work""  Policy changes with the wind.  No one knows what's going on from day to day.  If it will save a salary buck, they'll cut your throat."
bad,"Liked the job felt like it was really easy and fun but my co workers made the job awful. The scheduling was awful had to work thanksgiving, close Christmas eve, open the day after Christmas at 5 am, and then they had the nerve to deny my request to have my birthday off."
bad,Overall friendly coworkers and management Quality products
bad,Computer training provided.  Management and coworkers were professional and helpful.  Job was seasonal.  working with customers was fun.
bad,Its not the best to work. I wouldnt reccomend working there unless you were fresh out of school
bad,must be flexible and it is difficult to receive 40 hours a week
bad,"A typical associate is overworked and underpaid. Advancement is nearly impossible. Credit apps are top priority with threats and severe consequences when quotas aren't met. The company has been mismanaged and the core beliefs of the founder, abandoned. The products are cheap and overpriced. Pushing sales is painful because you can't truly have faith in the products you're selling. Management is lazy and unreliable. Associates are either overworked, forced to skip breaks or not allowed to take them until management allows, or they promise you plenty of hours and then give you the bare minimum to maintain employment."
bad,No proper training for employees neither the management. To much walking.
bad,Everyday my co-workers gawked/commented at women including the patrons. It got old quick. The manager included. It takes a lot to offend me and I just got sick of it. We didn't paid NEARLY enough for what we were asked to do...including running/chasing/apprehending shop lifters. The only good part of the job was the freedom to wear what you wanted (to blend in with customers) and walk around freely (to watch customers).
bad,Please look somewhere else to be start a career. This place pays very little for the work that is done by any position.
bad,"My typical work day consists of a full book of clients.. I was the highest percentage in color.. 98%..and also 96% on haircuts. I'm trained razor cuts..everyday is a new learning experience with associating with different clients...I had the privilege of been chosen from my salon to go to special excelled classes.. The hardest part of the job is having a bran new client in your chair. Trying to feel out there likes and don't like... the personality, seeing what they think and you suggest are the same thing.. What we know as one color they think something else. Or when they try to make you feel uneducated and having to prove yourself before starting your service.. as you well know I've been in this field for 25yrs.. "
bad,"Horrible pay, managers play favorites for advancement opportunities. Their yearly incentive raise was $0.15. People in the store are getting laid off left and right. RIDCULOUS"
bad,"A normal day in the Loyalty department is filled with reviewing reward member information that will be posted on the JCPenney webiste, attending plenty of meetings, and reviewing customer service inquiries."
bad,This was my 3rd time working for this company. I was promoted shortly after I was hired with no pay raise. My co-workers gave me a hard time and would be disrespectful after obtaining the position. My managers did nothing to support me. Jcpenney took away their cash registers and had to deal with irrate customers on a daily basis. 
bad,"Dealing with customers who have credit. customer service problems. Handling money, lost credit cards, invoice and ordering issues. Internet problems."
bad,"no team work, workers were slacking and were no where to be found most of the time, underpaid"
bad,"Cleaning cleaning cleaning cleaning.the position was a sales position in cosmetics but unlike other counters we doubled as the cleaning crew. If you like cleaning every evening and scrambling to clean before corporate visits then this is the position for you. Also after my original manager who was amazing left to open another store we had a string of inexperienced managment. They give false promise and hope to employees of promotion and advancement but instead tell perfectly qualified workers with experience that they need further training and growth, and then hire their inexperienced friends. there is no commission and you rarely make bonus.hours are bad and unevenly distributed. Training and tutorials are the most enjoyable part of the job.it was definitely a learning experience."
bad,"A typical day at work would be going in at 10 a.m and opening cash registers and straightening clothing and presentation tables. When customers start arriving you must greet each and everyone, and ask if you can help them find anything. Working behind the desk you run the cash register and do returns and exchanges and answering phones. From working at J. C Penney I learned how to Run the POS system, I learned how to do returns and exchanges. The hardest part of the job is standing for multiple hours at a time and the shoplifters. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the public."
bad,"While at JcPenney, I was a retail sales associate. My favorite part of working at JcPenney was the opportunity to meet so many wonderful customers and grow as an associate int the customer service field. Because I worked in such a busy environment, there was always room to grow and learn new things about myself and my customer service style. The hardest aspect of my job at JcPenney was the instability in hours."
bad,This place treated associates very bad. it was a good learning experience but i didnt like working for them to much.
bad,long physically days lifting and organizing products; demanding job.
bad,I have had management responsibilities for over 3 years but they will not pay people to do jobs they already do.
bad,JC Penney is not a place where you can expect to be promoted or trained for other positions....easy work if you like dealing with customers a lot. You are always on your feet....
bad,I hated this job. worst 2 years of my life. far too much work for very little pay. I hated showing up there. I disliked most of my co-workers ut was nothing but a gossip mill.
bad,if you like putting up with complete bull everyday j.c penney is the place for you
bad,Manager at the JC Penney in State College PA only cares about herself and is two face.
bad,"The compensation was less than a person would need to survive in today's economy. On the other hand as a seasonal or part time job, the extra income and discounts are a great selling point during the holidays, etc."
bad,"Poor training, low pay rates, benefit plan sucks"
bad,"In the beginning, I thought, JCP was going to be a great place to work. The management seemed to be very supportive while in training. But after a few months I realized the training I was receiving or had received would make it impossible to be successful in my position. I asked management to let my supervisor and I work the same schedule so I wouldn't have to learn everything all on my own. That request was refused. So I never witnessed the things I believe I needed to. I was forced to change departments so I could at least stay employed. My weekly hours and my hourly pay were both cut."
bad,My typical day would be listening to morning meeting in our sales on a daily basis. It gave me a new insight on retail. Co-workers were very nice to work with. Management was not understanding to family emergencies. There really was not anything about this job that was hard. I enjoyed organizing the department and helping the customer's.
bad,"Like the company but there is no promoting inn this company what so ever! its like working at Burger King, the pay sucks and you're over worked!"
bad,"i have never seen anywhere , where business and pleasure mixed so much! no one is professional there."
bad,"The people are ok. But the company makes dumb choices, there's a lot of staffing issues, lots of favoritism especially where credit is involved (i.e. if you get credit they tend to look the other way on other things, but if you don't they're on you all the time even if you're a great worker)."
bad,Constantly over worked! Very minimal raises. Always changing and adding more daily tasks without raising pay. Favoritism amongst management that shows! It's an ok place to start and get customer service experience but not to stay long term. The events we would have to boost moral was very mediocre at best with every event being worse than the last you can tell and feel that management wants to spend less
bad,"Had little to no training. Management's a joke and doesn't care about most of their employees. Got along great with some of the other employees that I worked with, but that was probably the only enjoyable thing about working there."
bad,"See above. A humiliating experience, to say the least. My comments do not speak for all JCPENNEY stores (or employees), as (past tense) I have worked in the majority of JCPs awhile ago.  As stated by our elders, 1 bad apple can spoil the entire bunch. (reminder: there were also some terrific, smart , customer oriented individuals as well)."
bad,"The job itself was stressful! No Support from management or co-workers, alot of complaining from everyone! Stressful environment wouldn't recommend this as a place to succeed because management isn't going to allow you to."
bad,"I have worked at several retailers throughout my life and none of them were as bad as working at this store. Everybody knows that working retail sucks. You have to put up with BS from customers, work long hours with little pay, and have no work/life balance because you have to work weekends and an unpredictable schedule. What makes this store worse than the rest is how awful management is. The supervisors seem like they hate their job and keep quitting left and right, they take their emotions out on the employees and just dump all their responsibilities on the rest of us. you can tell how stressed they are if you close with them and how much pressure there is for everything to be perfect. this store operates in fear and there's a lot of tension between management that trickles down to the workers. overall a very negative environment that becomes overwhelming over time. it's no wonder people keep quitting. this is good for a seasonal job to make some extra cash, but don't expect to get paid your worth or shown any appreciation from management. we're all robots here"
bad,You get constantly burrated by the elderly and their holiday hours are ridiculous and overall cruel. I do love the people that work there but its really a dead end job.
bad,"Awful management.  I was a Christmas helper and I was told on the 2nd day of work there by a manager that if I didn't get a credit card app filled out, I would get in trouble."
bad,"I worked at JcPenney for 3 months and i did not like any second of it. The managers were all very rude. They kept you as late as they could once the store closed. I never received or was shown where i could see my paystub, overall terrible work place."
bad,This company talks about training and promoting within the company. They will go outside the company to hire for a job that an associates in the is already doing. Very poor company on promoting the associates.
bad,"I am a full-time student and they still want me to have open availability to overwork me on the weekends.  So it is not true that if you are a student they have a flexible schedule. The manager doesn't care, he told me I would have to look for another job if I don't work weekends. So if you think they'll care for your personal growth don't blind yourself.  And then they lack for personal in their closings, it is incredibly abusing."
bad,Really laid back place to work but not in a good way no body cared including managers wayyy to much time off would sometimes work 2 days a week and awful pay was already trying to leave only after 2 weeks wouldn’t be a bad starting job but don’t expect anything from it including pay checks little more than just gas money
bad,The pay was so poor I don’t know how anyone survived there. They were good about working around your schedule though. They gave you a lot of education too.
bad,I enjoyed working there for the most part. The associate discount was outstanding but workload didnt match pay or benefits offered. Several management changes over a short period with policy changes
bad,"The pay doesn't match what you do, the store I worked at was very unsanitized, expect to work overtime if you take PM shifts, management is chaotic based on my experience, lack of communication."
bad,This was the best job as a single (before kids and a fiancé) freshly out of cosmetology school woman. I had a lot of freedom working here as our manager was never there! If we messed up on a clients hair we had to figure it out ourselves somehow or call her. It was super unorganized and a messy experience.
bad,Lack of communication between management/supervisors and associates which results in the store looking a complete mess. Don’t expect to be let out at the time in which you are scheduled because the store is short staffed most of the time and you have to stay until the store is completely recovered. Some coworkers were great meanwhile others had no interest in actually doing their jobs.
bad,"The Hardest Part of the job :A lot of work for little pay."
bad,"JCPenney treated myself and fellow coworkers the worst out of every place I have worked. You were constantly watched to make sure you weren't talking to coworkers. Shifts were subject to change without any notice, I had to check my online schedule multiple times a day to see if I was suddenly work or if an entire shift was gone. We were worked back to back 12 hour shifts for a week and then a final 12 hour shift that turned into 16 hours when they wouldn't let us leave because it was the day corporate was coming to check. And then anyone who was hired that summer got no hours for weeks. Our employee bathroom was without soap for weeks and they eventually  threw in a bottle of hand sanitizer."
bad,They micromanage employee by using loss prevention like the Gestapo by constantly they actually tried to get me tell on other employees because they thought i might have witnessed what they were doing because they observed us on camera
bad,"JCPenny was not a good fit for me. They did not benefit me in any way other than with learning good communication skills, customer service and store cleanliness."
bad,Management could definitely be better. Required to stay passed scheduled time to clean entire store. Need a Morning Team to straighten up instead of workers who’s been standing for hours already and then have to stay 2-3 hours after closing time to clean. Credit apps are pretty much all managers care about. Get praised for making credit more than providing excellent customer service.
bad,"Worked there for a little less than 2 years but it was definitely the worst experience ever. There’s probably one manager that’s kind hearted, and the other ones will try to get you in trouble at times, HORRIBLE hours, the HR management sucks. The only thing they care about is driving their sales and increasing credit applications, if you barely open credit card applications you will most likely not even be known by any manager. Would definitely not recommend to anyone."
bad,"The job is ok, but management is horrible. I've worked at 3 different department stores and this one has been by far the most unorganized and dirty store I've seen. Managers don't even know what is going on they just sit in their offices and think ""they know everything"" they don't appreciate their employees and a lot of them are underpaid. I would never work there again or recomend this location to anyone."
bad,"If you are needing job and you got real bills and a family Jcpenney is not what it do. They lie to you about your raise and they look over your for advancement. They bring people off the street making the same money you make when you been their years longer and when you confront them about it  they act like they don't know. They treat you like stepchildren. The training is shady. They expect alot out of you and don't provide acquit training and they will cut you from full time to part time without telling you. They don't give you all the discount they promise. Like you are supposed to be allowed to use all coupons along with your discount but they don't. Special days like associate discount days you don't get the full discount they alot. "
bad,management sucked. the store sucked. people I worked with sucked. unintelligent people all the way around. no wonder the store closed! should have happened a long time ago
bad,"If you're looking for your first employment opportunity in retail, JCPenney is a good starting point, especially if you are a student. However, your chance of working dayshift only is slim to none. You will work varying shifts, all weekends, and holidays. JCPenney is only closed on Easter Sunday and Christmas Day. Rate of pay is low and raises are once a year with some years no one getting a raise. You will be pushed continually to make customers apply for the stores credit card which has a horrible interest rate and penalties for late payment. If you do not meet the credit card application goal they have set for you and for the store, it will be reflected on your yearly review and whether or not you get a raise and for how much."
bad,"Cashiers and supervisors are the only people that get hours, there’s too many people employed so not enough hours, it’s a constant stress there. They simply don’t know how to properly and efficiently run this place"
bad,"You have to befriend the general manager in order to be able to work without being stressed and bullied. Leadership team sucks!!! Turn over rate is high. Really, this store manager is hard to work for.  Everyday is horrible"
bad,The culture here is very corporate focused and the company does not seem to care about employees. Management is lacking skill and employee turn over is very high.
bad,"This was a great first job, during my first year there. After that, management started changing at a very unhealthy rate. One of the higher up managers is the reason I left after 2 1/2 years there. She was very overbearing, rude, and made what used to be a fun job a terrible experience. I think she had good intentions. but her execution made me want another job even more."
bad,"This was my one and only experience working in a retail environment.  The manager scheduled me to work closing then opening a lot...this was very difficult even though it was just part-time.    Since this position was minimum wage + commission, your co-workers would descend upon customers like vultures in order to get the sale before you. The worst part was that I was suppose to have certain accommodations made for me due to an injury, and they totally ignored them. Needless to say, this job was not for me...I hope this helps you decide if you wish to work for this company."
bad,The management worries more on the sales than anything else always pushing employees to hit the daily credit card application goal even when we try our to get one sometimes on isn't enough for them. There is a saying with some employees that credit card applications gets you more hours which was a true statement a lot of the time for many of the cashiers that worked for JCPenney. Overall management wasn't that great and never spoke about their policies to any employee which caused difficulties along the way during work.
bad,"Holiday hours are horrible, management is all over the place and its very stressful due to Manager's. Hours change every week, and the budget for each week is different and never used properly."
bad,"The crew of Packers were performing as they were lead to. Even when the management team were against each other, the crew still were able to complete each task as asked quickly and efficiently."
bad,Appointment based. Must self promote and market clients. Training is available for new stylists. Flexible schedule is the best part for master stylists.
bad,Visually out of date. The store's outline for their mannequins and visual displays around the store were not appealing or interesting to the customer.
bad,"JCPenney could be a good place to work it they paid their staff a reasonable living wage.  The employee discount is a good one. "
bad,"Multiple Positions to learn from"
bad,"management could of been better, store is not handled well, mess everywhere, not worth the pay, the responsibility expected of you is too high for such the low pay"
bad,"repetitive- receive truck, unload, unpack, sort merchandises, change price signs"
bad,"Young manager very inexperienced"
bad,"Stop being out to attack your own associates to where they are all frightened to even ask to use the restroom.Favoritism, blame games, put associates down and out even when they weren't even trained properly."
bad,"stressful, on your feet for 6+ hours.  15 minutes breaks, 30 minute lunch.  Lots of bending, recovery of retail materials, folding of clothes, and worst is clientele"
bad,"the culture was awful at the Penny's I work at. they don't pay their employees a decent wage, in fact my pay was cut from an hourly to a commission when the company stocks tanked below $3. the pay tiers for commission require that you sell five hundred thousand dollars per year in order to move to the next tier and then maintain it. our entire store's goal for sales was less than three hundred thousand. the managers often sat in the back office instead of walking the sales floor and if you called for assistance they would be reluctant to come out."
bad,"many slow days, holidays were the most packed days since jcpenney is typically at the mall.  hardest part of the job is unruly customers which i learned how to deal with in an appropriate manner."
bad,"the store management is very off whenever it comes to simple day to day task. favoritism plays a large tole in where you are scheduled in the store and is very unfair. store pay is very unfair. when working in the back doing stock, unloading truck, and signing you are payed the same as working on the floor, which you just fold clothing, and many do nothing, but stand talk to one another counting the hours down."
bad,"pretty basic not bad place to work just not best either "
bad,Work there with the goal of getting out. Get the experience you need to advance where you want to go. It is a good starting job for younger people....
bad,"When I was hired I was promised 15-20 hours a week and I am getting on average 5 hours per week. This is because they recently started doing the schedule by how many credit card applications you get, so the more you get the more hours you get and vice versa. The management also don’t care very much about the employees, nor do they want to give out very many hours so we often only have one person per department at any one time. The atmosphere is extremely competitive and stressful."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job is the nice clients and customers. Most managers are nasty. Barely any work to do except answering phones and cleaning. which is easy but boring.
bad,"I was there 3 years in jewelry. I couldn't believe how much clerical work there was. We were usually terribly understaffed. Breaks were unheard of, lunch iffy. THEY NEVER PROMOTE FROM WITHIN. I really learned a lot but it's hard, thankless work."
bad,"I think this would be a decent first job for adults starting in the workplace that don't have to work or don't need to work full time to pay all the bills. I also think this would be a good job for teens coming out of high school that aren't yet financially independent. They are open most days of the year. Customer service is priority. This is a retail sales environment and employees are encouraged to offer credit cards to each customer and are recognized regularly for their numbers. Mostly, customer service reps can expect to sell, recommend, show and educate customers on products and services. During downtime, there is always cleaning up to do. The fitting rooms, displays, folding and hanging clothes and moving product from one area to another per manager request. Reps can either sell items directly or order them and have them shipped online. They offer part time hours, except for management, and mandatory hours on Thanksgiving and Black Friday. Every once in a while there is a raise, although I met a few long timers that were being paid $2 less than what the new hires came on with. There is a lot of employee turnover and teams change constantly. I would recommend getting yourself a good pair of professional walking shoes for those concrete floors and you can use your employee discount to buy them."
bad,"The work atmosphere is fast-paced, with numerous tasks to be completed at once. Employees must always be on their feet, multitasking. Employees are rude and unprofessional, management is inconsistent and communication isn't professional."
bad,I was a cashier who did not appreciate the added tasks on a daily basis because they could not keep their employees. They run skeleton crews then complain when you did not have enough time for the millions of added task.
bad,"Not enough pay. No advancment. Favouritism is bad."
bad,"It would be a good place to work if there was a consistent work culture. However, that can't happen at this location because the management is constantly changing. Also, there are new hires coming in and going out, and they let all of the long time employees that knew what they were doing quit without trying to stop them. The store is constantly in disarray because management does not really try to help in getting things in order. They just run around straightening things that have already been fairly straightened instead of worry about the big picture. Half of the people that work at this location do not know what the Store Manager looks like because she is not around very much. The last store manager was let go. Several good supervisors switched locations and a couple just quit JCPenney altogether."
bad,The management were very harsh on employees and i would find myself crying in the bathroom often. We were constantly pressured to sell the customers credit cards and if we failed to meet a quota we were reprimanded.
bad,The only good thing working there was the people that worked in the stores.  Most of the associates were hard working and enjoyable.  Senior management was discriminatory towards age.
bad,They werent very nice and all the managers did was talk bad about the customers including my family. They were just hateful and rude people in general.
bad,Everything is in this workplace is with no command structure. Everyone has their own goals but aren't part of a team. Time limits are placed  to the point it can't almost be done.
bad,Unload a truck load of merchandise onto stockroom floor.  Sort merchandise according to departments.  Distribute merchandise onto floor in a timely manner.  Conduct a merchandise account and verify with our inventory spreadsheets.  Supervise employees and review their work performance. Clean and maintain warehouse.
bad,"Jcpenney's does not value good employees. Management was disorganized, store was under staffed. Treat employees terribly. Dirty and unsanitary, this location closed."
bad,"They will lie to you about getting comission on care plans."
bad,The management at the Keene JC Penney while I was employed there was dreadful. They had no sympathy when emergencies arose and were known to fire employees simply for not liking them personally.
bad,The store I worked at had an extremely high turn over rate due to poor management and a major cut back in weekly hours for each employee. A typical day involved making sure all customers were greeted and assisted with any help they needed. Workplace culture was very diverse and I loved that. Hardest part of the job was the lack of communication from the supervisors to associates.
bad,First job i had working in Ny management started ot good at first but quickly changed .great job for high school students but not a career jcp is going down the drain .
bad,"Not a pleasant place to work. Poor management. "
bad,"The last few years have become volatile. Due to recent events, has become clear that employees are not happy. Benefits offered are horrible! Have been losing top talent due to environment."
bad,Very stressful---unstable--management has no strategy to keep us relevant--emphasis no longer on associates--every year layoffs---hard to leave pay is fair
bad,"no the best  experience.... really low pay, bad hours i never got the chance to work full time, when they had job fairs and we got new people a lot of them got full time and better pay it wasn't the best job that i had but i got experience with customer service and a lot of the departments that i worked for"
bad,"Underpaid, worked there for 8 years. I started out at $7.00 and hour in 2006 and on my last day I was only making $8.25. Hardly ever got raises and hiring from within was almost unheard of at my location. I opened the new store. Loved everyone I worked with for the first 7 years and then Management took a plummet. All New managers are terrible- Starting with the district manager Pam Harmon and continuing down. Hopefully they get it figured out."
bad,"Was a good store till management changed.  "
bad,The managers do not care about employees. They talk down to you and it's caused me to have such low self esteem. I had to go on anti depressants! It has ruined my life.
bad,"Would not give time off when requested to focus on school, cut hours if not enough credit card applications, managers were uptight and sketchy. A lot of favortism best time to work there is seasonal when they offer some people up to $12hr. Cashiers are nice mostly minors."
bad,"Unrealistic expectations.  Felt like I was pawn in a game of finger pointing and back stabbing.  Schedules were often changed by upper management and hours cut,only for the employees to be called back in last minute.  A team of 12 was expected to complete the work of 22."
bad,"Working here is a chore, and they don't take it easy on you. It's stressful and I am not a fan of the management. You can't advance, especially if an ex-supervisor applies to get their job back. The manager isn't looking to hire people for higher paying jobs, and say goodbye to your annual raise. They say you'll get one, but they don't actually give it to people. Overall, not a great place to work and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
bad,"very on the move, managers are fast to push the JCPenny credit card with the reward of being offered one ""jeans day"", manger was not flexible with my upcoming school hours, and would always have to stay 2-3 hours after my shift ended to put away clothes."
bad,"First job can't really complain, but like every retail job you witness the worst customers and the best. One more than the others. Managemeny would rather play the pointing game rather than help you out with what you need. There are always diamond in the rough management I was lucky enough to had one but some managers have a god complex and use the I am above speech on you."
bad,"Working at the JCPenney call center is Lenexa is a standard call center job.  The culture is very relaxed and most of the people are friendly.  There is virtually no dress code and even supervisors dress extremely casual. Associates are supposed to follow metrics, although at this particular call center the metrics are no where near as strict as other call centers.  This is nice in that you are not going to be disciplined just because your metrics are poor.  "
bad,"This was a very stressful environment, and lacked professionalism , no real room for advancement . Did not take the time to explore the endless possibilities of becoming a leading salon in the area, and the management was very poor and absent often"
bad,"This was my first job out of high school, several years back, and it was a meaningless and drab place to be. The hours are too up and down, sales are low, and the management is just okay. There are a few standout managers that I still keep in contact with, but everyone else I do not. "
bad,"JCPenney at one time was the leading industry in the retail world. I worked at the company many years and I was surprised and shocked that I was laid off from the company. The company laid me off two days before Christmas! What I learned the most was that no job is secure. Management was very hard on the long term employees and the expectations to us to succeed was beyond attainable as the sales goals, credit applications were way too high. The workplace culture was cut throat as people would steal sales from other people. The hardest part of the job was going to management with proof that people were stealing sales and they did absolutely nothing. The most enjoyable part is that I receive a life time discount for all the years of service that I put into the company"
bad,"The overall work environment of JCPenney is all too stressful and misleading to any new staff members. Supervisors are demeaning and prone to belittling your capabilities as if they are not enough. What you you do there will never be enough to them. Humble associates are seen more as property or ""robots"" rather than hardworkers who also need a break at times also. This place drains you and makes you lose motivation to strive for better. Managers should work on being more sensitive towards their employees nature instead of carrying on with inhumane acts."
bad,new associates aren't given much training to prepare them for the job.  Managers put that responsibility on existing employees.  Not to mention all the drama.
bad,They only cared about credit card applications being turned in or the score on the recipt from customers calling in and scoring the store. They had favorites and treated everyone like numbers instead of people
bad,"I would get to work and wonder around the store sizing clothes and basically looking busy, never got what i felt to be proper training and the girls I worked with had groups that where hard to ft into. manger was never there to talk and seemed super intimating wasnt."
bad,A typical  work day is around 4 hrs to 7 hrs per day. The most enjoyable part of job is the co workers. The hardest part of the job  by the end of the day your body is so tired that all you can do is go home and lay in bed.
bad,I honestly think every job or work could be enjoyable if management  is willing to work with and for its team and appreciates and values its employ work... no matter how hard or exhausting it is. but for that good pat on the back. You will always coming with a smile.
bad,"Depends on the people working at the location, management, and plenty of other things. I have worked for 3 store and have found that it has wasted my time. The only good thing is they pay decent (sometimes!!)."
bad,The staff was very negative and uninviting. The management team played favorites a little too often and there was gossip non stop. I met the monthly requirements to stay employed with them but they always found something wrong with me.
bad,"I've only been there a month and decided to just quit, the girls were so mean i felt bad asking questions because most of them would just ignore me..."
bad,it was stressful in the since that they expect you to work none stop no break. They ask a lot of you. You have to keep a certain sales average. there was no raise.
bad,"Very poor culture with the lack of positive feedback. Management is very unclear of associate opinions. Hiring of young undeveloped, unexpirienced leadership causing a disconnect between employees and management. Extreme fraturnizing between management leaders which in turn causes lack of productivity and trust."
bad,"Its different now from when I worked there but the store manager was fired for child pornography on his computer, the supervisors are rude and don't treat their staff fairly. All employees are part time now so they no longer have to give anyone benefits. Boring and unfulfilling."
bad,"The pay and the hours are not for the independent. There is never a week beside black Friday that I get more then about 16 hours and the pay maximum for any associate regardless of qualifications and time spent with the companyis less then $10/hr. It seems like every section of supervision all the way up to the CEO is under new ownership and they change their own policies more then people change their clothes in a year, all the while still asking of a professional work ethic from everybody but the teenagers making it so difficult to begin with. Also, since the scheduling is different from week to week and only released in two week increments it's really hard to plan for anything or even keep track of the days. Not like I could ever take a day off anyway because it's not paid for at all and my yearly salary is just under 1/2 the yearly rental cost for section 8 housing (1 bed upstairs) in the cheapest part of the state."
bad,"Management treats employers like prison inmates, especially the temps. There is no talking and always being watched and undermined by the managers...."
bad,"management at jcp at the mall at bay plaza were terrible. The often talked own on employees and never approached them with respect. All management did not follow dress code, used their cellular devices on the floor and spoke too customers poorly"
bad,"They talk a good game about advancement opportunities, but they only promote externally. Extremely weak leadership with little to no real mentoring or development. The most enjoyable part of the job is the pay check."
bad,"Ask receptionist about you scheduled clients, make sure station is clean, organized and ready for clients."
bad,"company restructured and eliminated key positions and expected the sales associates to pick up the slack and still receive the same pay."
bad,"Each store has its own manager and each have their own way of managing. This job requires constant standing and leaning over tables to fold garments."
bad,"Like most clothing retail stores, there are ups and downs. Some employees were helpful, ambitious, encouraging people. While others made working here a hard time. Upkeep of the sales floor and tendering transactions were the day to day doings. Pushing to get customers to open a credit card was a daily goal."
bad,"Working there, being a student and having a family is impossible.  Good for single people maybe, but not if you have a family.  They demand to much of your time, work you every weekend, no respect for your church life and values, not to mention it's like going to high school all over again.  You also have to baby-sit 3 out 4 of the managers because their off gossiping and hurting people.  I don't recommend it unless you've got thick skin and have no where else to go."
bad,Its a very demanding postion and you get very little time to do tasks. Its not a flexible either you have to be open and availble at all times. They can schedule you whenever they want to even if you have kids or school. Youre responsible for almost everything in the stockrooms and on pricing. Lots of management issuses as well and not enough pay for the demand of work. Offers PTO but you might not get that.
bad,This is a good job to have if you need to gain experience in order to advance into another job. There isn't much opportunity for growth and the pay structure could be reevaluated.
bad,Management at JCP is negligible. The company cares more about credit cards than customers. Shady sales tactics like misleading or intentionally misplaces signs.
bad,"Management is terrible once our last Store Manager retired. Favoritism is shown throughout the store.  If you are well liked by the supervisors (especially the ones that make the schedule), you are GUARANTEED hours which is unfair!  They push great workers out of the organization and is wondering why no one shops there.  Was a great place to work until they started mistreating employees and treat them like they don't matter.  I understand if I was a terrible worker but they award the sorry workers with more hours which is not fair AT ALL! They use and abuse you when they need to get things done and when they are done with you they no longer have hours to give you.  Maybe its just the location I worked at but my experience was terrible!  I would not recommend this job to no one only college students and people that do not plan on staying to make a living out of it."
bad,"Work environment was stressful because of the co-workers. Many of them had a ""I'm better than the rest of you"" attitude. They did not want to work together as a team. The employees that had been working there for a period of time wanted nothing to do with helping train or answer questions for the newer employees. On the other hand the customers that where friendly, made me come back to work. I loved helping customers find what they where looking for. To see them happy walking out the door knowing i did that is a amazing feeling."
bad,"This job is basically a custodial job, basically your just cleaning up behind trifling customers all day long. I applied for a sales associate and they always have me on the register the whole entire shift. I didn't agree to be a cashier! There's more in the job description of a sales associate than standing at a cash register all day long!  Most of the co workers are young girls with no real bills or responsibility and they don't have any work ethic. They dissappear the entire shift and the leader on dutys don't say anything about it all, they only care about how many credit apps you get for day. They don't care about the endless line of customers you have to check out, or the mountains of returns you have to recover.  They stand around and joke and gossip the majority of the shift. Feel like I'm wasting my life working at this job. I don't get how you can have a job and still be broke and struggling. The pay is a joke! I only got paid $8.65hr and I have experience. On top of all that no one can leave until the store is fully recovered which means you end up leaving a hour after the store close.  The schedule varies form week and your never off on the same day which makes it hard for you to make plans. Also you constantly have to beg customers to sign up for a Jcp credit card through out the shift.  Very high turnover rate seen new people hired every month while I was there."
bad,"I worked at Speedway part time while I stayed with my cousin as a live in nanny. I knew that full time positions were not available when I started to scheduling was not an issue. The management was very shaky at this time. It seemed like there was a high turn around rate here. I was assigned mostly late closing shifts, although I requested to be changed to day shifts because I was new to town and did not have a car of my own."
bad,"I learned a lot about people skills, and also dealing with money and operating a cash register. A typical workday was always different which was good and bad. I would have liked to have one set position. Co-workers for the most part were all very kind. The hardest part of the job was the long hours."
bad,"I worked for JCPenney for 35 years. The company used to be family oriented and a great place to work. That is no longer true. They'll tell you to give great customer service but what they really want is for you to get the customer in & out as fast as you can. Not to really engage & listen to what the customer wants. When I did, the customer was happy but I'd get in trouble for taking so much time with the customer. They often understaff their stores, so you no longer can give the one on one service. Customers miss that kind of service. How do I know ? Because I listened. If they don't start listening, they'll go bye-bye like so many other blind companies."
bad,"This job seems great at first, a great discount on everything even on the home items, in the salon, and the Sephora @ JCP. However this doesn't change the fact that their scheduling and hiring process is really s*** They hire every and anyone , candidates that aren't even qualified which requires more of a work load for the regular workers. After working there for 1 1/2 years , starting when I was 16, I am tired of this job and their unfair treatment and scheduling. The misses and juniors departments are extremely understaffed and it's just too stressful of a job, especially since I only make $8.23."
bad,I worked on the support team which was ran by people who weren't exactly sure what their own job description was or what my job should have consisted of. They always asked us to do more than what our pay rate was worth. A lot of hard manual labor in extremely tight spaces. Always chaotic and never organized. Went through 2 store managers in the time I was there which was under a year. Disrespectful and sometimes entirely rude team leaders.
bad,"Customers come in to pick up their online orders, I answer main phone lines, and transfer calls to departments.  I assist customers on the sales floor regarding merchandise, and on the register .  Return merchandise for the online desk, and pack merchandise to be sent back to warehouse.  Managers, I feel some of them need to have more training, and have a more positive working relationship with co workers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when I meet so many different people and strike up a conversation."
bad,"I realized how abusive civilians are towards other civilians are in the retail world, and how HECTIC everyone gets for false low prices. The debt was REAL at this store, and I felt sad signing people up for 7 JCP credit cards, but anything to make a sale right? ...."
bad,"was in back on salon, so a lot of people didn't know it existed. Wasn't very busy lucky to do 1 person on Friday. Coworkers was fun to work with"
bad,I would complete set goals daily. The goals were to make certain that every customer was satisfied and that the merchandise was out onto the sales floor in a timely manner before the end of the shift.
bad,No advancement possible and they fire people for no reason. Hours are good and bosses are ok. Job can get tiring. Fitting rooms are exhausting.
bad,A typical day at work includes helping customers find the products they are searching for within the store and providing a positive experience for customers to get them to return. I learned at this position that hard work will get you the hours you need to make a good paycheck every month.
bad,"The home office environment is full of blame and ""fitting the mold"". Compensation is fair for this industry. Cafeteria food is great. Starbucks in the building. Ascetically pleasing building and campus. "
bad,JCPennys was not a favorable place to work. I would get schedule and the schedule would be completely changed. They did not work well with my school hours and the managers did not listen to customer or employee complaints. I was also laid off with a weeks notice due to a lose in the position. This gave me no time to find another job to pay my bills in time. Thankfully I was still living with my parents and not on my own at the time.
bad,"Might be store specific, but HR couldn't even give jobs away. Lack of workers and low job appreciation led to a miserable work environment. Endless gossip amongst upper management. Workplace was disgustingly dirty and roach infested. I honestly don't know how this company has stayed afloat."
bad,"I worked here when I first turned 16, it was my first job. I liked it initially, however there were a lot of late nights and management did not consider that I and other co-workers of mine were still in school, so it was hard to balance both school and work. I'm not sure how the company is run now"
bad,"To work at a customer call center, one must have an incredibly keen ability to handle upset and sometimes irate customers. While not being the only type of customer to call in, I would have to say they had to have contributed to about half the calls received. A typical day would consist of sitting in a cubicle and answering phones for the entire shift. There was nothing else to it, just answering call after call, placing orders for customers, or helping them with an online order they had placed, double checking prices and stock on certain products, and assisting them with our rewards program. In short, it was not the job for someone who wants to see their customers face to face and be able to move around more than inside their cubicle."
bad,"Place items out in the store and help customers. Assist co-worker on sales floor. Stock and organize stock room, put items into computer system."
bad,i have leaned alot of my customer service skills there. i love dealing with people and solving problems my coworkers are like family i have been there almost 10 years. ther hardest part of my job is not being able to provide for my customers
bad,"A typical day entails you coming in and giving your best to meet the high expectations only to find out your efforts are rarely ever good enough. However, a job is a job and it will pay SOME of the bills, but this is a place that is about advancement from within. They would rather work you until you can't take it anymore and quit. I suggest you play the game of ""Go along to get along"" and do your time and move on as soon as you can!"
bad,"•	Assisted customers with purchase needs utilizing product knowledge"
bad,Performing the assigned tasks on a daily bases for each department when working in that area. Working in the ladies and juniors department assisting customers and helping out in the stockroom replenishing the salesfloor.
bad,"Poorly managed, and advancement is nearly impossible. If they find a good, motivated worker, they will work that person to the point of quitting. I worked at two separate stores and found that that was the case in two totally different locations. Co-workers can be unmotivated because management does not manage effectively."
bad,"Not much to say as the VP of Operations was known to belittle and bully multiple employers on numerous occasions.  Great physical office, but the management made it too difficult not to take emotional issues home to your family."
bad,"You have a life? Well not working for them you don't. I am a full time student, and because I could no longer work on certain days my hours went from 30-35 a week to 12 a week. I was told that they had to budget the hours, but some of my co-workers where getting 40+ hours a week. The store manager lied directly to my face saying he messed up on making the schedule one week and that the next week I would have more hours, but that never happened. I put in 5 years for JcPenney and after all that time they still treat you like you're nothing."
bad,"Not enough hours in the day to get done what needs to get done. it`s too bad, because there is a place in the retail world for this company."
bad,it has been getting harder to get things done since Ron Johnson was ousted as CEO. Trying to recover from his mess.
bad,"If you want to make minimum wage with no benefits, this is the place for you. Regular Penneys associates make 9 or 10$ an hour and they just ring up purchases. At the salon you will be expected to do all the same work as an associate and all the work of a stylist for minimum wage. If you clear enough hourly you can make commissions but if your store isn't busy you won't be either. You can expect to work several dead shifts a week so its very difficult to make any money. THEY DON'T EVEN PAY RETAIL COMMISSION!! But you are expected to sell retail. I had random dental insurance deducted from my check even though I didn't sign up for it. As a result my last check was for 7$ for a weekends work. The local team was OK and I made an awesome friend so it wasn't a total loss but darn close. I worked there on weekends for nearly a year ( I have a regular 40 hr job elsewhere) and only made 3000$. It wasn't worth it to give up the only time I had to rest for that kind of money. There are busy stores and salons but not the one I worked at. Three out of six stylists quit because they weren't making any money including the top stylist in the salon. If you like working hard for pennies, work at Penney's."
bad,"No hours, management is rude, no advancement.Too many people working in a departmant."
bad,"Same old upper management running the company into the ground, I had three trucks a weeks delivering clothes from Seattle to Bend Or., but the trucks were 1/4 full. stop the madness and ship one a week and then the store runs out of high selling cloths and nevers restocks them, yet I had a million Levi jeans that dont sell stacked to the ceiling. "
bad,dealing with customers and credit applications was a definite requirement
bad,Unprofessional management and minimum wage ends up ruining the quality of the jobs available at JCPenney at the Roseville location.
bad,"A typical day at work would  consist of changing store signs, scanning items for markups, helping customers when needed. The hardest part of the job was getting up at 3 am, the most enjoyable part of the job was the employee discounts."
bad,"The store I worked at the manager was not a team player. When it was brought to her attention that certain employees were stealing from the store, she would do everything in her power to undermine any investigations that were underway. Even going so far as to approach suspects and give up any information we had gathered. End of the day we had her under surveillance. I was laid off being told it was due to the company making cut backs. Im pretty certain she had something to do with my leaving."
bad,"Managers would being day by informing sales associates of each departments sales scores. Credit applications were very important to store and stressed at each meeting. Informed employees on how to better their customer service technique."
bad,"I tried to work at JCPenny but I found that it is no place for a college student or post grad. The pay is not that good, the managers or department heads can be rude and down right mean at times, the managers can be too hard and harsh, and they constantly have you on an unbearable work schedule. The only good thing about working at a place like this is the people you meet while working there. They were the only thing getting me through while I was there. I love people and love working with people and meeting new people. If you're not a people person, do not even think about a job like this because its the only thing that gets you by."
bad,"I loved my co-workers, but the job was boring. I felt that I was unimportant to the company."
bad,A typical day at work is waiting on customers.  I have learned more about inventory in a large corporate department store.  Management is ok.  But not especially supportive only interested in what you can do for them.  Co-workers are very nice.  Hardest part of the job is trying to find inventory items for markdowns.  Helping customers find the perfect piece of jewelry is very enjoyable as I do love to accessorize.
bad,"I didn't like this job because it was seasonal. I worked here two season but didn't understand why I wasn't hired on, so I was kind of disappointed I guess."
bad,"This is the type of job for someone who is retired, and looking for extra income, a teenager for something part-time, but if you are of another age group, this may not be the choice for you, especially if you are trying to make a living for yourself and your family. There are really no raises, we received no bonuses around the holidays like with other companies, and they do not give you really any hours. A lot of times you are on an on-call basis, meaning if they need a person to cover a shift, they will call you. Around Christmas it was great, got plenty of hours and over-time, but afterwards and the other times, when we should have been busy, not so much. Let's see... if you have plenty of experience in retail and with the company, it doesn't always count for you getting a promotion. There was a lot of favoritism that went on, and they made poor choices by this, just by promoting teens to managers, and others who did not have much experience, schooling, nor training to hold such a position. What they did do, which was nice of them, every year before Christmas, we had a party for the entire store as a thank you for everything we did that year. The hardest part was nothing much, just trying to squeeze hours of the management, because they claimed there weren't very many, that was because I saw them giving them to the new people. I catch on quickly with work, so for me this job was a breeze, I have done it for so long that it was very much of a routine for me on an everyday basis. My friends, the co-workers who were genuinely kind, and a lot of the customers- these are the ones"
bad,"customers were great also the co workers were very friendly, no hours, no job advancement or raises"
bad,"It was a great company to work for. Of late, they lost sight of their employees and customers. They are fighting to regain the trust of the public and employees."
bad,"I worked in the evenings so when I went in I would clock in and find my supervisor and ask her/him what department I needed go be in that night. I would start greeting customers as I walked by them and helped them find what they were looking for. The management was friendly  They kept everyone up to date with what was going on that day. I had friendly co-workers, but there were also rude co-workers. Most of my co-workers were very friendly and fun to be around. The hardest part about the job was on certain days of the week we would get really busy and it was a bit hard to keep up with everything. The most enjoyable part of the job were coming to work and helping customers d talking to new people."
bad,I enjoyed learning new things here. But it wasn't what I expected to be. Hours weren't set and it was always changing.
bad,I would have never realized that this retail job would be one the worst I have ever expereienced. This was my first retail job and I hope that it is my last because this company has made me a total different person.
bad, A typical day at work was helping customers on the floor and  performing returns to floor.This position would have been a good position if it had work life balance.  I went through a lot to get a schedule that was family friendly. I enjoyed working with team leads and other employees. The hardest part of the position was instability and the assistant manager. The most enjoyable part was working with all of the customers and working with most of my team mates.
bad,"While I enjoy working at JCP warehouse and want to advance within the company, the Statesville JCP Logistic center is poorly organized and most of the employees consist of temporary staff. Despite I possess an Associates degree and show a passion to perform my duties within the work place, management refuses to recognize my capabilities and have no intentions of hiring permanent employees, despite the two temporary agencies are ""Temp to hire."""
bad,"The people are great, store looks great! Great store to work at."
bad,The manager staff was not consistent with their values at all. Overschelduled people alot and were not considerate of others. 
bad,The really wasnt any structure or chain of command so everyone kind of did their own thing which caused everyone to work late
bad,"I have worked for JC Penney in Florida, AZ and NC. This company decided to hire a new CEO two years ago who drove customer service and employee recognition into the ground."
bad,"I have worked with JCPenney since November of 2011. At first, everything was great and I loved working there. As JCPenney made extreme changes for the customers, the associates were also affected. In my year-and-a-half of working there, several lay-offs have occured. I am experienced in every team and department yet I have never been offered a full-time position or promotion; instead the company hires new people. I am a fast learner and worker and I get the job done right and on-time. However, compared to new-hires, I am underpaid and underworked. For the past several months I have been averaging 0-5 days a month of work. I am in search of a job where I can put my skills and knowledge to good use."
bad,JCP is your typical retail store. Hours can very for 6 am to 1 am.
bad,It was great when I first start a tJC Penney in 2010 and its gone down hill when the new ceo took over and made changes in February 2011.Lack of hours and favoritism. I use to work 5 days a week not anymore. Im lucky if I get 1 day every three weeks
bad,"JC Penney, or now known as JCP has been going through changes over the last year. The change has brought a cleaner look and update products for the customers, but associates have faced cut hour and implementing NEW customer service programs (portable check-out)."
bad,"Typically busy, friendly coworkers, I somewhat enjoyed my stay hole employed at JCP."
bad,It varies from time to time depending on work available. Never a set schedule
bad,They hired a bunch people and closed down a month later. I feel like they just got a bunch of cheap labor to wrap things up before they went out of business. The only thing that was good is if we got a add on sale we were awarded $2 extra on our check...
bad,"JCPenney was, in theory, a great place to work. They push for equality in the workplace, a sense of family, and yet they never quite achieved it. The manager for Sephora was on a constant up and down mood swing, never really sure if she was going to be in a good mood when you came in, or if you were her scapegoat for everything wrong that had happened that day. Verbally abusive, made several of the employees cry, was an absolute hypocrite and was honestly the most painful manager experience I’ve ever had working in retail. The co-workers were either too afraid to take the issues up the chain (mainly for job stability) or were in her pocket and only added to the miasma of misery that the place permeated. The other employees seemed just as miserable under the management of their section managers, and there was a wave of people who quit when JCP went through its new change in CEO and policy. There was no room to move up in the company, because if you were not a favorite of the store manager, you were pretty much assured to have your same position ten years down the road. I enjoyed learning new things, and most of the customers were a joy to work with, but the overall oppressive and abrasive environment was not even worth the drive into work."
bad,"Management never agreed on same thing, one person did one thing another did something else. Never knew what to do for sure. Very gossipy work force, really talked behind your back, was not very professional. Was glad to leave."
bad,Jcpenney letting mid manager go to bring low paid inexperiance supervisors. One time it was a family store now greed has taken over.
bad,"Business is really slow, poor managment. coworkers within the salon were great to work with."
bad,Dull sales environment. No skills gained at this job. Regular part time employment
bad,"I worked there for almost four years and I've always been a hard worker, dedicated to the job and didn't call in very often. Sadly enough some of the supervisors had poor management skills. They had there favorite employees to ""shelter"" while others like myself worked hard doing the job. Learning from some mistakes usually ended up in right ups which I find unethical."
bad,I worked for JCPenney in their Salt Lake City corporate office. There is a reason this institution has started to head down hill. The work culture is forced friendly in the hall ways and cut throat/survivalist behind closed doors. They stifle innovation and expect you to know the full history of the company on day 1. You will be treated like a worthless piece of trash for at least the first two years. I have cautioned many peope away from joining this company and will continue to do so.
bad,"I got hired as a seasonal, and I'm kind of glad they decided not to keep me. I worked recovery and cashier. I was hired for recovery mostly, but I liked being a cashier best. I was fine with doing what my job title was supposed to do. But, the management and all that was completely HORRIFYING. The management started becoming worse when they got a new one. There's this one lady from the management that had a problem with me and I have no idea why."
bad,Jcpenney is a great first job for younger applicants. They teach you so much if you stick with the company for a few years. From cashiering to merchandising you will learn it all.
bad,"I was hired as a seasonal sales associate for the company, soon enough I was given the choice to stay for a permanent position. A typical day of work for me was to come in at around 5 PM until 10:30 PM. During this time I would give customer service and clean around the store mostly by myself. Management barely scheduled other coworkers aside from one dedicated recovery associate. Said recovery associates would barely work, and spent most of the time on their phones doing nothing. The only enjoyable part of this job would be the fifteen minute break that you'd get."
bad,Store manager doesn’t appreciate Salon so you get absolutely no support.Stylist normally are very lazy and depend on the hourly pay. You do come across some good stylist
bad,"Management and work culture should improve. Especially TCOE, management has no idea about the work being done. To many change in managers in almost all teams"
bad,"this place is so disorganized, you have these managers who are so afraid of the store manager and all he cares about is getting the jcp card, and he will tell you do what you gotta to get it."
bad,"I quickly realized once I started this job that it was not a good one. I had about 20 minutes of floor training then never saw someone in management again. I would just come in, recover the men's department for 5 hours, then clock out. None of the managers knew who I was, and I learned the very minimal amount I did from another sales associate. I was promised to be put on register when I was hired (my preferred area of work) and never was. No one bothered to try and get me to stop from quitting, no one even realized until it was my last night. Employees came in and out from that job so casually. Glad I got out of there when I could."
bad,"JCP in Columbia, SC was a  different employment experience than my experience in Baltimore, MD. I think the demographics & culture made the difference. The mission to make the customers shopping experience a good one was the same. The Management staff were inexperienced and not poised. The HR Department personnel was not poised. Too many turnovers."
bad,Management was horrible. Anytime you would call for assistances no one would show up for at least 10-20 minutes. Customers were getting angry with me because of a purchase I couldn't handle myself.
bad,"I started this job after losing my other job to make it through the end of high school. From the start, it didn't seem like this was going to be a job that I stayed at for a long time. The management and other senior employees constantly helicoptered over me, nitpicking everything I did and making me feel like I wasn't doing anything right. This happened up until the day I quit. I found that I did enjoy working with some of the staff and we were able to get things done. However, when I was with other parts of the staff, I was unable to get anything done. By the end, other coworkers and I noticed that I had a lot on my shoulders. I was doing everything in the store and more and it got to me. The management was a mess most of the time. I would notice that some of the management would just go into the back room and not come out for hours. Management would also do anything they could to stay away from the registers because ""they were busy."" Half the time, the management did nothing to help the employees. Almost seeming that having to do their job was hard. Most of my problems are not with the job or the things I had to do. Most of my problems were in the terrible management. If you need a starter job, I highly recommend it. But don't stay for long and find somewhere that will treat you better, because you won't find it here."
bad,"Good people worked there, the managers were ok and learned some things about retail, sales, and customer service. The work place had some minor things I would want to change but that’s it."
bad,"We got good co wokers, but customers are rude most of the time even though you are nice to them. Employees have to run back and forth helping the customers find what they need, confirming prices cause sometimes the sales dont come up in the sistem, etc...and they dont pay well. In my opinion that is a job for high school teens and not for people with bills and reponsabilities."
bad,"If you don't sell enough credit cards they cut your hours. They won't fire you, or lay you off, just give you one day a month till you quit. Their busy season is the holidays and after that they start cutting your hours no matter how long you've been there. There are no new customers since the company is closing down so it's impossible to hit goals unless you are shady about it."
bad,"While I worked there, I did more than my job entitled plus other people’s jobs. Without being compensated more or even what was fair. Plus the store manager was indecisive and rude."
bad,"Good first job, they just need better management. The supervisors were never on the same page. One would tell you to do something, and another would come by and ask in a condescending tone what you were up to as if you were off task. It simply was not fair."
bad,"A typical day at work was cleaning fitting rooms, fixing clothes, checking out customers, and checking fitting rooms hourly. I learned how to work quickly. The culture at JC Penny sucks. The hardest part of my job was checking out customers when busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was the break, to be honest."
bad,"I was the only one on the floor most days I worked. I learned to clean up after others and not only handle rude customers, but rude employees as well."
bad,My training was very quick. Person who trained me was more concerned with talking about her love life than training me or communicating with me about store procedures. I worked diligently to keep the lingerie dept and dressing rooms in a very good and neat order. I worked as a cashier and occasionally helped in the Children's dept. Management gave me 2 days notice that they couldn't keep me on.
bad,"I was fitting Room and cashier, and my experience overall was really difficult to handle because people would just walk in with a bunch of clothing each minute, we would stay till 12am just to finish all the recovery that wasn’t done because they kept moving everyone. If you ever work and have worked at JCPenney you know how bad we stressed our selfs out for the managers not helping at all. Cashiers would be doing their work in a fast paced way and still be told to multitask and if you are recovery they would switch you as a cashier, Fitting Room, and recovery to but also be told you aren’t doing “your” job. Paychecks we’re not good, so if your looking for a job that pays really good then the job is not for uou."
bad,"I personally would not recommend working here. The management was very poor and this was my first job, and they did not teach me how to use the register on the first day. Some of the people I worked with were very nice."
bad,They start you out with normal hours but if you’re not a person who’s good at making sales then this job isn’t for you. Within a few weeks your hours will be deducted without anyone notifying you. I found out from former employees that you’re only valued for the amount of credit cards you sell. If you don’t sell the minimum amount that’s required then expect to have your hours drastically cut the following week without notice.
bad,"Worked there for over a year, never got a raise, said I could be considered for one but then still may not get it, was forced to make customers sign up for credit cards or your job was on the line, hours sucked management could care less if you were dying on the floor as long as you pushed credit."
bad,"Work life balance is a real issue. Management is often overworked and underpaid.  Training is nonexistent for management.  The management team is so overworked that you are just trying to figure things out as you go along.  I would of enjoyed my job much more had I felt like I had received proper training.  My store manager at the time was terrible and did not try to understand the employees needs and concerns, and had no answers or positive feedback for either. Pay is minimal, much the same as a fast food restaurant."
bad,"A typical today was running the register in a quick paced store with customers buying merchandise or returning it. Also greeting customers, cleaning the fitting rooms, and hanging merchandise back were it was supposed to go. Learning a little running a register. Management was mean. Hardest part of the job was not enough training. Most enjoyable part of job was meeting new people everyday."
bad,"Last position there was a nightmare i regretted moving to it after i had gone to it for a few weeks. There was NO good fit with my nor the others in my department teams."
bad,They were always rude and never helped anyone. one manager always took others sales to boost herself. the main manager was very sexist. overall poor work environment.
bad,Managers dont listen to issues in the work place it is hard to keep professional they tend to judge personally and dont take time to train they rely on other associates. they promote from within.
bad,"The people I worked with were for the most part pleasant, but I never truly felt welcome and needed. I was constantly being redirected, putting me behind on my important tasks. I also had a very heavy workload, definitely too much for one person, especially not worth the low pay I was getting."
bad,Place is like a revolving door. No one stays for more than a year. Management is rude and will throw people under the bus and pin things on them that they didn't do etc.
bad,I was only supposed to cashier but I was doing everything else except being a cashier. If you don’t want to do more work than your paid for don’t work for them
bad,"Grind you down and still want more. Always changing schedule/hours, if you don't like it they say hit the bricks. Beware of peak season. Mandatory 70 hour weeks with no days off for weeks is the norm."
bad,"Management Team does not empathize with employees at all. Goals are unrealistically high when no customers are around. No proper training or coaching. NO Warnings whatsoever, they just take action. Flexible Hous, and free meals on specific dates."
bad,"This was my first retail  job so it did it's job in starting me out in the sales world. However, I was very unhappy working here for as long as I did."
bad,Management was not forthcoming with growth opportunities. The culture was not as engaging amongst management or associates. Gave the worst amount of hours for associates.
bad,Jcpennys was a good place to work for back in the 90's just didnt pay enough per hour. Lots of time there was not a lot of overtime allowed to be worked but i am sure it has changed by now.
bad,"The pay at JCP was ridiculous for how hard they stretched the employees and made them work. The management staff never set a good example for workers, they never helped clean just a toxic work environment."
bad,"Management does not give  any positive feedback only negative. Lack of assistance and associates to perform the work. "
bad,"A typical day at work for myself was pretty stressful. For my position it was constantly staying busy and recovering areas around the store where as some others were more relaxed. The atmosphere is based all on who you were working with that day. Some co workers would always help out and others would slack and let you do all the work with no repercussion. Certain management was mediocre as they would favor particular employees, picking and choosing who  would be written up for minuscule things that other individuals would do consistently with different treatment."
bad,Worked in the back room.  Job mainly consisted of moving products as they arrived on trucks and taking them out to the floor to be placed for sale.  Also was responsible for updating sales signs and straightening displays.  Usually left before or just as people arrived at store opening.
bad,I got fired on thanksgiving day 10 hours into my shift with only 30 minutes left till my shift was over. The lady manager was yelling at us. And following us around when we were putting clothes back in their spot. Ran downstairs after talking to me and another employee and I got called downstairs only to be fired because they “didn’t think I was happy” pathetic. Made you stay past closing hours to clean the whole store in the mall which is 2 floors with only 10-15 people. Would be putting items back for almost 2 hours before anyone could go home. Towne east mall
bad,JCPenney was an alright job. It’s a basic retail work experience and with that I can’t and won’t complain. You’ll have to work holidays and weekends obviously which isn’t too bad if you know what you’re signing up for.
bad,Mangment all they care was about having there associates get customers to open up credit cards for customers. It comes to a point where you can’t even enjoy your job cause they stress you out from beginning shift to end . Very unhealthy work environment. If you do good in credit they will complain that you are not getting enough surveys. They make co worker turn against each other cause it all a  competition .
bad,"I was a seasonal associate I had no idea if they planned on keeping me, not only that but I worked as hard as I could being pregnant and new to the area. I was promised a chance at being a full time associate and none of the managers gave me any heads up as to wether I was going to be a full on hire, it would have been nice to have some type of heads up so I could be looking for a job in order to pay my bills . The employees were awesome and sweet but the management sucked now im out of a job and don't know if ill be able to find one in time"
bad,"Too many things to get done, because of lack of planning"
bad,"I worked at JCPenney for one and a half years, and did not receive even a portion of the respect I would have expected from a company of this size. I honestly loved my job but I felt like the training was lacking and my supervisor was a monster. Whenever mistakes were made the supervisor would call the whole team to look at the mistake and tell us that if we continued to make mistakes she would send us all home because she could do the job better herself. The district managers were kind and seemed fair, but the store mangers would get so overwhelmed when a visit was approaching that the work load would get crazy and nobody ever could get done all that was expected of us."
bad,"There is no negotiation on work hours. The management team is horrible when it comes to talking to team members. They expect you to work EVERY possible hour you can. The only good thing about the job is discount, but the clothes is already cheap."
bad,"After working for 2 years in this company, you do too much for what you get paid. Managers would pull me aside and make me help them with projects all the time. Even stocking the floor with multiple carts of merchandise when im scheduled to be cashiering not even on the morning stocking team. I didn’t get any raises/benefits for literally doing their job for them and still get paid the minimum for working there for 2 years. Even new hires get paid more than I did which was unfair, 8.50 for constantly doing managers responsibilities for them was not cutting it. Also the floor was always over stocked and unorganized, customers always expect coupons from this company and when there isn’t they start arguments or don’t shop at all. The only good things we’re the people you work with and the 25% off discount you get off merchandise."
bad,"Penney's was great for the first 8 years of my career there.  Many opportunities for advancement and exposed to great management that cared about my career.  Last 2 years was filled with high stress due to a very poor, demeaning, volatile manager. Only well after I left, did they do something about this manager."
bad,It’s wasnt always fun working at JCP. Management never did what they were suppose to. They made you work extra hard for little pay and couldn’t grow within the company.
bad,"A typical day at JCPenney included reaching the credit application limit, recovering the store, and providing customer service. "
bad,"slow passed, lack of management and no advancement outside of salon. Good product and skills training programs though great to learn new techniques and products"
bad,"Management was a little tough to get along with, seeing favoritism when it came to providing schedules and hours a week. Felt like my work was underappreciated and although I volunteered to work in various departments and various hours, I was rarely offered any opportunities. I do not recommend JCPenney, especially if you need a job to pay your bills,"
bad,JC Penney is never consistant with the working condition of their employees. There is too much favortism and back stabbing. They expect us to get all our work done but dont give us the hours to do it in
bad,Average work day began with uncertain work. Management was scattered. The store only ran decent when higher ups would visit. Managers and employees both have left due to the stressful environment.
bad,JCPenney ran its stores like it was going to close down back in 2014. I wouldn't recommend jumping onto that train 4 years later when they're still likely doing as bad.
bad,"No pay, never let you off on days needed, and management was poor. They only allow you short breaks, and they either over work you or under work you., never inbetween."
bad,I had to watch my back. It was a hostile work environment. It was competitive and that caused friction between  employees. It was not an enjoyable experience.
bad,"I have learned as to what not to do and what to do.  Managers need to take the time to sincerely understand the needs of their managers and employees and how they can best serve them.  If the leaders don't have time to connect with the care about their people, how can they expect their people to care about their work?  There is no blame; it is about employees, managers and the company taking responsibility for their role in employee performance.  When everyone can forget the ""we"" vs ""them"" mindset, the true potential of not one of the individuals, but of the entire organization can be realized.  Work is more enjoyable and the company would be more successful."
bad,"I did enjoy the job on the days when I didn't have to deal with nasty customers who couldn't get discounts on everything and the assistant manager looking to tell me I was doing something wrong every day. I went into my job on a Saturday in January my manager told me there would be less hours and I was like ok then after my shift was over she told me since there would be fewer hours in the winter months she would be laying me off until March. Then March comes and no one contacts me. I didn't even get proper training or get to do the photography part of my job. People that started working at the same time as me and later got to learn the photography portion. At my interview, the manager was really interested in my photography experience. Don't bother working at this location."
bad,"The pay rate is terrible compared to similar employers. There is no difference between how the good workers, and bad workers are treated. There’s also a lot of favoritism, and seemingly no room for growth. There are a lot of great employees who work there, but they don’t get the treatment they deserve."
bad,I did in-home window treatment and draperies.  It seems like this position is being replaced with a contracting company. The corporation seems to be in a transitional phase.  The work culture is relaxed and is normally pleasant.
bad,"great place to make friends. great job for a high school or college student. there isn't much room for advancement, not a place you want to make into a career."
bad,JCpenny although is very relaxed the managers are not really there to help their employees. You are pretty much on your own and kind of have to figure how to do things on your own. All the job cares for is how many credit cards you sell for their company.
bad,"Good luck holding this job if you get sick. Basically is like school where you need to give warning if you cannot be there for your shift, they like 24 hours notice (but sometimes that isn't possible). Then when you go back you need a medical note to not have the attendance held against you. It's bad pay for bad hours for dealing with really bad people employee wise and customer wise. Sometimes you are the only person in your department who works, especially since most of the managers do not care about anything else you do besides credit apps. The only pro is the employee discount from what I remember 15% off. The only time that would be handy to work here is the holidays, especially black friday. You get paid really well and you can place things on hold then for the deals quite early and leave it for a bit."
bad,"I loved working at JcPenney, I've been with them for almost 3 years or 4. At first, I felt it was a great environment, I've made great friends and the pay was ok. However, with the time came, the hours started to decrease because we had too many hires and the management was getting more poor every time. So I decided to look for other ventures where I can give all of my hard work and feel I'm getting the right share of pay instead of overworking myself for low pay."
bad,"It was my first job and I wasn't sure what to expect. However, I hated it here and I felt very left out the whole time I was there. Management never helped clean after hours they would sit in the back until we were done. Some of them were very rude also. I quit without having a secure second job due to me being so uncomfortable."
bad,"Get anything you are promised in writing. They will make promises but definitely not deliver. The GM is not really in charge, his right hand people run the show. He doesn't have a clue what's going on."
bad,Managers hassle associates to meet daily and weekly credit application goals. Constant screaming over the radio about asking the customers to apply for the credit card.
bad,"Company has been in decline for several years now as traditional retail has been struggling with the new on-line ecom retail world and dying mall shopping experiences.  "
bad,They are more about the bottom line these days. They don't care about their associates. These days they hire people for part time so they don't have to pay benefits. They hire people who really are there for the paycheck. They don't keep coverage so the customers want to shop. They cut hours of the full timers and hire more part timers at less pay.
bad,"I love working here, all of my co-workers are amazing but I am moving out and need more hours/better pay. The co-workers made the job enjoyable and so do a lot of my customers."
bad,I was working at two places at once so it was truly not a big deal to me that it did not offer much due to aside from working in 2 jobs I was also a student.
bad,"A Typical day was fraught with abuse from both customers and managers with a chip on their shoulders. Your estimated value as an employee must be something close to zero, as the turnover rate was exceedingly high"
bad,"I was promised full time,  medical, dental and vision, I was promised a minimum of 37 hours per week. "
bad,Associates should not have to be intimidated by any management. Workdays are stressfull and associates should not feel they are being picked on by others...smh
bad,it was a stressful job/position but like with most things im able to take a deep breath and do my job. there was always 2 things to do at once but if the job calls for it you have to do it.
bad,"I was a hard worker and They liked me but overall management was poor, very bad benefits, a lot of hours lack of new hire,they dont care about you. Left good though"
bad,very stressful and takes up the majority of your time. The hours of operations changes depending on the time of the year. So during the holiday season expect to not get any time to spend with your family.
bad,Management at JCPenney was very poor. When i worked there I was not going to quit. I tried to get in contact with my manager and take a short leave so I could concentrate on my finals. She was never available so I quit.
bad,"I enjoyed working there it was a good way to get experience dealing with unhappy customers.  Very balanced, very fast paced at time and slower at others!"
bad,"This is a great job for a teenager and getting to know what the word responsibility really means. Handling money, seeing exactly the actions you do has equal or opposite reactions and teaches you exactly what customer service really means all with a smile on your face."
bad,"Management was all over the place. When you needed help, no one was ever found. Corners were cut all the time, things were unorganized and associates were treated unfairly for the most part. Favorites were picked all the time."
bad,"They bring in inexperienced management."
bad,Not enough hours to go around with low pay. Weren't enough supervisors for a department store and the ones who were there never paid attention to employees.
bad,If you need extra money for the holidays or while your going to school this is a great place to work.  Do not expect a lot of hours.  Part time is only available for most people.
bad,"the store manager is very cold-hearted. doesn't care about deaths or illness. cant have a second job and tell her.. she will try to make you choose between the two. very narcissistic and sarcastic, not caring at all."
bad,the paced was to fast didn't get taught how to answer calls or transfer calls or how to order things from other stores online for customers. very difficult and uptight workplace
bad,"I was fresh out of the military.  I did everything that was asked and handled each job to the best of my ability.  I was the only employee that worked receiving, stocking and pricing positions.  My pay increase was a joke.  I, of course, sent in a response to my evaluation with what the company lacked in my review.  I got no response.  The company takes advantage of hard workers and appears to remove them vice keep them.  The environment was not one that I looked forward to everyday."
bad,The culture is very cutthroat and is run like a high school popularity contest. The store managers do not hold associates accountable for their actions and make it hard to uphold any disciplinary actions for poor attendance. They tend to favor employees who they know will make a scene when they don't get their way and do not protect their employees who consistently do the right thing. As the HR supervisor this made it hard to comply with company standards.
bad,I liked working the cash register and helping customers.The hours use to vary.It was all different hours i worked.Sometimes i would work in the morning and sometimes at night.
bad,"Barely above minimum wage, you only get hours when you make all the credit applications, and management won't fix the people that are causing the place to go downhill (store wise) because they're too ""busy""."
bad,"This company turned its back on its employees, customers and core values.  They will never recover and I would not recommend considering this a long term position.  I personally witnessed, not only ethical problems here but harassment and retaliatory  practices as well.  I did give them high marks for their benefits because when I was there PTO was grandfathered in, so if you'd been in the industry for 10 years, you wouldn't start with no PTO.  However, the medical was amazing when I started, but by the time I left we only had catastrophic insurance, so if you didn't have cancer or something, you really weren't covered.  They actually charged my boss an extra $50/month until he lost 30lbs.  and if you refused to get a physical, they'd charge you an additional $200/month until you did.  You could not pay me enough to go back there."
bad,"While I worked there I was constantly being watched by a manager, as if they didn't trust anything I did. I wasn't allowed any freedom to work without supervision which made for an overall bad work environment."
bad,"Was fun until new CEO/management came in to play.  Now it is all about signing up people with credit cards.  It's like a car dealership.  Even if people DON'T want one, or SHOULDN'T have one, you need to sign them up.  No longer about customer service.  You can get all the good reviews from customers, but if you don't sign people up, you're in the dog house."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend, very slow and not much to do. Management is not great and try to take their job too seriously but actually don't even do anything. Look for anything else"
bad,The amount of pay was terrible and everything was poorly orchestrated among different areas within the career. Customers were constantly mad due to poor management.
bad,"My day started off with customer returns, spent a lot of time merchandising, putting in orders online for customers, may put some outfits together. Management wouldn't want to help out with certain duties because it was too much to do, they would care more about sales and numbers more than their employees, there was almost little to no encouragement until we got new managers. We would spend hours on the registers during the weekends and spend about 1-3 hours cleaning up after the store closed for the day. They are big on selling their customers credit cards and rewards cards. The dress code is business casual, jeans and tennis shoes were not allowed at all."
bad,"incentive were bad, unprofessional. It was a while ago, And the staff wasn't very helpful. I really don't what else to say of it, I was not there long"
bad,"Not sure why this is required but we where too many hats there, I mean it;s a cool laid back job very easy but the management and the pay sucks, with no experience required they hired a lot of people who have not had the experience of dealing with customers that are very angry all the time."
bad,"Honestly, if you love retail it's a great company with great discounts. The store I worked in however, was just a overall horrible environment to work in. New management came in this year and I can honestly say, I would love to work here again, but never with the management they have now. They only look out for themselves and they never listen to what associates have to say. They give horrible raises, if any at all, and it's so hard to grow because it's all about favoritism. The store is so understaffed, and a mess everywhere you look. If you decide to work in this store, you're in for a crazy ride."
bad,I feel management does not know what they are doing. Communication here is not there you get told one thing by one person and something different from another person.
bad,"Even though I always worked hard and showed a lot of dedication, I was never appreciated. I felt like a number and not like a person. I was grateful to be employed and that's what kept me there for so long."
bad,"The work environment is not LGBTQ friendly and isn't progressive in any manner.  They do not accommodate additional special needs of the employees, and they had sporadic organizational skills."
bad,I got hired as seasonal help and worked hard to try to get a job after the season ended even learning cashier to help my chances friendly co workers and fun to be around
bad,"Company has been in a turnaround for several years.  Teams are great at executing vision but come with great personal sacrifice.  Many jobs being sent to India and company is constantly laying off associates.  Corporate office is in midst of being updated and everyone moving to an open environment which can be challenging to get work completed."
bad,Management was very lask. At lot of bickering amongest the associates in the catalog department over insignificant things. most enjoyable part is interacting with the customers.
bad,"not the best place to work if you want a stress free environment, but colleges are nice and welcoming. there are few opportunities for advancement. sephora rewards their associates for working there by giving them free products"
bad,Typical day is loading 3 to 5 trucks a day work hard to get the job done. I learned team work is key. Management is hard to say they moved them around a lot. Getting the job done on time and do right. The hardest part is having to unload a truck to put on a pallet that was not on the line. Most enjoyable is the people you get to work with and know
bad,"My time at JCPenney was eventful and our managers struggled with organization, communication, and scheduling their workers. Our discounts were great and I felt like 90% of the workers there worked there only for the discount."
bad,"Not only do the people that work there slack and not do anything, the managers take advantage of the people that do. There are people that will get more money than you but do less work. And if you think you'll get full time or benefits? Good luck with that, it rarely ever happens. It's a high school in there with the associates since everyone is so young and the customers treat the associates terrible too. It's just a mess. The only plus is you get to hide and not do your job as long as you don't get caught and even if you do they never fire, they just cut your hours and become even worse with you."
bad,"This employer had more unhappy employees (managers and subordinates) than any place I have worked.  One day a department manager saw the look on an employee's face and said, ""I know, I know.""  The Saturday morning meetings basically informed us of how unhappy upper management was.  One example was blaming salespeople for not being able to catch thieves when the store had detectives.  This was difficult when your base salary was $3.00 per hour plus commission.  I was hired to sell Men's clothing but my eventual goal was to get into the Management Training program.  It didn't materialize before I received another offer to become a department manager."
bad,"The company does not have a great vision burning through revenue without a forward thinking strategy.  Just laid off over 6,000 employees after creating hundreds of jobs.  Instead of fixing apparel business for what the company is known for, they are more concerned about selling HVAC, Major Appliances and Flooring.  The JCP identity is looking more and more like Sears."
bad,Jcpenney was a cool place to work just lots of managers that are very rude but the customers were very nice to me all the time. I have worked there for 3 years and still had not moved up .
bad,"Company wide it's a frustrating place. IE simply to try and promptly communicate. No support for the appliance supervisors. They have this wonderful thing to go and create a 2 way communication except 99.9% of the time the answer people don't have a clue. Part of running the dept is you will have to ring out customers from other dept's (kids) while you are trying to wait on your own customers all the while you and the people you supervise have metrics to hit. Or you will have your registers taken over from people coming over because in their dept the registers are broke again. The appliance dept's have had brand new printers the company cannot get to print 7 months after grand opening. Need to print appliance specs for a customer, here is an embarrassing nope... "
bad,Took this job as a way to make extra money. I enjoyed the customer service aspect of the job. We sold furniture that were prior displays at stores so we let customers brown around and assist with any of their questions they had and completed the sale of their item(s).
bad,"This company is trying to make a comeback from almost going out of business. They will spread you thin and don't care when customers complain and berate you for the long lines and no staff on sales floor. But also expect the sales floor to be organized and all go backs put away with little to no staff working. As a department supervisor there is no support from upper management. I was told several times.... We don't have the budget, just make it work. Sometimes part timers only get one day a week 4hr shifts. But are expected to come in asap when called in. 2 week schedule frequently changed last minute. Management is very inconsistent with correctives leaving terrible employees on payroll. Some managers you will never see because they are always in office."
bad,"When I first stared working, I was offered little traning. I was told the basics, and then left to go do whatever. I never learned how to ring the registers, simply because nobody ever taught me. I would tell them I didn't know, but never got trained."
bad,"They never have enough people working, customers get angry with you cause the line is very long. Managers not helpful, if you ask them a question they blow you off, or they will ignore you."
bad,A typical day at work would be cleaning and making the store look nice. The hardest part of the job would be keeping up to the managers standard .
bad,"The best part about JCPenney is the people you work with, as well as the learning opportunities available. The hardest part of the job is that overall, most people have a poor work/life balance and the workload is very rough. Many of the systems that JCPenney uses are out-dated, which makes it challenging to complete projects/reports in a timely manner."
bad,"No opportunity for grow in the company."
bad,"Permanent employees tend to look at seasonal workers as some sort of rash that in time they wont have to deal with, but until then they certainly aren't going to be made feel welcome."
bad,Didn't really like the managers.  Very little hours. Co-workers were alright. A day could very from busy or dead.  Overall not very enjoyable.
bad,"I learned how to better my customer service skills, learn how to handle customer problems and fix the problems to the best of my abilities and I bettered my multi-tasking skills."
bad,Most of the employees at JCPenney are awesome. Some upper level management need to be trained in keeping up employee moral. I really enjoy working with people and helping them solve a problem or get what they need.
bad,The company is horrible. I worked in the salon. The salon is super out dated and dirty. They do not provide good customer service and they never had the products to do peoples hair. I lost business and money because of the company.
bad,As much hard work you do as a sales associate you will never be recognized. I worked there about 3 years and I think I wasn't getting paid enough.
bad,"I have worked there for many years... for half of my college career and high school. I am really upset on how immature managers could be and how favoritism exists here. I will not recommend this job to anyone. I have done so much for this company and never got yearly raises whatsoever. I don't have children or married but they choose to pay them higher wages to those people than someone who have degrees. I have stuck with this company for history purposes and flexible hours for college. If you want to get paid less for doing a job of 10 be my guest and work for this company who don't respect individuals who want a higher education, or not have children."
bad,"My day started at about 6 am and would get merchandise prepped and ready for putting to floor, with set sale planners. I would also help customers, cashier an markdown mrchandise when needed. "
bad,Fun place to work but management was not very good. They make promises to get you in the door and pretend like your in a family more than a business. The most enjoyable part was getting to go home.
bad,"Penny's was my first job out of school, and was a great stepping stone in my career. Although I have been in my profession for about 15 years, had to start over being in a new state."
bad,It is a good place to work but the management is not what it used to be a couple of years ago. Everyone that works there is pleasant to be around.
bad,This was a job that I learned a lot on but mainly learned what I good and bad manager is. The manager over the store location did a really poor job being the man in charge.
bad,"Flexible with work and school life perfect for current college students as a part time job. Although hours are bad at times, its retail that tends to happen, management could be alot more productive."
bad,I only stayed for 3 months folding clothes. I couldn't stand management and how they treated both their employees and their customers. Also couldn't keep folding clothes endlessly to no end.
bad,Want to be led and hope to move from floor associate to leadership position wont happen but I did love the associates we were a real true family but mgmt. gets an F+ rating(this is the Savannah store this applies to)
bad,"The last three years of working there were the worst years ever. The atmosphere changed drastically when they changed store managers. Wanted associates to perform above and beyond and yet there was no appreciation of the hard work. The advancement of associates was minuscule and illogical, believed the store managers choose people he liked and not looked at their work ethics. It used to feel like a family but it quickly grew into something else undesirable."
bad,I disliked working for JCP because they would work me like a dog and then yell at me because I could not get everything done. Our team was constantly give too large of a work load and then looked down upon when we could not handle it all and finish everything. I loved my co-workers and my manager they were really great and we all had a great time getting things done as a team. I learned to be weary of retail because they don't care if you have children or lives or school to worry about all they care about is the work.
bad,"A typical work day would be doing any of the visuals that has come up. Helping with the signing, price changes, rtvs and if there is a truck busting and running the carts."
bad,"My experience at Jcpenney was not a good one. I was hired right before Chrstmas in 2001, and finally quit in March of 2015. after four years of working there and being a hardworking employee i only got two raises. One, because policies had changed and they were beginning to hire people for more than I already made; and the second because after five years the company finally decided to give raises again. It was a whopping $.23. They will hire anyone who can at least dress themselves in the morning and are too lenient on policies so those who deserve to be fired are not and the hard workers must take the hit for it. On top of the extremely small wage the hours you get per week are not great either. Understandably throughout the holiday season they are better but for most of the year you are luck to average 20 hours a week."
bad,I didn't like the coworkers.  Breaks were short. The worst part of working there was working black Friday 4pm-4am.  The hardest part was the mean managers.  Sometimes the rude customers were easier to deal with!
bad,"This company is a terrible place to work. Lack of upper management, absolute ZERO communication, the store manager is the most unappreciative person I've ever met in my life. "
bad,"A typical day consists of opening registers, diamond count, merchandise layout / setup, and then helping customers. Things you can learn are repair of jewelry and knowledge of fine jewelry. Management was lacking leadership fundamentals and was not responsive to employee recommendations. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with management and the best part of the job was the enjoyment of helping customers."
bad,"The management did not know what they were doing and they continued to hire management who did not know what they were doing. They did not value their employees. They were not flexible with schedules. I think other store may be better but the Elkhart, Indiana stores was awful."
bad,"The Jcpenney that I work at is like a play ground. Nobody takes the job serious and management finds ways to make their job easier by making their associates do their work. They give the associates a ""manager"" title without the official title and pay. The only qualification to be a manager there is asking which then leads to inexperience and incompetent management."
bad,"This company used to be fun and enjoyable to work for. Now you come into work and you have to be worried about losing more hours so they can stay under budget or being yelled because what you did wasn't good enough. This is the first year for appraisals and management was told not to give any employees ""meets expectations"" because everyone can do better therefore, nobody will get a raise. The co-workers (what is left of them) are the most enjoyable. Many good workers have left due to this tyranny and cutting of hours."
bad,"Management is too messy and prejudice. a day consist of helping customers with purchases, obtaining credit applications, and helping co-workers."
bad,"Retail environment not good for working parents."
bad,I've done almost everything with this company from putting merchandise out onto the floor from restocking the stock rooms to doing mark downs and price changes. Also I've helped with technical things as well.
bad,"I would commute an hour to be at work on time everyday at 5am. I would gather with the other two people on the visual team and we would communicate which tasks to accomplish first, rather it be with visuals on mannequins, displays or signage. Management was rarely available meaning one had to be very independent and responsible. The commute was the hardest part of the job, other than that it was worth while."
bad,Helped reset floor plans and keep neat and organized. I learned how to do window treatments. My management was not helpful and never talked to me much..I had to figure things out on my own.  My co-workers were great. The hardest part was meeting on line orders quota daily. The best part was the products.
bad,"customers coming in all day to borrow money until payday, I have to verify employment and banking accounts and then tell them what they are approved for."
bad,"Little or no training is provided for Legal Dept. Home Office positions; new hires are expected to learn the systems on the job and are highly criticized for not being familiar with and/or quickly assimilating the ever-changing and often non-functional on-line programs. "
bad,"A typical day on the replenishment team starts by unpacking the shipment. This usually takes a couple of hours, but can vary depending on the size of the shipment. While unpacking, the replenishment associates sort the new merchandise onto carts and rolling racks. Once everything is unpacked, merchandise is brought to the floor to be placed on shelves and racks. I've learned how to operate a baler, a trash compactor, and a pallet jack. I've also learned a lot about working as a team to accomplish goals in a timely manner. Management, at least the upper portions of it, has been very snotty and unreasonable. The various equipment we use on our job is stored in different places on the four levels of our store. When we need it, it frequently is not there, because whoever used it last did not return it. Our team is constantly scolded for taking longer to gather our equipment and management does not understand that sometimes one can check three or four places before finding what is needed in the wrong place. The co-workers are the best I've ever had. They genuinely care about me as a person and we have grown very tight as a group over the last couple of years. The hardest part of the job is working with the management. None of our duties are particularly hard. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with an exceptional team."
bad,Don't value their employees or customers. Are all about image and money
bad,"When I come in to clock in there is never a list of what my task is or what am I going to be working. I work with the trucking team in the morning and some days the manager tells us the truck comes on Tuesday, they cancel the truck every single Tuesday. Most managers didn't know what to tell me or what to do. I sometimes wonder why am i schedule on Tuesday. Also their are times when a manager is not there and didn't leave a task sheet. Then change the plans and never explain to the employees."
bad,"Little work life balance.  With all the changes the company has faced, there is very little stability."
bad,"A typical day at work consist of assisting customers with finding what they are looking for. Sometimes even helping them finding something when they are not looking. Throughout my time with this company I have had a chance to improve my communication skills by far.  The hardest part of my job at the beginning was not voicing when things did not seem correct of fair. Many people on the job went to each other when things were not right which caused more problems. While I went to managers which always resulted in problems being fixed in a professional manor. "
bad,"JC Penney salon is fine if you have an established clientelle, Otherwise it is terrible. The commission scale is skewed to punish part time workers, while their productivity expectations punish full time workers. On the plus side, my co workers are fabulous. Very talented and caring stylists are working there."
bad,If i had a chance i would work for this company again i would because of the people.
bad,"Management was poorly run, overall it was not the most productive environment."
bad,"A typical day at work included straightening, assisting customers, and cashier. I learned how to use an iPod as a mobile register. Management wasn't all too bad, but mostly terrible. They treated employees unfairly with favoritism and talking down. There was a lot of drama between employees, as well as management. The hardest part of the job was dealing with crooked management and having to pick up the slack for other employees that didn't do their job. The most enjoyable part of the job was having an employee discount."
bad,"i loved working there, but they started changing everything. and they dont care to really show you how everything is done until you mess up. and there is alot of favoritism that goes on. I know me and this one girl started at the same time, and we did the same work. and she got employees of the month, and she was given more task and got more money. and they don't hide the fact that they like other people. its to much work and not enough hours and money."
bad,"Minimum wage, condescending management, and immature coworkers. Unless your sixteen and this is your first job, this is beneath you."
bad,want a job that is fun in short term work? LP is for you. want Job security and great people to work with? LP and JC Penney are not for you.
bad,This is a good place to work for someone new to the workforce. In fairness I joined JC Penney at the onset of the Ron Johnson debacle and have had to endure a time of tremendously painful change for JCP. JC Penney unfortunately has a stifling culture and an almost blinding focus on operational rather than organizational leadership which could explain why tenured supervisors are generally unhappy.
bad,"keeps busy at times, not a bad place to work, customers are the most enjoyable part of the job, etc."
bad,"In the short time I worked at JcPenney, I learned how to work with customers over the phone. I did a lot of catalog orders through out my work day which allowed me to build a personal relationship with customers."
bad,"It was a fun place to work, I fit the customers in glasses, took appointments, answered phones."
bad,"This place does not value its good workers. The raises are terrible, if you get one. Management is a joke. Benefits are terrible."
bad,"J C Penney used to be a very pleasant place to work. The departments were well-staffed and we were able so serve the customers better. Each employee had a task to do whether it was assisting customers on the sales floor or getting new stock put out in a timely fashion. Also, the store had a reputation for selling good quality merchandise at reasonable prices."
bad,Benefits are so bad that more and more employees are electing for private health care.
bad,"JCPenney has really cut back on their help over the yrs, just this yr. alone we lost 4 supervisors and 2 managers. However, the same expectations are demanded."
bad,This was an easy company to work they were willing to work with my school schedule. The management changed over a few times while I was there. There is a very high turnover. You will not make a alot of money here.
bad,"Fun place, management was ok, i love helping customers, and meeting new people just wish the pay rate was better with benefits with better work hours"
bad,"Nice store , good prices, fun enviroment. a very clean store."
bad,"I cashiered, and assisted with keeping the Women’s Department floor in an orderly fashion. I was responsible for obtaining credit applications, at least (2) per week, as well as catalog referrals, and for providing great Customer Service with a friendly shopping environment for the customers. I also have (3) years of working a cash register and handling money."
bad,This was my first job and the discount on clothes was great while i was in high school. The coworkers were generally fun to work with and the management was almost non existant.
bad,"JC Penney is a corporation that values what their cusromers want. They provide training for associates, that helps to get a better insight of what customers want and expect."
bad,Didn't Really Work there long enough to review them i was only a holiday help for two months but it was ok meet some cool co works that became my friends
bad,"Coworkers don't enjoy working as a team. There was a lot of competing for comission, when the comission wasn't that much anyways. Customers really don't want to hear the ""He's my customer!"" bickering. Customers would rather enjoy looking for themselves and they will ask for your assistance if they need you. That's when sales associates should be more than happy to assist. Too much sale associate drama for me."
bad,Only fair. I discovered that I don't thrive in a corporate owned company. Corporate retail is not interested in an individual's creative contribution.
bad,A salon atmosphere I went to work daily and helped clients with an enjoyable experience. I leraned that work doesn't come easy you have to work hard to earn everything you have.My co-workers were amazing and enjoyable to be around.
bad,This job was a seasonal job that allowed me to come in a work as associate for holidays.
bad,I felt under valued as an employee. I also felt like if i was of another race i would have had better hours and schedule.
bad,"There were so much favoritism with in the company, and everytime there was a problem the favorited was back up. I would work day in and day out for the company and never got a pat on the back. People who were lazy and didnt do anything got their feet kissed as they walked on the ground."
bad,"Its a good job if you're in high school and need extra cash but other than that it's not great. You don't get recognized for hard work, raises are never given, there is no chance at promotions and other than the holiday season, the work is extremely boring and useless. Employees are nice but not a great company to work for."
bad,They wont be in busy much longer. Not enough hours to make a living to support a family. I did meet a lot of nice people and holidays where always busy
bad,Management is horrible. And if you have an issue don’t call corprate because they are useless as well. They will work you like a slave and if you don’t open enough credit apps or make the company enough money they will it  your hours.
bad,"The company does not pay enough for a livable wage, but asks a lot from you. Do not expect a raise or any kind of positive recognition for providing customer satisfaction or going above and beyond in the work place such as consistently covering others shifts or working ridiculous hours. The only things that get noticed are the smallest mistakes anyone can make (which you will be reprimanded for in front of customers/clients as well as co-workers)."
bad,First of all the managers there are very childish and are not leaders at all. And never does there job. They will fire you with out purposes and will talk about there associates there. They don’t want you to have the spot light and won’t even allow the associates to communicate it’s no team effort there with the managers. Also Will not work with you availability. They associates on the other hand our just loving and warm hearted i made a lot ago good friends there .
bad,"Every store is different. One store can be amazing, and another store can be career-ending. All is based on management. Even if you are IN management. You can be the best manager you can be, but if others are above you and are into the “politics” then you have nothing that will help you through and get you where you want to be. It will be the end of your career. Even with Powerline in place. This was my goal. To end up as a Gm but one store ruined it all for me."
bad,this company is the use and abuse type. they will exploit your helping nature or ability to adapt and never follow through with promotions or advancements
bad,"I will simply say that this job has been incredibly hard for me, as someone who left a better-paying job to ease my state of mind, only to find that JCPenney does not value their employees the way they should. Perhaps it is just my experience but I have never worked for such a careless company, unwilling to fire employees who refuse to do their jobs or who are verbally abusive. Managers give little thought to training, pairing new associates with veterans who don't take the time to train properly or are simply resentful. Please, if you ever work here, voice your opinions and don't be afraid to be chipper even if you work early a.m shifts, because the biggest issue with my team is morale, because we do work such an early shift. We are usually clocked off by the time the store opens at 10 or 11."
bad,It was a little slower than what I was use to and it wasn't worth traveling so far and not have sufficient clients.I did enjoy watching what other stylist created.
bad,Company overall was grwat like most places the GM's make up the personality of a store and district manager of it's managers.  Well in our are a very bad district manager made it bad for all around him.  Very poor people Skills needed to be in setting minus human contact.
bad,It look like it's trying to be a e-commerce but not quite there need better managementat the Black Friday and Cyber Monday a lot of employees with stating that will probably get something home within 4 hours so I'm looking for something else
bad,"The company is barely holding on. The turnover rate is extremely high and it shows, Management has little to no patience for new workers, because they know someone else will fill their place."
bad,Working for JCPenney for the two years I was employed there was an eye-opener. This is not the company I grew up shopping at. The status of the company is in a very slow turn around that will not work unless they start investing in their employees. That starts with adequate training as well as livable wages. Benefits can come later so long as the employees don't have to work two jobs just to survive.
bad,The hours are not enough to depend on  not everyone follows the rules not everyone works the most important thing is credit applications  those who work hard are never recognized those that have been there forever do nothing but stand around and talk new hires often get paid more your punishment for taking time off is no hours
bad,I enjoyed my experience wit the company I wish I could’ve stayed longer and learned more overall it was a good job just wasn’t for me but it could be for someone else
bad,Learned the beginnings of what it was to work at a call-center.  The workplace culture for Sales was very intense.  The furniture sales side was better if you could get it - bigger sales and commissions. Many people push for those jobs.
bad,"Very competitive environment. Managers and supervisors always try to find shortcuts or a scapegoat for mistakes. If you're a good worker stay away, you will be the carrier of all the slack and get a 10 cent raise..."
bad,They did not care about the employee. The schedule was not good. One week 27 hours and the next it could be 8 hours. The managers did not want to be bothered with you.
bad,The central manager always stays in her office and is never out on the floor and the assistant managers do the majority of the work on the floor that the manager should be doing. Some of the sales associates talk bad about other associates behind their backs for no reason. Some associates are forced to work in sections such as jewelry or curtains/mattresses with no training and don’t receive the training necessary.
bad,"Long hours, only closed on Christmas. It used to be a fun place. But at some point the numbers took value over the quality of associates. Team turned into every man for himself."
bad,"I miss the golden rule. When this company stood for what was right..."
bad,"The compensation does not equal the amount of work that you put in. The managers are two faced and talked about you behind your back. When i worked here, one of the managers went around telling people i put in my two weeks when i never did, I never even talked about doing that. That manager constantly spread lies about the other employees as well"
bad,"My manager was horrible, but I didn’t hate the job. I just didn’t get as many hours as I would have liked. I wish my manager would not have micromanaged or I would still be there today."
bad,JCPenny was a fast paced Holiday job. The pay was only minimum wage. I feel for the amount of work that was to be done the employee’s should have been compensated more.
bad,"Customer service is very important in any company that you work in whether it’s fast foods, clothing stores and grocery stores. Customer service keeps a business running without the customer stores wouldn’t make money. Making people feel comfortable by always acknowledging them and by letting them know that we are here to take care of them."
bad,"There's no proper training. They may teach you the basics but ultimately end up pairing you with a ""buddy"" (who's just another associate, not a manager) who has to teach you everything they know.  Management tends to ignore you. They only like to pretend they have a good relationship with associates whenever corporate comes over.  Associates are told day and night to push the credit card. If your numbers are low, you're accused of not doing your job. In actuality, no one wants the card."
bad,Good place to work if your only working to get out of the house. If you need the job to take care of your household then this probably isn't the place to work.
bad,I personally only works at JCPENNEY for 3 months and for the most part I did enjoy my time there I think the store manager at my location was what ruined the experience for me.
bad,Didn't enjoy working here. Management was not reliable nor did they work as a team or train employees properly. Made for frustrating working conditions. The job I was hired to do had so many tasks to accomplish that made it impossible to get things completed in a timely manner. Not enough knowledgeable or well trained employees scheduled to help customers so that was my top priority but yet I was criticized for doing so.
bad,My time at jc penny’s was not the best. They would cut labor and expect to rely on the managers assistants and floor managers to do everything. They pressure you to push their credit card. They had questionable practices when it came to asking people to sign up for the credit card.
bad,Lack of job security do to slowing business.  Asset Protection seems to be an area that JCP will reduce support to save revenue.  Although it is good experience for a new Asset Protection Manager.
bad,Really enjoyed working there at first but then I see that they don’t keep their word when it comes to hours or schedules or pay. Company is in trouble and my location has many days when there are hardly any customers in the store. Not much inventory to offer. Hard to  compete with Target and Kohl’s. No loyalty to hard workers. Management is uninterested. Company is losing many good workers.
bad,I love my coworkers. Generally speaking it's not a bad job or place to work. The company's financial situation does not help with feeling like my job is safe though.
bad,Wasn't a very good job for the amount they were paying. I only worked there a few months but I did not really enjoy my time there. The managers were too strict unnecessarily and had me performing numerous tasks outside of my field due to lack of staff.
bad,They don’t pay you enough for the work that they ask you to do. Especially not enough for the very rude customers that you will often get. Cheap with “raises”
bad,management could use a lesson in understanding and treat employees more like people and not sheep customers were quiet nice and understanding most days one benefit is holiday pay
bad,"A typical day at work as a front line cashier at JCPenney consists of:"
bad,I worked for this company previously and found out that they really already pick the people that they want to advance and hinder those that they are determined to not to even consider to advance within the company.
bad,There is no work life balance when you are expected to work every weekend and close during holidays which means staying each to clean up and getting home at 1:30 am.
bad,"I appreciated the opportunity to work here, but I believe it wasn't the environment or place for me. I went to work day in and day out however there was never really any organization."
bad,I worked hard at JCPenney I did my job! But At the end of me working there I wasn’t movtivated to do anything. Because All I heard from my managers was do this but never A thank you. Never felt appreciate. But over it.  Beside managers Our LODS (leader on duty) they did most of the work. I liked them. And the other associates were nice too!
bad,"Unfair company, stressful but friendly employees. Lunches were free at times, typical days at work, I've learned a lot in the packing department. The hardest part of working at JCP Warehouse was packing by yourself and the most enjoyable part was having to get help and communicating with others."
bad,I went from a job that I was making a difference in the lives of youth and families. This job had me placing signs and tags on clothing. It was a boring environment and not much interaction with strengthening and helping people.
bad,I should have to write of a review of a place I work to apply at another job. I need to be able to just apply for another job so I can be with my family more.
bad,Not sure how much longer this retailer will be around - New CEO could change thigs - we'll have to wait and see.  Feel like the company is not targeting a younger customer to help carry them to future.
bad,"I was super excited to get a job at JcPenneys as cashier/sales associate. But the first day i realized once i got there they just throw you out there with little training on folding clothes, where clothes go in what department, cashering. Mind you i was in kids department that is never organized. Some of the coworkers were nice yet going through the same thing as i was. I left due to lack of training and lack of organization throughout the whole department."
bad,"It was ok. I feel there might have been a struggle to find the right personnel for the higher levels of corporate management. Some successful programs were abandoned, while less effective ones were used."
bad,"Ranging from the gossip to the stinky attitudes, the hair salon atmosphere was extremely unprofessional and degrading towards moral standards of the work environment."
bad,The cashier job is REALLY only about getting people to sign up for credit cards.  Nothing else gets monitored or communicated about to any degree.  Long time staff members are generally rude and unhelpful.  Esoecially if they sell a lot of credit card applications- then they can do whatever they want.   Managers are pleasant and hard working
bad,"I got really depressed and suicidal, so I was hospitalised for a week. Came back and was fine for a few months before I started getting suicidal again. I called in to work on my really bad days (couldn’t find people to cover usually because it just comes and goes and I didn’t have time to find someone to cover me,) and instead of being met with understanding, I was basically told that it doesn’t matter that I’m suicidal, I need to find someone to cover my shift or they’ll fire me next time."
bad,I was only seasonal work so I was only there two months.  Because of that I don't have a lot of information about the company.  I enjoyed the work but didn't get enough hours to even make seasonal work worth it.
bad,I love this job and don't really want to leave...but my hours has dropped to only 2 to 3 days a week I can't live on that.love everything about the job including all the people I work with I love being one the pricing team and everyone I work with....i just need stability and knowing that I can pay my bills when nessacery...i honestly believed I would retire from jc penny
bad,I went to work for company 😭😭 I like to work then that my first job I want to trying 😂 to see how are your doing in the company if they nice to work
bad,Guidelines are changed so often  that no one knows what they are. There are several managers on duty at all times and every time one walked by they would tell me to do something differently. No one knew what was going on.
bad,The working environment is not bad. The thing is the hours are scarce and the amount your paid is not worth it. Also the store that I'm working at didn't have a smooth transition of managers. Communication is unclear.
bad,"I worked at JCP for about 5 years. When I started, everything was good. For the last year of my employment and after, things slowly started to unravel. In recent visits, the store is a mess and short staffed."
bad,"It’s an okay job. It’s not the best. The place I worked at , they didn’t train you well enough so you pretty much learn everything on your own. You deal with nice and sometimes rude customers due to the price not ringing up correctly or simply because they didn’t read the signs. (Of course it’s life) Sometimes the managers take forever to come to the cashier register to override the price change ( when it’s not ringing up correctly and we can’t do it since we are just a cashier ) and the customers aren’t happy. They also don’t schedule enough people . Sometimes there’s only 3 or 2 people working throughout the whole floor during the day and sometimes towards closing shifts only 1 person is working on the floor. You pretty much do the same thing every day- cashiering or recovery or fitting rooms/ put backs nothing really different unless you are trained in jewelry. It’s still nice to get the sale associate experience."
bad,This company right now is good for part time work. I’ve been working for JCPenney and I haven’t got a raise in 8 years. I’ve been loaned in at the furniture department until my job ends on March 1st 2019. It was ok in the beginning but now with all the online shopping more retailers are losing their stores. I need to have a steady job.
bad,"Not much to say. Temporary job, wasn’t great but paid for what i needed it to during college. Boring, customers are often rude, I much preferred pricing on the sales floor to doing register."
bad,"I was a seasonal hire for this company, so I can't say much. But during my time there, hours were random each week, nothing was consistent. Pay wasn't consistent for each worker either."
bad,This was my first job and I did not like the fact the manager would not work on the weekends and then told everyone that everyone had to work on weekends when she never worked on the weekends. Because of the manager I lost a loved one when I got a call that my family member is in the hospital. The manager was not working she left a nasty voicemail but i still rebelled out and left. Unfortunately I lost my loved one and I quit.
bad,"My job was very fast paced and should have had at least two employees to handle the work load, but instead it  was only me. I enjoyed the people I worked with, I just felt as if my position required another person to maintain the large store."
bad,"Cashier, engage and help customers, clean and keep floor clean, customer service, offer promotions, help customer find what they needed, cash deposits,"
bad,The environment isn’t well and the management could care less about you. The only thing going for the company is its benefits. This company doesn’t care about their employees just only their sales.
bad,"Worked there for a bit. However, management is very strict on the employees, have gotten mad at them for making a mistake that could easily be a learning opportunity"
bad,"Performs processing activities, as assigned."
bad,"Friendly co-workers, flexible schedule and knowledgeable workers."
bad,Needs to have a better marketing system. Clients should have a 24 hour cancellation policy. Very low client retention due to high cost of services. Remodeling project took months to complete and hired immigrants to work on the job.
bad,"The Jcpenney I work at currently is one of the better stores. The management teams seem to be stuck on their high horses and don't see the things the employees are going through. It's retail, you can't expect much."
bad,no advancement no training low compensation managers not willing to listen great employees. understaffed. not enough hours offered overloaded with work.
bad,The Job can be very stressful with the demand of employees asking customers to apply for a credit card. The customers are also very impatient and the slow computer systems that require approval for small tasks add to the tense work environment. People are constantly quitting.
bad,"Customers and clientele can be absolutely unreasonable. The dress code keeps getting stricter under the new manager. The coworkers were all incredible, though."
bad,This is a OK place to work for. Its better when you work for the company and not through a staffing agency. Make sure to find the department that has the schedule that fits you.
bad,worked as a filler. worked floor. cash registers. stockroom. worked on the floor and worked as a filler completeing online orders to b e picked up. some times closed
bad,I was only a seasonal worker hired for Christmas holidays. It was a very flexible job that allow me to do my private sitting . The staff that i worked with was very friendly.
bad,we would come in and the team lead would assign everyone the calls they would have to make to verify the borrowers employment. once we got the work we would make the call.
bad,Very stressful. You would have to talk people into getting JCPenny's  credit cards. Upper management expected a lot for the amount you were paid. Never work there again.
bad,"This was a good first job, but I would never want to work there again. Too much drama, management didn't care when a 17 year old was doing drugs on the job. Told us to mind our own business and that was when I quit."
bad,"I was wrongfully fired by JCPenney after being with the company for 10 years with no complaints. The company chose a shoplifting criminal over a valued, dedicated and loyal employee; who could have sued the company but chose to move forward. I'd recommend it for part time work but not job security or advancement, The company is not loyal."
bad,"One member of management never knew what the other was doing. They'd conflict with directions and change things without notice, including shift hours. Don't ever dare get sick either."
bad,The only thing I liked about working at JC Penney is that they don't give a whole lot of hours which was okay when I was in school full time and couldn't work too much.
bad,"As the store is supposed to welcome all its customers, it only welcomes selective group of people. Some managers and supervisors will wait around looking for people of color to stalk presenting to shop while monitoring the entire shopping of the people of color. The store is very racist and only employs a few people of color to covers up how racist they are."
bad,"Stocker"
bad,"Leadership needs improvement at best and is falling completely apart at worst. There is zero positive encouragement to associates from leadership; they rely heavily on negative reinforcement to ""encourage"" associates to meet unrealistic goals. Leadership allows customers to verbally assault us in fear that they will turn and report our ""wrong doing"" to corporate."
bad,"I would no go back to this employer, due to the work load and the schedule you do not make a lot of money and the benefits are note worth it unless you have been there 10 or more years."
bad,"I have no review to give it was just a place t work. I lot of changes within the company morale in some department was low, you have some supervisors that treat you like you are dirt and try to work you like you are no one."
bad,"Fun place to work at, great discounts. Not enough pay or hours, other than that it is a great place to work at if you are going to school or have another job"
bad,Working here was all work no play. Work one stop and would have to return 2 minutes later and repeat. Constantly picking up clothes and folding. Helping customers find where they need to go.
bad,"depends on who your manager is, customers tend to be disrespectful, and customers feel obligated for a discount. I wouldn’t recommend working here unless it is your first job"
bad,I felt that the salary here was not enough for what all the hard workers were being asked to do. The work environment was always very competitive and the working environment was not the best.
bad,"JC Penney is a great work environment. The salons are beautiful, lots of space. appears ever: The pay is terrible for stylists coming right out of school. If you are an established stylist with clientele who will follow you, this would be more suited for you!"
bad,"Our manager was a sweet heart but we were underpaid, and very limited by the companies editing software to customize photos for clients. It was frustrating and often times customers were very rude"
bad,I do not wish to provide any further commentary on this employer. The employer did not meet minimum expectations. The training was less than effective and vastly different than live calls. for assistance was in another state
bad,management only gets on the employees that actually do their job and hours have been cut and it seems like its only the ones that work the hardest have been cut.
bad,"I thought I would love working at J.C. Penney.  I found out quickly that it was not going to be a long term place for me to be."
bad,"I don't know how JCP is now but when I worked here management sucked, favoritism was more important than actually getting the job done. Once a manager did not like you, they all seemed to work together to get you fired. Other than management JCP was not too bad employee discounts, holiday hours you make good money."
bad,Very fast paced on getting work accomplished is very micro managed .The store is a mess because their are no hours available to maintain presentation standards.
bad,Very stressful and too many mistakes made when the holidays came around. Some of the staff are nice but this is a failing business so there aren't many opportunities for growth. The customers there are very mean at most times and will definitely scare you just to get a discount. I felt scared working there.
bad,I have only worked here for a few months and I have already had many issues and it was not due to myself. I think part of the problem is that I should not work in retail and I do not recommend it for a first job.
bad,"It wasn't management's fault, as the turnover was so high. But we were very understaffed and I could not take off time that I needed for school activities. It was not a great environment to be in, and I dreaded working every day."
bad,I would not recommend working here. JCPenney had the worst management! They tried to fire me for no reason and just took me off the schedule without saying anything. I wouldn't have ever even expected something like this to happen and I didn't even receive a warning from corporate until 6 weeks later!
bad,Very stressful and not a lot of support.  Team was challenging and some not very open.  Great opportunity if you have the right mindset to handle negative employees.  Enjoyed my time with the company even with the challenges I faced.  Great experience to help fine tune your managerial skills.
bad,They put you alone and almost never give you any help when you needed it. They forced you to sell credit cards and at the end of my time there they said that they where going to have to start firing people if they didn't get the goal they had for the end of the month. That is when I started looking for another job.
bad,"Honestly, As a sales associate a typical day of work consisted depending. If you were scheduled to do recovery you would be putting go backs up and fixing clothes your entire shift and if you were scheduled for cashiering you were to stay at the cashier and ring up people, scan coupons, and when you had no one at line you would assist with go backs. There wasn't much to learn besides how to be on the register and how to put back clothes. Management cares for themselves but they do stick up for associates when customers are rude. The workplace atmosphere was chill somedays but whenever sales and coupons were around or it was a special occasion like mothers days all the clothes were everywhere and the amount of customers were overwhelming. Managers really and truly only care about sales and credit apps."
bad,"I worked the holiday season so it was very stressful but taught me to work in stressful, hectic conditions. Also to always have good customer service skills."
bad,"My experience at JCPenney was a little less than undesirable. Although I had mo problems with my coworkers and the job environment wasn't too bad, I felt as if there was a lack of ""color"" in the workplace. This caused my interest and enthusiasm to decline, ultimately resulting in me quitting the job."
bad,I worked in the salon. set prices were low. have to be able to build your ticket. Tips were. Good place to start for 1st time stylist. good discount. Good products in the salon.
bad,"Whether you like working here or not all depends on which team you are on and how much you let them take advantage of you.  Do not put yourself out there to help the company as it will not be appreciated, only expected that you can take on more and more until you die of exhaustion."
bad,"When the new CEO took over in 2003, JC Penney started to go downhill.  When Penney's originally opened, Mr. Penney had the focus on personalized customer service by having assistant personal shoppers for every customer. After 2003, that changed and the service went down hill."
bad,cooperate environment with poorly constructed structure. changed the pay scale 3 times while i was there. change in ceos in the company caused a lot of headache and confusion. loyal clientele and stylist.
bad,"At the time i worked, i was a high-schooler and just needed a job to earn money. I got the job there excited to work towards getting education and getting experience. I was paid barely above minimum wage, forced to close past 12am on most nights, and felt like i would be disciplined if i made friends with my coworkers."
bad,I was a part time employee and could never get enough hours and was basically minimum wage.  Not much else to add to review.  Ultimately left due to hours/pay issue.
bad,Management does not provide support.  They are only out for themselves so any issue is recorded and held against you.  Some timelines are unrealistic given the request that is being made.  Your success will depend 100% on the buyer you are paired with as they hold all the power even though you are told that buyers & planners are equals.
bad,"The management was awful, the were rude to employees and there are no worth while benefits to staying at JCP. The store itself is always a wreck, it was so disorganized. The customer base was ruthless, terrible."
bad,"Greeting customers."
bad,"They do not treat their employee with much respect, their only concern was sales and sales only. Don't get your breaks on time or at all if you work an 8 hour shift,"
bad,I gained experience by working at Jcpennys however the management and pay did not make the job ideal as a young professional/ college student. Hours and time off was limited and the store was ran unprofessionally
bad,Came in and help customers check out. when it was slow we would return product to the floor. once we closed we would clean our department and then go help clean every other department.
bad,I enjoy working for jcp simply because you gain experience by working with different network sites. Not to mention you have opportunity to change departments after your 90 days to gain more experience. Giving the opportunity to become an leader over multiple people is a challenge but it's exciting.
bad,"Workers weren’t friendly and others working the same amount of time has me were getting paid more.  "
bad,did not feel that we as employees felt important.  cut hours quite frequently.  i definitely enjoyed the hours but that was probably the only desirable aspect for this place.
bad,Unfocused management grasping at straws everyday. We were to focus on different metrics as the wind changed. Detrimental head count reduction is just going to put the already stressed out teams at corporate at a severe disadvantage going forward. They expect the detail from when we had tons of people in the office out of less than a skeleton crew... the equation just doesn't work. Good luck having a work/life balance!!
bad,I liked working here but during the holidays it was just beyond crazy that things would never get clean. I mostly enjoyed looking at clothes before they even hit the floor.
bad,Fast passe and busy environment. Retail is very demanding. Holiday sales are usually very demanding and busy. Stressful at times.Recovery teams don't usually take enough breaks.
bad,"Over worked, under paid (all but management makes roughly 8.25 per hour).   It appears that no one form the corporate Head Quarters on down knows what they are doing and clearly unsure of the direction the organization is headed.  They seem to be headed down the same path as other retailers trying to find their way without any luck."
bad,"hardest is working black Friday"
bad,You do not get paid fairly for all of the work that is expected of you. However the associates are very friendly and helpful. The discount is also worth it.
bad,"Manager wanted everything done his way if it was his way you were fired, thank god for me it was just  a temporary job because it was there long enough i would of not enjoyed it."
bad,"I enjoyed my job but management was very rude and sexist. I was accused of theft when I did what I was told, which is to always accommodate the customer."
bad,"New managers turned it into a stressful work environment. Way to much focus to get icaps (JCP credit card) and unbelievable chaos with departments changing and moving around too much. Work hours and shifts are a constant roller coaster. One week, everyone's hours get cut, then later the same week, they call a bunch of people in to add hours. Crazy!"
bad,regular retail job lots dont give you enough hours. small raises easy job for a teenager just trying to make a little extra money not a job you can live on
bad,"Salary and paid time off are good benefits at this company, but the work environment is very high stress created by unrealistic deadlines and contractors who provide low quality results."
bad,have worked many places in retail.  i was not impressed with them. the manger was terrible lots of people complained but nothing was ever done about it.
bad,"Meeting new people was fun,But the supervisor who was in charge of cashiers was miserable and took it out on the employees. I was told that was how she is and I would have to accept it.did not like the idea of going in to work and being yelled at in front of costumers and fellow employees was a normal thing.Fellow employees were nice,but some you were there for a while had a chip on their shoulder and thought they were in charge and were very bossy."
bad,Their no growth and ask to learn something when time is free you besides have to keep on asking. No growth in pay when the economy is growing. Thank you
bad,"Enjoy helping customers"
bad,I didn't enjoy it because it took up half my time and the customers there were rude and the mangers would schedule you when you already told them that you could not work that day.
bad,"When arriving, I set up the fine jewelry area and utilize all my floor time cleaning and making sure the signing is correct. Every customer is taken care of as a priority and I help other employees as needed. There are many and varied duties including reaching sales goals and stocking incoming jewelry to present all cases in a neat and orderly manner. The present management does not give the fine jewelry department any acknowledgement or encouragement nor do they help out when we are busy. We lose many sales because customers walk away. I always have a positive attitude, even when the management criticizes almost everything I do. I overcome the negative by being positive and smiling as well as complimenting those around me. I have developed a great number of loyal and return customers. I have continued to be a part of this company, hoping that I could help build the department and turn attitudes into a positive atmosphere."
bad,"The pay is to low for the hard work that you will do, going full time takes a long time for workers who want stability in there job training is bad instead of having a manager train you they have a worker train you and some workers don't want to"
bad,"Understaffed, Horribly ran, Bad pay, and very little assistance. They treat you horribly because you are just a sales associate. No talking with friends, No phones. Normally I understand no phones and favor it, but when you have folded every shirt multiple times and are slow as could be, what else can you do?"
bad,I worked hard for little money. Everyone was nosy. Didn’t  like the environment. I kept getting moved around to different jobs that no one wanted to do.
bad,"Although I enjoyed what I did, I hated being the only one that did the work around the office. When other employees were there or the manager was there they would carry on conversations with store associates or be on the phone with people they knew."
bad,The work environment begins at the top level.  Management treated their managers disrespectfully therefore causing poor morale with their employees that work with the public.
bad,working there was okay; i was only there for a month. and there really is nothing else to say about working here; it was okay; I was glad to leave as soon as I could.
bad,"Certain managers need to understand what it means to put  in action, “JCPenney Business Ethics”.   Certain managers  at the Mid Rivers Mall location have toyed with employees, harassed employees and fired employees without legitimate cause. Some in management are not honest. What these unethical managers fail to understand is, these now ex-employees and their families were also customers but now will never step foot back into another JCPenney if their life depended on it. It is never smart business to treat employees unjustly or unfairly."
bad,I found this company to be hardcore because I got ran out of the company. It was a good company in the sense that I was a really hard worker. I didn't let anyone put me down.
bad,Was told my schedule would be Monday through Friday. Then was scheduled over 11 days in a row. No explanation other than it was peak season. When issuing my grievance there was no resolve of the issue and no explanation of why the schedule was made in that way. No way to make plans outside of work because you are never sure what your hours are and what you may or may not be able to do.
bad,Decent job but team mentality was unseen. Management did not seem to care what employees were doing. Often times told to do the same things in succession
bad,Fun place go work at if you like retail. I enjoyed the fast pace unlike others. Very friendly co workers and really good management. I would work there again if possible.
bad,"I was very disappointed with this job"
bad,"Management is a horrible excuse for leadership and the bottom line is the only concern of the corporation which exploits its underpaid, under-educated workers."
bad,Fast work place and you have to keep up ur attendance. They very restricted about things. When you are there better be ready to work and do ten hours shift.
bad,Working for a company making them millions and getting little credit and no benefits. Managers treated you unfairly and took advantage of your skills.
bad,"Typical day at work would be cleaning out dressing rooms and stocking shelves because we were always so slow."
bad,Warehouse environment that need IT assistants with networking device and users. Was able to learn and grow and advance my career by working for this company
bad,Okay place to work but need better incentive plans and training programs. Store could use an overhaul and better cleaning staff.  Update work hours to be consistent with breaks. The hardest part of the job is working/standing for more than 4 hours and only having a 15 minute break. The pay scales needs to be reevaluated regarding years of experience vs no experience.
bad,"A typical day at JC penney would be cashiering, helping customers find specific products, promoting credit cards, counting and handling money, and zoning the entire store."
bad,It could be much better with better management. It would help with sometimes rude customers. I also think the pay has a big thing to do with it. The hours dont match the work.
bad,do not treat older workers fairly I enjoy working with public and my job but need more hours and pay they cut our hrs so could not get pto time and it is a good place to work but as I said treat their older workers poorly
bad,"Hours are pretty much given seniority based, minimum chance of progression, minimum chance of pay raise. However, you will meet plenty new people and make new friends."
bad,"I was thankful for the opportunity, but I am even more thankful I am no longer there. It could be a great place to work, but there is a huge disconnect between management and their workers. If they fix the communication between the two, and showed some flexibility with the schedule, it could be great."
bad,"The people - other workers - made this job tolerable. The work was extremely physical and back-breaking. The pay was not equal to the work that was expected. Conditions were extremely hot in the summer. If an individual had any medical conditions, it could become very hazardous, if not dangerous."
bad,"company is a great company for students and works with your school schedule, the works are flexible to an extent. Management can be difficult at times."
bad,I may have worked here for about 7-9 months and it was just bad. I was part time and i still got less hours than a part time should have gotten.It was just overall a bad place to work at.
bad,This place is soon not organized. Its always a mess and there is never a plan. Its hard to get a hold of your supervisors and its like you have to figure out everything on your own. Not cool and the customers that shop there think they own the place cause they think they know about the sales and have a ton of coupons.
bad,They will never leave you alone about nagging the guests for jcpenneys cards. They nag you constantly about it and also keep you very late in the store.
bad,"Although I started out loving my job at Jcpenney, that quickly changed due to the lady who was put in charge in my department. She had no clue on what she was doing, would schedule me a few hours a day but expected me to always stay over my scheduled shift due to the job not being done. Other than the management, it was a decent place of employment."
bad,I loved working at JcPenney. The staff was not all great and a lot of the management had no experience in the department they were in. The customers made the job great.
bad,The work is very slow at Penny's.  I would not ever go back and work for them.  The departments don't ever work together and there for it's hard to get to know the people that work at the store.
bad,"This was a part time job that involved working in law enforcement and something I wanted to try. It was a great experience."
bad,"I went from the lows of 2000 to the highs of 2008 and back again during my time at JCPenney.  Retail is just a tough place right now, and shifting leadership made it tougher during my time there."
bad,The company is to credit card focused and tries to focuses more on getting customers to open credit cards instead of focusing on good service and always have massive lines due to understaffed store.
bad,"Stressful, but alot of fun customers coming in and out. The company makes sure things are taking care of. They show alot of appreciation to all the workers. Always have great sales they also make sure all the customers are satisfied."
bad,The store might have changed since I worked there. I still do think the management team is a bit old and does not work well with the much younger employees. Most of the problems were lack of communication.
bad,"It is only cool as a seasonal position as it will have to be because the permanent positions they promise while you are busting your behind for will never be.  You can show up everyday on time and work long hours doing everything perfect and doing everything they say but you'll never be able to be more than seasonal, unfortunately. The staff is ok but they'll never call you back. There's no drama though and everyone there doesn't talk about each other and there's no gossip. Everyone literally gets along."
bad,The managerial team just expects you to know everything and they throw you into it before even properly training you. They also get mad if you cant personally help a customer so they have to come from their desk to your quad to do it.
bad,"Good coworkers, good atmosphere and team work!!!!!"
bad,"Was a great summer job to start off with but not to be hired on as a permanent employee. The lines of communication died off after a certain point upon hire, and the hour shifts became ridiculous. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the costumers and helping them with their needs. Creating a friendly based environment when a lot of the staff wasn't helping, was rewarding knowing the customers were seeing that their needs were taken care of and the feeling of being welcomed."
bad,"Like most retail jobs, the schedule and availability is fine for a college student. However, not a job for someone needing to support a family. Also, in today's day in age, retail associates must also be able and willing to sell credit cards to customers with outrageous interest rates"
bad,It is a good place to gain customer service experience. Everyone is nice and helps you succeed in your position. The discount is great and it was near my home.
bad,"The only great thing about it was that the company was fairly flexible with allowing me most of the days off I would request. Besides that, it's the typical retail work atmosphere. Pay isn't that great, work is repetitive, people (both customers and other employees/supervisors/managers) get on your nerves. It's great for people who need a job right away, but I wouldn't suggest staying there too long. It's almost impossible to move up the ladder."
bad,This was one of the roughest jobs I've ever had. Its way to much to even explain. The whole company is having hard ships which makes it very hard to want to stay working there because there is no job security.
bad,This care management agency really takes  good care of its clients. It was a pleasure to be associated with them. I would work with them again. I feel like they are friends
bad,"This is your average, run-of-the-mill corporate retail job. You will spend your days clearing out endless amounts of clothing in fitting rooms, while also trying to sign people up for credit cards every time you're on the register. If you're lucky, you might actually be able to help a customer find something that they're looking for, but more often than not, you're just trying to keep the line moving at the register, or you're drowning in a sea of clothing that was taken out of the 10 fitting rooms."
bad,I refuse being forced to write reviews about all of my past employers before i can look fora job. This ios a waste of my time and i will not participate in it.
bad,This is the worse job because they treat you like dirt. Even the managers didn't care about themselves and hey didn't care about their employees too just saying
bad,"J.C. Penney is an okay job, it does have its good days but overall for a beginning job it is okay to start there. Other associates are really nice and friendly."
bad,"The typical day at JCPENNY was always hectic. Management addressed its workers as children, and at least one employee quit a day. The environment was very tense. My co-workers were fun to work with, but management made it a pain. I believe that the experience would have been positive if management was trained properly to work with its employees. The most enjoyable moment of working at JCPENNY, was the positivity my co workers and I tried to provide for one another, as well as the love customers wanted to share, knowing how management was by observation."
bad,"horrible staff boring stupid dirty sales floor management super rude , overall just one horrible place not sure if it improved but I do not recommend to apply here"
bad,"It's an okay place to work but probably once I stop working here, I won't be working here or come to this store again."
bad,"Major issues with management, they were never corruptive with my school schedule. The benefits were amazing and there was an amazing employee discount."
bad,I disliked working at JCPenney. Management did not care for employees and did not listen to concerns. Managers would always get in disagreements with each other and ignore customers.
bad,"Nobody at JCPenney cares about anything. The store is constantly messy and no one puts in any kind of effort ESPECIALLY the managers. The company only cares about making money for themselves and any time the store is doing poorly the FIRST thing they do is cut our hours. In fact, right after the holiday season they let go of almost all of the seasonal employees and cut everyone down to working 10/15 hours a week so that the managers could get their bonuses for the year. After that business went down drastically because there was never anyone in the store to help our poor customers!"
bad,Decent Job But Dont Expect A Lot Of Hours. Not A Good Job If You Dont Have Any Other Income. Dont Expect A Great Check. No Full Time Positions Available
bad,I'm always learning new things there. Different people come in checking out eye wear. I love helping people to see with their new prescription. First time wearing glasses. Or help kids with their first pair of glasses.
bad,"Worked in Price Accuracy department for almost 3 years. The department was great then he left to go to school. New manger - very young & snotty attitude. We did price changes, markdown old merchandise& set for new ads!"
bad,"Pay is not great"
bad,Company was going through too many changes at the time and laying off a lot of long time hard dedicated workers. Management was very poor. Time there was spent only as part time while going to school.
bad,It was the absolute worst place to work. The air conditioner never worked and the company did not care at all about the employees. The system was way too easy to manipulate. Who would want to work for a place that doesn't take security seriously and just lets anyone walk out with stolen merch?
bad,"Management at my store had it out for me from day one. I would routinely go entire pay periods getting no hours, which made it nearly impossible to survive. Pay was meager. I did, however, make several friends with fellow employees in my brief time at Penney's."
bad,"The job itself was not a bad experience, however the city in which the job was located made the position a little boring. Not many people came in the Mall, which left a lot of time for sitting around. A typical day at work consist of sales transactions, store upkeep, and product placement. The management was very open and understanding."
bad,"It was a ok 5 years, I started working in jcpenny in manhattan ,new york than transferred to glen Burnie Maryland. There was a a lot of ins and outs but I learned and succeeded through my 5 years."
bad,"The job was a learning experience. You worked a rotating schedule every two weeks. This was the hardest part getting use to. But since I didn't have children yet, just my spouse, I was able to make the working hours operate. One I had my children, I was put on a more normal routine. I would only work one long weekend a month.  On the job it was nice to get to meet the different type of customers. Some were not always happy, but you did your best to solve the customers complaint. You ever able to move up in rank as long as your proved your self and did the job. The management was great to work for, as long as you did the job. In the department we treated each other as we were family."
bad,I didn't really like it there because we had to stay too late after our scheduled leave time. The money was great but I was so tired all the time that I was sleep when I wasn't working.
bad,"Working here was very enjoyable at first, upon working here the employees seem to be very friendly as well as some of the management. However after working here for over a year if I didnt click with the management or employees, for example hang with them at there parties my hours seem to be hurt by it. Some people who didn't work as effectively or at all were favored because they were in the ""in"" crowd. The reason I left was because of these issues and to seek a more reliable job, I will say I disappointed because working there was fun and I was great at my job."
bad,Didn't get enough help. The mangers were rude. The employees were very great to work with. There is seveal ladies that have worked there for years. Other than that great place.
bad,Most customers were very friendly and easy to please. There were some to no avail who would act like children and threaten the employee. The messes we had to clean were hazardous to our health with very little cleaning supplies. I loved shopping there but never again will I be employed there.
bad,If you like hard labor this is a job for you. great hours and you can get overtime. you have to keep your quotas up at all times. you are working on a line with 5 other people and if someone is lacking you have to pick up they work
bad,"Holiday hours are the worst! management has its favorites. To top it of, they don't give raises that often, plus they are really unfair to giving people opportunities."
bad,It's just not a place you wake up to be excited to go to. It's not an enjoyable work enviorment and the mangers just watch you all day. Very uncomfortable.
bad,Do the work of 2 and be happy about having the job in the first place.  No room for advancement and social obscurity for those who don't play along.  Management is weak in character and interpersonally.
bad,The company is primarily based around the customer and getting everything done to their standards. Hours have no set organization or structure besides being scheduled to make sure all shifts are covered.
bad,"Too much favortism, pay rate is good, hours are horrible, management not as understanding as need be, some lazy associates, not so flexible schedule.."
bad,"Cannot recommend the JC Penney company. Although I like most of my fellow workers, the company's focus is purely on financial gains. Workers are praised and evaluated primarily on how may credit card applications they can sign up, even for management positions. Working hard and following core standards is low on the list. We are very short-handed and accept any warm body. Standards are not followed consitently between employees. Hours are cut after holidays and those who get more credit applications get more hours even though they work less and they do not follow core standards. Pay is very low, even for managers."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this job, poor management not enough hours, coworkers cant stay in there own lane people get hit by forklift dailey, my paycheck gets messed up from time to time."
bad,"Management seems to hold personal grudges"
bad,"Always bickering between the coworkers and on a typical day you break at the same time and you eat at the same time. no space is given to breathe, until the end of your shift, which were 5 hours in the morning"
bad,"From the start of the shift to the end, depending on your task or position, it was easy to keep busy if you were a good worker. assisting customers between doing tasks was sometimes a little difficult because there was usually just one associate per department on shift."
bad,I have been at JCPENNEY'S for over two years and there is no advancement they constantly change anything you can think of and waste money and cut the hours to justify the spending it we have people that have been working 40 plus years
bad,"working at jc penny sucked the pay rate is horrible, we work really hard for a little of nothing management were not very helpful over all I guess this job will be great for someone who is just starting"
bad,show great customer service it was pretty easy i loved greeting the cutomers as they walked by . i answered any questions they had to the best of my ability.
bad,No matter how long you work for this company your option for advancement is not there unless you know the top people personally. Top sales are not rewarded and top photography is not considered. They will publish your photographs and use them wherever they please With no benefit to you other than bragging rights. It comes off more seasonal than professional
bad,"I did the home department and I loved it! very peaceful folding and restocking. Costumers were fun. Co workers were easy to get along with. management was very unfair. they would work you like a dog and never give you a raise. What I've learned is to never settle for a job just because you need one, always shoot for the stars. let your next job be your best job."
bad,"I don't want immediately come here and bash a company, especially one I truly enjoyed working for. There is a reason I stayed for 5 years. But the culture Is utterly miserable lately and the management proves over and over again the do not like you. But Its definitely not all bad. There are some amazing coworkers and a few decent supervisors. They almost always work with your schedule and the pay is fair for retail, as far as my experience goes."
bad,They cut everybody hours every week. Full-time is more like part-time. They have an rodent and insect problem badly. I will never recommend anybody to work there or shop being that I know what goes o behind the scenes. The people are 100 percent lazy. They make you work in bad conditions. Its so not worth the little money they pay you. Jcpenneys  is an upscale slavery.
bad,Enjoyed working with the associates at the home store in all departments. Hours worked were convenient. Store is fast passed most days and easily straightened up through out the shift and at closing.
bad,"Very poor benefits good work enviorment. The system effective, customer service was great. There were people that couldn't stand the site of the stock room. Building didn't have any fresh air. No lunch venders. Needed benefits needed insurance."
bad,"Coming in, I keep saying Hello to everyone I meet, whether customers, associates,supervisors, the manager and the maintenance people. Once ready, I clock in and directly to the floor. What is the target of the day? was it busy? everything is Ok? I need answers. "
bad,Management was not that great. customers were great and loved taking all phone calls that came threw store. that was the best part
bad,"I did not feel appreciated for my hard work, and things were not handelled by the supervisors in a professional manner. It was more of a clique situation going on then a professional and not personal environment."
bad,"Overall JCPenney is one of if not the best company I've had the pleasure to represent. However, there are areas of opportunities at the site in Lenexa Kansas. Favoritism and Retaliation are two major opportunities the site should focus on. There are a lot of great people in the business that may or may not be aware of these behaviors during day to day operations."
bad,"It is common knowledge how poorly this company has faired the last several years. Most management positions have either been downsized or completely eliminated. Company culture is great with many people who have been there for years, however many people have lost their jobs in the recent years."
bad,"I worked at JCP for almost three years, and for most of my time there I felt unappreciated and underpaid. I watched the store leader treat his employees like servants and degrade them behind their back. I even heard a racist remark. No matter how desperate for a job I may be, I would NEVER go back there."
bad,"Keep departments neat and organized, help customers whenever help was needed and give advice to help them purchase what was suited best for them."
bad,The company has historically been a great provider for their Associates and was a place to build a career. Those days are gone.
bad,"Too many people that did not know what they were doing. Bean counters trying to run a salon. Money should not be more important then the client. When a customer is more important on the sales floor than in the salon there is a problem. "
bad,"Working throughout the day isn't bad, the store closes at nine on all days of the week except for Sunday. After the store closes you begin recovery which takes a long time, on a good day you expect to be out of the store by 11, on busy days you usually leave the store around 2 in the morning. You have to get 2 credit applications a week and 8 a month, there's a possibility your job will be terminated if the quota is not reached. The upside of credit applications is you earn an additional two dollars for every credit app you earn and the managers congratulate and reward you for them. Not all employees are started at the same amount of pay, some may be getting paid 8 dollars an hour and some may be getting paid 9, it doesn't matter what your previous work experience is."
bad,JCPenney is a retail store back on the rise from poor decisions made in earlier years. Their call center in downtown salt lake is not a terrible job but its current management could do with some cleaning
bad,"-job was pretty easy to get the hang of"
bad,"Not much to say but that I have to put 20 words here.  It is a typical retail job.  What you see is what you get.  Really, nothing special.  Good for high school kids."
bad,"Management often times failed to communicate with associates."
bad,Been there for three years and witnessed three different CEO's. No stability and very tough to advance. Changes seem to made weekly.
bad,"The work was interesting to a point, I didn't  want to be a credit card salesman, nor did I want to be a cashier.  The numbers were difficult to attain and maintain."
bad,Non stopping mechanical distribution line of product to ship out. Management not very professional. A handfull of co-workers were good to work along with on the line. The hardest part of working here. It's not a place to seek advance of growth. The enjoyable part of this job was the close vecinity to home.
bad,"Atmosphere was greatly affected by management, which was just all over the place. I found co-workers feeling flustered as one change after another had been implemented one after another for sometime. Alright if you need a place to work over break temporarily."
bad,it was an ok place to work. I would not work for this company again. the management team was an ok team to work with there is no room for growth in the store I worked at
bad,I felt part of the organization even as a contractor.  They are facing economic hardships and don't make sound decisions when selecting and implementing technology projects.
bad,I feel that the upper management in this store is stubborn.  He does not let you do YOUR job.  The lower management is a pleasure to work for.
bad,JCP was an interesting experience. It was a great introduction into customer service and cashiering. I became more outgoing learning to serve customers.
bad,I was hired went through orientation and two days of training and was not placed on an active schedule so I obtained work at Kingston of Vermilion.
bad,"this was my first job after college. I graduated in a recession. This job was easy and unfulfilling, but that's retail for you."
bad,There really isn't anything to tell. Before leaving the company it was very different than how it is now. Working there always left me tired and not rewarded in any way.
bad,"The start you off with a good amount of hours, then all of a sudden they cut them down to nothing! It makes a better second job. The managers are cold, distant, aloof, and slow to help. Some expect you to brown-nose and that's not my style at all."
bad,"This job had good bennefits as far as health insurance. It was a production based job. I worked everywhere in the warehouse, and i like that i got a chance to gain experience in those other areas. The cons to this job is that i felt like not all of the management were friendly and i feel they could have showed more compassion towards their employees."
bad,"I love this salon and the people I work with. The management Is not the greatest. They have unrealistic goals you have to make to stay there. They will tell you they are busy, but truth is, its not. The front desk is told to give clients to certain people. So if your new, or a ""designer"" level you will not get a walk-in until all the masters and seniors are completely full first. Then its battle over the walk-in between the available designers. There Is definitely some strong favoritism is this salon. They are hiring like crazy and tricking people into coming here with empty promises and lies. This place has a lot of potential but I fear with the remodel things are about to get very intense with management. Too stressful and very unrealistic."
bad,"the coworkers were really nice"
bad,"The management was always changing the rules, and they did not know what life was like in a real store!"
bad,"Average retail environment, management stays hands off, do not interact with employees as regularly as some other companies. Has unrealistic goals with employees however many of these goals are met with compensation."
bad,There are not enough workers to keep the store in a stoppable state for customers and it reflects badly on the associates who work hard to try and keep the store clean.
bad,"This is the only place I've ever worked where the store manager sets people up to fail. I've witnessed multiple employees be promoted, give minimal training, and then literally get yelled at for not doing the job properly."
bad,I learned at JCPenney that management did not care about any of the employees as they are interchangeable. Management eventually fired all full time employees to lower costs.
bad,This company is not stable. There were individuals positioned in upper management levels who did not work in the interest of the company or its success. The corporate office culture is extremely hostile & political. It does not foster a positive work environment for its employees. There are many employees there that are eager to leave and are constantly looking for employment elsewhere because of this.
bad,"Pricing, customer service, helping fellow associates. I enjoyed challenges and making sure my work was done efficiently."
bad,"Tuesdays and Thursdays are when the online merchandise arrives. I scan the packages/boxes in, process/complete the orders, make phone calls to alert customers that their order is here and do a reconciliation report. I would work with management on an as needed bases and with minimal supervision. Most of my co workers understand what is expected and needed in that department. I enjoy having one on one time with customers. What I don't like is when I have to duplicate a job that should have already been done which lessens the time I have to accomplish my tasks."
bad,"•Opening or closing the store putting money into cashiers/counting draws."
bad,"A fairly decent job for a high school student."
bad,Don't be fulled by the speech they give you during your hiring process. JC Penney is not a family focused company that they claim to be. A typical day they will expect 1 person to do the job of 3 people. Not only that but training is non-existent. After you do you computer training which is nothing like how it is on the floor they throw you too the wolves. Some of the manager are pretty nice and try to create a good work environment but they have no say or power in anything. My manager made too many promises that he couldn't keep to keep me around. The discount is the only really great thing about working there. I finally left JCP after they tried to force me to work during my College Graduation after they had already approved it off 4 month before when I requested. I realize that it was a high selling weekend but I'm not going to skip my Graduation. Another girl had her wedding that weekend and they fired her because she refused to come in on her wedding day! When you work for JCP they think they own you so don't be surprised when they won't let you off for any family functions or weekends because 90% of the year is blacked out (meaning your can't request off)!
bad,"Sales associates were spread thin.  There was a lack of support from management.  Twice, I had to train new supervisors to supervise me in the furniture department.  When they each got promoted, I still new more about the department than they did.  Penney's wasn't consistent about promoting the most qualified person for the job.  Job satisfaction was never a factor, performance only was."
bad,Very low hours... Bad management... Very stressful for people with families and bills to pay..
bad,"Very split management team. No sense of ""team"". Upper management not helpful at all."
bad,I was hired for the holidays and I didn't like how they went about letting people go. basically I looked on the schedule Friday before I left and I was not on there for the next day. Weeks later I get a letter in the mail saying I was fired because the holidays was over.
bad,Team work. Enjoyable and convenient. Almost the same behavior of workers when it comes to serving customers. Good benefits.
bad,"JcPennys could be a fun and productive place to work at times.  The most difficult part of the job was when you were scheduled by yourself at the busiest of working hours.  Management did not like you to socialize with other employees, but at the same time they wanted us to all work together as a team."
bad,I have found the people where I worked to be unfriendly and if you are a christian they look down on you and treat you badly for it.
bad,"Loaded and unloaded trucks of merchandise"
bad,"When I worked at Penney's, I basically cashiered, recovered clothes and helped in the fitting rooms. There wasn't really anything hard about it. The management needs to be improved. I feel the managers have certain goals for certain people without being specific or fair. Attitudes were very negative here. A lot of gossip. I got along with my co-workers, but I didn't want to be dragged into the dirt by other people. "
bad,"What I didn't like about this company we weren't getting trained well, It was all poor management skills, The hardest part of the job was to reach the credit score goal, and that if you don't make it to the goal you lose hours"
bad,I worked at J c penney warehouse through a temp service manpower the job wasn't hard it was a very easy going job for a temporary position.
bad,Great if you are a people person that loves to help people. Many projects to keep you busy.
bad,J.C Penney's was my first retail opportunity so I learned a lot here. I learned how to open and close out a register. How to work with people (customers) face to face. I learned how to keep the sales floor maintained. The coworkers here were awesome and friendly. The hardest part was getting to know how to do everything at first but it didn't take long. The most enjoyable was to being able to work with customers and learn how to deal with all different types of people.
bad,"slow passed work,classes are available.good supervision,wonderful people to work with.not a hard job,learning new things."
bad,I enjoyed this job and enjoyed the discounts even more. I was a sales associate in the perfume department. I had to use persuasive skills to sell products to many different customers
bad,It has been awhile since I have worked with this company they have changed things around But the mangement was not good when I worked there..
bad,"If you are part time it is probably best to find another job along with JC Penney because part timers typically do not receive more than 15 hours a week.  The management there was horrible.  The managers always thought of themselves as better than the employees and it was often a ""us versus them"" kind of atmosphere.  The day also moves pretty slowly during the weekday away from any major shopping holiday, however that is somewhat normal for any store.  The hardest part of the job was the constant standing sometimes for 8-10 hours straight with just a 15 minute break and a lunch (where you couldn't walk out to the mall).  Through all that, though, you are liable to meet some pretty interesting employees there and usually that is enough to get through the day."
bad,"When I first started working for JcPenny I worked in the children's department. I kept the floor clean and helped customers. I learned how to multitask and take care of customers while multitasking without the customer feeling like they didn't have my full attention. The customers were great to be around and made my job amazing. The hardest part was working during the holidays. Staying late to clean the floor was hard. You never knew when you were going to go home. When I transferred to the shoes department some things changed. I no longer had long hours and I got paid for every shoe I rang up. The hardest part of the transfer was getting paid when other people rang the customer up. Most of the time other associates in the store didn't use my code, so I wouldn't get paid the commission. The co-workers were great, but there was always gossip. Management was excellent until we got a new manager. He was the worst when it came to gossip and knew how to make you feel like you didn't fit in."
bad,"A typical day would include operating cash registers and keeping fitting rooms clean. Sometime you have to replenish the sales floor with merchandise. I learned that providing customer service is enjoyable but not always easy. Most, but not all of the management team are unfair in almost everything they do. Co-workers were always extremely easy to get along with. The hardest part of this job would be dealing with difficult customers and putting up with some of the manager's shenanigans. The best part of the job is the environment."
bad,"cashier"
bad,I enjoyed selling jewelry and assting customers.The hardest part pierceing ears.
bad,It was an ok place to work. Its honest work but not enough pay and support
bad,"Depending on the day, a typical day at work can be very slow or really busy. If it's slow, it's fairly easy to maintain the appearance of the floor. However, on the opposite end the store's appearance can be very terrible on busy days. At the end of the night, we are responsible for cleaning and straightnening for the next business day. As for the management, the store I work(ed) was horrible. There were favorites and the rules only applied to certain employees.The hardest part of the job was not receiving any raises after being there and putting in great work at the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was the associate discount! Who doesn't like saving money!"
bad,I Enjoyed this job alot! Its a good experience if you have never worked in a warehouse..
bad,when i got hired at JC penny's it was good then it gotten worse bad management
bad,"Prepare for corporate! No flexible scheduling, and constant monitoring just to start off. The department managers were awesome and tried to be very understanding. Employees were cool, mostly college students. The upper management needed some help. A little too opinionated and overbearing."
bad,my management was not good. Some days were good most days were bad. Management kept be switched around
bad,managment was horrible. all the supervisors where disrespectful and belittled all of the associates.
bad,"Sell. Sell, Sell. Credit,Credit Credit. That is their mantra. You get in trouble if you don't get people to sign up for credit. Sometime the job was slow and boring, and you didn't make a lot of money after Christmas."
bad,It was a fun place to work and I had very good co-workers. Everyone was happy and competent.
bad,"working at a JcPenney may be a whole different experience at another location. The JcPenney I work at is dead most of the time. I find it hard to build because people don't want to travel to a mall to get their hair done. Productivity is outrageous, the people in the retail part of the store get paid hourly no matter what they could stand around and do nothing all day and still get paid. In the salon you have to reach a certain productivity or you get fired after three warnings. it's only part time with minimum wage."
bad,"I was basically a receptionist doing all the dirty work. I wasn't even able to take appointments and do hair which is what I went to school for. I basically got paid the same as I did when I did housekeeping in  high school. poor management. They constantly screwed up my schedule and clearly didn't know how a salon is run. They treated me like a cashier girl which was unappreciated, not to mention I wasted my skill and talent there."
bad,I stayed pretty busy with either helping customers or stocking items. I made a few online orders daily and I got along with everyone there. I still keep in contact with many ex co-workers and the job itself wasnt hard on my school or personal life.
bad,Show employees everything that is expected of the company.
bad,JC Penney was a good place to work. I learned to work with the public. My co-workers made it easy to work there because they were fun people. To me there were no hard parts to this job.  I loved shopping so working in retail was the most enjoyable thing.
bad,Always a pleasure to help customers with what they need in the store or for service
bad,"Working in the retail store with a booming business and always on your feet. I learned patience and working with others maybe easy or hard depending on that persons attitude and character, you have to be able to pick up the slack of others who are not willing to do there job. The most enjoyable part of my job is when your able to get along with other employees and you are all willing to the duties necessary to finish off the day."
bad,"I enjoyed assisting customers with all questions they had. Setting up promotional displays was very enjoyable and keeping our department clean was a must. The only thing I did not like about my job was feeling like I was baby sitting. We had several younger associates who were not always so responsible with showing up to work. When that happened, I would get called in to cover. I did not mind but it started to get to the point where I was called very often. Since this was a part time job, I did work seven days a week but I needed to have my time off during the week for take care of things at home."
bad,"Had Meetings every morning on how we did the day before. I Won alot of awards for customer service and selling on line to customers.  Cleaned dressing rooms, sizing, folding shirts. Team Player."
bad,"A typical day at JCPenney involves mostly straightening and refolding the clothes on display, and tending to customers at the cash register as well as throughout the store."
bad,"As a manager at one of the largest and oldest company, I've have trained, hire and set sales goals for the store.  While employed, my responsibilities include training employees on various positions from new hires to existing staffing personnel.  "
bad,A typical day consisted of making sure every customer is treated with respect and excellent customer service. I learned how to manage employees in two different departments and the meaning of customer service. I became a Zoner (limited managerial position) for the store and enjoyed it. My learning agility was exquisite and there wasn't anything I couldn't handle at JC Penney. The most enjoyable part of my job was to offer less stress to the customers by helping them with their shopping experience and being rewarded for it.
bad,"i would not reccomend for anybody to work here. I worked there for 6 yrs and things were great at first but went bad very quickly after we got the new CEO EVERYTHING is always changing, and currently they have no manager so nobody knows anything or whats going on."
bad,We stat at 6am and we reticket. some of us off load trucks and do pickpack. Then by the end of the day we find out if there is work for the next.
bad,"A typical day at work includes morning meeting, opening registers, assisting customers (both regular and custom orders), answering all incoming phone lines and directing calls to correct person/dept., processing online orders and pickups, keeping dept clean and orderly, when asked pulled to other depts for assistance. Training certified in both custom windows and fine jewelry."
bad,Working at JCPENNEYS was not a bad job. It was difficult for the management to keep everything organized including the employees so it was a stressful job.
bad,"I was released as ""job eliminated"" along with 2 other employees who had been there for a while and were over 50 years old. Direction of business with new CEO seems to be sending business down the tubes, as can be seen on most news venues and thru stock news. This is reflected in rating choices above."
bad,"I worked for JcPenney for two years and the first year was great! It was fun and all the associate got along nicely. We all respected and listened well to our supervisors, and then February 2012 came and everything seemed to go downhill. With the new CEO came new assistant management, people from Apple who waltzed in trying to tell us how to do everything we were doing perfectly fine before they came. The schedules which did pretty good before, were constantly wrong and always needed changing. The fun atmosphere that was there when I first started there was gone, and you went to work every day with everyone hating their job. It was bearable for about 6 months but it seemed to constantly get worse and eventually almost all sales associates weren't getting hours. Only the favorites got to work and most of us feared not having a job the next day. So I quit before they could let me go, and have never been better. Honestly the atmosphere and management are awful. So are schedules and hours, plus to not know if you have a job the next day or week is very unsettling. Just be careful when you decide to apply at JcPenney."
bad,Not stable industry. No benefits.
bad,I like who I work with on the floor. Not many opportunities to grow. Too much pressure to get credit applications. Breaks are short. The pay is too low. Libbys are our new registers and its not going so well because of their connections.
bad,"The store was extremely unorganized and there was no order in place what so ever,"
bad,"Its ok but there's no incentive to work there . I like my job and what i do, but also i would like something better and better income."
bad,They could never keep a manager and I applied for the position mulitple time and never could get an advancement.
bad,This company is reinventing itself - They offered alot of continuing education courses
bad,"very unprofessional, i didnt like that they cut hours and they would tell you that you had to work over without notice."
bad,"Used cash register to complete transactions, such as purchases, payment on accounts and special orders. Put clothing back on racks that customers left on the floors of the dressing rooms"
bad,"I came in and did my job and left when i completed my shift, coworkers were nice and easy to get along with, i learned the warehouse and how to operate equipment/"
bad,A typical day consisted of me picking orders for online customers in a timely manner while doing the job proficiently and thoroughly.
bad,Maintain clean dressing area and checkout customers in a timely manner.
bad,"I only worked with this company for a short period of time but they take organization to the extreme almost every item within the store had there own special area, place, and postion."
bad,"I was hired at JC Penny to work for the Christmas Season. After a few months, I was laid off. I didn't really get anything out of the job besides money."
bad,J.C. Penney's management has been brainwashed to think they are higher than most people. At least that is how they behave. I was not paid enough to put up with their belittlement for as long as I did.
bad,"not well balanced in management, poor work hours, very fun co- workers"
bad,help assisting customers
bad,"Since 2007, all the knowledgable and hardworking managers have been replaced with lower paid personnel. The store's karma and overall ambiance reflects this indifference to the customer's Retail experience."
bad,Was a fun place to work but you have no job security. You never know when your last day will be irregardless of how long you have been with the company.
bad,"Working for this company was fun and easy going. It is a good company for a part-time job. The only down side would be the pay, and the mean costumers."
bad,Not a good place to work at the moment. Huge lay off in February. Management is disorganized and don't really know what's going on. The pay is probably the worse in the industry. Avoid this place if at all possible.
bad,i use to like my job now i wish i had another one. things have change with each new manager. don't work as much as i use to.
bad,"Favortism, long hours, management had bad attitudes about possible inquires."
bad,They were decent at times but rarely  gave the time of day to train anyone i trained myself to work the cash register. They are very unprofessional and unkind.
bad,"I worked here a 4 months ago, and was hired in the summer as seasonal, and then ended up getting kept. Everything was good and chill for the first 2 months, but then I noticed how I was carrying the store on my back as just an operations associate. Low pay and having to deal with one LOD who constantly harassed me also killed my experience there. I just didn’t see me being there for a year."
bad,When i first started at Jcpenney it was going good i got appreciated and rewarded but not its alot of favortism racist i dont feel appreciative no more they dont care about their associates like they use to alot of people are either depress or stress out just working there.
bad,They do not treat people fairly... I was fired for a lie... I was told in August 2018 about doing a credit card without I’d... which was a lie... it took manager till oct 24 to fired me... 8 years with a company I gonna put my job on the line for 2.00... 2 months no warning no write up.. Something is definitely wrong in that store.. it has happen to many people wrongful termination...
bad,"Loved the interaction with co workers made work flow easy, would hardly get scheduled and other co workers had the same problem, management is terrible !"
bad,"I worked as much as possible for a part-time. See pros and cons of an idea of what it’s like to work there. My biggest advice is to avoid drama wherever you work. With so many young workers in one area and management being immature enough to humor those situation, it’s best to not get involved with anyone to that level and risk your job. I saw this happen a lot. However, I still made great friends that I see to this day."
bad,"Working here was okay for my first job. I worked seasonal. However, I am missing two paychecks and/or never received those paychecks and payroll was very unhelpful. I was only able to obtain $1.24 and that was a result of an error on their end where they said I never checked in when I know I did. When I finally obtained a debit card for my money to go to, they said I couldn't add it in because the seasonal had ended. Again, I contacted payroll and they were very unhelpful. I would have rated higher if none of this ever happened."
bad,"They keep hiring more and more people and putting them to work on the floor without the adequate training. In the meantime, the veterans who have worked there 5 or more years hours are cut to in order to give the new people hours. On slow or non-event days there are very few people scheduled which means those scheduled have to cover several areas of the store, even the ones they are not familiar with. They award people for credit applications and completed customer surveys but not for all the other hard work that is done to keep the store running. This is not seen or rewarded. I stayed for the discount and the flexibility of my schedule. Associate recognition is bias and unequal."
bad,"Your schedule can and will change without notice.  It is often difficult to plan vacations or even a significant event due to blackout dates and Upper Level Corporate visits at a moment's notice.  Your productivity is monitored and correctives issued if you don't have sales (varies by location).  The hardest part of the job is the long hours on your feet or too many responsibilities placed upon you to meet benchmarks.  The people are great to work with, and the company does have a nice rewards systems."
bad,Regular people are friendly but management talks to you only when they need to.  I was at the distribution center in utah. Lots of cheating and management not having your back when needed. Pay was good tho but not worth the stress.
bad,When i first worked at JCP in Brentwood  i was really excited because it was my first job however it was a ton of favoritism and management was very poor and unfair treatment.. if you were not at favorite at the job then you did not move up when i was working there i didn’t get any hands on training i had to learn from myself and other co workers.. i was happy to leave after my first year
bad,"Associates are friendly. Management needs to just get under control and follow company policies.  Otherwise, customer service is always number one and we treat customers like family."
bad,"A few managers there were unprofessional, rude and judgmental. Some workers were lazy or would be dishonest to customers to get a credit app for a quick dollar. They hire a lot of young teenagers and give no benefits or not enough hours. Pay is very little as well. Only good for young people to work as a first job to gain some work experience."
bad,"Bad management takeover "
bad,"Work once a week just for the discount. Totally not worth the stress!!!! Upper Management just wants results but never leaves office to actually see how hard the team is working. Supervisors and Associates do their best with the so little help that is given. If you want a humbling experience work in Retail. "
bad,"JCPenney allowed me to have a flexible work schedule with my school and personal life. Management seemed a little disorganized at times and appeared to not know much about their employees whereabouts.They never had a set work schedule so staff was short at times. On my fist day of work the girl I had to shadow didn't show up to work so I had to shadow someone that was unprepared for me. Training was minimal and not realistic. We spent an hour on a computer which had no similarities with a real register and then got sent out to the sales floor. Management also seemed more concerned in employees' daily quotas with store credit cards than anything else. Every work meeting we had  management just commended those who had the most credit card applications filled out and pointed out those who weren't doing well with credit cards in front of the whole staff, which I thought was unprofessional."
bad,"Worked for the home/customer service area. My hours got cut tremendously when my husband got a new job, I gave them the hours I wanted to work to find out I would only work 1 day a week. weren't allowed to dress in comfy clothes only professional dress."
bad,"I found myself dreading to go to work most days. I was stuck with what felt like pointless shifts - four hours at the end of the day when we barely had any customers. Management was inconsistent with their expectations, and it was frustrating dealing with them. Certain employees did the bare minimum to get by while others went above and beyond to make up for it. Pretty average for a retail job, unfortunately."
bad,"It's a nice first time job for a very patient high schooler. The pay does not justify the work that is expected of you at all. The commission was laughable, to the point where you would just think why bother? Half of management would be mad if you asked a simple question. Bit the other half always had your back. It did teach me a bit of accountability and I think it definitely helped with my patience for ornery customers."
bad,They give a good discount and they always have something for you to do. The supervisors always give us projects to do. The store manager is very rude and doesn’t appreciate what we do.
bad,"Jcp started as a good company, low but fair pay and environment that quickly changed and collapsed.If a person can live off 12hrs a week .Expect to do 2 or 3 jobs .The only good things schedules and discount."
bad,I was a lost prevention officer at JCPenney I really enjoyed the job my job duties was to prevent theft and patrol the lobby for suspicious activity............
bad,"When I first started working at JCPenney, it was a very enjoyable place to work, I found myself excited every day to go to work. But about a week after I started, we got a new general manager, and since then things have descended gradually with what seems to be no pit stops. Most of the managers that were there when I started are now gone, and most of the floor associates that I started with are gone as well. With a lack of guidance and practical training, we are left with a team of unreliable associates who would rather spend their time standing around than actually working. The fun and trusting environment that I was introduced to is now replaced with a hostile and negative environment. Associates have trouble getting along, and with all the drama in the workplace, I feel like I am back in high school; and this drama does not exclude managers."
bad,"Unrealistic expectations, advancement opportunities are few and far between and even when they did come up they would rather outsource. Biased management would openly favor the relatives they work with. communication was almost nonexistent. Plus pay sucks! you cap out at like 9 dollars and change until you get promoted and I wouldn't hold your breath waiting for that promotion."
bad,I started last year here and I used to enjoy my job. Customers are sometimes picky but that’s just retail life. You have to deal with it. However I cannot deal with my manager lying to my face telling me she doesn’t change my schedule however I have photo evidence she refuses to look at because she knows she’s wrong. I am a very good employee I’ve never been late and I’ve never caused issues. Unfortunately since the new manager came in and she’s done schedules she has been messing with mine and a few others. Until 4 weeks ago I was never late. It’s a shame all the good employees are leaving including myself. I’ll miss the few good coworkers I have.
bad,"Although I worked at JCP for the holiday season, the work environment was slow and not exciting at all. Whenever coworkers would try to work together we would always be split up.. even when the job was getting done. I don’t recommend it."
bad,There is no work life balance when you are expected to work every weekend and close during holidays which means staying each to clean up and getting home at 1:30 am.
bad,"they promised me at least 20 hours a week, they are barely giving me 8 hours a week. the very first day on the job the person that was supposed to be training me never spoke to me and was on the phone almost the entire time. and every day I have worked after, the people are always on their phone. I have asked for more hours and have not got them"
bad,"Great job for a fresh start, you get great hours but some of the workers are rude, you have no training,and it’s easy to get in I never had a interview only a back ground check and I was in."
bad,"When I first started it was great and managers were cooperative, but after a few months they became really immature, and will walk around in packs and gossip. There are multiple associates who don't do their jobs, and just sit on their phones or shop while on the clock, and the management allows it. Benefits are good, but that's the only thing worth having this job for. The hours are inconsistent and you must work weekends, and if you cant work certain days they will penalize you. If you don't push the store credit card on every customer they will cut your hours and try and push you out. Do not work there."
bad,JCP Logistics shut down their warehouse and gave employment at other areas except for me because I was 57.  I had to sign a waiver to not sue for age discrimination or they would not allow me to collect my severance package.
bad,"Hours promised never came to fruition. Kept changing my shift. Was involved in and was hospitalized for and auto accident. Upon return my position had been ""reassigned""."
bad,"Perfect job if you’re looking to have more than one. The benefits are good ( discounts and coupons ) but the pay is under minimum wage and the management is TERRIBLE!! Some of them are nice but the more important ones are TERRIBLE ,  If you don’t get credit apps they cut your hours and after the holidays they look for little things to let people go. inconsistent with hours, they expect you to remember every little thing from orientation and don’t trust them because they will turn on you quick to save themselves.  So be careful and pay attention if you work here!"
bad,"I have worked with this company on and off for 10 years, and it has only gone downhill.  I did everything from cashiering to truck and pricing.  Management and store structure were constantly changing,  wrong people were getting promoted, and management couldn't care less about if the job was done right; just as long as it was done before a district inspection.  management wouldn't take responsibility for their poor decision making and would take it out on lower level employees.  employees were never recognized fr good work and hours were constantly being cut (even during the holiday season).  If you didn't want to be reprimanded, it was just best to keep your head down and keep your mouth shut... otherwise, you were just adding fuel to the fire.  my equal level team members were the only reason i stayed as long as i did."
bad,"the store i worked changed managers twice during the time i was there ,and with each switch became progressively worse. When integral people quit, they were not replaced, thus doubling the work load each time. with every manager that came in, they brought their friends and management team as well, shortening advancement opportunity."
bad,one thing about it do not have this as your first job. cause it is very cut throat and do not give you any slack once so ever. the discounts are wonderful when you do use them. most of the time you wont.
bad,I am willing to work everyday except on Sunday.  I have prior obligations on Sunday.  JCPenney was not willing to work with me and my schedule.  I had a mandatory retreat one weekend and I told my manager that I can't work.  They fired me that day.
bad,I personally worked at the Jc Penny in Arbor Place mall and the management was horrible and lacked leadership. And did not treat or tend to employee needs at all.
bad,"1st emails list for all Air and Ocean containers coming to USA"
bad,"Nice work place. Free lunches sometimes, customer service, they push sales on credit cards. Co workers were nice, wasn’t a big fan of the managers....."
bad,"Responsible for driving sales and revenue. Training, coaching and developing associates. Assist customers making informed decisions about products and services. Achieve department sales objectives."
bad,I enjoyed my manager. Working during peak holiday season was nice. Interacting with the families. Overall this job is meant for people that doesn't like to work too hard. The pay isn't good and when it's slow its slow! You sit there and do nothing unless you're in school and have homework or something to do.
bad,"I worked there as a Seasonal hire, however in the group interview/training was told they had just fired 12 associates for store thief that gave me the impression that if I did a good job I might get hired on full-time after the holiday season. Was thrown onto a register with no training at all. Thankfully I had some past experience from previous jobs but the system was Greek to me. Everything was going well made it though Thanksgiving and Christmas and New Years. Then abruptly my scheduled hours were taken away and then I couldn't access my schedule at all. When I called to speak to a manger to try to find out why I couldn't access this I was told ""they didn't know I'd have to wait on the store manager to get back from vacation in a week"". I waited the week then called back store manager transferred me to HR who told me I'd have to talk to the store manager. When I informed them that I just had and they had transferred me to her the call ended, I was hung up on. The next day my paycheck came in the mail and it said Final paycheck on it."
bad,Great for your first job. Too many managers trying to be the boss. Pay is at a minimum. They hire management outside the company. They are not realistic in sales goals nor do they staff enough employees to efficiently clean the store.
bad,"The constant questioning of whether or not I'll have a job played a big part of me leaving. The company made a lot of bad decisions from a market perspective that they could not undo. For that, they eliminated positions and cut fat. They did this at the expense of long time employees."
bad,It's fun to work when you know your product and policies. Personally I didn't feel I could grow in that company I saw favoritism on my behalf I might be wrong but that's the way I felt.
bad,not a great place to work and raise a family. no work/life balance. expectations are to work as much as possible to get the job done. no exceptions. ..
bad,"No training. If you want to learn and grow, you can't. Management is unforgivably under qualified. There is a lack of communication throughout the company and building. No ""open door policy""."
bad,I loved working at Jcpenney and it taught me a lot about handling difficult situations. I would reccomend this place for a first job and the employee discount was alright.
bad,"Wants to operate with part time associates, few managers in the building.  Associates struggled to get things accomplished simply because payroll dollars were virtually non-existent and subject to change.  Way to many clothes in a limited amount of space.  Made shopping and clean up hard.  Not a pleasant experience."
bad,employees were enforced with how many cards they could get a person to sign up for. if one does not meet that requirement there would be consequences.
bad,I was working here during my last semester in college until I found a job that was more geared to my career aspirations. During that time I found it to be a very stressful place to work. The culture of the workplace wasn't great as we were required to work at least 10 hr shifts during the holidays. The compensation wasn't great or worth the stress of dealing with irate customers all day.
bad,I only worked part time  but the hours and pay were just not that good. I didn't like the drama going on in the salon setting. the managment however was nice.
bad,"Great relationships with store level management and associates. Employee engagement is a top priority in order to get entirety of staff on the same page with customer service. "
bad,"My typical work day mainly involved maintaining the appearance of the dress shirt tables. I learned the proper way to recover and fold dress shirts to have an outstanding appearance. The management team was not very coordinated, and never on same page. The hardest part was dealing with managers with conflicting interests having to decide which one to follow. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping large groups for weddings (I was in the men's department) or other events."
bad,They never taught me how to do as lot of the online designing of homes as much as they described. They had me watched educational videos that were so old it kept loading every 2 minutes and I would constantly be alone so I was never sure what to do and when I asked questions from other coworkers who have worked in the department I received nothing but attitude from them. They also never let me know they were cutting my hours.
bad,"I am a sales associate who cashiers, customer assists, store recovery, fitting rooms and replenishment. I work 5-6 hours per day 3-4 days a week. This started out as a fun and energetic part-time job, but due to hour cuts and poor management, it has become stressful, erratic and overwhelming. You receive little to no help when you are cashiering, being left to deal with a line of 6 or more upset customers, phone calls and price checks (there are no price check machines in store). You will quickly realize that you have no chance of growth or moving up, despite promises by management that you will receive it. You feel constantly pressured to make credit goals and customer surveys, and your value as an associate is based on that. They do not follow your availability and requests for days off, no matter what time of year and situation."
bad,"They don't schedule enough people to relieve you on your break or when its time to get off. They change your schedule while you're on the clock to make you stay later. Managements is horrible. If you call out for something important, they cut your hours for two weeks. You are often left alone to close 4-6 registers as a new associate."
bad,"Not a good place to work. Company changes positions every year. Not a stable place to work, you never know when your hours will be cut. Regional manager is somewhat of a bully."
bad,"Didn't get a good welcoming, instantly headed into training. At the start of working, I was just immediately put onto the floor with less than 3 hours of training, had no help from others. Had to learn as I went, and mastered it after a month. With that there were some times where you'd have no clue what the solution would be to assisting a customer. Management always were ticked to the point of getting ICAPs(# of customers applying for a credit card.) Assuming that they care more about that rather than the employee and # of sales."
bad,"This place was a mess in my opinion. Management was nonchalant about issues brought to them. They had an absolutely awesome thing they did where if ou were a good worker and didn't slack off then you got to do your coworker's job too. Most of them were on drugs, one I know for a fact was stealing money from the store but she was bestfriends with the store manager so it was ignored."
bad,"Management wanted nothing to do with Appliances, until there was a customer issue. At that point they would get upset and say You should have done this and you should have done that. Most of the suggestions, I had all ready done. Having to work on issues through a middle man (JcP.com) was the cause of most of the difficulties. Working through them was like being blind. I couldn't see what to do to help the customers"
bad,"I started this job as a naive teenager and it started out great. However, as time went on, I was required to do other jobs without reward or recognition. I was put in other departments that I was not trained in and I had to learn to adjust quickly. The managers also played favorites and the one in charge of scheduling gave better hours and more hours to people they liked."
bad,"It was good at the beginning but ended up just not being a good fit for me. All of my co-workers are the sweetest. Some of my managers really care, others not so much. The budget cuts really kill you"
bad,It was a rigorous job with high school environment.  It was mandatory overtime so it interfered with personal life. Not the best job in the world it pays.
bad,"If you're looking for a job in between jobs, this is definitely a great fit for you. Now, this could have just been my location but the management would never allow a break for me (And I am a minor which is a required 30 minutes of break time every 4 hours). They told me to go on break but could somehow never find someone to be able to cover me for the small portion of time."
bad,"This was a good place to work, I loved all of my co-workers all very friendly. Only thing that completely ruined my job experience here was the management. They're very rude and don't care for their associates."
bad,fast paced customer service is key for repeat business. coupons bring in the sales and add ons. store is not what it used to be and culture is badgered to open up new accounts daily
bad,very good place to work. not the best but for seasonal or just temporary work it is good money. Not enough hours to be able to live off of. I was working here while attending classes at East Tennessee State and was told that after a 3 month period they would consider full time employment. however after the first month they told me and around 6 others that we were only going to be working till the first of the year and that we were just seasonal employees. They told us this on the last few days that we had worked. not nearly enough time to be able to find another job.
bad,"Tracking trucks that came in and out"
bad,"I loved the training and my coworkers but the management is not very accessible, often gone. Works better when the manager is gone she often cause conflict within the salon."
bad,"Current store manager is incompetent and way in over her head. Store is behind work load planning, missing targeted holiday goals. Overnights became mandated to catch up."
bad,"Demand for higher sales is never ending. The quality of product provided leaves much to be desired. They always want higher number than last year, but it is hard with so many competitors and customers getting laser eye surgery. Few people know about us as we are tucked away in a corner of the main store. Also this job starts you at minimum wage and customers expect you to really know your stuff or have a degree, but you are only a sales person and do basic repairs and measurements. Two of the opticians I worked with ended up being very fake with me. I do not have pleasant memories about working here, but hey if you are in need of some kind of money, it beats breaking rocks in the hot sun. My hours were constantly being cut, the pay was unstable and I made about $8,400 annually."
bad,Manager had no respect for the workers.talk very rude to you and wanted you to be able to be ing w/o places at one time.didn't even know if workers where at work or gone to lunch
bad,When I first started at JCPenney they were an excellent company to work for but toward the end they became top heavy with too many chiefs and not enough indians.
bad,"The sales position was pretty much what one would expect from a busy holiday job.  Sometimes, the job was frantic and really fast paced due to the holiday season."
bad,The management is terrible most of the managers had no idea how to do their job. They expected one employee to do the work of three to four associates. They never wanted to provide associates with more hours because of budget cuts although they knew that more associates were needed on the floor. That is why many customers complained because there were never enough associates on the register or on the sales floor assisting customers. They expected your duties to be completed in 4-6 hour shifts while they constantly dragged you from your responsibilities to do other jobs and 95% of the time those jobs were left behind by others or they wanted you to do something for them. Jcpenney is a company that does not care for or value its hard working employees.
bad,"Can be fun if you can stay above the ""noise"" and focus on driving top line sales.  Tough to get time off and the expectation is that you are answering emails 24/7.  Not a lot of consideration for personal life."
bad,"Working here help me improve my skills in retail, not only with clothes and shoes. Working in different departments of the store were I help all as needed"
bad,"Outdated - Moldy and leaks everywhere, 80-90% of the regular clientele are 65 and above and the people looking for discounts..."
bad,"The pay is not great, they expect a lot from very little staff, inconsistent hours. This is a great starter job for high school and college students as the hours are pretty flexible."
bad,"They don't pay well at all and only allow you to work 35 hours a week.  If you stick it out, you ""might"" make it to an exempt position which will pay well but everyone else gets shafted."
bad,"They make you find something to do even if there are not any customers, which is often. You will fold and refold until you are tired because they do not want to pay you if you are not doing anything. Pretty stingy considering that I was paid minimum wage."
bad,Allow you to work another job but management is awful. There is now a lot of room for career advancement with the company. Hourly wage could be higher.
bad,They lacked structure and their company is falling down. They dont actually care about their empolyees. Everyone is just a head to count off and they don't pay enough
bad,if you looking for fulltime but wanna work part time hours look no further than jenny's they will put you on the right track for making no money and working you like your on the local boot camp. if they take the time frame way then this job would be idle for some but until then this job will be forever trash
bad,Everyone Dreads retail in my own opinion. JCP is really good during holidays and thats about it. They play with your hours constantly and they promise you advancements but do not follow through.
bad,Fun work place doing christmas holidays. Management very rude and not professional. Do not like the work pay or times of work. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you would meet
bad,"received ticket for orders needed "
bad,"They said in my interview they were flexible with scheduling and they weren't. The big issue for me was that they were VERY understaffed and everyone called in a lot, which then would turn back on you to work double shifts. It got so bad that they would call me on my days off and ask me to come in. There are quite a few mangers there and only two were super nice, the other managers were very rude and didn't seem to like training new hires. I felt that way, because I'm someone who likes to ask questions so I know and a lot of the managers seem to get very annoyed with that. Basically most of the managers have the attitude of they don't care about the job, and they would also every now and then go to have a smoke outside and they wouldn't even be on break. Also the sales are ridiculous, they mark prices pretty cheap and that causes a lot of stealing and situations with customers when they are checking out because some customers try to get it for even more cheap then what it is and most of the managers are ok with it. The sad thing is I really liked the employee's, they were all very nice and I made some good friends but it was too stressful to work there. I feel like I would've liked retail if I started somewhere else, possibly smaller and not a department store."
bad,They keep you right at part time hours (20-25) per week. Just cause they don't want to give anyone benefits . I was one of the lucky ones that started off at 35 hours a week with benefits. Their for my benefits couldn't be taken away. But..... As of right now.. I'm also only getting 20-25 hours a week.
bad,"12 hour days -6 days a week"
bad,I have worked at JCP for 4 years and make barely over minimum wage despite glowing yearly evaluations from my previous manager. I am currently looking for a new job because I feel the amount of work and responsibilities expected of me is not reflected in my pay check. I used to take pride in my job but after 4 years of minium wage I cannot say that is true any longer.
bad,"Overall, JcPenney was a good company to work for. I was able to learn how to provide good customer service and improve my critical thinking skills as a person."
bad,"No fue muy buena la experiencia, realmente no existe compañerismo, y otras cosas más negativas tampoco oportunidad para crecer como empleado"
bad,"too much emphasis is put on productivity goals based on services, instead of combined services and sales. there was a very limited clientele and the expectation for service goals was higher than achievable."
bad,pay is okay but the company ask a lot of you but does very little for you. management is horrible ive been with the company a little over two years and have been through 4 GMs.
bad,My co-workers at the time were so kind and easy to approach. My job was always extremely important to me. Would personally find ways to help get things done as well as help other complete tasks. I even made life long friends through this work place.
bad,Very easily bored with this job. It is the same thing every day. Nothing new happens. Pay was okay but hours were terrible. There was no way to switch shifts and it made it hard to find family time.
bad,This employer was always clean and I always learned new experience with this employer. The hardest part about this job was when management will talk to you any type of way.
bad,"JCP is a good part time job for people just starting to get into working. It teaches you great communication for customer service, It however is not meant to be a long term job. Your hours are based on Credit cards you open for customers shopping during that previous week and are also making LESS then minimum wage. No credits- no hours. Management will only focus and care about the employees making the store look good (Good customer service feedback, credits, etc). Later on, you find yourself training new employees that take your hours."
bad,"Very hard to work at Jcpenney very long due to a very unprofessional work environment. Although this is my first job, without much experience, it is easy to tell that the environment isn't professional."
bad,I was originally told I was hired on as permanent staff it was only after I missed spending the holidays with my family that they told me that I was only holiday help. I was constantly given the worst jobs and pressured to promote the credit card even if the customer has previously tried to apply (which hurts their credit score)
bad,"During training I was told about how great it would be to work at JC Penney.  The leads and managers would stop in and talk about what a great place this is to work.  I was excited and couldn't wait to finish training and start working.  Unfortunately, things were not as they seemed.  Some of the managers have bad attitudes and you don't have an assigned area to work.  Everyday you would have to sit at a different computer and most of the time they would be nasty, and full of dirt! There was no organization whatsoever!!!"
bad,"My job required that I helped customers find the product that they wanted and work the register."
bad,This job is a good job to start you into the Sales Associate but I recommend you do your research about which JCPenney's location you apply at. I learned a lot while I was there but they do not treat you with fairness. The management were all over the place some knew what to do others don't. Trying to find help was like a Russian roulette and if you did something wrong they yell at you or even call you out if you don't call in. Tread very lightly around them they don't play games.
bad,"Only worked their for months but .  Good management, providing employees with opportunity to give good customer services."
bad,"Would like more hours.  Not enough hours, I only work part time.  Looking for another part time position. They provide benefits, and 401k.  The schedule is mostly working weekends."
bad,"Good place to gain exposure, but at times can be difficult to work here. Due to home office being unprofessional at times, issues with glasses being done improperly and not sent out on time and not cooperating with the staff."
bad,"Stressful environment and horrible management. Met great people along the way but too much brown nosing , unnecessary drama, and playing favorites. Not worth the pay."
bad,"Management isn't the best but coworkers are great. you will not receive much recognition for your achievements, and the workplace is always a competition between employees."
bad,Most of the customers are rude. Most of the managers aren't very nice or helpful. There was one manager that I liked that still works there. She was very helpful. The best day was Black Friday because it went by so fast. I didn't like that they opened at 3 on Thanksgiving because I didn't get to spend much time with my family. Most of my coworkers were nice. I actually made a few friends. Over all I would never ever work there again.
bad,At my store they never worked with your schedule and often forgot to call back. Supervisor lied to me and said after I quit that she would never rehire me when multiple people confirmed that they do in fact hire back. If you have anxiety or depression I advise you not to apply because they will often not work with your illness and think you are lying. Also I wouldn't apply if you're awkward and weren't really well known in your area (if you're in a small town like me). Catty co-workers and overall just uncomfortable as a job. Be prepared to do grunt work for at least half a year with little hours.
bad,"It was an OK place to work. However, they use to sneak and get on the phone and listen to your calls. The environment was nice. We have our own desk, but it was very very loud at time."
bad,"Great experience to grow and learn "
bad,its ok cause you get out early but management is bad. they don't help you and when you don't finish the truck on time you get blamed. but they sometimes take away people and they don't see that. they care more about the floor than the truck.
bad,"The majority of us in IT are scheduled on a 3day/4day shift. I've learned a lot in regards of troubleshooting a warehouse sized network along with a corporate domain. I also got exposure to Unix/Linux environments. I have some pretty awesome co-workers, but we are feeling burned out, this place isn't doing anything to expand our horizon's in the IT field. We spend 5-7 hours a day printing invoices, it's by no means difficult, honestly there really isn't anything DIFFICULT about this job. This has led to complacency, and a desire to learn that just isn't being satisfied."
bad,"My coworkers at JC Penney made work so much bearable--I'm still really great friends with all of them. Almost everyone who works there is extremely friendly, helpful, and all share a common disliking for the management. Almost all of the managers/bosses/supervisors/lead were completely unprofessional--gossiped in the break room, invaded privacy, unnecessary anger, expected employees to do the impossible, the list goes on and on. Customers are savages at this store--they will tear clothes piles apart right after they watched you fold those clothes, throw clothes off the hangers and onto the ground, leave piles of clothes up to the ceiling in the fitting room, leave food and bodily functions around the store, put a $0.99 clearance sticker on an item that is clearly over $30 but try to convince you that it's correct, get mad at you because THEY forgot their coupon, and attempt to assault employees (which has happened). "
bad,"Great Learning Experience but poor management. I loved being a designer but wrong management came in turn things around. Hostile environment, a power struggle. When I informed the general manager about my previous education she said it didn't mean anything. so it was hard to move up with the company after being there for 2 years."
bad,"If you are looking for a dead end career in the hair industry JCPenney salon is perfect for you. Managment only promotes his favorites. If you are new to the industry, don't waste your time at JCPenney Salon. You will primarily be working as a receptionist if your lucky to get a walk-in or two. I was told in training to prioritize clients for the stylist who would make the company more money or Master stylists. No room for growth, stylist will not take time to help train you, you will be stocking, wiping down shelves and given unattainable goals and set up for failure. Management does not respect employees at all. This salon is poor representation of this industry. No work life balance when your new. Keep looking there are better salons for new stylists out there!"
bad,A typical day at work is ringing up customer purchases and making sure the sales floor is neat and organized. I also solicit credit apps and assist customers with online orders. The joy of it all is when I see another satisfied customer.
bad,"I enjoyed working at JCP however, I wish there was more ""customer"" interaction. "
bad,"typical day at work would be to put things in locker, clock in and go down to the sales floor, finding which dept. you'd be working in and start fixing clothes, clearance, and other things all the way on the other side of the register you'd be assigned to. This was really bad specially if  you were the only one working in your dept. unable to see customers unless they went looking for you, or just left to another register. learned almost nothing extra from my previous retail job besides you having to be working like a robot, weren't allowed to even stand still for even 5 mins out of your entire shift, else you would get in trouble, a girl lied to a manager about what I told her when she had asked to me pick up a clearance area one time when working in the bra and panties area. which got me in trouble and the manager was very rude to me warning me that she'd cut my hours if I didn't fix the problem. The day after I came in worked more than half my shift was called to the managers office only to be ""let go"" for not being productive enough, when I was busy running around all day doing my best to keep things organized and neat looking, being that the person I was to work with had called in for being sick. Jcpennys expects way to much from employees, people are not robots and can only be fast enough, or busy enough to a point. Will probably never shop or work here again."
bad,"almost everyday management always had negative things to say but in their minds thinking it will boost us up to be better in our jobs. When you hear it every day you start to feel that work is a place of punishment, and they dangle your job over your head telling you ways you could get fired. My lead manager was the nicest in the store, and I could always talk to her when there was a problem such as with my co workers who were what i'd say the more favorable in higher management. Because they could do no wrong. There was things they would say that was truly not OK, and I tried to go higher than HR and they said they would deal with it but they brushed it off because its not that big of a deal. It was sad also because our paychecks were always different, no matter the hours we worked. Nothing is guaranteed, and you have to be OK with that. "
bad,"-Slow, only busy during weekends"
bad,Co workers were great to work with management was disrespectful and not considerate of peoples feelings sometimes. I learned that customers need help and I really enjoyed helping the. The hardest part was recovering after the whole store closed for late hours. The most enjoyable part was seeing the smiles on the customers face when you were able to help them.
bad,"While I believe that most of the management team is well intentioned, they are at the mercy of the Store Manager and Corporate office. I had good and personable store managers as well as not so good. The supervisors and management teams reflected the influence and directives of the current store manager. I will not say that I had a bad work experience at JCP. However it most definitely did not inspire me to aspire to a supervisory or management position in retail"
bad,"Company is still recovering and is trying to protect their bottom line."
bad,"They schedule so few people during the day that no real work can be done, then they'll keep closers way over the end of their shift to try and clean up the mess made that day. And raises are pretty much nonexistent."
bad,"The management would never say the same thing usually. You would have one LOD say one thing and then another say something else. Therefore it would become frantic at times. Also because of scheduling, there would be nights , that were not holidays, that we would be there until midnight cleaning."
bad,discount 25% off almost everything and you can include coupons. hours are pretty good too. Managers PUSH employees to make people sign up for credit cards. You have credit card goal. You HAVE TO ask everyone 18+ even if they have one.
bad,"managers no goodl, no commission on jobs, the pay was okay, could of been more for the hard work that was done, didn't believe in giving overtime, sales associates were very nosey and backstabbing, always in everyone else's business. customers were rude and were always doing exercise walks through the store in the way of buying customers."
bad,"I was scheduled at 6 am when my availability didn't start til 11. I tried to sort out this problem with management several times and was told it was my problem, not theirs and if I didn't show up for my shift on time I'd be fired."
bad,"Hardest part of job is not actually having the help or the tools/merchandise to be effective."
bad,"Working at JCPenny is a nice ""started job"".  In my personal opinion, the staff and managment is not very friendly or supportive."
bad,"When I worked at JCP, my co-workers were great and all, but the over-all work environment was absolutely horrible..thank god it is closing down in Aiken. The manager was absolutely selfish and not willing to fix problems that were beginning to get out of hand, for example, the bug problem..I found a tick on me one day at work..I told her about it and she told me not to tell anyone else because they would freak out, well then a week later one of my CUSTOMERS found a tick on them in the fitting room!! What kind of RETAIL store has ticks??! The ticks were not the only problem..roaches, rats, gnats around the register, spiders, it was absolutely disgusting. It took my calling the Cooperate office for the manager to finally step up and try and fix it. But my co-workers were always pleasant to be around, when they weren't bashing customers and gossiping behind their backs, to include one another's..."
bad,The customers and few employees are great to work with. I dont feel that JCP really cares about the employees there is lack of training and right hand doesn't know what left hand is doing!
bad,"Some departments (like mine) it's very difficult to get credit applications in. We get returns and online pickups. These people already paid us, they don't need to apply."
bad,friendly people fair pay great staff great hours when needed understanding
bad,"I'm a friendly a person that always give my 100% at work, I never bring my personal problems in a work place. I always get good feedbacks from costumers, witch I highly appreciated because I get recognize from all the hard work that I put. I'm a quick learner I learned how to handle the fitting room, recover my sections really proper, I became a levi specialist because I came from a Levi store, so I already had experience when I got hired to JC Penney. Now I'm working in the shoe department. This job is not hard at all is just it gets exhausting when we're having short staff because a lot of people be calling out so now we got a lot of extra work to do. but most times I could handle it. I just need a better opportunity I have a lot of potential so I know I deserve something better. The most enjoyable part of my job are the friendly co workers I work with and the friendly costumers I usually get."
bad,"I learned a lot, met interesting people"
bad,If you like to work with people then this is a great job for you
bad,Not many hours except around holidays. Not much pay and forget benefits. But you get to work with alot of beautiful people.
bad,"It was a good job I liked all the positive  attiudes, always had different jobs to do"
bad,"Typical sales job, management is always worried about what needs done next rather than acknowledging what has been done.  Salary and benefits are underwhelming."
bad,If you like working with customers this is a great job.  Nice people to work with.
bad,"always fun in 1999-2005 , a lot of friendly people team players"
bad,"1. Have morning meeting, start working at 6;50 to 5;15p.m."
bad,"If you are looking for a full time job this is not the place for you. Unless you are going to be in a management position, there is no way you are going to have a full time job. Jcpenney doesn't want to offer full time because they don't want to give you the health benefits. The management is very horrible, they are not in check with each other for what they want in the store. one minute they want you to be very customer service oriented but when they see you talking to a customer for 5 minutes they get mad and nearly chase the customer away. Also they don't offer PTO until after a year of working with them. The pay is also very horrible."
bad,I didn't like the hours they put me on and the management there was a joke and also they gave me a hard time when I told them that I was going back to school and that they need to cut my hours down and they wouldn't so I quit
bad,"Your schedule will change weekly, management is terrible, pay is almost none existent. This is nothing more than a second job to have to add extra income"
bad,There is a lot of favoritism. Little to no room for advancement unless you are favored by management.
bad,typical work day is unloading semi trucks with some ok co-workers
bad,Hard work for little to no pay. All in all the job is what I expected since I had little to no work experience.
bad,"A typical day would be clocking in doing my tasks and finding other tasks to do after completing those, lunch, then leaving for home. Management was very unorganized and messy. Schedules changed on the daily bases and misunderstandings happened often."
bad,Was working there til i began getting severe headaches from perm chemicals.  and had to stop doing hair..  after stopping doing hair they have stopped.
bad,"I started working for JC Penney, Santa Ana location, as a transfer from Arizona. I know how to do my job and I do it well, but working a three story department store is very  is a big difference then only one. story department store, compared to a single story."
bad,"Always something to be done whether it's cleaning, organizing, merchandising or assisting customers. Mostly merchandised the department and was a cashier. Also had to assist customers with credit card accounts."
bad,"It was a constant pressure for the employees to push customers to open credit applications, Managers were nice, co workers not so happy, hardest part was closing tired and having to clean the store afterwards the most enjoyable was making the customers shopping experience a happy one."
bad,"Counting the diamond"
bad,"Working at JCPenney has been more of a challenge to convince myself to remain an employee with the company than anything else. What keeps most people there is the scarcity of employment in Albuquerque and the WONDERFUL people who work with us as co-workers and management. A job is hard to find, a good work environment is even more difficult to find in today's economy. "
bad,I feel the company is not looking out for the best interest of their employees and their families
bad,"A typical day at work was over whelming and rough. I only work nights and since I was a student, I had to work every weekend because of my availability. I was taught how to perform my duties as a cashier and learned how to replenish the store. Management was never there, only in mornings and most of the time at night, the manager was working in other departments. I relied on co-workers and had a decent relationship with them. The hardest part of my job was working without any assistance from management because I mostly resolve problems by my self. There were not any enjoyable moments while working at this company. Also, wages were real low and only improved in a month. "
bad,"     A typical day at Penney's consist of coming in to work, standing for 8 hour period, processing garments, and keeping up with production. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, that is how we all got through the day, team effort.  "
bad,"The company consistantly takes hours from designers, no benefits, and never really took into consideration the reality of living. Loved co-workers and was able to build clientele. Learned from classes and hands on training."
bad,the work was very boring plus there was not recongnition. Just not a happy place to work.
bad,"Days were very busy, management was slightly harsh, but the coworkers were great. Dealing with picky customers was the hardest part of the job and I learned a great deal about hairstyling and how to deal with clients. At the end of the day, knowing I made at least one person happy was the best part."
bad,"My day at work is being able to do the work needed before store opens. I have learned that retail is very unpredictable, management is good in their jobs but hard for them in this economy. My co-workers are great to get along with also to work with. The hardest part of my job is trying to get the work done in one days work in half the time with cut backs very challenging."
bad,"Helping customers, cleaning out fitting rooms, folding clothes, but during the holidays expect alot of crazy shoppers."
bad,"My typical day at the company was focused on selling to the customers. I expanded my customer service skills. Management was helpful. My coworkers were helpful, but also competitive. The most difficult area of my job was the customer, but they were also the most enjoyable part."
bad,"was great at first but because it was not timed organized it became stressful, most of my coworkers were a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job was not receiving enough work hours"
bad,Pretty much a job you want to get there and get it over with. Management do not communicate very well with associates and also put me on the schedule when not available. Some managers try their best. The best part of the job is my fellow co-workers very helpful in time of need and working together as a team.
bad,"A typical day at work for me is usually a good but more of a challenging day. Really everyday is a new challenge but an opportunity to meet great new people, who were potential customers but more like friends. I learned really how to network by meeting new people and provided the opportunity move around and get to know people much better by doing this. By me doing this, I got the opportunity to be apart of management which allow me to network much more and interact with more people and associates. The workplace have more good associates and employees by being a leader and on how to communicate and show good character. The hardest part is loving what you do but not receive the wage one or I deserve. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with potential and/or loyal customers and associates."
bad,I loved helping the customers find merchandise and then ringing them out. I also enjoyed coming to work because of my coworkers in my department were fun and made the day go by fast.
bad,JCP has changed so much in a short time. Transition is in place and employees are afraid that they may loose their job as well. I hope for future of the company for their sake.
bad,"JCPenney was once a place to build a Career from. Not anymore, Massive lay offs and Poor choices from Corp. makes JCP not a place for Middle age workers to make a living. Most employees now get only 12 to 15 hours each week to work. JCP took pride in their associates attire now jeans and t-shirts are now acceptable. It's my view that JCP has lost it's way and has forgotten just who to market too. New Shops called TOWNS are geared toward younger people and diffently folks under 35..I spent 18 years with JCP, I loved my job took Pride in doing it. I can only hope that they make their way back. Not a Nordstrom and not a K-Mart in Between with great merchandise and knowledgeable associates who care..."
bad,"worked in the same store for six years. Did just about every job in the store. Won countless awards, met the silly demands for credit card goals, rolled with the punches. I also got screwed out of a management position four times in a row. They also fired my favorite manager, Took my commission away after 3 years and brought in some bottom feeder from corporate to try to convince me I should be happy about everything. Bottom line, They don't care about their people. Management is selected entirely randomly with no basis of qualification or work performance. If you are looking for a career don't waste your time. For temporary part time work its a super easy job that doesn't pay beans."
bad,The job is ver repetitive. Pretty much ringing up sales for customers all day. Some of the customers can be very nice and cool. A lot of customers can be very hard to deal with and you don't want to help them but you have to because it's your job.
bad,"I have worked for the company for 4 years, and I have learned that even though they tell you in the beginning that they have competitive pay, great benefits, and are willing to work around school schedules, it isn't true. I started working there at minimum wage ($8.00 and hour), and in the 4 years I have been there, I have only gotten up to $9.01 an hour. At first they were giving me a lot of hours. The moment I tried to start school, the company cut back my hours so much that I dropped out of all but one class, and then even had to drop out of that class because I couldn't afford to buy the book. I did, however learn a lot working there. But I had to seek out the training. They don't offer it to you. They teach you the minimum of what you will need to know once you get out to the floor and then leave it at that. You're left constantly having to look for someone to help you. There are select managers at the store I work for, that are always there for you no matter what. But others, are only out for themselves; taking the credit when you do a project for them, that is the result of them not completing their work. Issues that are brought up to the store manager, are said that they will be handled right away but never have any real outcome it seems. If you need a day off, most of the time they don't fight you about it as long as you give them enough time to fill the spot. But nonetheless, if you need it, they give it. So, I suppose that is a good trait."
bad,"I love my job and the people, but I need more money to survive on my own. I have been there since 1995 and am currently still there."
bad,"Wonder company to work for while in high school or college, a normal work day consisted of ringing up customers at the cash register, and being on the floor answering questions about the product or making sure the product is presentable. The value of teamwork and how far good customer service can take you as a sales associate was my biggest accomplishment and what I learned. Management was very supportive, friendly and were at times like parent figures the best supervisors any employee could ask for as well as co-workers some of my co-workers became really good friends and we still keep in touch and talk even to this day being a family was always number two right after customer satisfaction which is one of the reasons I looked forward to going to work each day. The absolute hardest part of this job was the pay and putting in so many hours to get so little back that causes stress in the personal life of barely making ends meet"
bad,I loved working here in the beginning but since the changes to the company i have found it harder to relate to the work. Many managers left and it has made it harder for scheduling and it doesn't feel like the managers really care about you.
bad,I enjoyed meeting new people on a daily basic and learning how to do leader roles in my department.
bad,"Management at the time didnt show me how to run the register, or any of the job requirements needed done. Rough learning experience, but educational."
bad,"No room for advancement. Hours are always getting cut, which is too bad since the job itself is a passion."
bad,"I would have stayed with this company , but they would not work with my hours I was available I told them over and over I was only available to work 1 night a week and every other weekend JCpenney took a deaf ear to that , that;s why I quit"
bad,"I use this job as a means for movement and exercise. The hours work well with my current obligations. Good for students, and those who need flexible work hours. Could make a career starting in this position, however, not a career in and of itself. Certain managers are more friendly/helpful than others. Work within a team, but independently within the team. Great if that's your cup of tea. Bring your own work ethic, show up, and it will work out great."
bad,"In my honest critique of JCPenney, it is a  good starting job for people who are looking to enter retail. "
bad,Working for this company was great in the beginning but after a few months working for them I was very disappointed in so many things from pay hourly to the way employees are treated
bad,"As soon as I was hired, my first shift was before the store opened by myself. I was told I'd get trained on how to work the cash register but nobody helped me. There were a few coworkers who were nice enough to train me, even though they didn't need to. I rarely saw the managers. When I had told them about the training thing as I was resigning, they gave me an excuse that, ""training is boring and no one learns from it. so instead, we throw them out there to learn."" That would've been fine if THATS WHAT I WAS TOLD."
bad,"The place wasn't bad when I worked there 20% of the time. You grow connections with customers and treat them like they are ""worth"" it. Half of management including the Cashier Assistant Lead, was a total drama queen bigot, mind you a HE! If you are not his favorite, then he will try every move to make your life miserable working there. I busted my tail there all the time and I was treated like a waste. It was a pain just to ask for hours. If you don't get credit apps, they don't give you hours. But they will give you hours if someone is always calling off, and keep that employee who calls off.. It was ridiculous drama there all the time. There is no appreciation for employees there. You get a credit app, great, thats $2 in your next paycheck. But an hour later into the shift, they frown upon you if you don't get more or meet the goal from company expectations. Hours to a hard working employee is not a factor apparently."
bad,Fultondale store is hard to work for. It could be a great place if the culture of the store was better. I seriously enjoyed everyday until the culture and management changed.
bad,The employees are nice and some are hard working. However the managers are very rude and if your doing a great job they will over work you and have you do other people's job if they are slacking. Also you only get a 20 cent raise yearly no matter how good you are at the job or how many people you get to sign up for the card.
bad,"Executives and management preferred to pay contractors and outside salesmen for advice and direction over experienced long-time employees. Associates were expected to make plans decided on by executives and contractors work without issue and were held more accountable for the results than contractors."
bad,"It's starting pay has gone up ,but now it's hard too get a raise and if you do it's now once a year.It now takes about 3 too 4 years too make what use too take a year.The supervisors change so often now none of them really now the job now.It just becomes a pain too have someone telling you how or what you should be doing when they really have no clue."
bad,"Management is awful in all departments. Management won’t work nights or weekends with you. Working by yourself most of the time. Everyone expect you to do everything, including tasks that are not from your department."
bad,"My manager is flexible with scheduling "
bad,Managers never update anyone about new policies or changes throughout the store but then get mad when you do something that is not allowed anymore. All anyone cares about is opening credit card applications and hounding you until you get one or two in a day. Customers get mad when you ask them more than once and yet you have to ask thrice. Always a hostile environment.
bad,"The job itself is okay. Customers will be customers and it can be a bit stressful when you’re the only one in charge of a whole department. I find myself running around frequently because of how understaffed we are. The employee discount is pretty nice but, I don’t feel the amount of work I do is justified by my pay. The thing that has turned me off from the job is how disrespectful some of the managers are. It’s not all of them, but a handful. The rest are sweet as pie along with my coworkers. I’ve been body-shamed and lied on during my time here. Some of these managers are on a power trip and it really shows. They abuse their power constantly. It’s incredibly disappointing that they ruined the job for me. Am currently looking for other employment."
bad,"I worked here as a summer hire. I was supposed to be a sales associate (cashier/recovery), and I instead got put into online order fulfillment. I was the only one scheduled for that department several days. I had a radio (except when I didn't, which was most days,) where I could call for help, but it was a toss-up if anyone could actually help, or even that the person helping even knew what to do. This meant that for 120+ orders daily, (not including same-day pickups which meantdropping everything and doing those immediately,) I had to pick each order exactly off the floor in whatever unorganized spot it could be in, scan it and print labels to ship with it, pack it, and make sure UPS got it. In ten hours. Whenever I complained they refused to move me to a new dept, and they said it wasn't really an issue. I cannot recommend this department, butoccasionally I was required to fill in for cashiers and dot com workers, which was much better."
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was the loyal customers and hard working associates. Long hours and under appreciated by upper management. May the work culture unsettling.
bad,"This jewelry associate position was a temporary 'seasonal'. And as such, was not met with any sort of expectation that it could or would be something more permanent. I enjoyed working directly with the public, making product recommendations, assisting with sales transactions, etc."
bad,No matter your position everyone equal or below does not treat you as so. The associate discount is definitely a plus but if you over use it and coupons that is not allowed.
bad,The biggest opportunities are the culture itself. I liked working with my employees and the customers and merchandising the floor. walked the floor and met with my managers and supervisors to set the tone for the day. Observed associates waiting on customers and gave feedback when an opportunity arose as well as recognized associates who did a good job.
bad,"So JCPenney’s is a job. You get paid every two weeks, get abused by customers on a daily basis, lack coworkers so may have to handle entire departments alone most of the time, and expect everything from you yet it’s impossible."
bad,Learn to build a foundation and have short term suffering for long term growth. Complete a vision then make changes to add to what is successful. Customer service is challenged due to employees not having same page mission objectives from top filtered down and implemented.
bad,"Working here was stressful when dealing with customers and managers. Customers ask for more discounts since the clothing got “dirty”. I also learned things the hard way since this was my first retail job like no one told me how to get online orders from the back, refund online orders, and others that I forgot. If you like retail and fashion, go right ahead and might of changed since then. Discount is 10%."
bad,JC Pennys was a good job for part time work. They do not have a great training  program. They do not promote well from with in. They work well will with the school schedules and with the collage as well. they do not over work you.It is not a lot of hours most of the jobs are part time.
bad,This JCPenney I work at in Florida Mall was the worse. They don't pay you enough for your hard work. Your feet aches after each day of the amount of work is required from you an the LODs is so rude. Well majority are. And they are so unorganized. One will tell you in thing. The next will expect something else and you are left to do three different taskes a day that you will not get finished doing anyway.
bad,My task working as a sales associate at Jcpenneys was to help customers fufill their needs and help find the correct sizes they need if it’s not on floor. Another task I was responsible for was being a cashier when shifts may vary.
bad,depends on management with this company. you get a good one...your fine!......... or vice versa. District and corporate expect too much of one person.
bad,"The people I worked with were great and you were expected to work hard but I always felt like there was stuff I didn't know or wasn't given enough informantion on. That started with learning they don't always tell you if you are seasonal or not, I was not informed that it would only be temporary. Also confusing when you are laid off. It was on your schedule, some people were just completely removed from the system before their last day. I would have had a better review if we were more informed and that leaving wasn't so confusing."
bad,Only care about ICAPS if a customer doesn't  want one they expected you to keep offering discounts it aggregates the customers and probably won't come back. And training is horrible you are expected to figure it out on your own and when u ask for help they get aggravated like they don't have the time. They wonder why people quit in a week or two? Just because your new doesn't mean your not a person who may need a little help everyone has to learn one way or another and I'm sure the people who has been there awhile didn't know much eather when they started at jc penny have a little more patients when it comes to training!
bad,"Workplace culture turned toxic due to secrecy from upper management and lack of transparency. This created an  erosion of trust from associates, and exceptional associates leaving for other companies."
bad,"Typical Retail, the hours and people I work with are great, the work is tedious."
bad,"Over the last 10 years, the company has had three major leadership changes. With each change came a different strategic direction, leaving the company alienated from the customer and out-paced by the competition. Stable leadership with a solid strategy is much needed."
bad,Inbound call center with call Que as many a 200. I learned how help people order though their catalog online. Strict because it was a call center. Stressful.
bad,There is a serious lack of communication amongst upper management that causes problems on a daily basis. The messages are not consistent and it hinders productivity as well as causing conflict amongst employees. One supervisor will tell an associate to do one thing and a manger will tell the same associate to do something else. They also put unrealistic expectations on employees demanding that goals be met despite not having the proper resources.
bad,"While I had a good boss, and decent co-workers, the job itself was easy with good customers and taxing with rude customers. I only worked out front, and chose not to be a photographer."
bad,I started working here while I was in high school. It was a great first job while still in high school and attending community college. The hours are flexible.
bad,"At my particular store, the management is really poor. I love my coworkers, but morale overall is really low. None of us feel we get paid enough for what we put up with, we are constantly understaffed, managers very rarely understand what exactly we are dealing with out on the sales floor. I don’t know if this is a problem unique to my store, but it really needs to  be address ."
bad,Most work days were 12 hours long and full of down-time. You have to have an attitude geared towards finding work if you want to enjoy this place. Most employees are generally unsatisfied with their employment there.
bad,"Working at Jcpenney is hard because all the managers are often hard to find and unorganized. If the general manager doesn't like you for whatever reason, it shows and it causes other managers to treat you differently. The managers often don't follow your availability and often get upset when you have to call out. The other associates there are great and wonderful to work with. The real issue is the management."
bad,"I worked for JCP before the changing CEO's in2012. I loved the job and the people and the company, however when they changed CEO's it all went down hill. I can't even recognize JCP now"
bad,"Typical day at work you clock in, usually on your time kiosk you have what department you would be working at and what you would be doing. If you are recovery team you would be organizing your department and making sure merchandise is in the correct place if not you would take it to its correct location. If you are in dressing room you would be taking clothes out the dressing room and organizing to take to correct department dressing rooms. If you are in cashier you would check out customers merchandise, as well as recovering around the cashier if days become slow. Great managers, and enjoyable part of the job is seeing the different characters entering and exiting the store."
bad,"Don't expect much support from management, especially when dealing with an angry customer. They're much more likely to give in to the customer's demands in order to keep them as a customer than to follow corporate guidelines."
bad,The pay here is awful for the amount of time spent on the job. The only thing that the supervisors cared about was how many credit cards we could get customers to sign up for.
bad,"The company has resilience, but lacks communication needed to fulfill the level of work that is required.  There are not many corporate training opportunities which means more is expected of the average worker."
bad,"I get moved through the store why demanded to finish projects, training is much, u learn over time but i didn't get much training to begin with. Poor pay, no chances to advance, and not awarded or praised for doing a good job. Poor pay, places like target pay 11 dollars a hour and give u more hours, and i get a low payment of 9$ a hour with no chances for more hours."
bad,"I liked it at first, then it wore off. When I first started working there the managers were nice, I worked plenty of hours, and everything was going fine. Then it all went downhill"
bad,"I’m not one for supervisors with favorites and as far as I knew my supervisor had them, or if not then one. I didn’t have a problem with the walking but it was boring for me. There aren’t many hours assigned to someone in my position and I needed hours. So not good for me."
bad,"Old school management styles and work. Slow at adopting new technologies and methodologies. Work was tedious and boring, and senior management as well as managers promoted from within struggled to adapt to the changing times."
bad,I worked in the shoe department. It was very disorganized and difficult to keep clean. I learned how to sell shoes and use the cash register. I did enjoy helping the customers find their perfect shoe.
bad,"Great learning opportunity for someone in the marketing profession.    However, the work environment has lots of tension due to the companies struggle to stay afloat"
bad,"Although working with clothes and helping people shop was interesting, I found the overall workplace rather dull. It was more often than not that you wouldn't have much to do even when working the floor, fitting rooms and registers at the same time, so finding busy work was difficult."
bad,"At the time I was working for JCP I was a college student. I found the job to consuming since I also had lots of school work to do. Very long hours and short staffed made it hard to get free time. Holiday season was the most difficult with the extended hours. I was in charge of the women's dept and had to keep it clean, man the fitting room, and do the register. It was a lot to manage on my own especially during rush hours."
bad,"There is simply no communication from the top to the bottom in both large and small scale, the store is a disaster and management would rather promote from outside."
bad,"the objectives are not achievable based on staffing limitations.  the company does does pay support staff competitively,"
bad,"I would open the department alone for about 2 hours. I was in the mens department one the second floor of a store. I would have to meansure men for shirts and suits, assist them in advice and sizes for the product, clear fitting rooms, do go back, answer the phone, solicit credit cards and rewards program, check out customers and recover merchandise. There was 2 of us in the am and 2 in pm. Management just pushed credit card apps. Most employees were too slow and lazy with work.I enjoyed the hard workers because we would swarm and get things done in a timely manner or make sure a little of everything was done. I wanted to do more but the job wouldn't allow me to do better. I had too much to do with not enough resource."
bad,"handling customers and making orders. Cashing customers orders, working sometimes long hours, especially during holidays. It can be stressful at times, especially at nights when you have to fix the store after you close."
bad,"I worked in the men's department assisting customers, running the register and keeping the displays neat and tidy. I would assist the customer with on line orders. Nothing was difficult about the job, but I found it extremely tedious folding clothes all day long."
bad,"It has been some time since I worked at the company so there may have been various changes since then. When I was employed there, most of the associates were quite alright, though much of the management staff was less so. The shifts were all over the place and rarely consistent, and thus coverage was questionable amid ever-shrinking hours. I understand the retail environment quite well and realize that it will always be a mixed bag of pros and cons. I could see the job being fine for high school students or somebody wanting to earn a little extra, but advancement was nonexistent and raises were the lowest that I have ever seen in any company. Again, this information may be outdated as of now as it has been a number of years since my employment."
bad,Being employeed at the JC Penneys that hired me wasnt the best experience that I've encountered. I was never fully trained into doing my job and was penalized for things I had no knowledge of  being wrong.
bad,"A typical day is helping customers find what they need, restocking, cleaning, checking customer out at cash register.  Co-workers are fun and helpful.  Customers for the most part are nice.  Easy job.  Management stinks.  Managers are not trained well.  The training they do receive is not employee friendly."
bad,Payroll cuts required me to do the work formerly handled by 3-4 people. Hours were not promised and therefore my benefits were in peril.  It would not be a bad place to work for a second job as most of the employees are very friendly.
bad,"I worked here for quite a few years.  It was a great place to work, but once the new ceo took over and changed everything, and then even after he resigned. It all went down hill."
bad,JcPenny is a good part-time job and good to work for evenings and weekends.  It's fast-paced and physical work where you move constantly all evening and weekends.  The team members are great to work with.
bad,"Working for the company was okay, but the managers were disorganized and the managers often gave conflicting directions on what to be doing for the day."
bad,"Sephora manager and employees are very passive aggressive and have no makeup experience other than what they consider to be product knowledge. The only thing they care about is sales and not actual makeup artistry or customer service. They would constantly talk negatively about customers (and other employees) as soon as the customers left the store. The manager and other employees also acted as if training was a burden or if you asked a question about something. I honestly wouldn't recommend working there or even paying to get your make up done, go to MAC or the Sephoras in Greensboro."
bad,"Large company with lots of people running around all the time and looks and feels like a shopping mall. Management was clueless half the time, the pay was low. I personally would not go back to this company even if they paid me a high salary."
bad,"Started of as a good place to work, became worse as management changed. Replaced scheduling manager and messed everything up. Unclear instructions on tasked that were asked to be done."
bad,I felt like i was being pushed into getting people to apply for a jcpenny credit card. You have to get so many a month or you get in trouble and with that being a part time job its hard to get the quota if you're not there enough. It was a ok environment i felt like but I also feel like I have had better job environments.
bad,it was an okay job. the pay wasn't great. The customers are not always nice. most of the time their rude. the breaks are not long. It's a lot of standing on your feet. its a good first time job. good employee discount.
bad,People are generally nice. The IT environment is chaotic. Job security is non-existent. Lots of jobs have been outsourced to India. I would not recommend
bad,"Working here was a good experience, although JCPenney struggles to manage their store and employees in an effective manner. Balance between job work and life is quite poor."
bad,It was a good place to work. I had the best manager ever who really worked with me. I enjoyed the work. I had customers who came in just to see me and ask about what had come in this week. Every day was different and I enjoyed the constant movement. Most everyone got along at work and I made some great friendships while there.
bad,The company does provide excellent service for customers however lack in employing people for a specific area of expertise. Too many complaints about prices. Management is awful always having leaders come and go; it is all one way with them. You either work by yourself and struggle and never get help. The only enjoyable thing about this place is the people you work with that makes it fun.
bad,"I liked working here. although the wages were low, it had a family atmosphere. Management was nice and the staff were friendly"
bad,"I was 17 and this was my first job, I had a lot of hours which would be a plus if you need them. However, I didn't need them, but I dealt with it the best I could. I was often called to take a shift for someone who called out and if I could not come in I was put on a guilt trip. Most of management were rude behind your back, but really kind upfront. Most co-workers were teenagers while management at the youngest was 30. Most of management were power hungry and would often be a little excessive at times. I got in trouble for briefly stopping to talk to a coworker while bringing them their items for their department by a manager who quickly called the person who was head of closing that night. I often would get lost in my department  and wouldn't be reminded until I had missed it by one manager and then be scolded by another manager if they saw that it was 8:05 and I was supposed to be in the break room at  7:30.  I honestly think this location was one of the worse few, as a coworker who worked at a JCPenney out of state told me about their management and the opportunities they laid out for them and just how much better it was in comparison. Although, I wasn't their for too long I was told about how hard it was to advance and to get a raise. There was a junior manger who started their 3 years prior to me. I had came in when minimum wage was raised to $8.05, I was making $8.25 while he was making $9."
bad,"Working at JCPenney has its pros and cons.Although for me working  for this company there is more cons than pros. But what I will say about this company is that I am very happy that this job has helped me to gain various skills and how to work in the public with customers and as a team with others. A normal day at work I am a sales associate that do various of things such as fold clothes, assist customers, promote sales, bring merchandise from the stock room to the floor, and clean carts that are full of clothes. The hardest part about working for this company is having to deal with poor management and low pay. The most enjoyable part about working for this company is the discount, the skills I gained and helping customers."
bad,I did like that I was able to move up fast in the company. Management is very willing to help you do so if you put in the work to step up.  I pay and benefits could have been better.
bad,"MY co-worker are some of the most amazing people I have ever came across. The management on the other hand is absolutely horrible. They have awful commination skills when it comes to communicating with fellow managers and their employees. They are very unprofessional individuals that have a lack of respect for their work place, have a tendency to use colorful language towards employees and/or at work in general, and are negligent when it comes to customers basic needs."
bad,"Although retail isn't what I want to do with my life, I got a lot of valuable experience and enjoyment from my position. I was able to prove my abilities which let me organize and run the department using my own judgment. In retail, however, employees have to go where the need is so there are many times when your job becomes doing other tasks as needed."
bad,"There were several changes in management and supervisors just in my short time there. I was part time and never had a set schedule, I did not enjoy the way this company treated part timers and the constant changes in higher positioning was unfair as some depatment managers would give more hours then others and would have different perspectives on how to maintain the sells floor."
bad,"A typical day at work consist of providing good customer service, checking people out on the register, putting items away, and cleaning up the area that you are assigned to work in that day. Some co workers are easy to deal with and others are not. It's not a hard job as long as you are confident in what you're doing."
bad,"this hollister knows how to work you to death. with only a 15 minute break and a two hour travel time and a 6 hour shift to get through my days were never that great. besides how long it took to get there, there was a general rule : either get like us or get lost. every couple weeks they have a catalog for employees to look through and pick outfits. although this sounds exciting, the clothes there are not cheap and we barely get a discount. on top of that we had two choices of shoes : flip flops or vans. both of which are unconfortable especially when you have to climb shelves that are about 15 feet high. not to mention they move so someone could push a 15x15 shelf on you an possibly crush you. trust me i speak from experience. also, i was never trained in my duties and was constantly reprimanded however when i brought these issuses to management they wouldnt here it"
bad,"JCPenneys security definitely works with your schedule, BUT pay is not worth getting hurt. Associated outside of the dept make more than LPA's. No workmans comp considering the hands on work that loss prevention associates do. LP saves the store thousands of dollars, with little to no recognition from the store (it is a thankless job), no appreciation whatsoever. There is absolutely no room to advance either. The upside to working here is the satisfaction you get from stopping shoplifters."
bad,"minimum pay; (minimum wage). Made you stay however late (sometimes 1 am or longer) to fold all of the clothes ! When hanging them, the hangers have to be evenly spaced out. Hated this job. They give you a 20% discount, but their clothes aren't that great anyways. Would never work here ever again."
bad,"A typical day- you never know how busy it  is going to be"
bad,"A typical workday usually consists of preparing the next day's merchandise truck, resetting displays and floorplans, constant cleaning out of fitting rooms, cleaning up after customers"
bad,"This job would be very good if it wasn't for closing nights "
bad,"The company themselves, was a good place to work for the people in which they gave supervisor positions to, in my opinion were not the best choice and made the work environment seem as if were a gossip place."
bad,"They listen to and work with the customers to create a store environment that is welcoming and comfortable."
bad,"I enjoy working for the company, it is fun and the atmosphere is light hearted. I engage in conversation with customers daily. I am very hands on with this job."
bad,"Its a good place to start, the one store in Robinson,PA  its good on every aspect they keep you informed of your progress and the progress of the store  a decent amount of hours for starters, but the store 2010 in Parma OH management  is not good but is not bad,  the problem is : because of the managament the hours of the employs seen to be hurt, so  not even a decent amount of hours"
bad,"I enjoyed my first few months at this salon. In the beginning, the pay was great, the environment was clean. I enjoyed the constant flow of clientele and the variety of products available to use on customers. The cons; if you do not have your own, strong clientele base, you will barely make  money off commission, you will only receive minimum wage.The work staff there at the time was okay. You had some people very vicious and competitive. Others, very friendly and welcoming."
bad,"Enjoyed meeting new people, customers and co-workers. Typical day- Giving good customer service, cashier and stocking merchandise according company diagrams/charts."
bad,Most associates were good to work with. But if you close you never got out on time. Schedules were often changed with no notice.  Each manager or leader told you different things to do so you were never really sure. Too many people not doing their job.
bad,"No work life balance"
bad,"Its all about the management, they don't do a really good job of encouraging employees to meet goals. More of a demand, instead of coaching them on how to improve. If they did that I feel as if the reviews would be more positive."
bad,"horrible management"
bad,"The company still is  having lots of problems with their finances,  their are cutting hours, and overwork people in current schedule."
bad,"Folding clothes and helping out on the register."
bad,"•	Unload and load shipment using sit-down forklift"
bad,"Most fellow co workers are pretty great, I have stood in this company too long mainly for the experience I need for salon but also because I have developed relationships with some of my coworkers that I love dearly, but the manager, well as soon as she doesn't like something about you (cause she is judgmental) she descriminates you and deprives you of working, she has special preferences and will minimize you to work 8-4hours a week, she is the reason why state board hit and why the salon is going down hill, unfortunatly."
bad,No buisness at this salon store 7.25 an hour salon manager doesn't even do hair very slow
bad,"Working at JCPenney's was an alright experience. The're were some real nice people and then the're were some real grumps. Seems like the older workers formed a click and were not really warm or welcoming to the younger associates. There was also lack of communication, all of a sudden they were cutting hours and I got jack nothing. Just felt rude to be left hanging, not knowing if I had a job or not, or if I had done something that made the company not want to keep me. I find it disloyal and disrespectful to the employee. "
bad,"I worked in the salon, I am new in the beauty industry as a professional, and I figured JCPenney would be a good starting place for me.... boy was I WRONG!"
bad,"Customer service pays badly, you have to deal with often disgruntled people all day and the managers had no backbone because the customer is always supposed to be right. People break rules all over the place."
bad,"The home office is what you expect from a corporate epicenter.  It has onsite daycare, fitness, and dinning services.  Unfortunately, these amenities operate as more of a distraction than an aid.  "
bad,always seemed to be with adequate associate coverage. very entry level job
bad,"JC Penney has been a great part time job. On a typical day at work, you clock in and go to your assigned department. When I work the front of the store I run women' s, juniors, and men's department alone for the most part. We call for help when there are two or more people that need to be checked out to provide our customers with quick service. When you check a customer out your main goal is get them to apply for a JC Penney credit card. I was number one in credit apps last year in our store. When you are not checking people out usually there are dressing rooms that need to be cleaned, departments that need to be straightened, and customers being greeted when they walk in. The main focus is to provide our customers with a great shopping experience so they will come back. The hardest part is in the midst of multitasking you have to be aware of every customer shopping around you because of people stealing. We loose hundreds of dollars every week due to shrinkage. The most enjoyable part about my job is, I love working with people. Creating a good working environment in essential to me. Lastly, I love putting a smile on my customers faces. Making them happy in return makes me happy."
bad,Performs high level accounting activities and provides subject matter expertise for systems and processes critical to the Shared Service Center and the Special Accounting Department. Advanced analytical and decision making skills. Experienced with Account Reconciliations
bad,"The hardest part of the job was standing all day.. it was constantly on your feet kind of job, I learned how retail worked. The most enjoyable part of the job, Was meeting all the different types of people who walked in the doors, And the employees, Management wasn't bad, But they seemed to goof more than being serious, Quite lazy as well.."
bad,Store Manager did a terrible job scheduling. Some of the managers talk to you like your their children. Sales associates work really slow and wouldnt leave the store until 2am when scheduled to 10pm. I will never work there again unless I am HOMELESS.
bad,My Hours is what i liked most about my day
bad,"jcp is a completely different employer than it was a year ago. Since the sr leadership changed at the top, additional leadership changes have cascaded throughout support organizations. This ""leadership"" is comprised of people who've been brought in to ""reimagine"" jcp, who do not understand the business or environment. For the rank and file that are left after 2 huge layoffs in 2012, this has left a frustrating mess to navigate and support, without a clear path for growth."
bad,"Had spent 25+ years at JCPenney before being let go this past year in the massive headcount reduction. I came to JCP out of college and enjoyed working there through much of my career. I enjoyed the work I did and really enjoyed working with most of the people I got to work with. Because of how the company is doing and the uncertainty there, don't think I could recommend going to work there and expecting long-term employment. In doing subsequent job search, I am finding that I was fairly well compensated which is probably related to my number of years there. I also appreciated the companies commitment to 'being green' and supporting things like United Way and the JCPenney after-school program."
bad,"I love most the people I worked with, but some of the people I couldn't stand. I just couldn't stand them because of things they did."
bad,"worked with guests to find outfits in sizes they need, running register, doing credit card sales, and straightening apparel. Had a wonderful manager, and management team, feeling that they understood the needs of the community. Occasionally it seemed that corporate didn't give us room to make the store what it needed to be for the community, but was trying to get it to fit a mold that was ""easy for them to gauge."" I loved the people that I worked with and for, and the brief encounters with the amazing people in our community."
bad,The job itself is monotonous and tedious. There's a total lack of communication between management. The pay is also not very good. Anyone has to have a lot of patience to work in any retail store. Many customers are inconsiderate and ignorant. On the bright side The people I work with are amazing. I've met a lot of really interesting people and learned a lot of new things.
bad,"They tell you one thing, and expect another. They tell you that you won't work over 40 hrs a week, but you are EXPECTED to. My store manager told me that if I wasn't there 60 hours a week that I wasn't doing my job. They don't care about your personal life."
bad,"I love my job till they decided to eliminate my position. I spent hours coaching, training the stores 250 associates. Loved my job!!!"
bad,"I was a retail Sales Associate, worked 4 to 9 pm M-F, and 10 to 12 hours weekends during Junior and Senior years of High School, also worked part time during vacations while at college. Learned alot about customer service through this job."
bad,On a good day it can be very busy. I learned how to read new reports. I learned a lot of product knowledge also. My co-worker at that time were not team players.The hardest part of the job is learning all the procedures and making sure people dont take clients off your books. The most enjoyable part is the time goes by fast if you stay busy.
bad,JC Penney is a great place for high school/college student. Thats about it
bad,"A fun place to work, enjoyed providing excellent customer service to assist customers locate and purchase products, great incentives for hard-working employees."
bad,"the work there was not too bad, but i did not enjoy the work for it was very slow paced, and was only a seasonal job that required me to pick up the slack of others."
bad,"This started well, but the new leadership in the company values flash over substance and cut back positions to pay for a an ad-campaign to re-image the company."
bad,"I worked here over the holidays at the mall. If you are used to working a very face paced and frustrating job, this job is for you. I do not recommend this as a first time job, you will struggle and hate your life."
bad,It was a good experience overall. I was able to network with upper level management and grow as a Manager. I was able to manage my team while living the Core Values of JCP
bad,Management is insulting they expect you to learn stuff to fast when you don’t it’s bad the employees some help you and others just keep moving the customer are great the discount is nice
bad,"Its an okay place to work, however they dont really listen to you and only schedule you like 4 hours per day. so it is really hard to make money there."
bad,I would recommend this job as a short summer job. If you want to get anywhere higher than associate or ANY raise you will need to go elsewhere. Managers are a bit to demanding for what they are paying you. Favorite part was definitely the co-workers you meet there.
bad,"At my location, I was unsure if I was just a holiday employee or permanent. On my last shift I was told out of nowhere that would be my last day there which gave me absolutely no time to find a new job. Whenever I worked shifts, I felt like an outcast because nobody was willing to talk to me, they only worried about themselves and talked to the friends they had already made there. I was improperly trained and didn’t know much of what I was doing but was ridiculed by managers for my lack of knowledge. It was kind of ridiculous and dealing with customers complaining about coupons every 5 seconds got highly annoying."
bad,"During my time there, I've witnessed favoritism, failure to discipline and lack of diversity. While JCP is a good company to work for, I felt no motivation to go above and beyond for the company. I respected only two of the managers there because they were very motivating and focused on teamwork. As for fair pay, not so much. Employees for their first job would make more money than me hourly, while employees who have with the company for years are barely touching 10-11 an hour. I think they should rethink the wages."
bad,"I enjoy my co-workers and supervisor's company , i also enjoy leaning new things about retail at JcPenny . The only problem is the low amount of hours i receive ."
bad,Jcpenney is not the best com. Low payroll  severance  pay sucks district  h/r did not know cal labor laws gave in to customer even when policies were in place
bad,"Working for JCPenney was ok. The hours were not so great (if you got any at all). The management was kind of ok, sometimes mean and did not want to offer any help."
bad,"No one answers the phones or checks voicemails. "
bad,"I thought jcp was where I wanted to work.  I started right when the company started changing.  To try to make up for all the corporate poor decisions, we became very lean.  To the degree, it was impossible to get everything done."
bad,"Lots of pressure from management to sign people up for credit cards, they will pull you aside to tell you to sign more people up. Fairly monotonous work"
bad,"Received a job offer about a month ago from them and I never did receive training or any update on when I could start working throughout that time period (said they were “waiting on background checks”). HR didn’t follow through most of the time and there was a lack of communication."
bad,"Working there is ok, but management could use improvement. Some supervisors do not do their jobs and make the associates do it for them. Employees aren't really treated fairly."
bad,"typical day would consist of sending emails taking calls from customers, editing orders, using multiple computer programs, multi tasking, written and verbal correspondence"
bad,"The job itself isn't difficult by any means, and it was the first place to hire me so I am grateful, but it just wasn't enjoyable at all. I had to deal with rude customers pretty regularly, the store was often left a mess even with several associates working off of the register, and the management team was pretty iffy. The management team only really seemed to base employee performance on the amount of credit cards sold which almost devalued any other work the associates did. The work culture didn't help since even the associates who had worked there for years were pretty open about highly disliking their own jobs. It was an okay job, and it did allow me to gain job experience which I can now use when applying to other jobs, but I personally wouldn't work there again."
bad,"The application/interview process is simple. You apply, they email you, set up interview, and get offered a job on the spot. "
bad,"A typical day at work would be about 8 hours. At first when I was only working operations, the days would go by quick and be productive because of working on shipments. But when I started to be trained and worked as a cashier then things started to become very slow-paced and boring because of the sheer amount of other cashiers working at the same time."
bad,Managers would scream and yell at each other in front of associates. There was a lot of passive agressive tension and fights. I saw a manager punch a wall... Just a crazy environment to be in. I would not recommend it.
bad,I do not like this conpany you give 100% they only appreciate you 10%. They have lack of communication within management. Management are not on the same pages.
bad,JC Penney is a great place to meet life long friends however there is little work life balance. You’re required to work long hours and perform as if you are 3 people. The company only cares about numbers. They tell you that customers and front line associates are their priority but do nothing to show you. The pay is sad in comparison to other retailers. The GM only works M-F but expects everyone to give up their weekends
bad,"It's low-cost, corporate retail. I worked a position that required very little skill. Dissatisfaction and poor management was common. Not good for career advancement."
bad,Good place to work if you have minimal bills. they do not pay very much. they are flexible with hours. typically all the old people got the good shift and the younger people got the night shift.
bad,"crazy hours, the employee's were always lazy and didn't like to finish out the task they were asked to do over all I didn't have the greatest experience working there."
bad,"The Management was able to assist with me working hours I could work and give me a flexible schedule to balance; work, school and being a single parent."
bad,Not a place Id ever try to work at again. I know things had to of changed in the company sense I was there but the company's standards I just don't agree with.
bad,"Managers were mostly doing nothing and just on their phones. Barely helped out on floor, cared only about themselves and getting paid. Too little pay here to be given multiple jobs to do at once with only like two people per shift."
bad,"It was a great company to work for. With their current corporate leadership, it has no chance to survive into today’s retail market. Everyday you walk into work thinking, "
bad,"I came from an employer where we really focused as leaders on how we coached individuals and making coaching a mutually beneficial experience for both individuals.  It's not so much at JCP at times it is almost disrespectful and manager seems to get off on it too and thinks everyone should coach how she does, which is just telling and screaming at people and embarrassing them in front of other employees to the point of harassment."
bad,"As a retail associate you will get assigned one of two roles, cashier or fitting room attendant.  Being a cashier was stressful because you are always gonna get into a fight with a customer over an expired coupon.  Fitting room attendant is not as bad but people love to leave piles of clothes on the floor. Half the time shifts are understaffed and the managers aren't flexible with schedules which was bad for me because I was a high school student."
bad,"JCP was ok, late nights and the over time or PTO was confusing but great benefits. And That's all i can say about that company . They are very close to closing so upselling is you basic job but they make it difficult with all the inter workings of getting items to customers"
bad,Not given a fair raise even if everyone else is making more than you.  They can decide to not give you hours if they don't like you.  The managers are very disorganized.  The other employee there are really nice and friendly.  They base your pay off of how many charges you get.
bad,The associates are amazing people easy to get along with and always willing to have fun while you work but the management is terrible mostly the higher up management they have a sense that they are better and come off as “petty” not all are terrible some of them are actually amazing but the majority of them feel like they are too good to do the same work as the other associates. Also they aren’t very considerate when it come to scheduling and availability. If management was different I would have stayed .
bad,"horrible corporate environment. constantly changing standards, structure and consistency."
bad,"You are put alone at the women's department register within your first week with little to no help from management and expected to perform other tasks while you have a long line of waiting customers. Not only are you expected to quickly check out each customer while also trying to get them to sign up for a credit card, which in itself takes at least 10 minutes, you have to run to the other end to help the kids section cashiers, fix the clothing, etc."
bad,"No training, slack management, learned signage, bad workplace culture, the hard part was loading cart, enjoyable part was the creative opportunities. The typical day was stressful."
bad,"Up until the last few years, I enjoyed working and collaborating with colleagues on many different projects.  When times got tough, we started being told to do some things I didn't agree with."
bad,"- working inside the mall was fun"
bad,"The work was fine and not difficult.  I enjoyed what I did and did not have any trouble with doing the actual job."
bad,"they seem to be an okay place to work. i was hassled multiple times by management however, stating i wasn't fast enough, except when stocking the floor i would unload 2 carts to everyone else's one cart. i was accurate, motivated, and dedicated, always on time. there was no reason for the comments made to and about me."
bad,I would recommend for someone who is not easily overwhelmed. I think that they don't give you enough time on breaks but also they are in your back most of the time
bad,"Manager's have preference, that's for sure!  feel rejected by some of my co-workers, because I'm not a loud person and/or a drama queen. In some way I feel discriminated. Not a well organized place in general, also need to replace manicure materials, everything it's too old! The only thing I like about this place is, that you get to choose your working days/hours and I feel independent performing my hair services, manager is not watching over you."
bad,"Management is horrendous. A lot is expected of you for very little pay. The pay is SORELY unfair. A very stressful environment to work in. Head managers are very fake, hypocritical and are quick to blame others for their own mistakes. Other than management, the environment is friendly and energetic."
bad,"Having friends to work alongside made this job great to apply my work ethic, and feel good about the work I did. The comfortable, yet varying frequency of pace, made the job exciting. Meeting good people, was definitely a plus!"
bad,"During the holidays at jcpenny is sooo stressful and fast paced. friendly environment, the hardest part of the job was signing people up for a jc penny card."
bad,"Challenging, having a lot of task every day, keep busy though the day making it go fast, always like waiting on customers helping with their needs...."
bad,"jcpenney call center in my opinion is not a good place to work. the managers were not open, and friendly enough, and this company does not work with your schedule at all."
bad,"I have been with the company for nine long years but my job isn't secure. Due to the way they schedule me, I feel like they want me to quit the job because am barely given hours.  Recently I can barely pay my bills working with JcPenney because they have reduced me to working only 2-3 days a week: a total of four 19 hours. It's sad but this company doesn't treat it's veteran employees well."
bad,"JCP is a place to work for if your going to school and you need little money in your pocket, they will work with your hours as well. "
bad,There is a lot of different fields that you are able to enter such as different departments and you get a firsthand experience of what it is like to work in retail
bad,I had several positions there and I felt they were all very educational. I wasn't a fan of the store managers . Asm managers were ok. pretty good about time off etc. able to move up in company.
bad,"Typical day at work Sanitation, Organization, Customer recruitment, and customer service, I learned how to do many different techniques as far a haircutting and hair color are concerned.  Management was lacking as far a training and availability for employees.  Hardest part of the job was advancement in having to recruit your own customers. I enjoyed how everyone was willing to help each other even when there were differences or disagreements"
bad,"Let me preface this by saying that if the salon were under different management, it would probably be a fun place to work. I liked most of the girls working there and liked my work. But the salon manager made it a miserable, stressful job. She's very passive aggressive, takes her stress out on everyone, and nothing you do will ever be enough. Favoritism is a big problem here as well. The pay is good for a part time job, but it's just not worth it."
bad,JCPenney has changed through the years. I am dissappointed in how hours are presented to employees. You can work hard and give your 100 percent but at the end of the day the service isn't given back to you in full affect. I started as a Seasonal hire and ask to stay longer. I enjoy helping customers all day but unfortunately I have transition to another department and given lesser hours than ever. Working one day out of a week is not survival for any human being. I enjoy interacting with customers and making their day happy. I pray that change will soon come and the company will give employees whom are faithful and committed to work hard. Encourage and uplift their employees for their hard work..
bad,i thought i did my review for this joint already. i said i wasn't trained enough so they let me go after my seasonal. I blame this on poor management.
bad,"Every manager I had was horrible. The pay was below average. If you are working in juniors, or womens you will spend a majority of your shift cleaning the fitting rooms and putting away all the clothes. You will never get out on time always takes over an hour to clean the store for the next day."
bad,Awesome company and have told my friends to apply here. It was a great experience to have worked with people that I was with around that time in my life.
bad,"If you have a lot of bills and need money I would not recommend this job. During the off season you barely work. One day a week and sometimes once every two weeks. During the holiday season is horrible. Angry mothers left and right. They hate the pictures even though the pictures come out really nice. Wouldn't recommend if you don't like dealing with the general public. Take my advice and find something else that's more steady. "
bad,"You have to deal with lots of rude people, the pay is low, the hours are always changing, and there is little room for advancement. If you want to get by while working the you better be prepared to get lots of credit apps or start working 2 jobs."
bad,"stock room had bugs "
bad,"Great company to learn product development/design, sourcing, planning, forecasting, inventory management, & various other categories. My experience has given me a complete overview of how merchandise is launched from inception to the retail floor."
bad,"nice place to work while in school, depending where you are the coworkers are great people. usual day at work is clocking in and putting away all the clothes from last night and making sure you greet customers and make sure they find what they need."
bad,We used to have good benefits but that was taken away and only used for supervisors. Hours are cut to 13 a week if your lucky. the management is nice great environment overall.
bad,"Many items, are outdated, store design, equipment, paperwork, training, associates complain of underpay, or no pay increase at all most times. No 401k that was stopped as well. Same sale offers every month to consumers, no excitement."
bad,pay is not that good. they want you to work all kinds of hours and be available to work at a moments notice but will cut your hours down to nothing at a drop of a hat. not the company it was 15 years ago
bad,I absolutely liked this job only because flexibility & the amount of respect I had gotten from the staff. I can't stress enough how easy it is to work here and how warming the atmosphere is.
bad,Customer service is key. Flexible scheduling. Friendly and understanding management that works beside you instead of over you.
bad,"There are days I go to work and have nothing to do, and then there are days where I have plenty to do. There's no consistent workflow anymore, and it makes me feel very unstable. I love to be challenged, and it's a shame that my job no longer offers those challenges. Everyday you wonder if it will be your last, due to frequent layoffs. The organization is still very top heavy and opportunities for advancement are few and far between. "
bad,Lack luster and boring. The girls in the salon are great but you don't get clients and you feel cheap constantly handing out flyers. Do not recommend.
bad,JCPenny is a great place to work and maybe retire at. A typical day working there is nothing special just helping people get what they need when they walk in your store. Management always feed you and have fun things going on in the year
bad,"The only thing a cashier really did at Jcpenny other than man the register was clean out the changing rooms,make sure that the floor was clean as well as putting clothes that customers choose to not buy/return back on the floor"
bad,"Solid place to work if you're just starting in retail or currently attending school, Days were really busy there was hardly any employees working at my department,There were days when I worked the whole shift by myself for about 5 hours also closed by myself numerous times,My coworkers were really childish drama environment,Hours are non-consistent one week you would get 25 hours the next you would get 12 which was extremely weird Discounts were pretty solid that's about the only positive thing I could say about working here."
bad,"the beauty business is awesome on many levels and most of those levels are not in this store . there are friendships with other stylists  and clients that make coming to work not work. experences and interactions that add to you as aperson  . none of which have I found here .  The Manager is a god send in this madness , there is so much that is awesome in this business but none of which any of the stylist will ever see ."
bad,"Most of the time , the store was shorthanded or had extra help where it wasn't needed. Management wasn't all that great and tended to slack off. Again, many locations are different , but this particular location wasn't a good location to work at. Breaks were sometimes not even given but lunches were. Many of the coworkers didn't know how to work together to get a goal done because many did not help out when needed."
bad,"Make your schedule as long as you work weekends. If you dont get credit applications you arent going to get hours."
bad,"Great co-workers, upper management poor, only care about credit cards, don't care about their employees or advancement."
bad,Clientele is slightly nicer than you would find at a big box retailer however they feel obligated to help when demanded.
bad,Not a lot of room for growth. Needed more organization.JC penney wasnt one of the best jobs
bad,"The past 6 months have been great with penney's, recently the scheduling has changed and a lot of us have lost our prime hours and a long with that our clientele. Management has abandoned the salon at our location and our salon manager is out sick for 3 months. No management in salon currently. I'm not one for chaos, I just need steady work:)"
bad,check out people management was good it was a part time job sometime long hour during holidays
bad,"A typical day includes helping customers with questions about: pricing, online orders, refolding the apparel,  keeping the store in order, handing cash/card/check payments for items being bought right aways or payment on credit cards, or other question dealing with their purchase and/or jewerly repairs. "
bad,I have learned over the last 6 years to help customers in many different ways. From finding the perfect shoes to go with an outfit or helping them find something in particular. I love helping customers and seeing them return another time lets me know I did my job giving them a pleasant shopping experience!
bad,They just don't to care about their employees as much as they make themselves seem. (at least the one I currently work at) You will not get your yearly raise so don't even expect it. I have rarely heard anyone say they loved their job here! I mean it's not minimum wage (8.00 per hour) but we all do deserve to make a little more. This should definitely be a last option job.
bad,"* Life is a learning experience.  I learned so much about people.  "
bad,"putting away clothes"
bad,"Working at a retail clothing store is not the greatest job, especially getting paid at minimum wage. Folding clothes and having everything organized can get very tiring. "
bad,"Was an assignment job by a Staffing Company, but inside of the warehouse company of JCPenny, the care was the same for all employments."
bad,"Based on my year + of employment with JC Penny's, I was never trained for the position I was hired for."
bad,Loved working there even though the nights were all. Loved getting the discount on the clothes
bad,Merchandise sales floor
bad,I worked for this company for almost two years. I enjoyed the experience and the advancement of my customer service skills.
bad,"Active job that required constant movement, which I enjoy. Learned how to work in a big box retail store environment, how to manage a department versus a store, and how to run a mobile POS system."
bad,"I like it here, our discount is awesome, friendly co-workers... I was hired on a after the holidays, which was great...hours were than cut to 8-10hrs a week!!!"
bad,I feel my seasonal work at JC Penny was not properly trained in order to give me the fair opportunity to be kept as a full-time employee. I was used where little jobs were needed and was never trained on the cash register like the rest of my training group.
bad,"As a stocking clerk, you generally have someone to answer to, so you can put things where they are supposed to go. However, when you do not, it makes very difficult on everyone. Its not a difficult job by any means, its just not meant for a new person to roam aimlessly in the back area, without knowing what to do or how to do it. The solitude can be pleasant or painful. Its a double edged sword"
bad,Very slow during regular weekdays. Management isn't as professional as I had hoped for. Learn quite a lot about retail and merchandising from fellow coworkers. Hardest part of the job was recovery during weekends and holidays.
bad,Helping co-workers and customers was the best part of the job.
bad,"jcpenney is going through many changes at the moment, all for the better in my opinion. The store I am currently at however is full of incompetent leaders who continually brush important issues with their employees/store under the rug. Bad morale, organization, and overall leadership. Until jcpenney gets their new vision well underway (a few years at least)...stay away."
bad,Worked very hard. I learned Pricing & Signing and a different way to work in retail. Management was great. Co-workers were wonderful. Nothing really hard about JCP and I really liked working with customers.
bad,Company is being changed drastically by new CEO - unfortunately the long time employees that have dedicated themselves to the success of the company are bearing the brunt of the poor ideas and implementation of those ideas
bad,"Typical retail job. Customer service, cashiering, phones. Pay is low on hourly scale, but offers commission incentive. Co-workers and management are professional and friendly. Company needs to offer a lot more hours and higher hourly pay."
bad,If you like the retail world... J C Penney on the whole is a nice company to work for. The particular store I worked at left a bad taste in my mouth due to a new manager that was brought in. It was at the beginning of the economy decline in 2003 and he was brought in to chop hours and increase profit.
bad,JCPenney's is a good place to work and learn about customer service. The work schedules are somewhat flexable. Pay is not very competative.
bad,I honestly didn’t like it there it was bored and the store was really empty a lot of people didn’t shop there . I used to work in the back mostly I liked it there .
bad,Some managers are great some aren’t my problem with the company is the communication about points accumulating HR let my points accumulate to a a warning and then eventually terminating me instead of asking me why I was absent or late and they didn’t respect the fact that I was in college so they scheduled me almost everyday during the week
bad,Working at JCPenny was fine it was just the people AT JCPenny that stuck out to me. Made me feel like I wasnt as smart as them and that I wasnt able to do things. Some employees wouldn't even be there with me and I would be the only one doing transactions. I was very capable of all that I was doing and I was pretty good at it. But it just didn't seem like some of the people I worked with wanted to help.
bad,It’s okay if you wanna work for a little while but don’t stay trust me you’ll end up hating it as much as I do it’s a friendly environment but don’t let that fool you get a job that’s actually worth your time and effort
bad,"Working on task was rewarding, but very hard work. Fairly physically demanding. Work went by quickly but the work needed always got done. Teaches you how to move quickly and effectively."
bad,"Credit cards, credit cards, credit cards. That is the only thing that matters and the only thing management cared about."
bad,"Store culture really depends on the current store manager. Been there almost 4 years and have had just as many store managers, each one creating a different environment. Hardly any promotions unless the new manager wants to fill the store with his/her people and get rid of the old. But schedules are usually very flexible. You can usually get away with doing very little. Work is pretty easy."
bad,"The amount of stress the job gives you isn’t worth worrying there. They’re very strict with their standards, so don’t expect any slack. They treat you well and work with your hours, there’s just a lot of pressure."
bad,"As a department store salon it is a good place to learn about products when first starting out as a hairstylist. You learn the ins and out of a salon and you get the experience of working the front desk and being a hairstylist. The downside is management and the lack of walk ins that you receive. You get 50% commission and while that sounds good, if you don’t already have a clientele 50% ends up being equal or less than the hourly pay. Which is only $8.50 starting out."
bad,The company is on the brink of extinction. They are doing every thing they can to stay relevant in the brick and mortar environment. The company implements a lot of new ideas and trends to try and keep up. The company has a lot of turn over and makes it hard to maintain policy and profits.
bad,"Working as a part-time morning Stocker at J.C. Penney isn't a horrible job (especially compared to other jobs I've done in the past), but you just don't really get anything out of it. The pay is minimum wage, and the hours are so scarce that you're making next to nothing on a weekly (or bi-weekly) basis. "
bad,"JCPenney is definitely quite the place. A typical work day as a cashier involves making sure you are where you need to be, then standing at the register and checking out customers. When there aren't many customers, you're folding and refolding the same things everyday. For a 5 hour shift it feels as though you worked 8 hours, and when you see your paycheck, it's easy to get upset and feel that you aren't being paid enough for the work you do, that is, if you're doing everything the managers tell you to do at any given time during work (and actually doing it). Hours are wildly inconsistent as I have only worked 5 hour shifts for the past 4 months and maybe only work 1 day a week, 2 if I'm lucky, and it's only because they push cashiers to try and motivate customers to sign up for the credit card. If you don't get enough to sign up, then your hours are decreased dramatically. Promotions are little to none unless you are already in upper management (in terms of Shift leads in store). I have been a cashier for quite some time, and have witnessed new hires taking positions that should be given to long time workers who have enough experience to be there."
bad,"It was very busy, the expectations were very unreasonable. But I'm glad I had the opportunity in retail. Basically I return items and clothing to correct departments and helped to keep store neat and in order."
bad,"Great work environment. like a second family"
bad,"Has gone downhill in my 4 plus years of employment.  Can count on one hand the number of supervisors that are still employed at the warehouse  .I do work 40 hours per week, but some departments are working only 25 to 30 hours."
bad,"Management is rude and unwilling to help you out. If you get confused or are doing something wrong without knowledge that you are, you are met with very rude and belittling supervisors. Were not willing to train on other things so I could take more hours or shifts. When I was let go there was absolutely no notice I was just not on the schedule anymore."
bad,"I am a Temporary Support Associate right now. So far, I have no idea if they are still keeping me or letting me go. "
bad,"I worked in almost every department and have been there for 2 years and get paid less than people who just started. The pay is not worth the work, for me personally. They work me everywhere in the store and I still get paid poorly. Management is frustrating and sometimes rude to you in front of customers. Overall, it sucks."
bad,"It could have just been my store, but JCPenney seemed to have a terrible management style, and not much room for just anyone to move up in the company. Only those which were the favorites to upper management were given opportunities to move up. Extra $2 was given on your paycheck for every account opened."
bad,"When I began at JCP the management and staff were great, as years progressed management changed to become worse at all levels and this was the most frustrating. Procedures were in place and new management wanted to change them eventhough they were from corporate."
bad,"No place to go if your mid management, they make you an offer then you start and can't work more than 35 hours per week.  and if you take those 5 hours X 52 weeks that's a large % of that salary you where counting on.  I was told 35 hours is because they care about work life balance than all the salary managers are working 50 hours a week.  So either that's not true or they don't care about there managers. I think corporate cares but on  district and store level not so much."
bad,"flexible hours, young work environment."
bad,My job is to clear out the fitting rooms and I also help straighten the racks and tables when I have finished clearing out the fitting rooms. The hardest part of the job is just keeping up. J C Penney needs more employees to get the job done. They need more employees to keep up with everything they do. I enjoy the employees i work with and the supervisors. They treat me fairly and I enjoy coming to work.
bad,Not quite sure of how stable the work enviroment is at JCPenney call center.  Older systems and lack of desire to move forward along with unsafe surroundings bring tons of questions.
bad,"While JCPenney works well with your schedule, if you have worked there for a long time. The pay is awful. They could care less about their employees, because they are so busy trying to keep the business afloat. I work back at customer service, and their .com delivery process with trucks is AWFUL. Something always goes wrong for the customer, and nothing has been fixed. They are losing a lot of money because of it."
bad,"JCPenney exited the Casualty Insurance business, which is why I left this job.  The Management Team was very fair to work with and office was very comfortable. The Store Audit Team was also assigned to this facility and I participated on some store audits."
bad,"Cashier at JCP,"
bad,I transferred from New Orleans and they was not willing to pay me what I was making in new Orleans I feel the pay could be better specially when you have a family to provide for min. wage is not a good pay for someone who is 30 + with 3 kids
bad,It was cool easy fun but I personally don’t feel I was treat fairly my last 3 Days.   I   totally feel that they overlooked my skills and only was focused on get credit apps more than having a satisfied customer/service.
bad,Casual work place where everyone helps each other assist the customers. I found the ordering system interesting everyone is trained to order merchandise that is out of stock. Far as the windows department managing the ordering system for blinds was the hardest part of the job. It is a different system then the regular Kiosk. One of the things I enjoyed working there is that everyone treated everyone the same even though they we are from different cultures and background. I also met some people at work that I could hang out with.
bad,This review concerns the morning team. We are given all the odd jobs piled on top of our regular assigned duties. We get reprimanded so easily because we handle just about every aspect of the whole store. Though our personal manager is great at giving us encouragement we also feel so much pressure because of everything we have to do. Everything has a time limit which is done with a very small group of people. How do you expect to get a job done when you only have 10 people to work on a job meant for 20. It wasn't always like this though Penny's ever changing environment is mostly the problem.
bad,"I was assaulted by another coworker with a hanger and nobody seemed to want to do anything about it. The person who hit me didn't get into any trouble at all and I had to wait several weeks to be transferred to another department. If you don't make your credit card goals, you are reprimanded, even if you aren't in an area to push credit cards. There is lots of favoritism to certain employees, they get the days off and the better hours."
bad,We basically did retail during our shifts. We would recover the store/ our designated department and ring customers up whenever there is a line. The associates there are all very nice but the management there is horrible. They're constantly expecting more than what the associate can handle. They say flexible schedules but when you need a day off for a doctors apt. They will schedule you when they see that you requested the day off and the request got rejected.
bad,"When I first started working for JCP it was an excellent environment with great management and good working conditions.  As time moved on that changed;  good managers retired or moved on and were replaced much less skilled individuals.  Company culture changed from an employee-first organization to a corporate-first feel.  Benefits changed to programs that were more expensive with less received.  Titles (and associated pay rates) were downgraded and changed from Managers to Supervisors to Coordinators to ""Specialist"" (whatever that means).  Retaining good store-level employees became less important;  they were reduced in number and piled with more responsibility with no additional compensation or benefit in title, pay, or training.  What had been a great place to work and advance became a hellish environment of threats and constant pressure.  I left during a departmental ""reorganization"" which would have downgraded my position and pay but required the same work.  Would no longer recommend them as an employer."
bad,I was only there seasonal so I haven't had too many bad or negative things to say about it but the people i met on my journey there were great friendly and helpful i haven't had any bad experiences with guest
bad,I wouldn't recommend anyone to work at this job. The work was easy but the co-workers that work there will try to do anything to get someone fired but it's best to just come there for work do what you supposed to do and go home.
bad,"Hours are way too flexible....sometimes work 30 hours sometimes 16 hours....A lot of customer contact, which I enjoyed because I enjoy assisting customers and or those I work with."
bad,"Help customers with their shopping, assisting with getting additional clothing to try on and running registers."
bad,"like any other retail, always the pay could be better but what would one expect working at a retail store. the management was okay so far when i work there. no problems with anyone or co-worker. it was nice environment to work at"
bad,"The schedule is so random that if you need another job, you can't get one. On an average week you get 18-20 hours, because if you're full time they're required by law to give you benefits. So they have 7-8 people per department working part time, all with random hours."
bad,"It is great for someone starting out or a college student who can't devote much time to working but that's about it. If you really need money to pay the bills this is not it. The pay isn't that great and the amount of work you get depends on the company's budget, which at times can be very bad. You're also hassled about opening credit cards for customers. A lot of your job ratings are based on this which is not fair because your job rating only depends on if someone wants to make that financial decision or not."
bad,"They get stuff done! I hope all retail is not like this. Because of this job I will never work retail again. It was exhausting. I was on my feet a lot, but it paid 9 dollars an hour so that's not bad! The coworkers were not in any interest of getting to know each other."
bad,"JCPenney was my first job, and where I once loved it, I now hate it. The management where as they were once very kind, understanding and fun, have turned into people who don't care about your personal well being and make you feel bad about not only how you do the job, but yourself. I have done nothing but work as hard as I possibly can yet the management are still not happy with how I work. JCPenney's has been apart of my life for some years now and I am sad to say but I will be putting in my 2 weeks at the JCPenney in Duluth. My mental health goes first, and the management will never see that of their employees."
bad,Associates that work there have a lot of drama the. The management didn't do their job properly. We didn't get much compensation for applying customers for credit cards. Advancement you didn't move anywhere a stale job that only works you as little as possible.
bad,When dealing with the customers that will call in. You get to talk to people from all walks of life. You get to build trust with your customers.
bad,"I didn't expect much out of a part time job but I was still disappointed in how this particular JCP was run. Management was rude to associates, especially when under pressure. They had incredibly unrealistic expectations as to the speed at which tasks should be completed. They all just seemed interested in putting the blame on others instead of taking responsibility for their mistakes. Overall, coworkers on my level were pretty nice. It's a really easy job, just like any other retail job, but you just need to have a certain level of tolerance for rude behavior. This is something you're obviously going to come into contact with in any workplace but especially don't apply here if you have a low tolerance for a rude, sarcastic and incredibly inconsiderate management team."
bad,"I was employed with JCPenney for 34 years, I earned awards Customer Service and Management Roles, however, when there was a TEMP CEO that almost ran the company into the ground, many management associates were let go, myself included."
bad,Looking for something different. A change. Like working there and meeting different people. Also like that this company had benefits.
bad,When I worked here management was a joke. Right after I left three managers got fired including the store manager. I personally worked in the salon where there were overpriced services and I was getting minimum wage.
bad,"It was a nice working environment at JC Penney, the employee discount was a great plus, and our breaks were flexible. I really enjoyed doing hair."
bad,large company good management lots of perks and good place for being a large franchise. I had this job when I was 16 and loved it!
bad,"Fun work place with nice staff and management."
bad,JCPenney is an enjoyable workplace where I learned a lot about customer service and increased my people skills but the ability to move up within the company is very unlikely.
bad,"greeting customers, helping them find what they need, ordering them product, that they cant find inside the store..and the hardest part of the job is when the customers cant use the coupons and they just get a lil upset about. but i learned alot from my co workers showing me how to use and do things around the store....And the most enjoyable part of the job is when those best customers come in and ,make your day, or you make there day and they tell you thank you so much for making my day im really glad i came in this store today, you make me wanna come back everyday."
bad,The JC Penney upper management doesnt give the salon much thought. It would be better to not even have one!
bad,"every day was fun, I had the best supervisor. I got to great and meet friendly costumers daily. I had to keep my area and all the clothes in order around my department."
bad,"Good Company.  Good People. Company is trying to get back on track.  Top leadership is under lot of pressure to do this,  Hard part of the job is you have to do all the jobs.  NO time to really be effective.  I enjoy the people.  Workers care and is a good place to work."
bad,"I love helping people and making them happy by serving them and finding what they are looking for as long as it is about clothes,helping costumers by saving some money on they shopping,we have a great team at jcpenney,we love setting goals every day and working and helping each other out,there is no hard work because i enjoy what i do....."
bad,"Every day at work at JCPenny was interesting because you can always encounter something new. Whether its an unruly customer or a grumpy manager, most days were not fun. Coworkers were mainly good and a mix of young and old. Managers, as mentioned, also ranged widely from relaxed to overbearing. I learned how to use a POS machine and become more efficient at it, but the clothes folding techniques are nothing revolutionary. Hardest part of job was customers that were a pain. Best part was 30 minute lunch breaks to get away from it all."
bad,"A typical day at JCPenney begins at 10 am, with a morning meeting, informing associates of any changes, major adverstisments for the day or week, recognization of employee achievements, ending with a morning cheer. Each day at JCP I meet new people and often see the regulars, no matter the type of customer I have learned to provide excellent customer service by greeting the customer, offering my assistance, and informing them about great deals, or coupons going on for the day. I encourage the customers to take our surveys to help me and our company know: how we are doing, what we can do better or what we can eliminate, most importantly I encourage each customer to take the survey so that they get the guaranteed coupon after doing so. This brings them back to our store and keeps them highly satisfied. My location JCP is filled with vibrant, colorful, and positive attitudes, we work together as a team to present a beautiful clean store, we work together to make sure that all items are on the floor or neatly organized in the stockroom and availble at the customer's request. The hardest part of the job for me is getting customers to not throw clothes on the floor and sometimes the hardest part is dealing with bad attitudes, however, I realize that we all have bad days and I musn't take it personally but do all that I can to be positive and offer each customer a pleasant and fair experience.The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a highly satisfied customer and working with my positive and fun co workers to make the store neat and clean and beautiful."
bad,"Greet and solicit customers to home interior work. Input of orders from Decorator, phones, and reporting to upper management."
bad,"Too much work for less income, they don't care about employees. Income it's not enough for all the work that you do. No matter how hard you work, they don't appreciate you. "
bad,"As a customer service rep I checked out customers using the cash register, when my section was not very busy I would go to fitting rooms and get all the clothes out and put them in the correct spots. Once the store was closed we made out section nice and neat them we helped everyone with there section so we could get the store clean in a timely manner."
bad,Worked long hours. Enjoyed working with customers. The management team was helpful but no room for advancement.
bad,pretty decent place to work
bad,Typical retail store. Focusing on maintaining floor appeal and helping customers.
bad,Jcpenney was an awesome job for when I was 16. Jcpennet has really good associate discount and clothes. I worked here 3 1/2 years but I left because it was impossible what I was making at this job. There was a time I asked the manager for a raise and he said no that it was a bad economy that he would only give me a penny raise. I had recently graduated so I had to make mote money to get started with my life. I would've stayed but that's why I didn't.
bad,"fun , how to fold dress shirts , management was excellenct, co-worker was great, going to other departments and clean before you could go home,most enjoyable part room for advacement"
bad,"My position was eliminated at the start of the year, along with numerious co workers. given the option of taking reduced hours, or being terminated (the severance was a joke). Hours are so inconsistent now. The managers dont really care. They still keep their 40 hours to hang out in the training room, or the office. Or find new spots in the back to hide their stuff till its marked down. And when you do ask for more hours, they give you some sob story about how they have to cut 100 more hours from the schedule."
bad,the management was poor and the environment was horrible. The floors were over crowded. There was no team work environment. the management was not encouraging
bad,this job was my first job. i applied when i was in high school and was my beginning to retail. i was hired as seasonal during the busiest holidays. then was given a part time opportunity. great discount and management was good.
bad,Good work environment.  It was easy laid back work. Nothing was hard. It was busy especially during the holidays.  I like the menace Department. fair treatment .
bad,When I worked here I had really awful hours and pay. I was expected to do way more work than one person can handle. All I got out of this job was experience in customer service.
bad,"The salon department is a joke  Corporate  Has no idea how to run a salon, which leads to the salon being neglected hardly any backbar or color and huge turnover"
bad,"It was a decent job. I was expected to work every Friday night and most Saturday and Sundays, while others in my department got nearly every weekend off. The worst part of the job was being forced to get as many credit card applications as possible if you did not meet your goal for a month you were questioned about it."
bad,"JCPenney doesn't have enough personnel to undergo the demand on a daily basis.  Because of the lack of personnel and hours, every member has to do excessive work in the same hours, sometimes there are only 2 cashiers for rush hour.  The customer complaint a lot about the situation, but JC Penney doesn't have the budget to increase hours."
bad,"If you want to make an impact on a company this is the place.  There is so much to be done, but the new CEO has a clear vision and with her guidance and change management I think they will make it."
bad,Es una compañía donde solo se beneficia el que hace un mal uso de la descripción y el desempeño de sus compañeros. Creo que todos merecemos la mismas oportunidades si poner preferencia o amistad sobre otros compañeros y simplemente dejándose llevar por las metas logradas por el individuo.
bad,Hard to get them on the phone to speak to someone get the runaround if you are going back don't they will not show up for the interview and leave you sitting there to someone else interview yoy
bad,"They do not care about you or your families . You can only be absent, late, or leave early 2 times total in 3 months (90 days) before being issued a policy violation.  You only get 24 hours of life time balance PER YEAR.  They expect you to disregard your personal lives and children for their numbers and production.   You could be in a fatal tragedy, or a family emergency comes up  and you're unable to come to work....if the issue isn't work related,  they dont care -they will not excuse your absence. But they say they ""understand"" life happens.  No they don't. I had to work with a bruised rib for 2 weeks because apparently the note my doctor wrote wasn't as credible as the note I had to WAIT FOR from a physician that works with the facility. What makes their doctor better than any body else's?  They want us to work harder for zero appreciation,  zero raises or promotions.  Of course in the summer , its over 100 degrees in the warehouse,  still expecting to move at 1000mph . They don't offer us ice,  water,  Gatorade, free food... nothing.  Then the supervisors dare have the audacity to tell the employees about us always walking away from our stations for a period of time for ice and water, talking about ""we can only get that during lunch and breaks"" . Wth. And in that same conversation,  they gave us a ""heat awareness"" lesson.  🤦🏽‍♀️🙄Ive been here a year and literally I'm doing the saaaammmeeee thing ... and that goes for everybody I was hired with. But at other jobs , people are promoted after only a few months of employment.  I definitely wouldn't recommend being here."
bad,"Working at JCP was the worst decision ever made, I was constantly working hard and over looked for a position that I was qualified for.  After I stepped down from my Lead position, I was still doing management assignments that I could not get away from. And also the constant change of my schedules without any knowledge to me."
bad,my managers were extremely rude and pushy towards me getting credit card signups even though I did not work the register more than 3 customers a week.
bad,I had a good time but the managers weren't that helpful. And it didn't have a good work place environment and I wouldn't recommend this to a friend. And it was very difficult to work with my co-workers.
bad,"I was only seasonal during the holidays. But, my department manager was a paranoid maniac and a blatant southern conservative who wanted her ethnic employees to ""remember their places."" My manager was controlling and usually angry about personal things that had nothing to to do with our jobs and would engage in departmental gossip with other managers on the floor. She made it almost impossible to work effectively and her attitude and lack of leadership diminished the department's sales and customer service."
bad,The company comes off as great at first till you get in and everything is a mess the staff is just ratchet the supervisors really don't care and if you don't live on the east side the commute is horrible
bad,"You learn really good customer service skills"
bad,"It was fine at the beginning, but became harder to accomplish everything tasked to me in the time I was allowed per day."
bad,"Hours were cut to easily. Employees don't matter. The costumer is always right no matter how wrong the actually are. Management lacks leadership, and associates are expected to raise company from inevitable failure"
bad,It was great in the being but I hated working there. Employees weren't treated fairly short staff pay wasn't great overall the employees and customer were the only good part about the Penneys
bad,"Far too many people with the title of LOD; large focus on sales/credit card application quotas. If quotas aren't met, an LOD will threaten you with cut hours or termination."
bad,Not enough hours or pay to give to the employees the benifits seem to only apply to uper managment employees arent recieving much hours but they continue to hire more people to have them still waite to go to work
bad,The hardest part of the job was picking up slack/shifts since the store was constantly understaffed. The 6 hour minimum for a 30 minute lunch break and a 15 minute break in general was unfair as management would schedule 2-5 hour shifts.
bad,"I worked in the women's department and it was a wreck. I loved my coworkers but that was the only things I enjoyed. Most of the time you did not have another associate to help you in the largest department, management wouldn't let you do your work the way you wanted to even if it was more efficient. Women department was also responsible to go help check out customers when it got busy, putting us behind in our department."
bad,"-Lots of work to be done."
bad,Dirty work areas.  Co-workers do not pitch in to clean their area.  Rude co-workers.  Did not like being a part of this team.  This was not a good experience.
bad,"Working here couldn't really be described as a job many would enjoy, but if you need something to pay the bills until you find a better position whether within the company or a different one it will work."
bad,It started off as a nice place to work but the hours become super inconvenient and inconsistent and started conflicted with my school schedule even though I had talked to them about it. They were also very biased when it came to playing favorites with employees and giving raises. EVERYTHING was determined by how much JCP credit you could con onto people. They expected you to push credit on EVERYONE including customers who barely spoke english and very elderly customers. It was kind of disgusting and ridiculous how much we were expected to PUSH credit onto people. We even had discounts just for applying and to a customer that sounded great until they unknowingly got approved and didnt know what to do from there because they didn’t want a card
bad,"Although JcPenney may have been a good start out place for anyone, orientation was poorly executed. If i remember correctly, training was only for one day. When i finally started my first day on my own, i had no clue or the knowledge on how to perform my duties."
bad,The company is not very good and compensating for earned icaps achieved and is not very realistic with the goals they set their employees depending on which department you are working in.
bad,"Working in stock area, floor, and providing customers service was awesome. Meeting different people and helping them find merchandise was fun. See kids face was fun."
bad,Management isnt very knowelgable and expect you to do a large amount of work when its unrealistic in the amount of time given. Attendance is a joke and not followed along with never getting the right amount of recognition unless you sign people up for the dumb credit cards. Hard work isnt appreciated. No room for career growth. Asked many times to change to a different job position to no avail.
bad,JCPenney's was a good experience. It taught me a lot through my years there about customer service and how to promote thier JCP card. It was fun and good job.
bad,"I really enjoyed working at JCPenney, it was challenging and satisfying. However, when they changed I was not impressed at all."
bad,"The work was fine. I appreciated that it taught me how to use Word, Excel, and Access. I also liked the bonuses I got. But JCPenny sold Eckerd, so I had to be moved back to JCPenny after, which was a hassle. There was no future for this job because of that."
bad,"Work was very competition based, if you did not meet certain numbers you were threatened with termination and I didnt enjoy having to pick up the broken pieces of a once thriving company that now seemed desperate."
bad,"I was working temporary for two months. Very stressful & difficult. There was a manager that was tough on all of us, when I got cut off from the job, there was another new manager,"
bad,"Lsst week of my training the company informed us that they have bed bugs by having a safety meeting. Co workers were finding bugs EVERYDAY. Terminex comes to the company to treat but they do not treat the chairs everyone sits in. You can not bring in any alcohol to spray your area. So you have to sit there paranoid hoping and praying a bed bug doesn't get on you, you take it home and it lays eggs now your house is infested, then you have to throw out all your things. Its not worth it i quit for that very reason. They clearly dont care about their employees. "
bad,Making 7.35 a hour was not enough for my living cost. I was also only schedule very few days. I was not able to fully provide for myself because I was not making enough.
bad,"The store manager is a complete jerk. He has no regard for the situations that employees may be dealing with and makes no attempt to accommodate schedules to help individuals. He is very arrogant and cares only about himself. He has demoted people from positions that they have been in for years just to save money for the company. This location is like high school, everyone talks about everyone and this often creates a hostile environment"
bad,"I had emergency had to leave out of town spoke to the manager 3 days about it before leaving she said she will take me off the schedule the day I had to leave turns out they didn't I was not thought all the things I was suppose to learn."
bad,It was hard to work when there wasn’t that many workers to help you with customers. The company didn’t really take care of its workers. The store wasn’t always open on time.
bad,I worked very hard at this position.  I was very clear at making sure they understood that I don't work Sundays.  I was assured by management that they would not ask me to work Sundays.  I was then yelled at for not wanting to work a Sunday shift and was questioned as to why I even needed Sundays off.
bad,Many companies I worked for manufactured for department store like JC PENNEY.  There are strict guidelines that one must follow in order to have a healthy relationship with them.
bad,"Management did not do a good job at training new employees. They really pushed selling the JCPenney credit card, which no one wanted. The management was not the nicest."
bad,"overall jcp needs alot of work ; to begin with the narc down to the coaches ."
bad,a typical day at work there is stressful because customers are rude a lot of the time. management is tolerable. the hardest part of the job is cleaning at the end of the night.
bad,"A typical day for me at JCPenney is working with customers correcting orders, reordering orders. Contacting vendors, delivery companies, store locations and customers to correct orders or to clarify what needs to be done on a customers order. Work place is high phased, very detail oriented. The hardest part is telling customers we are still trying to fix their order(s) after they already been told by other reps the same information who have not done any of the needed work to get the information for the customers."
bad,"Awesome people to work with, but of course like any other retail job it gets crazy during the holidays.. Managers really care about you and there are times you are awarded with free food!"
bad,"On a typical day I would assist customers with finding merchandise, operate cash register, assist with checking fitting rooms, encourage customers to sign up with a credit card to save money, assist customers with online orders."
bad,"I was only set for part time, and I worked at least 11 hours a day. I learned how to restock, put clothing back where it needs to be. I did not enjoy working with coworkers."
bad,"Management was terrible, there was times where i would only work 4 hours a week and others would get a lot of hours just because they were friends with the managers. on top of that they expect too much of you, and set unrealistic goals or associates"
bad,"This would have been a great job, but management was terrible. I volunteered to work Thanksgiving and Black Friday, in exchange to have that Saturday and Sunday off to be with my family. My boss scheduled me for the whole week and most days I stayed 3-4 hours late. Scheduling was always a nightmare. Management never listened to my school hours."
bad,"Upper management had unrealistic goals for the locations, would go around management and hire sales associates who were not photographers, force guests into packages with bad photography and weird borders."
bad,"When I worked at JC Penney Salon, I would sometimes have one customer for the whole week.  The manager was there maybe once or twice in our location per week.  She did nothing to help generate sales or promote a better working environment.  My fellow employees I worked with  were very pleasant.  No cut throat attitude and light hearted atmosphere.   No drama."
bad,Personally I didn't really enjoy the job what so ever. But over all the company was fair to their employees and the staff was very cultural diverse as far as ethnic backgrounds. So it was interesting to work with so many people that came from different countries.
bad,"Not worth your time. I learn from a big mistake. Great pay, but the work environment is not good. That's all I want to say. A typical work day is slow pace. I did learn a lot. you will be doing digital exam basically replacing a eye dr's job not recommended."
bad,Required a huge work load and would under schedule us. My team would enter at 4am and would still get paid less than the sales associates. They were not flexible with time off and would only schedule 4 hour shifts. They were very unorganized.
bad,"-a typical day at the retail store "
bad,They didn't always give you the time you may have asked for. They were always scheduling you for every weekend. The younger generation never were trained properly to be able to work the cash registers.
bad,Once a great company but with the internet the use of the brick and mortar is becoming a thing of the past. Customer service is decling because of it.
bad,"You can have the best customer service and treat every customer great but if you can't open credit card applications they will be constantly on you. They value that over anything. You do get 2.00 per app but its still stressful when they constantly ask you over and over again to open more. Even if your department has hit the credit card goal, everyone has to get a credit card. What they do not understand is that everyone who wants a JCpenny card has one and whoever doesn't does not want a credit card at all. There is no work-life balance at all. Your going to be working weekends but that comes with any retail. Management could be better. They have offices where you can go if you need something, but there never there."
bad,"Everyone got along with everyone. The staff really made you feel at home. If you had any questions about anything, they were happy to help and attempt to answer. "
bad,"I worked for the JCPenney Salon.  The management knew close to nothing on how to run a Hair Salon. "
bad,"They give food for alot of different events, but no one who works at JCP is happy about working there. Its not a place you want to be for a long time, a summer job at most maybe but thats all."
bad,"I love meeting new people, it was a pretty easy job overall. I got to learn a lot there. It's a great place to work for if you like folding clothes. It's a pretty chill place over all"
bad,"Fun and very friendly employees."
bad,Do what you're told and offer extra services. They might cut your hours alot depending on your job title. JCPenney was fun at first because I had a lot of hours I got to work. Then it went down the toilet in my experience.
bad,overall my stay there at this company wasn't for too long but what i knew for sure was retail was not in my dream goal job description!
bad,"For me, when I was down on work due to being laid off. I was always able to work here through a Temp Agency. I like it for it being a warehouse job. But I think it closed down."
bad,"This was a decent company to work for. I started there during the holiday season, got promoted, but then lost most of my hours for reasons that weren't told to me. At one point, I received 5 hours a week."
bad,"A good job for someone who wants a job that requires a lot during holidays but not much at any other time. I learned about merchandise and how it's priced, marked down, and restocked. I also gained more experience in customer service and working the register. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers"
bad,You need to work as a team and help your co-workers to help take care of the customers. A typical day is to help help restock and clean your area and wait on customers.
bad,"·	Provide customer service, cash handling, and keep area organized. I learned to stat calm in very high stress situations and always treat customers with respect."
bad,I choose not to review my employment at JCPenney as the position I occupied no longer exists and the management team at that location has changed and no one would be available to speak with
bad,"a typical day at Jcpenney is ringing customers up, cleaning fitting rooms and selling the Jcpenney credit card and cash handle. Help customers find the right item for them."
bad,I enjoyed the work there and the people where always nice to me they showed compassion for the work and I always felt welcome the where very understanding well kept place
bad,A typical day at JCPenny is changing signs for sales. Making sure that you have the right signs up and making sure that the sign matches the clothing. I really didn't like working here because they didn't seem like they wanted to help out employees.
bad,When i was working at JcPenney Portraits they made me feel welcome. But as working there i did not get the hours that i hoped to get. i was starting to feel like not going to work and not really enjoying myself.
bad,"I started with JCP working as a part time cashier."
bad,I was a temp for the first 8 months in town and had to prove myself in this town. I worked at that highest paid for performance and did not get the pay
bad,I enjoyed the actual job itself but they were unorganized as far as keeping things on schedule and keeping people busy. My co-workers were very entertaining yet unprofessional themselves. There was favoritism shown at the job and I didn't see that as being fair.
bad,Started off well but the store got worse and worse due to management. Never given the chance to move up from a sales associate and was hounded by managers all the time when doing exactly what I was supposed to do.
bad,"The company is getting rid of its older workers.  Raises are laughable at best.  And in different stores the managers are not always fair.  There is definitely partiality shown to some workers vs othes.  Ok if you just want extra money and don't care to work weekends, holiday and late nights."
bad,"Working at JCPenney was difficult with very little appreciation.  The compensation and benefits were not great, and the reviews always seemed to focus on the negatives.  They did not respect the individual."
bad,"I enjoyed JCPenney when I started, I was told I would be able to become full time and everyone was very nice. After enough time I realized that I won't become full time and I was not valued by the staff and was just constantly expected to pick up everyone else's slack. The Johnson City store manager is very selfish and cares EXCLUSIVELY about making sales and credit goals and does not care about associates or using people to their best ability instead of bringing them down."
bad,Worked here for and its the typical retail job. They expect a lot of work for little pay. Hours weren't good. Now on to better things.
bad,Working at JCPENNY I have had the opperuninty to work in various different departments working with a varity of differant people .I have had the oppertuinty to learn and grow a number of different skills.
bad,if your a student or just working part time this is a great place to work. If your looking for full time or possible long term to support yourself and family it is not the place to work.
bad,"JCPenney has been driven into the ground with poor decisions that are destroying the company."
bad,Although everyone I worked with was very kind the management could have been better. They were not very considerate when it came to time off. I had requested a weekend off over a month in advance for a school event then was told to talk to various managers only to be told in the end I had waited too long to request time off and could no longer get the weekend off. I had many other issues with management the entire time I worked for this company.
bad,It was convenient to work there while I went to school because I could change my availability parameters to fit my school schedule. I could not count on hours to be steady or at least half-time which caused undue stress finanacially.
bad,"JC Penney was a nice store to work for if you just wanted a paycheck and didn't care about customer service, ethics, communication, acknowledgement, or morale.  It was really hard to work there because I have been taught that when you have a job, you are supposed to do it to the best of your ability.  I am a hard worker and like to see things done by the rules while keeping a good rapport with coworkers in a professional environment."
bad,"Management does not communicate with employees until they are getting written up because the salon manager didn't do her job for the past two months. So she decides to catch up and write employees up when nothing was ever said about what the concern was. Come to find out, the managers boss gave her goals for 2015 and in May she was talked to about it so the salon manager went back the last 5 months and added attendance up and wrote over half the store up for a change in policy that was posted 1 day prior to being written up."
bad,"My typical day at JcPennys would be walking around making sure everything is straightened up and organized. If I came across a customer I would make sure they was okay and to see they needed help with something. My  o-workers all had very unique and fun personalities. The harest part of the job was just the fact that it wasn't very busy, that I was bored at my job.  The things I needed to get done, I got done in 10 minutes so there wasn't really anything to do other than wait on a customer to come by. The most enjoyable thing about working there was just meeting the new people and what they liked as far as in fashion."
bad,"Co-workers were good. There was a lot of down time, so managers would make sure you always had something to do. Whether it was fixing the clothes or sizing and colorizing. Overall its an okay job."
bad,"As an employee at JCPenney's, I have learned money management as well as time management. The most enjoyable part about working at JCPenney's would have to be the hours that I work."
bad,"You will always keep busy and you will get the pleasure of working with all types of people so do not set your expectations too high. If you cannot comply with high amounts of tasks, this is not the position for you."
bad,The company has gone down hill since the hire of the now former CEO. I used to like m job in high school but as I graduated I realized the company is dysfunctional at best.
bad,Managment was not that great when there. Busy and worked with customers. Multi tasking and process freight to be placed on the salesfloor.
bad,its was fun to work there for the holidays I enjoyed meeting a lot of new people it was and interesting holiday season I don't remember much I was just  cashier and sales associate.
bad,Working for this company has been a constant roller coaster. Evolving positions always eliminating positions in restructuring while increasing workload.
bad,Penney's focus was not on custom decorating and sent a mixed message to customers by not having custom area on store floor. Priced higher than other retailers so often lost sale because of pricing and long delivery times.
bad,"Always busy"
bad,Knowing your always dealing with all types of customers can be hectic but it was always a good place to work and meet new friends.
bad,"ungrateful customers, employees, and management.  terrible hours and poor hourly wages, regardless of how long you've been there."
bad,"I designed graphics for the women's performance line. The experience was trivial, since the company was going through changes."
bad,Management never really knew what to do. They seemed lost most of the time.
bad,"- slow environment"
bad,I don't really know what to say it was a job but it laid me of not once but twice so based on the season I guess is how ull know if ur workin or not
bad,"do not stick to your availability "
bad,"Have to be able to balance doing a lot at once, or nothing at all. I learned how to be very accommodating to a wide range of people. The hardest part of the job was the none communication between management. The most enjoyable part of the job was the coworkers."
bad,Would not work there again. There was no leadership and no training.
bad,"I did not like being a retail associate. Time seemed to drag, the location I was at my co-workers were much older."
bad,Very busy and fast paced. Friendly co-workers that will help you if you had any questions.
bad,"Exciting to work for a large company, a large variety of women, men and children's clothing. Offering unbeatable prices to our customers"
bad,When I was hired promises were made to me but never followed through.
bad,I enjoyed my job and working with my co-workers. Management was constantly changing and it was not a well run company.
bad,"helped people find clothing for there children, ran register."
bad,"Not a whole lot of room to move up, and work is really boring. There are no incentives to provide great customer service except personal satisfaction."
bad,very wonderful place to work at you learn so much from everyone and everyone you meet
bad,worked there and they are judgmental towards customers and the management would try dating employees
bad,I learned a lot about customer service working there but that just came from helping people. The management was easy to get a lone with but was unfair on more then one occasion. the hardest part of my job was keeping track of paper work from days that I was not working. the most enjoyable part of my job was my coworkers.
bad,I worked at the Home Store which was a really good place to work at untill it was closed. My manager and supervisors were really amazing. Everyone was a really close family there. I quit after closing because managers at the main store were really bad hours were bad. No communication. Other employees had attitudes.
bad,"Good employees and company policies"
bad,I learned that time management for dealing with customers is key. I also learned how to build relationships with co-workers.
bad,"Pull orders and load trucks"
bad,it was nice to work with the people but as a company they didn't care about their employees
bad,"great first job to work out, i had a great time working there but left for better oportunities"
bad,"I worked at JC Penney for three years throughout college and it was fine at first. I found out after a while, however, that the position I was in was as far as I was going to go. Management also treated the employees as second class citizens; they were condescending at times."
bad,"Work with customers finding what they wanted either in the store or online."
bad,My typical work day consisted of taking catalog orders for clients. being at JC Penny was great for me to sharpen my sales skills. the management could have been more involved in the day to day functions. For the most part my co-workers were very professional. the hardest part of the day was when I needed to make a sale. the most enjoyable part of the day was also when I needed to make a sale because I love being challenged.
bad,"Great employees ,but managment was a mess. I generally only worker 3 to 4 days a week. My job started with pulling the orders of each customer on my list for the day. 3 to 5 customers sometimes 1 to 2 sometimes . I loaded  the product in the  work van , verified adress, called all customers, drove to each home, and installed the product . sometimes I collected final payment for product. then I called my next customer and verified aproximate arival time Ect.My work area was a 60 to 70 mile radius of the center of Atlanta."
bad,My first job and it was alot of fun working there as a minor and meeting new people.
bad,"I am not at all happy about the type of company they run. They tell you, you get off at a certain time and you don't they keep you until however long they feel. They don't handle situations they way they should."
bad,A typical work day is assisting customers in a timely matter. I learned that working in a public environment comes with many attitudes and management was very nice and understandable there. The hardest part of the job was working late nights and not knowing when I was going to get off. 
bad,The hardest part of the job is getting people to apply for a JCPenney credit card.
bad,"Main boss is way too strict, uses negative reinforcement instead of positive. A lot of drama to be dealt with on a daily basis, not worth my time or energy to drive to work."
bad,Management was easily influenced by seasoned workers over new employees. 
bad,My days at JCPenney were very interesting to say the least.  I worked as a jewelry consultant.  Business was usually slow until we had a sale. 
bad,":  Operated cash register and processed cash, check, and credit-debit card transactions.  Conducted nightly cash drawer audits. Investigated and resolved, as necessary, customer complaints.  Maintained inventory levels and advised department manager when to re-order merchandise."
bad,"Mose of the time it was fun a lot of the customers were nice, managment wanted to concerned about charge card applications"
bad,"I did not like working here very much. It was not structured very well, a lot of the management and everything were very rude and mean."
bad,I liked the job it was just i was never assinged to a differnt area. It was other position that i would loved to do.
bad,Learned a good deal about troubleshooting via the phone with someone on the other end that has no idea of what they are technically doing. Good equipment to work on and implement.
bad,retail job learned stock inventory and register. management was very disorganzed.
bad,JCP is a typical retail job. I often found myself looking for things to refold on a slow day. Busy days were better when there were customers to help out.
bad,"Provided customer assistance in selling, catalog orders and cashiering"
bad,I was hired as a seasonal employee. I really enjoyed my job with JCP and worked hard to impress to hopefully land a permanent position but I was let go before the month was even over. I was told by the person who hired me that I was not fast enough in meeting there expectations. I totally did not expect that. He said it was hard to do that to me but I know it was not his decision. He is a good man. I know in my heart I worked hard with throbbing feet at the end of shift. I only got 8 hours training watching video's and finalIy had training on the floor from 20 something year old girls who were not trying to train me. Finally I was assigned to
bad,Typical day at work is you take calls from customers and help place orders. I learned how to communicate better. My management were very helpful. You really didn`t get to talk to your co-workers unless on break. The hardest part of the job was keeping a positive attitude with angry customers. the best part was meeting new people and helping them out with what they needed
bad,Be young and have energy and you will be sort of okay here.
bad,It a good salon to start at but not a good plce to stay for a long time.
bad,This company has a friendly environment and management treat employees nice. Co-workers and managers treat each other like friends and show respect for one another.
bad,pay sucks....schedule sucks...management sucks....not worth applying for
bad,"Clock in, put on name badge & walk to work area"
bad,Very flexible with hours and is great for someone with a family.
bad,not a career move job. a great partime job. good customer service training
bad,"I loved my job, but wasn't so thrilled about the people I had to work with especially the some of the supervisors.They had absolutely no respect for others."
bad,"Lot of fun, Get to tackle bad guys. Low Pay and low hours. The Bosses are all about."
bad,"seasonal job,fast paced because of the holidays. The hardest part of my job was not having great manangement to lead."
bad,Everyday I would sweat like crazy but the work was really easy
bad,"While working at jcPenny was a great expericence that ended so fast. I learned how to use my ability in different fields, and effective listening skills helped me succeed. The management was excellent, i didnt want for anything, and they made sure all my dutuies was done before leaving. My co-workers were nice, dedicated, dependable, outgoing, helpful and loyal. The hardest part of the job was being able to last in the cold warehouse. The most enjoyable part of the job was being part of team that action showed they cared."
bad,Management is always difficult to find when needed and most often times do not please the customer.
bad,I personally think that JCPenny does favoritism to certain people they give don't you and chance to learn or improve on your skills. so of the manger are helpful the other ones don't do anything but yell and complain
bad,"JCpenney is a fast pace environment to work, there is a lot of interaction with customers as well as coworkers and managers. "
bad,The one I worked at in West County Mall had very poor management. I don’t think they still have the same managers so it might have changed since then.
bad,"Company was a great place to work  until we change management an Leadership. "
bad,"Was alot of conflict with management and employers , a very Negative space if you involuntarily get involved in it. Never work at the Aurora Mall JcP."
bad,"This was not a bad company to work for at all, however the pay was poor. This is a job where they want to work you to death and don’t want to pay what you deserve. I received one raise while I worked here and that was a 19 cent raise so I went from making 8.75 to 8.94. This is NOT a job that will support how you live. I would only recommend this job too someone who who is maybe bored or retired and just looking for something to do."
bad,"A typical day involves, photographing, making photo collections, editing photos and greeting cards, communicating with customers, answering phones, and limited office work. I learned new programs that I have never used before to design/edit photos and greeting cards. I also learned a variety of customer service skills. The hardest part of the job was trying to handle multiple tasks at once. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers and co-workers."
bad,i love working at jcp but they dont give me the hours that i would like to work. i want to work a lot and they dont use my availability when it is open to them.
bad,this job was really easy its just annoying to fold clothes and then watch it get messy again. The fitting room is annoying to fix cx leave the clothes there.
bad,when I worked there they went through a restructure of the company that was unbelievable. The store manger should not have been in her position. Eventually she was let go. A typical work day was waiting on customers and providing excellent customer service. Toward the end of my tenure the culture of the environment was at a long time low. The hardest part of the job was the restructure of the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people and the customers
bad,Good not a bad place to work at n good staff can't get any better  everyone who works there is also family and everyone gets along great together and words as a team
bad,"i learned about how to deal with moody people, and folding clothes, but it is a lovely and interesting work area. some days were quite stressing, but others were just fine."
bad,"This job was a little bit of a struggle, since it was during the busiest time of the year, but it only made me stronger and assisted me in learning how to work with many customers, work with a cash register, and organize clothing. The atmosphere was quite hectic but friendly."
bad,"A typical workday included staging my area with new sale signs and trying to work with the pricing team to finish the mountains of price changes that would never be finished on time and would run into every coming week. I learned how to make and print signs under their system. Management was a mixed bag, some managers seemed like they were really trying to accommodate and understand the price changing situation, while others just took a backseat and then got upset when the unreasonable deadlines weren't met. Outside of the management workplace culture was okay I got along with those on my team. The hardest part is like I stated the piles of price changes that would just run into every new week there wasn't a single day that felt like a win. The most enjoyable part was the team that I worked with."
bad,"A typical day at work is slow. Mostly floor work is being done, customers come in waves. Best part of the job is getting to help the customers dress up their wardrobe."
bad,"The job is fairly enjoyable, very low stress and extremely easy going with a nice group of coworkers who make the experience that much more enjoyable."
bad,"Coworkers are hard to work with"
bad,"It was like being thrown into a pit of hungry lions. I was not a popular kid in school and JCPenny employees was just a giant reminder of this. I was outcasted and picked on from day one. Hardly trained and left alone. Schedule was also bad but easily changed if you had another person to switch with you but that was highly frowned upon. Group events like Christmas and Halloween ""parties"" was a joke. Plus the constant nagging on asking every customer like 6 questions at the register which included credit card applications which if you don't meet your quota for the day you get penalized, doesn't matter if you exceeded your quota the previous day. "
bad,"During the week business is slow and goes by with ease, weekends and holidays are horrible. But I did learn more than I thought I would, I learned how to deal with customers in a hostile environment. Management is horrible, most of them are not understanding, not reasonable, and are not professional. But the other sales associates are great, easy to get along, understanding, and hard working. The hardest part of my job is pleasing every customer you come by. The most enjoyable was my customer."
bad,The coworkers are fun and management gets very involved. The hardest part is trying to meet quotas and get the credit apps. The most enjoyable aspect is being able to have freedom to take on tasks you'd like to that day you're not stuck doing the same thing day after day.
bad,"At JC Penny, things were ok at the begging but later on in the months, things got crazy the manger was never there to work with you, you never had a flexible time."
bad,An average day at work would be assisting customers. The most enjoyable part would be knowing that you made someone's day just by helping them.
bad,"Too many expectations. There is no bonuses, and no raises. Peak season you cannot request off for three months."
bad,"Cashiering,Replenishment Merchandise, Stocking,Pricing,Greets the customer,"
bad,I had the best co-workers in the world and I learned so much about the beauty industry
bad,This was a job I had in high school. I worked in catalog. Little to no responsibility....
bad,"After working many years, sacrificing family time to manage and run the store including being on call for secuirty calls etc. my career came to an end because I did not believe my manager should spent 20 hours on her job while I spent over 50 hours. No one believed me until she was removed from her position 2 years later. The company was good to me and my family over the years...I specifically mean the people that work for the company over the years and some great management."
bad,"It was a handful of different duties per day. It is a very fast paced job, and requires full focus and attention. Managers are sweet and always attend."
bad,Good great managers cool job but low pay very far to commute it was a great team/staff but I was very slow paced.The ride was far to get there and I had to walk.
bad,"Working here was fun, but I do feel as though there was a lot of favoritism among the employees and thats what ensured you being promoted from within."
bad,"I was so bored while at JCPenney! I would pray they'd need me as a cashier just to help pass the time. I would finish my duties in 2 hours or less and then Have to actually find things to do. They also started only scheduling me for about 8 hours every 2 weeks. So 1 day a week for 4 hours, and I couldn't pay my bills."
bad,"Its a good place to work if you don't have any children, as long as you are willing to work hard for little pay this would be the place for you. i wouldn't go back"
bad,I enjoyed working at JCP a lot. The people are very easy to work with. We have a new General Manager that cares about the associates and the customers. The hardest part of the job was saying goodbye. The most enjoyable part of the job was saving the company money and reducing shrink.
bad,huddle and stretch before starting shift. the hardest part is constant lifting and bending. The co-workers are great to work with.
bad,Co-workers were friendly and helped each other in any situation they needed help in. Hardest part of the job was closing by yourself in your own department while it was a mess and you barely had any help.
bad,No work life balance. Unrealistic goals. Schedule is always changing. The pay is decent and the company overall is great. They care about diversity and they are really involved in giving back.
bad,I was a good experience working there...Work with co worker and great experinces
bad,I enjoyed working at JC Penney when I first started and received a couple of raises. I have now been there for 2 1/2 years and have not had another raise and hours are constantly being cut. With the financial trouble JC Penney was/is going through its understood. A good job for someone with no responsibilities.
bad,Come in clock in check the schedule see where I work then make the best of the day smile at all my customers greeting them as they walk in and check out coworkers there really isnt anything hard but u need to meet ur credit app goals
bad,Don't like the road they are taking with no sales or weekly doorbusters anymore
bad,"Since the new CEO has been in charge, I have had the potential of being let go due to changed hours, position title, and functions twice in three months, with massive changes. Not a career, risky compared to other retailers in the clothing industry."
bad,"Good place would recommend, however you must like your job to do. I did not like folding clothes or working at fitting rooms therefore I left. If you enjoy do stuff I would recommend"
bad,I was hired at $14/hour.  Advanced to $14.35/hr then my dept underwent restructuring and was cut to $10.50 but paid commission was added. We weren't busy enough to generate an extra $9000 in sales to make up the difference I lost every two weeks.
bad,"Terrible team member cooperation, mixed salaries, good deals and great employee discounts. My experience wasn't the greatest as an associate who lead the shoe department at closing all by myself. The shoe department was split between two parts of the store. Management wasn't reliable. Customer service was very spotty throughout every department."
bad,"working at jcpenny was a good experience the management there was really helpful they provided excellent training, its was always busy always work to do and customers to keep happy."
bad,Cookie cutter place to work. Their job training was basically hire/motivate/fire. So I was training a new group of people every two weeks which became frustrating.
bad,"With better Mangers that is a wonderful place to work. There is lots of opportunities for job advancement, the pay could be better, you do get sick and vacation for full and part time help, not many business offer that. You can be trained to work in one dept or all of them. The associates are all wonderful to work with. They have a nice big lunch  room with pop and candy machines. Then store is a clean and safe place to work."
bad,Helped open the store and would work 60+ hours a week.Didnt have sufficient amount of workers for the work load required. 
bad,"I would set up displays for the weeks bargain deals , stocking shelves . Assisting different departments that needed help , Assisting customers with online order for things that were not in stock and stock checks . Also keeping my department clean and presentable , as well as cashiering "
bad,"The company is in financial ruin, selling it's properties and holdings for quick short term cash which was the main reason they extended the closing dates in the recent round of store closures.  The closing stores are carrying the entire company with triple digit gains, while the stores remaining open are suffering massive losses.  They even had to sell the home office and two warehouses this year.  I predict that after these store closures there will be another wave of closures, and many of those will be larger stores where the company owns the buildings themselves, gaining more short term profit instead of actually resolving their internal issues, many of which would be easily fixed if they would listen to their store employees.   All of this information is public knowledge.  It used to be a great company to work for.  It is heartbreaking to witness firsthand the frankenstein-like monster it has become."
bad,"Although, Jc Penney has a diverse group of employees as a former employee I observed that the African Americans customers get treated poorly. Especially, when it comes to returns and exchanges. The employees are over worked due to the down sizing of the company. The higher boss can be a bit  unprofessional with then way he speaks to his employees. The flexibility is great although employees don't receive thanksgiving free to spend with their families but yet cooperate gets that luxury. JC Penney management can care less about their employees well being . The most concern is meeting daily store credit card sign ups."
bad,"i learn more english there with coworkers i grew like person i feel good working , but they dont give us more benefits and more hours so i need to grow in the laboral life ...My hardest part of the job it was my languaje but im still practicing english i would like to learn speak it fluenly"
bad,Getting to work early in the mornings and getting off by noon.
bad,"Dealing with the general public in a sales position now days, is a craps shoot. So many RUDE, Obnoxious people! Company more concerned on making a sale from those people that they’re blinded on the Verbal MISTREATMENT their employees receive and is expected to endure. There are weekly monitored (& critiqued calls).... You are expected to be Top Notch- Absolute PERFECT- in Every call!"
bad,"Everyone was really kind and welcoming. Working here kept me on my toes and always finding new ways to help costumers. I learned new skills including: how to close a register, how to fold clothing properly, and how to return/exchange purchases."
bad,"i love the people who are happy when they come in and ask questions and makes me more happy when i can come back with an answer, the weekends are the busiest when alot of people come in and crowd around one area when your trying to clean out the dressing rooms that part is hard when there is a line of people out of the fitting room when you cant get back in there, but i do enjoy working there with all my co workers, because we work together and thats the most important"
bad,"the job is ok...its closing so i dont have much to say"
bad,I learned alot at my first job. I learned to have patients a calm mind and a stable work habit.
good,I've never worked in a place that fires you for being diagnosed with Cancer until I worked at JCP. No compassion just hurry up and work. I was appalled and put in my 2 weeks notice but they took me off the schedule 2 days later.
good,Typical day at work was stressful depending on who was in charge that shift.  Recommend for an entry level person to secure revenue.  Job title fell under many different things.
good,"It would be a great job if the walkin traffic were there and they didn't have a manager that has ""favorites"" and helps them grow.. also too focused on the retail portion of the business.."
good,working at JCPennys was my first job and even though most people dont like their first job i surely dispised it. i will never work there again. nor any retain
good,"I loved the job and learning to take photos with a nice camera. But when they say part time I thought it would at least be 25 hours. Uhm. No. One week I got 4 hours. And the most I made working 2 weeks was $200. That's okay for a student that doesn't have Bill's to pay or a kid to take care of. They'll send you to another JCPenney to train and that's probably the most hours you'll see until you get to peak season. But after you're out of training, be prepared to work by yourself and learn what to do by yourself. Ask for help because you were never fully trained to work a full day by yourself, and one of the on call people would have to come in and you would have to go home. Loved the experience but in a situation where you don't know what you're doing fully and you ask for help so you can learn, doesn't mean send someone else in so you can go home."
good,I love what I did but was not appreciated for the work or time that was put in the company all they cared about was getting credit apps and care plan.
good,"For me there are too few hours  and I  need to work. You are able to go into the computer employee kiosk and ask for changes, schedules appear on Thursday or Friday and you know what you are scheduled for approximately 3 weeks at a time, I think most of us are concerned about the lack of hours we are given and so going into mgt is one way to  give yourself a better paycheck."
good,"It is hectic as soon as you clock in, nothing is organized like it should be, the associates aren't educated on running ads or discounts. I have learned a lot of customer service skills working with poor upper management.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the lack of hours and the traffic of the store at the same time. The most enjoyable thing is the life long friends I made there."
good,jcpenneys is a very old brand that struggles to keep up with the times. Very slow paced and i wouldnt recommend a younger person working there you might die of boredom
good,"management pretends that they care about whats going on with you, but it is all fake and they are horrible. They pay is horrible for how much you put into your work and they cut hours all the time."
good,"Started at the company as a Supervisor. But due to cutbacks not only did they lower pay but they told me I was at MAX pay. But still expected same work. Still carried keys, closed/opened the store. I do my job and I do it well. But I know more can be done than the company is letting on. Which is why I'm looking for employment elsewhere."
good,Unfair pay. Poor management. Poor training. Frustrated workers. Little time for family or important events. Management uses profane language too often. There is little room for growth in the company.
good,"I worked in the dickson city store for another 4 years. The first few years were great. Throughout my tenure there I met some great Co workers. Your timed on basically everything there. "
good,"I loved the clients, but the management when I was employed was a joke. One day she was your best friend and the next she was writing you up for something that was ridiculous. I never knew what kind of environment I was going to be walking into and it was miserable. There were too many stylist and not enough clients on almost every day."
good,As a part time employee their were no fair job advances. The management team played favoritism with the employees. Training was also a problem as their were no proper follow-ups.
good,Jcpennys salon was my first job and it was very uncomfortable at the beginning. The management came of very rude and showed favoritism towards certain workers. The co-workers all complained about the management at times. The hardest part was trying to keep a clientele being so slow. I loved that the place provided products.
good,"Typical day at work is constantly changing.  Learned a great deal about retail, customer service, plan-o-gram, pricing, and inventory management.  Co-workers:  managers-inexperienced in management and belittled associates.  Co-workers had mediocre worth ethics.  Hardest part of the job was trying to wait on customers when department set demands were a higher priority to store management than customer service."
good,"If I opened the store I would put out all the diamonds out in the display cases and make sure the cases were all smudge free. If closing the store I would have to count all the diamonds before closing the safe. I learned how to clean jewelry, change watch batteries. Management was not so great when I was there, our department did not have a manager and the other department managers were unsure of how the jewelry department was ran. The hardest part of the job was trying to get more hours. I wanted something more full time and they had hired me for a full time position but I never got the full time hours. My most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help costumers pick out the perfect ring, necklace, earrings or bracelet for that special someone or themselves."
good,"The management was poor from top to bottom, major lack of communication which causes the organization. Overall work was easy"
good,"A typical day of work is folding, straightening clothes, cleaning out dressing rooms, providing customer service, taking back stolen merchandise because of a new company policy. The management is okay..I love my co-workers the hardest part of the job is staying busy when there are no customers coming in. the most enjoyable part would be the customer service"
good,"Most of the time, you go to work not knowning what to do because of different changes. The workplace was never like this until someone brought JCPenney. Our job might be marking down, marking up, changing signs, dressing up mannequins, and at the end of the night recovering. We are unable to complete our on jobs because we are helping other departments. I've learned that change could be good or a bad thing and to keep positive mind. The management are very unprofessional and need to be re-trained. Some of my co-workers are good workers, sincere, and funny. The hardest part of my job is trying to complete a 8 hour shift work on 5 hour shift. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers as well as my co-workers."
good,"I wouldn’t recommend working here unless you are very into retails as a job but it has very low pay, low staff, a lot of customers stealing stuff from the store and run out. Managers are very poor On their roles especially when it comes to having errors on the computer managers take their sweet time coming down to the lower level."
good,Cant tell much. Good store but very many hateful people. They focus on negatives instead of positive things.  It is a very clean store and loved by the community.
good,There used to be a time at jcpenneys where everyone from the smallest associate to the regional manager were able to actually be happy and it felt like the most amazing place to work even though it was a heavy workload sometimes it didn’t matter because they felt like family. Then one by one people were moved up and the ones that should’ve moved up weren’t moved just renamed and it started to turn into a cold and dark place some of the managers started being snobby and above you and  put themselves on a pedestal and by then it was just another place I really really used to love working there I met so many amazing people customers and friends alike but now it is a store in agony a shell of its former self I can barely go in there without remembering that it was my first job and that I liked it there so much at first I cried when it was my last day because everyone had come to be my family. But now it’s an emotionless place.
good,I wouldn't recommend anybody wirh a family to work at Jcpenney. The pay is insulting for the work your expected to do. Management is not qualified and they are not concerned with what you have going on in your life at all. If you have any other options pick any one before Jcpenney.
good,Everyday I would have to do more than one persons job. The pay wasn't sent great and everybody always seemed to have an attitude. Needed a job that why I applied but it wasn't worth it at all
good,"Do what is asked of you, and try to stay as busy as you can. if there is something to train in do it. Try to learn all departments. help out anywhere you can"
good,"I value every experience as a learning experience. The JcPenny store in Chico, California is the dirtiest store I have ever been in. The fitting rooms are in need of immediate attention.  I believe the dust and dirt made me sick, each shift."
good,"Lots of long hours. They taught me the importance of customer focus, which grew a great career for me at another company. They worked around school and other activites and I made some of my best friends for life at JCP."
good,The jobs ended abruptly. I didn't like the hours and how the jobs just ended all of a sudden and u ended up having to wait a couple of weeks for another job to come open
good,"You will be beaten over the head to upsell every customer who purchases any jewelry item at all or threats of job loss. $7 silver toe ring? Better get them to buy that 3 yr insurance policy on it for $5!"
good,"A typical day at JCpenny is Busy, Fast paste and productive. Interacting with different ethnicity and personalities, management was Ok but I had relocate to a different location and management was amazing."
good,"JCPenney recently just cut close to 300 jobs. They don't provide that many hours to part time employees. They only care about I caps, and not about their employees. Management is slack with this company."
good,It’s retail if there’s your you get plenty but if there isn’t be prepared to work one day every two weeks. The only people who get paid time off are supervisors and managers. They purposely give you less hours so you can never get paid time off. If they want you to retire they cut your hours so you lose you insurance and benefits. F you Lori and your F’ed up eyebrows.
good,"None of the people I work with are nice besides like 3 of them, and the managers do nothing about them being rude or completely disgusting and disrespectful."
good,being a customer service representative entails on to listen and be attentive . I've learned patience while working with people of different personalities.
good,I loved Penneys for the atmosphere until a new manager came and ruined it. It was very slow and we didn't make much money. Sometimes hours were cut to save on productivity.
good,"Working here went downhill gradually over the years. It hit an all time low with the make over they did 4-5 years ago and have not been able to climb back out. I worked there for 10 years in a department working on commission and the incentives, training, treatment, compensation and available hours declined to almost nothing. The individual workload and areas of responsibility (such as being alone in 2-3 departments) increased exponentially. My advice is if you are going to work there, do not work in a commission department because you will be forced to help in other areas where you do not receive commission. Which means you are making minimum wage, as commission associates are not eligible for hourly raises."
good,This job is peak and valley. It requires minimum supervision and the ability to exercise good judgment. There is no protection equipment. So verbal commands a essential.
good,"It's taught me a lot about customer service but it also taught me how some people can expect so much of you and no matter how hard you work you'll never get rewarded for it. It's competitive pay but people who have been there for a couple years get paid way less than someone who is just getting hired. There super unfair with hours, and benefits aren't that great."
good,"The managers at my Jc Penneys were awful, they picked on all of the employees and gave the really bad shifts to all of the younger employees and cut hours from those who didn't make the minimum requirement for credit card applicants. I hated it there and won't recommend it to anyone."
good,"The amount of confusion throughout management was ridiculous. Working conditions are fair at best, decent coworkers. Overall a 2/5 for this job. Typical day at work is hectic and rushed. Most enjoyable part of the job is lunch and going home."
good,"This was my first job and it gave great experience to someone, like me, that was new working. I would not recommend this as a permanent job, but rather as a first time job."
good,this job is ok. but the area I worked for lacked the management to keep its people working. they had terrible management. but the job was a good job and I was easy work.
good,Not very welcoming. some employees are rude. training was not great. you basically have to learn everything on your own as you go and ask questions. asking questions got annoying to other employees when you would ask for help.
good,"If you are looking to make some extra cash this is the place.  You don't make a lot but it's money.  "
good,"Although day to day operations were pleasant, JCPenney does not offer much in the growth/development department.  Training is minimal and when you show ambition/desire to move up and grow as a member of the team they tend to overlook and forget you,"
good,didnt give very much hours and had no room to move up in the company the best part about the job was the coworkers but other than that the pay was really bad and didnt help being given an 8 hour work week
good,Jc. Penney as a company is pretty good to work for but as far as the Penneys in Killeen it is not such a great place to work in.
good,"A typical work day involves helping customers locate items, order items online, keeping the store's merchandise in order."
good,"Responsible for all monetary transactions, assisting customers in locating items, computer skills, and handling the registers. Advanced training lead to moving shipments off the trucks, handling returns, and properly filing and completing the inventory process. Experience promoted working well under pressure and know-how in deescalating angry customers, both in person and over the phone."
good,"I worked here for credits so most of my responsibilities were to keep the store clean, make sure the costumers had everything they needed."
good,"Would check out customers, occasionally help someone out with something. I'd honestly hide most the day. Managers were mean and selfish. Co-workers were old and rude. Hardest thing about this job was getting people to sign up for credit cards. Nothing was really enjoyable."
good,"My duties included maintaining and stocking my area of responsibility as well as keeping the customers first priority. I complete point of sales after successfully helping the customers with their needs. Management was constantly changing along with ping pong of rules and regulations. The most enjoyable parts were the customers, I learned how important customer service is and how to handle many upon many situations. My personal goal was to have happy and satisfied customers."
good,"Dept. supervisors were for the most part too lazy to lead by example and were too concerned about ""looking busy"" in their ""offices""  they were busy planning their personal lives and who they were going to get rid of in their dept. because they didn't like them. "
good,Team Building meeting then the sales floor.
good,"Great job while attending school, and flexible work schedule. Great for Retail and sales Experience."
good,i sell shoes. i didn't learn anything because Ive worked in shoes before. Management isn't so good. coworkers are alright. hardpart is having to close the store. no enjoyable part of job.
good,good place to work but team work there is really poor
good,"I love working at JC Penny, even though the pay suck and the management do people wrong. They will lay u of without telling you. One min you have hrs then the next min you are on the schedule but with no hrs and no one talks to you about this."
good,"I had worked hard here "
good,"It's your basic retail job. It's not going to be fun at times, but at least you have a job. I felt unprepared to start working. There wasn't nearly enough training. I was just thrown into the teeth of things."
good,"Honestly I didn’t like the job at Jcpenney, the staffing and management were horrible. They honestly didn’t care much about their associates there and they’re life from work"
good,The work is good but you don't get enough hours to do anything. Also if you don't speak Spanish you don't fit in. Very back stabbing work environment and if your not a favorite you don't get anything you need.
good,"Worked here as a sales associate witht the typical day work of folding clothes and stocking sale items. The work environment felt very unwelcoming as the workers themselves didn't appear to be excited about the job they worked in. Management was average and didn't seem to care much about the employee's except for certain people. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers, although that was given as a sales associate. There was nothing at this job that was particularly enjoyable each day was the same daunting task as the next that followed."
good,"I work as a customer supporter at JCP. My job includes taking the merchandise off the truck, sort through the merchandise for the correct department and then put it on the selling floor. Learing how to read or used the pictures for the item displayed. Helping out on the cash register when they are sort, or help put back the clothing from the dressing room back to the selling floor. Sort and clean the tables, rakes and back wall so it can be presentable for customers to get to. "
good,"Work was always fairly easy. Fold clothes, sell things, help customers, clean up. I learned how to stay on top of what I'm doing and how to stay busy on the clock. "
good,my fellow associates are great people. great working environment. however hours are weak and human resources disregards availability. hours are extremely short for some associates whom are given only 5 hours a week
good,They ask far too much from each employee than they’re compensated for. They hold personal grudges and gossip which affects your work life and scheduling.
good,Job was fun. Management was  helpful a times. Was thrown out to the job will very little preparation on the register (started on Black Friday).Scheduling was on a please let me work basis.
good,"Management needs some management."
good,The Jcpenney in Champaign is disorganized... stressful.. expected to the work of 20people eventhough you're only one person.. Untrained lifeless zombies.
good,A place to work while going to school. Not a place to stay long term. Not a great management environment.  Not a great hourly rate. Employees are like family
good,"JCPenny is an average place to work. The pay isn't great, but it isn't terrible. The hours are ok but not ideal. Overall it was a very average job; not my favorite, not my least favorite."
good,"It is like working with a bunch of children, high school mentality for most including management "
good,This is a place that works out if you are a student and need a part time job and don’t have work experience. You will be payed minimum wage no benefits or vacations. In fact they will even not give you payed sick days. You will be scheduled 5hrs and have to take a 30 min break so basically you only get paid 4.30hrs which is a waste of 30 mins if you ask anybody.  Management is the biggest issue. They are not very good at following what is set for them as a guide of availability. All in all I stayed there for a while mostly cause the discount is good !
good,I enjoyed working here when I was first hired.  I was given the task of putting the shoes in the stockroom. I like organizing things so it is easily found when looking for. I would then go and help others in different departments. They took that job away from me for no reason.
good,Though I truly enjoyed working as a photographer. The work environment was not great. This was mostly due to the  Manager who played favorites with her friends which meant less hours during the slow season and less support in the evening during peak season.
good,"There’s no communication."
good,"hectic work environment, not well organized, didn't stick to certain policies. they had very flexible work hours, that was a plus. but not enough hours given."
good,Not really that bad other than the fact that I never get that many hours. My paychecks are less than $200 sometimes less than $100. Some employees are kind of rude as well.
good,"Management was not great, they picked favorites and didn't treat all employees fairly.  Management was constantly changing and there was no consistency in the store.  They were inconsiderate to employees when they needed time off.  Nothing was ever done correctly."
good,Difficult employees and managers trying to control you and unfair have to be on your feet can’t stand behind cash register without customers camera have to be seen at all times
good,"In commission sales I enjoyed promoting products by telling customers the product details, how it was made, what it was made from.  Also recommending the best uses of the products, and which product would best suit their needs.  I hated telling them that the products they most often sought were out of their price range."
good,"JCPenney works to give great customer service and be all about the customer. Unfortunately as of late, the company was making changes to create a better layout within the store that were not following through. When I left the store, management was leaving departments short staffed, unable to give adequate breaks and support, and it seemed that management only cared about credit applications rather than employee satisfaction. I left on a sour note, unfortunately."
good,"Poor management with minimal education about job as well as poor planning and scheduling skills.Management made associates feel ""left out"" instead of voicing and correcting problems"
good,"The days at JC Penny were very stressful, with little to no help from management or other employees. I learned that retail was not for me very quickly, the environment is not meant for personal or group growth"
good,"is a good place to work at, very relaxing atmosphere, you have your busy days like days that you have to do online pick-ups and BOPIS, but that's if you would to work in the Home Department."
good,The store in Yuba City was dated and needed a remodel. the people I worked with were nothing short of amazing and they are the reason I stayed as long as I did!
good,"I loved this company and in the past I have worked for some great managers. That makes the big difference here. If they are involved and make sure they are giving constructive feedback, it is wonderful. But if they sit in their office and ignore what's going on out on the floor, it is not good. If you are an engaging sales person and greet your customers with a smile and don't try to hide from them, then this is a great job for you. Also if you like to keep busy, cleaning out fitting rooms and rearranging merchandise...this is a job for you. It will keep you busy and your time will go by fast...but if you stand and complain...go elsewhere....this company needs people who can be part of a solution, not part of the ever growing problem. The company would do well to pay better to maintain more experienced and motivated salespersons. They would see a huge difference and I think that would go along way in turning the company around."
good,"Did not like how your hours were based on how many credit card applications you had filled out at the end of each week. It was very frustrating to work there being that there were so many different managers, and not enough employees it felt like."
good,"Typical day was just a sum of selling salon product, receptionists duties, and making sure we were fully stocked on merchandise "
good,"Normally fast paced, yet underwhelming. I learned how to fold clothes a different and faster way. Management was ok,  when they were in the department."
good,"A typical day at work helping customers and making sure the department was in order and clean.  I learned a lot about the window department.  Management was good, as well as the workplace culture. The hardest part of the job was not enough training and not getting off on time,  We could not leave the job when our department was in order we had to help in the other departments.  The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers."
good,"i learned how to work a cash resister, interacting with customers, and how thw workplace flows. Management could use a little work but they were trying. Everyone had their different roles but still work together as a unit. The hardest part of the job for me was not being able to stop half way in my work. I like finishing my work. Stopping half way was always something i had to get used to.The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people. i also like my team. Having a good team to support you makes the work go smoothly."
good,"JC Penney is an extremely busy store, with a non-stop flow of customers coming. A shift can last from 4 hours to up to 10 hours long depending on the time of year. The lines get  very long, but there are not enough cash register efficient associates on the floor to back up, some times managers would have to cover and provide addition back up when there are too many customers to handle."
good,"Work Life Balance is Horrible. Overall the benefits are ok, however, the hours are not conducive to those with families especially if you are a mom with young children."
good,"I think the salon was over-staffed, not enough clientele to support constantly hiring new stylists. Lots of disorganization, misinformation and not a ton of direction with management. Back bar products were poorly stocked; an abundance of gels and a single brand of hair spray, yet not a single jar of pomade, paste or texture cream for men's styling. Color was also poorly stocked, over stocked with color rarely used, and constantly stylists were going to the supply store themselves to buy the color tube they needed or developer needed. The compensation seemed like a great idea, minimum wage plus commission 45%-60% depending on level, but there was always major problems with employee paychecks not being accurate. Cleanliness was an afterthought, not a priority, especially for ""busy"" stylists, they assumed someone else would clean up after them, sweeping, laundry, etc. with management not caring a bit. The receptionists tried to do their job, but the computers were so outdated that the software caused mass crashes and sometimes didn't even turn on. While employed there they switched commission rates, which seemed like it would work, but of course people abused the new system and management didn't hold people accountable for their actions so that was not an enjoyable experience. I believe most of the problems I had were because of the management, from the store manager, assistant managers, salon manager and district managers. Most of the management staff are close to retiring(sometime this year) and the remaining staff are feeling on edge because of the huge amount of closings the"
good,Store manager doesn't work with associates. Causes issues with work effectiveness. Felt bullied into leaving. Was written up for being late in a huge snow storm even though I called ahead. Many issues that need correcting.
good,"no longer a company for home decoration, enjoyed the beautiful curtain that were made. The hardest part was dealing with the installers. took phone calls from customers"
good,"I start day with full facility walk. I then check emails, and also do touch base with managers, associates, team. I then look at what was done the night before. I look at RTV-RTW process to ensure we process freight in the time allowed. I look at inventory flow, damages, seal program, yard audits, arc process, dif process, and look for pilferage to mitigate shrink."
good,"Typical retail problems, hours are hard on family's, pay is very low, had a hard time enjoying the public.  Staff was fun to work with made many friends along the way but overall expierence was not fun"
good,I enjoyed interacting with the customers and my co-workers.  Seeing the new styles and sales was a fun part of the job.  The hardest part of my job of straightening other departments after closing hours.
good,What the customer pays it not passed onto the stylist performing the service so we as a licensed professional are not making what we deserve and no benefits.
good,"Very confusing work culture. Need more training for employees. Long standing hours, less benefits for employees. overall very tiring"
good,Poor leadership skills. Would not work around my second job schedule.I was forced to choose between the two jobs. i choose the job with the better pay even though it is Seasonal.
good,"My team together to improve the stander of our department. my manager acknowledges our work, and give us praises daily. i love my job, it is fast pace, and rewarding. The best part of my job is meeting new people, and conversing with the customer daily."
good,"The job was great for the easy work, but I felt that it was a waste of money to check people already in the airport. I screened employees that had security access to the aircraft already. The best perk was being able to serve the NFL, NBA, MBA, and College team in private screening with airport guidelines..."
good,"My experience at JCPenny was not a great one. I didn't have much interaction with the other employees. There was a great amount of backbiting, particularly directed at management. There was an atmosphere of ""do work, don't ask questions, do more work."" "
good,Working at JCP was a great experience. I learned to speak Spanish there.I got a lot of experience working with the public.
good,"Managers are rude"
good,"Easy to get hire if you are over 60 years old. Dress code, company policies never enforced. I have learned about customer service, and work well with co-workers."
good,It was a nice experience to have working in a catalog department. the employees were very friendly.
good,"Sales oriented company.  Very nice place to work and made life long friends.  Learned to be patient and satisfy the customer with their purchase.  The most difficult part of the job was learning all the different window coverings available and all their features."
good,It's horrible working in retail during the holidays and it's hard recovering from it.
good,"Pay is low, hours being cut of long time employees so JCPenney can hire minimum wage teenagers. Management that has no clue what company policies are even though they have 30 + years with the company.  No opportunity for advancement.  Favortism to certain employees,  terrible work hours."
good,"There's a lot that JCP could do better. There is plenty of time and resources being wasted. All of that, though frustrating, didn't make the job intolerable. The ranting boss, who changes her mind and blames you when her new idea is irrational, is what makes a large percentage of employees quit and/or retire early."
good,"The hours and pay are really low, but the staff are pretty good people. this is good for high school students."
good,Taking this job was just a temporary position to do light store upkeep and store upkeep while man was away due to illness.
good,"A typical day at work would be hectic, and calm depending on what day of the week it was. One thing that was constant though, was that there were a lot of issues among the supervisors of various departments and it conflicted with tasks given to us employees. I felt as if management would have conflicts among one another making it hard for me to take direction, because one supervisor would tell me to do one thing, and the other would tell me to do the opposite. I learned a lot while working here, good and bad and I take that seriously because it helped me grow as a person. Working here taught me how to prioritize my time, and of course I gained exceptional work experience with customers and cash handling. I loved working with my co-workers, most days they made it  pleasant coming into work because we'd all be there for one another; whether it was us venting to one another, or motivating each other. I've met a lot of wonderful people while I worked here, and I still keep in contact with them."
good,come in & try to process shipment in 4 hours than go home. promise of more hours are thrown out there and promised weekly but never happens.
good,"The job began fabulously.  I enjoyed the work, the team, and my manager.  The job initially had growth potential and I worked up from a basic support specialist to a sales support team leader. The ill fated company restructuring took place under the new ceo changed the landscape of the company to an ill and bitter tone.  "
good,work in putting cords together testing them made sure they were working properly
good,"Associates hurdle into groups and ""bully"" employees. Also, when a report of something so important has been made, management does not do their duty and full take control of the situation. This goes for the Loss prevention side and the JCP Associates who work for JCP."
good,"Overall it nice working here. Management wasn't to bad, co-workers was fun to work with."
good,"constant changes in procedures, rules and regulations make this a stress filled environment to work in on a day to day basis.  Overall, thought my experience with the company (at first)was a positive one...would I recommend anyone to seek employment there? Sure, as long as they had a second job or no responsibilities."
good,"Very unprofessional company, very unorganized. The most enjoyable part of this job was giving customers my service."
good,I enjoyed working with the other employees but management and the way they ran their business was absolutely awful.
good,A typical day at work was to fold clothes and stand at the register to ring customers up. I learned to be alert. The coworkers were great made work a little easier. The hardest part of my job was the long hours during holiday season. The most enjoyable part of my job is the clothes discounts.
good,"JCP Penney was an awesome company to work for when I started. We were truly focused on the customers and still upheld the original values of Mr. Penney. Honesty, integrity, respect, and a firm belief that our store should be your home away from home. In 2009, things started getting ugly and the introduction of a new store manager did not bring encouragement. He only knew how to motivate through threats of termination and spent most of his time gossiping about his staff. He fired anyone he didn't like and replaced them with friends. An example is the friend he brought in as a manager with NO previous experience. This friend made $4 MORE per HOUR than I did despite my near decade of experience. Instead of terminating associates, he would simply force the supervisors to leave the employee off the schedule for 4 weeks because they will simply fall out of the system."
good,"Responsible for the delivery of furniture and large catalog items to customers in the Jacksonville, Fl. area."
good,"Every day was very special day with customers,"
good,I start by organize backroom. Open register and start selling shoe. As im selling shoe and i am not selling i am organizing displays. At Night clean up and close registers.
good,Fun place to work and love the clothes! I enjoyed working at this location because we were more of a family. I enjoyed the coupons and the employee discount and Employee Appreciation Day.
good,"I think with better management, the job could be good again."
good,"Management would harass you everyday to sale a credit card or open up one yourself"
good,"Do not get comfortable with working here. Although there are opportunities to advance in the company, many years will go by before reaching that point."
good,JCP is a okay store if your looking for decent hours. Still minimum wage and u dont get promoted really. Management could be better but its not that hard.
good,A lot of work is put on you without the necessary tools to get the job done. The pay is SO NOT worth it. The Jcpenney company overall does not care about its employees. They provide no benefits to part timers and don't value employees that have been loyal and worked for them for years. There is no opportunity for growth.
good,Too many minorities work there.  They often hire seasonal temporaries to work in the warehouse and call center then downsize following the fiscal review to include both direct hire and temporary staff.
good,I enjoyed my job until they started pushing us to push credit cards on the customer. Working in the stock room is a lot more fun but the time constraints makes things stressful sometimes.
good,jcp general managers micromanage everything dont give u a chance to do your job....high turnover of associates .makes it tough to build team atmosphere...no incentives to stay with company if u wish to advance u m\ust do outside of company
good,JCP salons in certain areas that don't do well you will be working to stay poor. They start you at $9 and make you work like a sweat shop taking clients just to get commission on services product commission is not at a reasonable percentage. They have sales that only hurt stylist and the education is only given if you can make it to a central location educators don't go to salonsseachsalon to ensure
good,"Great place to work if you're a seasoned stylist, however not enough training for girls just starting out. Very hard to grow and build a clientele because the salon is over saturated with stylist."
good,"I knew wben I was hired it was only a minimum wage job but thought annual raises were given.  I only received one raise after working there three years.  When I received a raise, it wasn’t even a full quarter!  I only received a 22 cent increase!  Really?  They couldn’t round it up to 25 cents?  The employee discount was great. The store manager pushes the associates to get credit card applications."
good,I worked for the season then my hours got slowly cut back. You get to do a wide variety of things while on seasonal crew though. People were nice there
good,One of the oddest places I've worked for. They really push credit applications and are rude to you if you don't get that many. I'm a student and they scheduled me WAY more than I said I could work. Like 10 hours more. Honestly work somewhere else because it isn't a very positive and supportive work environment.
good,Fun workplace meet a lot of differnet people to socialize being able to assist customers with any questions or concerns hardest part is maintaing everything
good,"At first, working at Jcpenny's is really fun. The environment there is super chill except for the managers. The managers at my location really did suck except for maybe one of them. If you did not get an ICAP aka open up a credit card for customers, they would basically give you dirty looks and treat you badly. If you approached the end of your shift and everything is not put away, the managers would all look at you with disgust and talk bad things behind your back."
good,the manager would never help me out when i really needed it. customers were rude and even saw and said things about how the manager was. i worked by myself a lot of times.
good,doing my job duties not only include people skills but patience as well. I worked in and around people constantly. the job could have  been therapeutic at times.
good,This company was a joke that is my review. I was harassed as well as several other employees and absolutely nothing was done. That is all i have to say
good,"I work in the jewelry department selling jewelry and cashier, cleaning cases,helping customers and answering phones and helping out in other departments when needed."
good,"Zero room for days off, even family emergencies or general sick days. Management is hardly every seen. No help with advancement and learning. Expectations and duties do not fit job descriptions or pay. Benefits are not great."
good,"Working in the jewelry department was commission based. I needed to sell care plans to get most of that commission. I learned the necessity and importance of growing a customer relationship so they come back and buy more merchandise. As a team we needed to reach a certain goal through each sale the store held. Of course the hardest part of the job was persuading people to buy when they can't afford an item. On black Friday management catered food to us, which I appreciated. I did not enjoy the lack of hours I received."
good,Leadership team gets blamed for upper management issues. GM and ASMs have zero respect for anyone under them. New corporate policies create massive customer service issues.
good,With a meeting to start the day to insure all team members are aware of the new sales and products to hit the floor. Shoe associate was my job! nothing better than making somebody day with  the right pair of shoes.
good,Job is ok. Pay is not. Upper management miserable and nitpicky despite being paid 3-5x more. Was once blackmailed by the manager that now runs the reconstructed team.
good,It was an okay place to work. The management had favorites. There was said that there was room for a permanent position but all of the seasonal workers were let go.
good,"Management could have been better. Managers in different areas were more helpful then the manager in my department.  They didn't have a lot of time to properly train employees on the floor. Constantly understaffed, resulting in a stressful environment."
good,Good learning opportunities while improving process. Transitioning to agile. Not very focused on quality. Focusing on head core and tail strategy and improving the dotcom site
good,I enjoyed what I did but dealing with management was not a great thing. They would change their mind all the time on how to do projects and not be uniform on their policies.
good,"greet customers help them, team work , put clothes away make sure the store looked nice. the work place was a young crowd from all ages.  the hardest part is making the customer happy and make sure they get the price they want."
good,A Typical day at work would be that I did not have a set schedule and it was a 2 week schedule that rotated. I learned how to fold clothes a certain way and change out the Tills and count down the money. Management was good and helped if you needed help. The hardest part of the job would be standing on your feet with long lines. The most enjoyable part was making friends.
good,I worked as a loss prevention officer and spent most of my time monitoring security cameras and apprehending shoplifters. I learned many problem solving and safety skills at this job due to the physical aspects of law enforcement needed to complete the tasks.
good,I was not impressed with how management handled things. They weren't very easy to talk to. They acted like they had everything under control yet when ever you went to talk to them about something they wouldn't do anything about it.
good,"Stressful work environment. Management takes advantage of hard working employees. Discount is decent, but that is the only bonus. Human resources is a joke."
good,I've never worked with a more unprofessional group of people in my life. The managers do not adhere to your availability. Their attitudes are worse than that of the customers.
good,I felt as if JCPenney allowed little social life. Also the managers were not very understanding when it came to scheduling. If you are an athlete or have other school activities this is not the place for you to work.
good,"When I worked with my co-workers it was nice. We helped each other. We had to stay always beside the register, even when helping a customer. We felt like children."
good,Poor management.   Management  lack skills and  discipline needed to successfully create a respectful working relationship between management and employee. Many times missed breaks.  Training was terrible - self training through modules within a limited time frame.  Company does not learn anything from the many reviews posted online.  Unprofessional attitudes of management.
good,"Jcp was a good place to work for, at least because I gained commission and that would make a huge difference on my paychecks. Some supervisors were very easy to work with."
good,JcPenney was my first job before going off to college. Working in retail really tests your patience and ability to give exceptional customer service. The people were sometime great to work with but there were other times where they would not contribute their share to get the job done.
good,Its a great place to work if you love fashion and great discounts. I worked with wonderful people and really miss them . During holidays and sales promotion the days can get a little hectic and stressful.
good,"I didn't like working there, just for the simple fact that I am more of a manufacturing type of guy. Some of the coworkers were rude and the customers were even more rude."
good,I didnt exactly work fir jc penny i work for a company thru jcpenny which i didnt like at all the ours was messed uo and there was mo communication at all
good,This is a great company to work for but the management is awful. Breaks were deducted from salary but not given. Scheduling was always incorrect in system. There was not adequate training. Most employees were found hiding during work hours to keep from working.
good,"I got thrown into a position I was never trained on. You are trained on a basic register for about a day then you are thrown into a position. Any sort of special position (bras, jewelry, decor, etc...) you really aren't trained for. I found myself being asked a lot of questions I had no answer to. And when I was hired in I was told that I was being hired in as a regular employee, not a temp. Then I was suddenly out of a job and told it was because I was only temporary. I didn't get a chance to know the managers (LOD's) that well. And there is too much emphasis on the surveys and they credit card applications. You can be an amazing employee but you are worth nothing if you do not get those survey's and applications."
good,I worked at Jcpenney home store located in pleasanton  from 2008 to 2010. For me it was a good learning experience. I improved my communication skills and also learned how important the customers are in every business.
good,"It's a good job to get you experience but not so much for anything else. The typical day goes from very fast pace one second to beyond slow the next. They push credit applications way to much, almost to the point of them preferring them over keeping the store clean and greeting customers."
good,This job is what it is an extreme part time job.  Good for what a second job.  No real advancement opportunities.  Management promotes from only the sales floor.
good,"After the store manager left the store the department manager start to lack in her duty which reflect on us sales people, she never had signs ready for sales, customer were complain about the repairs and she was never ever in the department to handle any problems so can meet out sales goals"
good,"The environment at JCPenney used to be one of family, fairness, and appreciation. The current location is the worst from disrespectful leadership to unproductive and untrained associates."
good,No balance of work and life. No longer a company that there for their associates. Only worried about what RATING they get. Hard to get upper management to see it from the stores eyes and whats happening .
good,"JCPenny can be a very fun place to work on occasion. Most of the time it is very stressful. Its stressful because you are not doing just one job, you are doing a little bit of everything. And everyone is doing that which means its a lot of bumping heads and conflicts. It is definitely not a very organized place."
good,The work is easy. You are either ringing or cleaning. It was my first job. I really enjoyed working with my coworkers. Holidays are the busiest. Wasnt too bad.
good,"Over worked, under payed. Your typical first job, nothing you wouldn't expect from a failing company. If you're not quick on your feet you wont last regardless of how polite or detail oriented you are."
good,"Extremely boring work, unfair standards, inappropriate comments from management about physical appearance. Pay raise and advancements promised and fully discussed within office, and then hiring someone less qualified from outside of the company."
good,I enjoy my time there. I became an great employe . I learned retail is hard and you can't make it without an smile. The hardest part was customers treating me like I didn't know what I was doing.
good,I was a good worker and followed all instructions but coming december they laid off a whole bunch of people without giving explanation and they only gave us a 25% off coupon to spend in the store which was good for 1 year.
good,For the most part it is a good job to have if you need a second job. However if you needs this to be a full time gig it isn't going to work out. They give full time hours around holidays and after that hours get cut to 15 hours a week if you are not hired full time.(which I was told full time is earned they never hire at full time). A lot of people who work in this location feel like management needs a lot of improvement. It's hard to get in touch with a manager especially if it is for a customer complaint. They usually take so long to reach an irate customer who then becomes extremely angry. There is room for advancement but most feel like you need to befriend those in higher positions to even be considered for an advancement. Supervisors and Leaders do not communicate with each other so it does make the environment way more stressful than it has to be.
good,jcp raises were horrible!! i literally got an $.08 cent increase!! i was flabbergasted at how they expected us to learn all these different job functions with the lowest call center pay
good,"JCPenney's is an organization, that has its heart in the right place. But it is being blinded by the current financial hardship, it is currently going through. They have lost sight of what is important... their employees and have chosen to put them second to profit gain. Its becoming a climate of winning, no matter the cost. It makes me sad, because working for this company used to make me feel, like I was making a difference (yes, even in retail), for a company that cared about me. If JCPenney, does not remember the people on the frontlines, fighting to save them...they will lose everything."
good,"I guess i'm not really too keen on having a retail job, it was really hard for me to get people to sign up for the credit card. They don't really offer to many hours and sometimes the customers and employees were very rude."
good,"Typical day would be taking shifts working cash register or cleaning the store. There are angry costumers every day, but the job tended to be pretty low stress."
good,"Showing high end jewelry and learning about the gems stones.  My department manager was awesome, the store manager needs to improve her way of handling the employees."
good,Working truck your hours are first to get cut when hours are needed elsewhere. You have to fight for hours to get decent hours. The management is a good team but it seems their hands are tied nine times out of ten.
good,"Depends on how busy the day would be. If its slow, then you'll just fold, put back, and check pricing accuracy all day. If its busy, then you'll be helping customers, checking out customers, and making sure the fitting rooms stay clean. The only reason why the rating is low is because the management. The kids department never had a supervisor until the last couple of weeks I worked there and she had no prior experience in retail. The upper management could careless about you. In the summer, the AC went out for four days and the kids department was on the second level. The water cooler never worked and we weren't aloud to have drinks on the sales floor. I felt sick so they had me sit in the back and told me to wear lighter clothes. Within two weeks the AC was back out again. And while the AC was out you never saw any management on the second floor in their offices or the sales floor. But I have heard about better management at different locations."
good,I have been at this company for almost three years and it has really help me build charcater and shown me working with the public isn't easy. This job becomes very overwhelming after a year. I would only work here if you like putting away clothes and working with the public
good,This store is very high volume with a very high turnover rate. The customers are difficult and the management was not very progressive. There was not much as far as training and development. It was very unorganized.
good,the supervisors work you hard and long. they don't have any consideration to people who work for them. they don't treat workers right they talk down to people and are very rude i had an horrible experience and was over worked and poorly compensated for it.
good,"The call center closed and everyone was laid off. For the most part, everyone was nice and considerate of each other. Very strict on having to follow dialogue VERBATUM"
good,Its was more work then i could handle. They wanted you to do your job plus other jobs that have people with different job titles. Management has the picks of who the like which is not a great way to run a company. The employees are messy and it feels like a high school and not a business. The hardest part about the job was having to do everyone's job but your and not getting pay for all the work you put into doing the extra work. The most enjoyable part able this was getting paid every two weeks.
good,They completely lie about everything. Every manager acted as if they hated their job on a daily. I could NOT get a minute with the right manager. I and a co-worker told 6 managers that we were switching shifts and when i showed up that day no one knew or had changed it.
good,"I had no department manager, all they cared about was credit apps, break room was dull, a few managers were big on favoritism, rude, didn't care about employees just sales. Mediocre pay."
good,Jcpenny is a very good place to work but the racial tention is no good they hire u then they treat u good the first couple months then u see that if your not Latino u cant never move up the they tell u that you replaceable
good,it was the time when the ceo took over and alot of jobs where cut very confusing to get mixed instructions the most enjoyable part was  that you where taught well
good,This company is all about money and not being a team. The managers did not treat their employees with respect. It was all play and no fun. I felt like I was a prisoner within the company or as if my opinion did not matter.
good,"When I first started here I loved it.  The store manager was very accommodating and I really enjoyed going to work every day."
good,"Typical Work Day: 8 sittings spaced apart, you are expected to go find more sittings throughout JC Penney"
good,"The managers here only get promoted as long as they can sell cc, they don't have to know any of the information  needed to be a manager, example I shouldn't have more knowledge of the manager position then the manager. They dont care about the law as in they didnt give me time off for a funeral all they care about is money."
good,management could use a lot more training she is very rude and inconsiderate to everyone around her she is the reason i left
good,The general manager is not a people person and does not lead by example. The hardest part of the job is keeping great reliable associates because of the low pay. I learned here that the tone and expectations needed to have been set by the store manager upon her arrival.
good,"Typical Day, I open de-arm and let in my team. Learning something new everyday can be a challenge but it makes it better. Management at this store has a few kinks but there are a couple good ones. Some of my co-workers are great, happy, on-time, and excellent at their jobs but some of them need a new hobby. The hardest part of my "
good,"The company is always going through changes. If the management is good, then it's a pretty ;aid back job. All the customers are regulars and make my day."
good,"It's definitely not the best place to work in retail. You do a lot of work for little pay. Management does not relay anything to others when you call out for work. I have left notes and only one person reads them and doesn't relay that information to anyone else. I loved my coworkers, that was probably the only thing I enjoyed. The hardest part of the job is dealing with people. It does come with the job, but some people really test you. I would not suggest working the holiday season unless you can tolerate the people you deal with and being away from your family. I worked Thanksgiving night till four in the morning and came back into work that night again. It was not fun at all. I personally think you could find a better retail company to work for, and have better pay and benefits."
good,"Job title involves processing the merchandise that comes in on truck shipments. We must size, sort, and organize clothing and other merchandise by department then deliver to the floor in an efficient and orderly manner. Because this position requires adherence to a pacing schedule the job can be fast paced and physically demanding. Also due to the unpredictability of shipment sizes, work hours can be wildly inconsistent from day to day and week to week. I would not recommend it to anyone looking for a consistent schedule or a certain amount of hours per week.  Occasionally other duties such as weekly RFID scanning, recovery (such as folding clothes and tidying up the sales floor), or customer service will be asked to be performed."
good,poor management and the hours are horrible.  If you don't mind working late and weekends then it would be ok.  The pay is not good and you do have to pay for your own health insurance if you want it.
good,"I dont remember much, but did enjoy working with the cutomers.  and assisting them in their purchases.the fellow employees were a joy to work with.and when I had to leave they were very understanding."
good,"When you arrive, you clock- in and then go to the register to find a binder that has the schedule with the member location on the sales floor. "
good,It's okay. you have to experience it to understand. The people I work with are annoying and they really need to work on what they look for when hiring. lazy co workers.
good,"Working around a bunch a woman is just nothing, but a bunch of drama! The job was nice at first, but then you get to know how people really are and then you just can't stand to be around anyone anymore because they are complaining about how everyone is so miserable with their job or how someone else does not do their job."
good,Fun job but doesn't pay well. Even for employees who have been there for years. Defintely a job for teenagers for sure. They mostly offer part-time work.
good,"I have had some of the best and some of the absolute worst Manager's working with this company."
good,"A typical day of work is to put out the diamonds in am, open the registers and get ready for the customers. (approx. 1 hour) Because of this, many times I would miss the initial sales meeting for the day and many times had to ask another employee if there was something important that I missed. "
good,"providing excellent customer service, working as a team to meet sales goals and productivity flexible schedule, My most enjoyable part of the job working one on one with customers and leading a team for store recovery and seasonal workers."
good,"Retail is retail -- it has its ups and downs.  Our store was experiencing hardship, but every store is different!  Meeting all kinds of different people is what makes retail exciting -- and scoping out super cute clothes, too!  It's definitely not the worst place to be, although everything depends on your location."
good,Dealing with grumpy and angry coworkers/managers. No room for advancement for the dedicated people. Very few ways to increase your pay.
good,"I enjoyed working here at the beginning but as months passed by, I realized how horrible the employees are treated and I noticed there was a lot of discrimination. This company should not hire so many teenagers because that's where a lot of drama starts and there's no end to it."
good,"I have learned to the register well,order online,use all my customer service skills and used my fluent Spanish speaking,reading and writing skills"
good,"Management would constantly remind Associates that they were expendable.  Associates were called names such as ""Brain Dead'.  Complaints to upper management went unheeded."
good,"Amazing coworkers"
good,"I worked as a customer service specialist at a small market JC Penney.  Since I worked for a smaller market store, there was no room for advancement or growth with in the store.  The location that I worked at was closed in May of 2014 as part of a corporate restructuring."
good,I enjoyed working with customers and did my best to provide them with the best customer service possible.
good,"this job can be tedious or busy, it just depends on the day and time of day. there is not a lot of room for growth."
good,Thing that was most enjoyable about this job was the customer support. Enjoyed assisting and meeting new people.
good,"When hired, I was told that there was room to grow.  Within the six month time being there, I was then told that I was not leaving the one department and was not going to move anywhere."
good,"Jcpenny is like any other job. Some days you hate it and some days you love it. My typical day at work was coming in, working with a large amount of customers, getting on the registers, and clocking out and leaving. I've learned that no matter what customers are always right, I've also learned how to work on a cash register, and learning all about the clothes, latest fashion, and the name brands within the store. Management was poor I went through a whole team of managers and two store managers. My co-workers were alright, we were all like a big family, we all got on each other's nerves but at the end of the day nobody else could pick with us. The hardest part of my job I would have to say was changing the signs but my most enjoyable pat of my job was seeing customers leave happy"
good,when i was hired i was told that i was a regular hire not a seasonal..but i was treated as a sesonal employee.. hired in august and let go in january..well i was never let go they just never said ANYTHING and everytime i called i never got a answer...but i would advise future employee canidates that if you believe you cannot do like three credit applications in a week dont bother thats all they are after you work like three and four hour days on a monday at lunch time you ring up a total of 5 people during a resession and dont get ten credit applications then your not good enough for jcpenney.
good,I did a lot of towel folding and sweeping instead of working on clients because it is a low traffic salon. My previous clientele didn't care for the pricing so they didn't fallow me. They are constantly going through different managers and would often go months without a salon manger. They couldn't seem to keep a consistent staff.
good,The store always had something for anyone that walked thru the doors in any color the could ever want. Management was very caring about the employees and the store.
good,The commission that we were able to make on the products we sold really helped our paychecks. The stylists would do the receptionists hair for free so we could show off to their customers. We were able to  be the first to know when discounts hit in the store. You could pick up $50.00 items marked down to $2.77. The bad part of the job was when I first started working there I never had a day off. The other receptionist was a friend of my Boss and she got her choice hours and days. I had a poor base salary so I made sure that I pushed the sales. 
good,Learned time management and importance of an education. No time for family or outside of work enjoyment. Difficult to work with scheduling outside of company.
good,"Jcp is a social store I enjoye working at.. The associateare friendly, and  they give the job a home like feeling... Most of the customers are regulars making it fun to assist in thier needs."
good,"A typical day at work meant a lot of interactions face to face with customers at the registers, merchandising, answer customer questions, locating items for the customers."
good,i work there as a stylist it was a not a great experience for a stylist lie myself (creative)
good,As a supervisor and an associate customer service was the best part of working in retail. I learned to do floor sets and associate training. The hardest part of the job was training the associate on the new pricing theme. The most enjoyable job was just the day to day working with a great bunch of folks.
good,"Sometimes very slow or little traffic, so no opportunity for sales or getting a credit application and the pressure was extreme at times."
good,Pushing employees on an hourly basis to enroll customers in credit.
good,I didnt like how they couldnt work around my schedule at the time.
good,"Penny's is good as a short term job. Expect to do the work of three people on your own. Several times they scheduled me without telling me, and expected me to notice the change. When I didn't, they called me to inquire as to why I wasn't at work. You are told in training to see ID for payment made by card to ensure signatures match, and you are not allowed to accept that form of payment if they do not match. Customers get mad and ask to speak to a manager who will come over and make you look stupid by accpeting the signatures, when they don't match. Management will constantly step on your toes to ""please"" the customer even if it is the EXACT OPPOSITE of what they told you to do in training. Customers are very rude, although that is the case in any retail environment and is not a direct result of the company. The new changes within the company has made many people mad, of which the customers take it out on the associates, so be prepared to deal with angry people on a daily basis."
good,wish the company had more advancment and job security when it comes to moving forward with the company
good,There is a huge lack of managerial skills shown in upper management. They have a skewed view on what is expected from associates at all times. Management pushs associates to get customers to sign up for the credit card in any way possible and demands compliance on the credit goals for the day. Management has used out of work issues and used the knowledge to bully and demean associates during work hours.
good,Alot of favouritism within the company. Within management some worked harder than others with smaller pay and felt discriminated against. Company benefits did not comply with the network for this location.
good,"When I started it was great but the company was between managers. The work environment is very tumultuous and staff is scarce and spread thin, the manager has a ""board of shame"" where names of employees who call in are visible, multiple employees have quit or been let go causing an extreme surplus of merchandise in backrooms of all departments."
good,"I would say this is a good part-time position to earn an extra income. However, this job is mostly geared towards high school students and retired employees. I would not recommend working here as a full-time employee."
good,I like my job at JCPenney being a detail checker or what I don't like is they send you home early our job starts at 5 a.m. in the morning in about 9:00 am. they will send you home saying there's no work and that can go on for months. The work is not consistent.
good,"Favoritism is real, and it sucks. One week you would work 5 days make 25 hours then the next week you go to working 2 days lmao "
good,Salary needs to be raised more hours needed early benefits for workers.  They lie about benefits. Some managers and supervisors do next to nothing on the job and pressure the workers sending them all over the place to work.
good,When your called in for interview you're sitting there waiting 30 to 40 minutes before you see anybody but they tell you to get there on time but they're not prepared and then when you go in the way that you're talk to the talk down at and then they don't want to answer the questions that you're asking when the interview is over with the amount of pay is there any health benefits they want you to do a lot for the small amount of pay the environments just not healthy and the managers very disrespectful would never ever work there.
good,It was fair and easy. They really helped to get me  back on my feet until the true colors started to show with The store Manager Brad The Hr Is an Angel. but don’t do it save yourself from sin plus management is terrible except for 3 people but that’s not my problem.
good,"Too many managers, some aren't even real managers, they only play manager for a few hours sometimes. The workers are mostly snobby young kids and it's just not worth my time. Too much disrespect at that place."
good,It was a fun environment to work in but the management was poor and often had no direction and no plan. They hired too many people having to lay off certain people without warning. Made promises for raises and hours that they did not keep. I would recommend the job to anyone looking for a laid back experience.
good,Everyone there acted like they were in highschool. Had to meet a credit card sale goal everyday and if it was not met your hours will drop. There was not enough trainning.
good,Jcp was my first job and I enjoyed it for maybe a month and realized it was not all that. The management was not that great and they picked favorites .
good,"Experience from this wasn't the best, but it was an learning experience understand how to communicate with people and understanding their needs from the employees."
good,The best thing about working at JCP was the discount and time of day I worked. Otherwise I did not like it at all. I did not like the attitude of the leader of dept. She was mean and rude unless she wanted something and no matter how many complained she never changed. I finally went as high as I could go in the store and still got treated as if my feelings or opinions did not count. She was able to talk to us and treat us any type of way without so much as a reprimand in her file. I finally quit and haven't looked back once.
good,"Hours given are sporadically given and the communication between levels of management is often lost between the multiple levels.  "
good,Not the best place to work. Workload is entirely too much for the amount of payroll given. Training is next to nothing unless it’s on the computer when they have enough payroll to get you on it. I wouldn’t recommend this place. Big sign when you’ve worked there for less than 7 years and already gone throug 4 ceos not a great sign. Communication from all aspects sucks in this company. They try but it’s not consistent. There is a lot of high schoolers working there that have no care and the leadership team who are adults are not professional you can see the rip between the teams.
good,just ugh... if u want a set job with no advancements for the rest of your life.. this is a job for you :). if u even ask for a pay raise.. they tell u to get back to them. everything’s put on a back burner there.
good,"Hard to Achieving unrealistic goals "
good,"Prior to several years of restructuring, JC Penney served as an unparalleled place to develop and grow; truly cutting edge.  The restructuring and organizational changes significantly impacted this key component of organizational growth and it was felt at each level."
good,This was a typical retail job.  Your day will include customer engagement and the upkeep of the store.  Some of the managers were very helpful.  Nice employee discount.
good,"This company is a good part time jobs for high school students.  But if you need a full time job and better pay then this job isn't for you. They are super flexible with hours. They are really bad at training, I had to learn everything on my own with very little help from my co workers"
good,Overall the associates were decent but the management was really bad and unprofessional. Very unorganized and care free about us employees. Give ideas and would get shut down from them.
good,People are rude. Managers are miserable. Petty. Everything is about opening credit cards. Really annoying. Underpaid. Too little hours except at christmas.
good,the store manager told me that i had to pick between working and school and at the time i still didnt finish high school. and they only scheduled me during school hours knowing i couldnt work those hours.
good,Working for Jcpenny's was terrible. My father got sick and had to have heart surgery. My salon manager acted like she did not care. They put in a transfer to another store without me knowing until that store manager was calling me. It was just super shady.
good,"Typical day at work Ringing up clients orders, helping with questions ordering things in catalog."
good,"lack of team work, no raises, very little appreciation. No room for growth. Very high turnover rate. Great leaders are needed. a great leader coach their team for a high success rate."
good,"Management was always very rude and unorganized, also very pushy. My duties/responsibilities were usually not clearly defined. The customers are always very rude, but other staff my level were nice."
good,I mainly worked in shoe department for this company. We would assist customer and direct them in which ever way they needed. I learned how to work a register and not to take everything personally.
good,Work days was always typical. I learned to work at a very fast past as an order filler and also got to cross train in different area in my department.
good,When I was employed here it was ok but not perfect the purpose for an retail job is flexility and that was not the case they will cut your hours if they feel your schedule is not working for them.
good,It was okay. If fitting rooms were clear there was always something that needed to be cleaned up or reticketed. Management is usually there when you need help but don’t expect them to go above and beyond for you. They’re always pushing associates to get credit apps which can get annoying but it’s to be expected with a retail job. There is definitely favoritism for associates who get credit apps who get away with doing nothing and being on their phones. Not fair to hardworking associates who do their jobs. More pressure is put on these associates to keep the store looking nice rather than lazy ones who get credit apps. Associates are for the most part friendly and approachable. If you need help someone will usually appear but we were always short-staffed so often times you will find yourself doing multiple things at once. There are special events for associates but they don’t happen often. If you want to get recognized at this job just get credit apps bc they don’t praise people for anything else. Obviously not a job you’ll keep forever.
good,"In a store which had over 125 employees, there was only 1 full time associate. That alone demonstrates the company's commitment to an employee's future... or lack thereof. Why reward service with a regular paycheck and provide health care when instead you could just hire 2-3 times more people, and cut them back to less than 8 hours per week when sales are low or you want to get rid of them? Why would someone care to go out of their way to do great work if there is no incentive? Welcome to JCP."
good,"Best work family in the world..  all understanding, always helpful in training and always sweet and nice verses always on a negative side of them........."
good,"A typical day includes greeting customers and cleaning up the store. We ring up cutomers transactions, however it would be nice if we weren't short staffed most of the time. They gave us very little time to complete a lot of tasks. However, if we weren't always short staffed, it would be easier to get more done. The pay for employees was not always fair. Certain employees who had no experiance versus people with almost a year of experiance started off with a higher salary. However the most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers. I also liked how flexible they were with my schedule."
good,"This job is great for high school or college students that do not need to support a home. However, if you are looking for a career to support your family, I would recommend looking somewhere else."
good,"A typical day at jcpenneys was assisting customers and keeping departments clean, however there were days where the general manager worked. he will most likely be the downfall of the store on the basis of his attitude. he has caused many good associates to quit in the year that hes been there. If it had been one of the ten other managers to move into that position, the store would still be in great shape and a wonderful place to work. They made the environment comfortable for customers and easier for the workers. they ran the store while the old gm was in and he gave them enough room to show their skills and progress. Now that the gm is luke, its not even worth working there anymore"
good,Favoritism and unfair wages and PTO balances. Lack of leadership and structure from management personal. Busted my back for 3 years for a company who had no appreciation for there workers. When help was needed for a job managers were nowhere to be found and you would get blamed for management errors. Hours were cut so bad i was down to 12 hours a week while employees who hadn't been there but a month were awarded full time schedule for doing nothing. Always had to clean up after someone trash was always left by night shift. In conclusion with better management i believe JcPenny (cottonwood location) could be a great store and place to work.
good,"Tedious and repetitive . Not stimulating or fun. Tiresome. Little incentive.I learned I don't enjoy working in retail. Very disorganized.Most enjoyable part of job is making friends. Hardest part was getting switched over all departments, so never got to learn too much about any one before reassigned and changes in merchandising daily seemed pointless."
good,"JCPenney is a good company to work for, however that particular store was managed poorly. The entire staff had low moral and everyone was miserable working there."
good,The managers were very nice and always put the customer first. They would assist in anything the customer needed. Most of the workers were very helpful as well.
good,They have u work very fast and u have to learn very fast. U have to get along with employees that are to rude if not u will get let go. U have go throw a temp service once u get your hours u think u will get hired on but they let u go to get in New temp.
good,"Examined merchandise to verify that it was correctly priced and displayed."
good,Not a very suitable  place to work if you want to advance. Its nearly impossible to do. Things change there within the company yearly. With every year being more and more extreme.
good,"Since this was my very first job, i really enjoyed working with clothes and interacting with people. Overall I learned a lot about the way I work and got to break out of shell. I was a fats leaner and loved the job."
good,Very laid back and relaxed environment. Somewhat organized in terms of management and marketing. I enjoyed the customers and co workers i worked with. Not a difficult job but a good beginning job for teens or a first job
good,"Overall JCPenney is a good company, but the location I work at has very poor leadership. I believe that, at the right location, a person may be able to flourish."
good,if you a person who just need money Jcpenney is their. i mean people need to pay bills and that's what this job is good for.... paying bills. people come to work and then go home that's it.
good,"While there were days that held a lot of stress, there were also days that held very minimal stress. Overall, decent place to work. This company comes with a few downfalls: hourly wages were poor, management was unprofessional, co-workers slacked off quite often."
good,The environment is not conducive for growth from the lack support from management. Nothing is consistent changes occur every 3 months. Organizational implications effect employees lifestyle.
good,Retail is harder than most think. JCPenney is an okay company to work for. But I wouldn't want to make this my life calling. I'd work as extra help around the holidays though.
good,As soon as you walk into the store you notice that work needs to be done. Clothes need to be placed back in the correct location and customers need to be assisted. As well as bringing new products out onto the floor for consumer purchase.
good,When I first started here it was an amazing place to work. Over time the hours got terrible and the experience just sucked. There is a ton of drama between associates and the managers aren't very professional.
good,Working at JcPenney's does have it's benefits sometimes but they also go by favoritism. The hours there are very terrible whenever it's not during any holidays. The employees there are all very friendly and willing to help out one another.
good,"This company has big, big problems with how it treats employees. People are fired over the most ridiculous petty things and for no reason whatsoever other than a manger dislikes or is jealous. This company  can only be described as COLD BLOODED and low down dirty. They takes the welfare and self-esteem of their employees for granted. Too many managers have firing ability is one of the issues with JCPenney. JC Penney needs to instill a practical and fair process for firing employees. Their method is the most inhumane I have ever witnessed.  However, the blame falls squarely upon JC Penney as a company for not having a progressive discipline policy established, outlining how corrective action and termination should take place should they have to fire someone.  It would BUILD TRUST and RESPECT from employees if they knew they could count on every employee issue being handled consistently and FAIRLY."
good,"My typical day is lead on the floor training staff,fixing errors on registers,making sure all guest are greeted and helped,making sure staff are kept on task,selling credit,opening and closing registers and store."
good,An okay place to work if you want to get your foot in the door. Good place to gain experience and really helps with communication skills with other people.
good,"I worked at JCPenneys for a while and I loved the environment, however the supervisors and store manager were just rude all the time and never wanted to help you move forward. They never understood your needs, and even if you worked full time hours, you were still considered a part time employee with no benefits."
good,"I worked here as my first job when I turned 16, and it was ok, but I feel the compensation should have been higher for the amount of work they required. I also feel the management was quite absent in things they should have taken care of. Based on my experience I would not recommend working here, but things may have changed, and my experience probably doesn't reflect the way all other JCPenny stores operate."
good,Working at JcPenney allowed me to meet new people with my customer service skills.  I also had flexibility to move around the store to learn different departments.
good,"Overall the company did not allow anyone to advance in any position, but only allowed to move into different departments which still landed you in square one.   However the management was bearable."
good,A typical day as a visual specialist during the holidays is the best time to work here. I enjoyed viewing all of the newly shipped items and getting to take a look at new clothing for mannequins before anyone else knew what the new shipments were. It is very high paced but overall a great job if you dont mind doing the work.
good,The company is cut to the bone. They only have one person working where we used to have three or more. The annualy pay raises are minimun. Insurance is not very good.
good,"Keep looking, don't stop here. Management is not invested in their direct reports. Select Managers have style of do as I say not as I do. Very little accountability for Managers!"
good,"The new location I am at is NOT near the quality of the location I came from, and it has to do with lack of management. I do not wish to disclose any further information, as I am new there, it is smaller than the one I am from, and I do not need any drama."
good,"It was definitely a job to get a feel for, being a slower paced company with a lot of older customers, you will definitely encounter some people upset about coupons and such, but it's a great learning experience for a starting point in retail."
good,"While working at jc penny thei noticed there is alot of favoritism in the company the managment is very poor, the pay dosent compensate for your everyday needs and the benifits are poor. The scheduling is never right, there isnt any structure to the company. Im greatful for them giving me a job but i cannot work in that environment."
good,"I typically never stop running at work. I am either putting out stock, reworking departments, assisting customers, assisting associates with issues, or packing and shipping customer orders. Over my four years I have learned effective management skills and sharpened my communication skills. There are several people on the management tea. Most of them are competent but would excel under better general management. The culture has shifted over time to a less supportive and inclusive environment to a place where most of the associates are uncomfortable and feel targeted. The hardest part of my job is trying to fill too many shoes at one time and the most enjoyable part is being able to move freely through departments."
good,I worked at the distribution center of JCPenny as a package handler moving and sorting boxes. Boss was cool and got 2 15 minute breaks and 1 30 minutes lunch break but job was very tough.
good,"I only worked there for a short period of time, management did not work to provide a work life balance. The job duties were  very mundane, no encouragement from management about advancing within the company."
good,"I enjoy working at JCPenney, in this company I have learned so many things. I learned how to manage the most difficult situations but as we work as a team nothing can be difficult. I don't think so if there is anything hard about this job and even if there is any difficulty there always a solution. The most enjoyable part of my job is I get to meet new people everyday. Customer service is so much fun."
good,"Not a single person I worked with a couple years ago still works there, kept me over on school nights after promising they wouldn't. Made it seem like getting time off for school wouldn't be a problem then would turn around and deny any request off. Over worked me after promising a maximum amount of hours. Sometimes wouldn't leave the store until after 11 because management didn't think the store was straightened up enough, even after going over the same sections multiple times. My job was often threatened if I didn't get ""enough"" credit card applications."
good,"This company doesn't care about its employees.  It uses them to get the job done and then tosses them aside.  It doesn't matter if you want to work or not they will not give you hours unless you are in management.  What good is it to make a great living wage if they will only let you work 2 or 3 days a week.  Who can live off of that?  I am talking about corporate.  At the store level, management cares but their hands are tied by the corporate entity."
good,"Not enough workers, running around helping other deptments, management was poor, workplace in the jr/misses dept was always very busy, the hardest and most aggravating part of this job was the fitting rooms. There is just so much you can take on a daily work day and working here was always the same ol...same old thing. The only enjoyable part of this job and was rare....the lunch provided for the employees."
good,"JCPenney as an art is historical to being zoonk the currency is on the word cent, the word penny has only one e...if a person has three names men do women have four names when they marry. Me I get confused that it is some mans uncirculated first and middle name...yet the last name only makes sense if hire the word cent of course to hire the best is the 1900's we are in the year 2017...me a female only gets hot flashes now that year 2000....personally I was more attracted to some the male co workers than customers waving coins & cash and coupons."
good,Department closure --  outsourced work -- no longer a family oriented place to work. employees no longer matter to the company.  long time and dedicated employees no longer matter.
good,"The company has been struggling, and the employees are feeling the effects. Upper management doesn't care about their needs or wants and expects everyone there to uproot and change their lives on a whim."
good,I learned a lot in all the years I was employed. It is a big company. Sometimes you get lost in the crowd. Always be your own advocate for career growth.
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers and fulfill their needs and wants. Also, I had to reorganize and make things neat. The most enjoyable part was being able to work with some nice co-workers."
good,"I requested fewer hours due to school requirements. Manager accommodated my needs and within 2 weeks hours were bumped back up to normal. I spoke to her again, and she fixed it. Within a few weeks she bumped me back up again. Once again I spoke to her. Same thing, so I gave my notice. She talked me into staying...and a third time hours bumped up again, so I left. Management is not concerned with the needs of employees when it comes to their education, even though they say they are when the hire you. It is simply to get  you on the payroll."
good,There is no set time when you're off. You clean until the whole store is spotless and that may be 11 o'clock at night. You deal with managers who don't want that title.
good,it is very hard to move up in this company. I worked for them for almost three years and I left because the manager would not pay me in the pay for being in the fine jewelry dept
good,jCPenny was a okay place to work. There was sometimes too much drama going on. there is a lot of favoritism that goes on at the orange park location...
good,"This was a temp seasonal job, which there was a chance to be hired on. I was positive I was going to get hired on because I am a hard worker, but didn't."
good,I really enjoyed working here . It was just the manager was very judgemental for lack of better words .i really didn't see myself progressing with the company at this location.
good,Day would begin by checking merchandise and sales appointments. Prepare to meet sales expectations set my management. The hardest part of the job was the difficulty to make sales when there were no sales planned (worked on full commission). I enjoyed making a great sale to deserving customers.
good,"Assisted customers with finding items they were looking for; as well as items that would complement outfits.Trained on different computer software.Able to make retail signs for the floor.Capable of price pointing clearance.Make visuals for displays as well as around the store.Can return catalog orders. Restocked selling floor from stockroom.Operated computerized cash register and/or charge accounts and credit card machines.Returned clothing to appropriate places from returned items.Assisted customers with online orders."
good,"Nice place, OK place for young people to work. If you like to work part time, ifyou can cashier and answer the telephone you can work here. A lot of running around, fixing clothes and items."
good,"This job is for someone with a short term goal in mind or a person who has little options. Some workers admit to being there five years at a low wage, with the hope of being hired one day. The warehouse requires a lot of walking and lifting."
good,"This is your typical big time retail job, seems like no one notices you unless you aren't kissing their behind. Management was ehhh and your ultimate goal wasn't the customers themselves but nagging them about applying for a store credit. Overall it was an alright experience."
good,"Typical day at work is arriving, unloading the merchandise from the truck, organizing it by brand, size, etc.  Hardest part of the job is TRYING to put out the merchandise because the sales floor is really unorganized and there's no recovery.  Which makes it really hard to replenish new merchandise on top of ""old"" merchandise.  Not to mention for the amount of work being done, pay should be more than $8/hour.  If you're really into merchandising though and learning what it's like behind the scenes at a department store, then this would be a decent introduction for you."
good,"When I began work with JC Penney I had just returned to Virginia,  I loved my job and the management was the best I had ever worked for.  I had the opportunity to advance and learn new skills.  However, since that time the company or the management for the store I worked in has become uninformed, does not care for their employees  and basically feel if someone leaves they can replace them and save money."
good,"I had to find something new because I was staying sick at my other job, I thought I was being hired into full time and am only getting 12 hours a week which is not a sustainable paycheck t live."
good,"Not a bad place to work but has it's times where things do not go very smoothly."
good,"Open registers, and help customers find what they are looking for and helping them check out. Clean and organize all sections of the store and then close. Co-workers were always changing new people being hired regularly."
good,"Must keep positive and have patience."
good,company is struggling to recover from 2011. Lots of high pressure from upper management. No clear path for career advancement.
good,"Working for this company the one thing that I really enjoyed is the classes and training that they provided for their employers, to help them advance and perform their work more efficiently."
good,I would clock into work around 330pm or 4pm and start right away with handling any customers that were at the counter.  Picked up clothes and put them away as the day went on.  Dusted and cleaned up after customers.
good,"I actually liked working here. I was happy to go to work every day. My co-workers very nice to work with,  we just had fun."
good,"they are horrible. almost never get breaks. the discount the give associates is horrible. ive never had a worse job the only reason for three stars is because during holiday season they actually try to be decent,."
good,We did a lot of work but he pay was terrible.  Hours were not given as promised.  Needs new management. Nothing else to sayabout this company.
good,"At the start of my shift i would clock in and then go to my assigned area of the Junior department. Here i would check out customers when they have found what they needed, make sure that the area is fully tidy, put away clothes from the dressing room, and at the end of the night i would stay until way after close making sure the whole place is clean."
good,"Fellow sales associates were easy to get along with, but there is an obvious rift in communication between management and non-management. Communication and understanding is lacking between the two. The hardest part of working at JcPenney was keeping such a large department in order with few employees scheduled. I would also add the fact that I was scheduled to work during times when I would be in class, thus forcing me to call out and lose money."
good,"Good place to work and attend school at the same time. In terms of future advancement out of it. Non of it exist. Nevertheless, I am grateful to have worked for JcPenney Besides from the fact you get to interact and meet good people, You learn a great deal about the value of leadership, you appreciate and value working with people of different cultures and background. There is a couple managers that take advantage of their job title and abuse their position. Overall it is not a bad place to kickstart. I do not rate a job by how hard it is, or what is easy, what is not. Like everything else in life, I look at it as a responsibility. Make it your own, learn from your job everyday more. Then ""enjoy"" what you harvest."
good,"I enjoyed working with people, my coworkers were very good people. I really liked helping the elderly. I felt like that they cared about the workers.Getting applications was the hardest part of the job."
good,"when i started i was a bit scared because i had never worked in retail before i got pregnant months after and there was times that it was very hard because i use to get the truck orders and usually help take everything out of the trucks and that was at 0500, then i got new position that was inventory in the shoe department that was very fun"
good,"I worked in the womens department, which is the hardest department to work in.  Women try on a lot of clothes and our teams had to have everything put back in its placed and faced up by the time we went home it was a definet challenge.   But I loved it."
good,"Learned a few new tricks in the business from fellow stylists who have been in the business longer than I."
good,It is very rewarding to see a satisfied customer. Management lacks in this company. Organization and direction is never clearly expressed.
good,okay place to work. a lot of regular customers with great personalities. try to appreciate employees with lunches and games.
good,Was a very productive and fast pace work but didn't have good hours and co workers didn't have great attitudes. I loved that there was always something to do
good,"Although I did not work here very long, I did  the best that I could. Mainly we put stickers on tags and put ink tags onto items and clothing. I left because of not enough hours and I was spending more on gas than I was actually getting paid at times."
good,"Very hectic, always busy work environment is crowded for the most part. Productivity is a must, always organized and ready to be on the move."
good,"It was really messy, managers would like to have you after your shift, and then clean up departments that weren't yours, also there was people who would be using their phones on the job and no one really took the job seriously"
good,"staying busy with employees ,training, coaching, learned to be more  productive use my mind not my back , I have a great team of co- workers ,we r a team,  ,Hardest part oh my job is scheduling , Employees come up and say I cant work this day I need  this day off I need to leave early , the most enjoyable  is the customers"
good,"Working at JC Penney's I have learned a lot dealing with customers and satisfying their needs. How to set a store for example, buliding displays for our products, Being responsible for handling money as a cashier and never coming up short."
good,Loved working here however very hard to make any money when a single parent only making tips after paying daycare due to schedule
good,"I worked in the salon, there was drama all the time. Catty backstabbing, because stylists fought over commissions, no management to horrible management in the salon. Every day someone quit or there was a new person, I was promised classes and never got them. I was supposed to be receptionist and a ""designer"" but you can not combine the two jobs solely unless it is your own salon with 10 people working it was impossible for me not to be interrupted constantly if I had a client. You can only do stylist job or reception, not mix the two- unless everybody is doing both jobs. Low pay."
good,"I enjoy working, and having a place to mingle with others. The work is not hard just long hours on your feet. lksoisjls lfojglglujslje"
good,"I really do enjoy working at Penny's; many things are neglected and put to the side far too often, very little employee recognition at this location."
good,"My typical day could be working 2 hours a day or 7 hours a day.  This is variable.  Some weeks I get 11 hours a week and maybe the next week it could be 21 hours.  My day normally begins at 6 a.m."
good,"Poor hours, low customer volume, too much demand. The job itself was nice, the co-workers were rude and if you weren't in the ""clique"" you always got the short end of the stick. Lot's of favoritism in the workplace."
good,A typical day at work consists of watching the CCTV screens in search of shoptlifters.
good,"I have been trained in more than one department, and loved most of them. HR employees are absolutely wonderful in my store, how ever, certain department managers are rude, lazy, and belittle you while speaking to you (My department manager, in particular)."
good,i work in the shoes department and meet alot of nice people only thing i found wrong with this job was the credits u needed to receive
good,"This was a second job. Enjoyed for the most part. Though when dealing with a family incident , management was not willing to understand family responsibility."
good,Enjoyed meeting different people and helping make selection of jewelry for their loved ones or for themselves.  Got along with all of my co-workers. The hardest part was working the holidays.
good,"I liked they people that I worked with"
good,It is just boring though. Doing the same thing over and over. Folding clothes
good,"good job,meeting people needs,putting customers first,not organize at all,short breaks,but does get their job done"
good,I learned how to color cornate and size the sheets and towels
good,The background to J.C.Penny's salon was that there was 24 stylist and only 18 chairs. If you did not have a clientel you pretty much sat around. I learned to keep inventory on their retail shelves making sure the selves kept stocked. I learned different tecqunics on how to color and highlight hair in one step. How to texturize hair with scizzer's. There  were some co workers that would help you when needed. The hardest part was trying to stay busy when there was no walk in's.
good,I worked with a lot of nice people that always helped me when I needed it.
good,I had fun working here. The manager was very mean at the time and that made it stressful often. The people are great but the job doesn't pay well and they try hard to make sure you are not full time to avoid giving you benefits. Overall the job is easy and if you love clothes the discount is great also.
good,it is RETAIL but I still love to shop there! It was too much during the holidays and they would not work with me. It was my second job.
good,Horrible Managers such a small store for too many managers. Too many chiefs not enough Indians scenario.  The actual store manager never got off her lazy butt to do anything either. The stock room people were snobby the managers were snobby certain managers and workers only talked Spanish to each other and were nasty and snobby I hated this place I'm glad I got out of there! Everyone was always in everybody's personal business and talking down to each other. I still will not go into place at this location!
good,Processing new freight in receiving department which included pricing and palletizing for the order pickers to pull when orders were placed.
good,"I worked at J.C Penny (Clackamas Town Center)  during the holiday season, as I was only 17 at the time it was my first job. I came in for an interview and they did not interview me they simply asked me if i could start tomorrow. So She told me to bring my social security and ID, i came back the next day and she just put me into the shoes department, NO TRAINING, nothing! litterly just put me out there to be taught by the other employees. I learned fast anyways,"
good,"I wouldn't say I had the best experience here. I enjoyed parts of my job, while others seemed unnecessary, or made to be harder work than they should have. I was told I had a bad attitude, simply for not smiling at the store manager whenever she walked by. I also had difficulties with management during a high-risk pregnancy. I left on good terms, but only after struggling to file paperwork for my unexpected maternity leave. The job expectancies were easy enough, and I still use much of what I learned there in my day-to-day life."
good,I only made it 6 months due to the unstable work environment. Management was a huge problem and no one was willing to try to fix the issues.
good,dealt with customers but the management had the worst attitudes ever.
good,"i liked working retail not so much the hours and pay. just not enough hours."
good,Usually work multiple positions. Sometimes 10 hour days because of being understaffed and manager refused to hire people.
good,"A typical day at work would be fixing store sections,sizing, and assisting customers. Co-workers usually work together to get things done, also some managers go out on the floor and help you if needed."
good,Not a bad company if you don't hate retail and don't mind never getting a raise. Management team is nice and coworkers are amazing. This makes the job worth it. Hardest part of the job is the time frames given to get things accomplished.
good,Not a stable place make rapid changes and never wises one for the customers and then wont take full responsibility for their actions.
good,"I worked in the drapery department and I loved my job working with the customers helping them choose window treatments, both stock and custom, to decorate their homes."
good,"Not a place for me, but it's only temporary,closing business next month. Very repetitive, you basically do the same thing for 8hrs. You place price tickets on merchandise. Take merchandise out of boxes and put it all back in there orginal boxes and put on pallets."
good,I believe this is a job for people who just want to have extra money or for high school students
good,"if I worked in a non-commissioned area such as women dept ; empty fitting rooms, checked out merchandise for customers, ordered items that were not readily available in store; merchandised."
good,Updated store to visual core standards. Communicated with other departments to ensure store core standards.
good,"In the past I was happy to tell people I was a member of the management staff at JCP. However now it is an embarrassment. This company has little respect for the floor workers and should listen to them. They are the backbone of our customer service standards. We as managers/supervisors were asked to lead the team with very unrealistic goals. Not sad to have been downsized from this company, and I don't miss the disorganization at all."
good,"I deal with a wide variery of customers and handle a lot of inquiries about merchandise. You have to be able to adapt to a lot of different situations. I have learned that you have to be patient. I have always been patient so this was not very difficult for me. The majority of my co-workers are easy to get along with. I am very easy going. The hardest part of the job is the hours. I work days, nights and weekends. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with all types of people."
good,"I would answer customers questions, fold, and restock clothes."
good,"A typical day at work was hard you work very hard and no one care about you as the employee it was do the work and shut up no raises and no promotion ,you ask another supervisor about move up to their department you was call into the office,you couldn't speak of this,my years of retail I like it because love meeting people and helping everyone that came into my department,so I stay ther because of my customer."
good,Conduct surveillance to detect and apprehend shoplifters
good,Work is always busy. Their is always something to do & learn new things. 
good,"unloaded sized placed items on floor."
good,"A day there consist of helping others, handling cash, working on books and walking the sale floors."
good,"When I first started at JCPenney, I could not have been happier. My co-workers were friendly and excellent at what they did, my manager was encouraging, and constant communication kept us working as a seamless team. However, when JCPenney attempted to change their image about a year ago, they also changed many of their values. Our manager was transferred, countless employees were fired or forced to retire in order to cut costs, and morale dropped substantially. Now that the ""new image"" has been abandoned, I'm optimistic about JCPenney's future, but the insubstantial pay, benefits, and limited advancement opportunities won't cut it for me now that I have graduated with my Bachelor's degree. I am eager to find a position more worthy of my talents."
good,A typical day JCP includes management breathing down your neck wanting you to con customers into applying for credit cards. Most of my co-workers were fun to be around and work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is having fun with the customers and fellow employees. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management. I learned that not feeling valued at your job makes an employee miserable.
good,Some days were busy and some slow.
good,It was very busy because I worked during the holidatys. The management werent very friendly
good,"I have been working for JCP for over 10 years now and have transferred stores twice so I have a good grasp of how this place ""works "". It is a pretty good place to work if you just want a part time job to get through school or have nothing to do. This is just because you can quit when you want, but if you want this as a career, go another route. Most of the associates are very easy to get along with, not a lot of hassle from customers, ect... But if you want to voice your opinion or have an issue with a manager, forget it. They don't want to hear it and will just end up making you want to quit, like for me right now. Enough is enough."
good,Was not properly trained for position. Had no idea who the manager was in my department until I resigned. Was not taught how to properly count down the drawer. Was always given the night shift and did not get that many hours.
good,It was a good working environment with a fast competitve pace. I learned how this compant distributed their products both locally and nationally. The mangement were hard workers with a competitve mindset. It was sometimes hard disposing the large boxes after pullin merchandise. The various nationalities of co-workers was the best part.
good,"An overall good place to work on a daily basis. The site manager could not be trusted to follow through on commitments along with the HR department being less then honest and forthcoming. The Breinigsville, Pa. site was more of a who you knew vs. what you knew place to work."
good,"enjoyed the atmosphere and co workers, team work was alive and well"
good,"JCPenney in Bessemer was the most difficult retail position I have ever held. I could not even take restroom breaks without being paged on the radio and hearing a ""talk"" from a manager about leaving my zone. Very short staffed, thus no one could cover. One particular day, I vomited three separate times, and STILL could not leave my zone (turns out I was pregnant). After moving across town, the company cut my hours in half overnight. I could not afford to keep working there. Management made doing my job VERY difficult. I would not recommend that anyone work at that location."
good,"It's a daily struggle to deal with the inconsistent treatment and bias actions by management. I've learned ( at this establishment ) it's NOT what You know, but rather WHO You know that will get You the furthest. We have very fickle personalities managing and supervising the store. There are many hard working individuals, but way more people "" shucking and jiving "" ( so to speak ) . The hardest part about being there is feeling appreciated. If Your not someone who brown noses, or is in favor with the people in charge ( know them outside of work / or kiss up and act phony ) , You will feel it in many ways ( overall treatment, scheduling, etc. ) . The most enjoyable part of JCPenneys is the customers. Fortunately, the loyal customers recognize the same deficientcies that are holding this company back. I often get feedback from shoppers who wonder how I ( and other employees ) can stand it."
good,The management staff was not team oriented and did not know how to handle conflict with associates.
good,not to happy with pennys was a hard and dependale worker for 9 yrs but do to a new ceo that came in and laided off a lot of older workers and a lot of really good people thru out the company now they are not doing well because of it had a lot of good friends and co-workers we were a good store
good,A typical day in JCPenney as an exempt manager is: you get to work hours before you shift is scheduled to start and immediatly start running. I felt that as a manager I never could get caught up. They asked too much of us.
good,"J.C. Penny's for a top end store works their people into the ground around the christmas season. Then cuts their hours to the bone. Most of the people who work for the store have kids or are kids themselves. They really need the money. If your not willing to do anything without question you will not advance,( I had something else written but it was called inappropriate language) and most likely have your hours cut . Till you give up and leave. They don't want the unemployment bother. This was my 2nd store I'm guessing it's the same all over."
good,enjoyed helping customers and had to overlook managers who did not like Arican americans
good,"Walk the Dept, identify what areas can be improved, to be more inviting to the customer. Make sure that all fixtures are full of product, and that all of the fixtures are shopable, and not messy. Make sure that there are nice clean aisles for the customers to manuver through for easy shopping."
good,It gives you little time for a personal life. Not the best amount of pay long hours and short pay. Not a big window to move up in.
good,Thousands of long-time employees being dismissed to prepare for new company culture and be replaced by younger employees at a reduced salary. Typical 10 to 12 hour days resulting from earlier lay-offs to reduce departmental costs. Work/life balance preached but not actually encouraged.Corporate culture and engagement of employees both declined in recent years prior to new leadership.
good,"I was a hard working, reliable, dependable employee. Everyone I worked with knew I had a positive work ethic."
good,"People that worked there were very nice, this is a good job for a college or high school student, not much growth opportunity"
good,"The changes swepted the business with little regard of employees, . Scheduling was a disaster with few days or few hours a day to avoid lay offs."
good,Working very hard and not being appreciated.
good,"I was loyal to JCPenney for over 27 years, I got tossed aside."
good,the people i work with were fun and to see all the new clothes and the discount u get while working there was really cool
good,Weather your a student in high school or working your way threw college JC 5 Star Outlet (formally know as JCP Outlet) is a good place to work if you need a flexible scheduled.
good,"I started during the Christmas rush thru a temp agency and was asked to stay in January. I worked up to assistant to the assistant manager.  Pay was low hours were low. I had to make a choice, work for pennies or take what I've  learned to another job. I appreciated the opportunity but I found a better paying job with Direct T.V."
good,"Worked as cashier, wasn’t completely bad but maybe since the time was chaotic they weren’t as like focused on each employee so got mixed up and put to do stuff they hadn’t taught me about or the training was too short (literally like a day or half) and then wanting you to be able to function alone if that makes sense but overall it was ok"
good,"I did enjoy working here alot for the first 16 years, the last year desperation was setting in and decisions were not made on what is best for the company. If you focus on your job and can be a pretty easy place to work."
good,"Great place for seasonal work but afterwards find out that after season over then they lay off workers, hour's are reduced, and now company closing call center and 243 employees without jobs."
good,Job was simple but I lacked sense of belonging and guidance when first starting. I was thrown into work and learned on my own. More training or proper training would have been appreciated.
good,Barely above average experience while employed by JCPennys.  Underappreciated and overall felt the store handling was disorganized.  More job security or growth opportunities would have helped.   Ok for a temporary part time job.
good,"I connected really well with all of the staff members and they were all very welcoming. The senior staff were all very helpful when I had any questions about anything, and they were always willing to help out."
good,"I've seen quite the wide variety of unspeakable things in my time at JCPenney's, but it was a suitable first job for me and I ended up staying as a cashier for over a year. I felt little to no room to grow but the coworkers were, for the most part, kind and willing to cooperate to make for the best customer experience, which was the company's main focus. Overall, fun and relaxed, though you do need to upsell and make credit goals."
good,Custom decorating is an a position for which much is required.  Mileage is not reimbursed fully. Must have area of your home to house the multitude of sample cases.
good,"I have currently been working at Jcpenney for almost 3yrs, I've been promoted once and received all kinds of benefits.  Dental, vision, Pto, and stock options as well as retirement and profit sharing are all apart of their packages."
good,"The store managers instructed the supervisors to lock the associates in at night until the store was completely clean to his standards. Store manager and assistant played favorites and didn’t promote from within. There’s no structure or organization, couldn’t get anyone relief for lunch breaks. If you spoke up your hours were cut and those that showed integrity were punished for others lack of integrity and work ethic."
good,Supervisors are real nice it's the co- workers  that are lazy. .you do learn to do different things and supervisors do notice when your a good employees
good,I enjoy selling the store merchandise and prices are pretty reasonable with rewards points that add up for customers to return. Doesn't quite pay enough money and at my location never got or offered a full time postion.
good,I love the part of my job decorating and designing. There is alot of responsibility behind the scene that could improve as far as structure in processing orders. Over all I really enjoyed working here.
good,"handled customers questions "
good,You work under pressure  and being told to do so much in a small matter of time. Sometimes you can’t even complete it if you’re working with more then one person. And it depends what position you get too.
good,Penny's has the potential to be the perfect company. It's just a shame such talent is waisted on prideful prejudice management. They will treat you they will find a way to make your hard work unenjoyable. They have a HR manager for what purpose I dont know. If your not liked by a manager for what ever reasons u will never move up.
good,"Turn over here is consistent. This makes it hard to want to stay. Turnover is from the top to the bottom. Management at this time is in great hands. Middle management not so much. I’d say with all honesty,  I enjoy the people I have met but advancement is very political and there is not much room for pay roll advancements. I believe this is one cause of people not staying. The hours are not available and or the advancement for income needed."
good,"You get to meet some really nice people and potentially make some really cool friends but unless the managers like your or you get along with them, you won’t get as many hours as you expected and they’ll notice the things you do wrong more than the things you do right"
good,"No direction, no training, not inclusive, not promoting from within.  Very little rais even with a "" high Achiever"" rating on performance goals reviews."
good,"Lack of communication, no appreciation from management, hours are constantly cut. I did not appreciate management not telling the temps beforehand that we are not needed."
good,Management was often poor or you would awaits try and avoid certain managers during the week. However the co workers were awesome and when the time of year picked up the shifts got better
good,"The overall culture of the company was awesome, however the IT department was very strict and my manager was a micro manager and that made the work place very stressful and tension filled."
good,"Management had a few good people but mostly rude and obnoxious, constantly harassing you to get iCaps, treats part time workers like full time workers, which left me with no time to have fun. If you call out sick you’re called inconvenient, I am currently trying to find a new job due to how little of a life I have working here part time."
good,"Great people, but promotions were not based on work merit. Emphasis on NEW credit card sales was crazy.  You do get a 10% discount, but are Highly encouraged to get the JCP Card."
good,"JCPenney does not like giving raises, they make goals high and make you work your butt off. I was there for over 2 years and I only made 8.50 an hour."
good,"The job was okay, pretty easy just a really boring slow paced environment. co workers were not social towards me. didn’t get enough hours either. great job for someone whos never worked before"
good,"Typical retail job but paid a little better than some other retail.  Little to no training on using the register.  Pretty much self taught.  Register system a little complicated/outdated - slow!  Co-workers were the best part, very friendly and helpful, not competitive.  Too many “middle” managers or “manager trainees”, not sure what they’re called, but they just walked around and talked to select employees and didn’t help out.  Managers push you to get customers to open JCP credit card account.   Scheduled even when asked not to be - ignored requests off.  Had to beg someone to cover the register so you could take a bathroom break.  Often didn’t get break when  supposed to get one.   Promise you the world when hiring you but got stuck on the register all the time."
good,"Ive been employed with this company for over a year now. I started off in the Major Appliance Department in the call center. Then they discontinued the department which left coworkers in limbo. They had a big lay off and a lot of people lost their jobs. Thankfully I got to keep my job but it's bitter sweet. I am now in the Chat Department. When the job was presented it was told we will only be taking chats from customers, that"
good,"When I first started to work there, I liked it. After couple years, I did not like how they run the company. I did not like how we have to choose the hours they giving us. There are times where there is overtime, which is good. There are times where there is hour cut due to slow times in particular months.Around Thanksgiving day to Christmas, everyone work 7 days for 8 to 10 hours a day due to busiest time of the year. I like working there because of the people or coworkers not because of the company."
good,"Competitive environment, which for me gave me drive. However the consistent events left me stressed and unprepared. I never had time to set the cases up per core standards required by the company. I got praised for good sales and ICAPS but was only praised for good customer service is a survey said I did well. I'd go back on a part time basis only, when I was full time and promoted I was never trained properly for my promotion even after 6 months of getting told I would have double le coverage to complete training and core standard requirements."
good,I have worked here about 7 months and found out that they have repeatedly not given me the raises I’m supposed to get for learning the new departments. If you want to be able to advance financially this is not the place for you.
good,"I love working to make my customers happy, it's a good job to learn from different people and grow in customer experience. The best part about working with different people is the joy of making someone smile."
good,"The hours are extremely inconsistent.  I have an open availability and I work about 8-12 hours per week. The managers said that if our schedule was open, maybe we'd have more hours but there are multiple people with their schedule opened and they aren't getting hours either. The managers don't communicate well w/ employees. We typically had a 6 minute grace period and out of no where, the manager said that starting the previous day, there was no longer a grace period whatsoever so people were clocking in a minute or two after and getting points because they didn't know it changed. It wasn't told to everyone until about 2-3 months after. The time clock was on the 1st and 2nd floor and it changed to only being on the 3rd floor upstairs due to a system update and again, no one mentioned this to the employees prior to it changing and everyone was clocking in late. They do not encourage people much and when they do, it's typically sarcasm."
good,"Been here for almost two years, straight out of high school to help pay for school. When I first started, management was great; they really helped you out and didn't demand a lot out of you. However, if you really slacked off, moved at a slow pace or did not get them their stupid credit card applications 'iCAPS' they would cut your hours in like half and you would be blacklisted. Many times there would be just one floor associate for long periods of time and they would expect you to clean the entire store (fitting rooms, fold clothes on tables) as well as keep up with great customer service. As I am closing in on my two years, management  has gotten to a point where they pretty much 'harass' you to the work a specific way and yell at you if you're not or even if you're talking to someone for a few minutes, they flip; even though they do it all the time. Not the worst place to work, definitely not the best."
good,The first year was great. We were able to get steady schedules so that we could plan time with our families. That went away for the department managers my second year.
good,The manager was a little rude the workers there they were great me and other workers always kept the store up and made sure the customers were happy with what they purchased . I learned how to work with other people communicate and work the cash register the right way. The most part I enjoyed was coming to work everyday to meet customers because all of my customers loved me they thought I had a great personality.
good,"JC Penney was a great place to work for in the 80s and 90s. "
good,"I have been having trouble getting the hours that I need to be able to provide for myself and my boyfriend and his daughter."
good,"It was a chill place to be. The workers are really nice there and they work as a team to get goals achieved. Pretty relaxed vibe there , and not much wrong going on In that store ."
good,"Basically, management has no communication skills. No one is on the same page, one person will tell you to something and supervisor says other wise. There are time when supervisors have no consideration for employees and will tell them harsh things about their work. There have been instances where assistant supervisors walk-out during the job, quit on the spot, or cry because of the lack of appreciation and harsh words that were told to them. Mind you, these assistant supervisors are not young adults or teenagers, they are full adults with families. I have never seen so much hard work from these associates and dedication to please the supervisors, but very very under appreciated. The associates who work there are amazing and make work fun, no matter what department you're part of, we help each other out and make work not a dreadful place."
good,If you don't need a full time job this job is good. My first time in a retail job so it's been difficult learning the in and outs. I would not recommend if you don't like working with people or customers.
good,"It was a seasonal holiday job, it was pretty busy and the store extremely messy and dirty though mostly the fault of customers, overall it was an alright place."
good,"You got to wear business casual clothing every single day, they also had evet weeks. They had really great hours, and worked with you on your scheduling if you needed it."
good,"Although JCP is typical retail, the management is really the problem. They refuse to stand behind their employee's and will always tell an employee that they are wrong over the customer. HR continuously looses request off forms and demands more hours than can be provided of a part-time employee. The coworkers are lovely and truly have a great staff, but the entire company hierarchy is messed up beyond belief and puts unnecessary pressure on the employees."
good,If you get a part time job be prepared to get a second job. There aren’t enough hours and the paycheck isn’t enough to live off of. No benefits are offered either for part time workers and you get less than 20 hours a week. I work 8 hours a week. Max.
good,The management at this job is very poor there is no team work. I’v Been there a year and I can say it changed a whole lot since I first started working there.
good,A lot of lazy employees left a lot of work for the productive employees to stress over. Daily work was a struggle to complete with little positive encouragement from management.
good,"Good part time hours,employee discounts and working at a great place.If you would like to advance with this company you have the opportunity.Great job to help others with their shopping expirence."
good,"As much as I enjoyed working with the customers, Too much drama at this store. Gossip and rumors sbound. Could not deal with the climate so after almost 7 years of employment I resigned."
good,"I didn't get much time to do what I wanted and focus on school. I loved my coworkers, they were the nicest people. The hardest part for me was doing the fitting rooms all the time. I think it would be better if everybody altered jobs every now and then, because then everyone would know how to do everything."
good,"There are pros and cons about working at my JCP. The hourly associates got along with each other relatively well. There is some background conflict with LODs vs the newer hourly associates. Our store has a limited number of employees which really harms the ability to keep up with the store. There is a quite a bit of favoritism which and extreme pressure for credit applications, this leads to high amounts of stress. On the positive side, you do get a great discount and it is an easy job to get in order to gain experience you may need."
good,"Responsible for assisting customers, working front end, soliciting credit application, online orders, surveys, find more online"
good,I did not like working in JCPenney. The work here is routine and boring. Can be sent to any department because there is a constant shortage of associates. There is no sense of permanence and confidence. Lack of growth prospects. Very poor training.
good,"Was not very understanding of my high school schedule. Management was rude and in my time working there, I did not enjoy it. Bad first experience for a job."
good,"I worked her just to have a job. i was not really happy working here. when i found a better paying job, i  gave a two week notice and i took my leave."
good,There is a serious lack of communication amongst management that causes problems on a daily basis. The messages are not consistent and it hinders productivity as well as causing conflict amongst employees. One supervisor will tell an associate to do one thing and a manger will tell the same associate to do something else. They also put unrealistic expectations on employees demanding that goals be met despite not having the proper resources.
good,"This was my first job in high school and worked here until right before my 19th birthday; approximately 4 years. This job started at minimum wage ($7.25) which was typical for a teen's first job. I was working about 32 hours per week (fixed during school week but sporadic on weekends and no fixed day off). Throughout my work experience here, there was little to no opportunity to advance to a higher position or a different department in the same store. Also, the only pay raise received was to $7.50 due to minimum wage being incresed while working there."
good,Job offers great employee discount on merchandise. May only get twenty something hours per hours for regular workers. Managers more. Pretty hair salon.
good,"A typical day working at JCPenny's is a fast paced environment greeting customers and cleaning the store and organizing everything in it. While working here you learn to have patience with everyone you encounter. the management wasn't the best but you learn to handle how rude they treat they're employees. the hardest part is the stress, the enjoyable part would be the nice customers and work friends."
good,"Learned a lot about people and inventory."
good,"JCpenney has poor management, but tries their hardest. Usually hires new workers and forgets about their previous workers. A lot of relaxed coworkers, but strict managers that don’t their job."
good,"This job is fun it's easy work, and people are friendly but as far as making money or advancement goes. You probably won't. The lead store manager pays zero attention when making schedules and in my overall experience is unwilling to work with your outside schedule."
good,Working at this company was not so bad. Although the managers there were very unfair in giving job tasks I always got my job done. I always had a work load which wasn't a problem. I didn't very much agree with the staffs decisions.
good,"I needed a part time job while I was in college, it was just something to get money in my pocket. It was okay but if you're older this isn't the job for you. I'm young and I see them treat the older people like the young people."
good,"unfair  and two-faced general manager and HR supervisor, back stabbing co-workers, lying cashiers, low pay for high stress, and nasty customers......."
good,"Show up, they tell you what your on for the day. Usually they change what you do during mid-shift and you are kind of everywhere. It was a great first job but after a while you just get tired of it, badly. Fitting rooms were always bad because there was no system but it wasnt bad all the time."
good,"Fun job to work, you may be on register all day. Which is great then you wont have to help straighten the massive sales floor. Be sure to put away your put backs and maintain the appearance of the register area."
good,"When i used to work at JCPenney's my daily work that i had to do was handle clothes and ring up people. Every other week, my manager would always male me feel absolutely terrible and kept on accusing me of stealing non stop. It is not a good place to work and i do not recommend it."
good,Is not a great place to work. The management is not every nice. They got mad because I wasn’t on winter break when management thought I was so he had to change my schedule.
good,"A typical day at work started by clocking in and then heading to the floor to start cleaning up from the night before. I learned how to manage time a little more due to the amount of things i had to finish at once. The management was poor and they were not very understanding. The hardest part of the job was multitasking between making sure the department i was working in was clean and making sure all customers needing help, found what they needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with all the friendly people and being able to make their day when they were looking for something specific."
good,Things could be more neat and the managers need a lot more training as they will make your life h e l l. Sometimes the hours can become very crazy. There just needs to be more training or something.
good,"You will sometimes work as a team and sometimes individually. Daily tasks aren't too hard, but one must be able to multi-task and be flexible especially when working freight."
good,"Great workplace culture, enjoy meeting new co -workers as we problem solve and help customer .  We all enjoy helping one another  together we are team."
good,This was not a particular job I'd say that I learned from other than that I wouldn't want to work for this company again just out of personal preference. I think this would be a great job for someone who is new to retail and looking to gain knowledge in experience about how large retail companies operate daily and what its like to be apart of it.
good,"You would normally come in and be assigned apart of the store to work at for the day. I learned that it doesn't take long at all to learn a store. Management was average, could have been improved. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help the customers to find what they need and seeing the smile on their faces."
good,JCP is currently growing if you are needing employment with benefits from day one you should check them out. They have multiple shifts and schedules available. As well as departments that are hiring.
good,can get overwhelming if in higher postions alot of pressure is put on management. If you dont have the right management team it is hard to work as a team
good,"no benefits, low wages, I had a bad department manager. we had a good overall managers. The store manager was good also. A lot of folding clothes in the different departments."
good,The job is repetitive.  The is no educational advancement opportunities.  The customer is always right.  Management is there but not usually helpful with customer problems.
good,I have been with the company for 5 years. I work with a great group of girls. the rest of the store is tolerable. the management is terrible. the best part of the store is the salon and they get no love!
good,"It is really easy, and most of the employees sort of do their own thing. Things can get competitive with credit app sells, and co-workers will start to get mad if you earn more."
good,One of the managers never approved of my availability & always decline it & the co workers was rude & disrespctful. Only liked one manager & a few co workers
good,"Great for a first job, would not recommend for a career. Many changes in leadership in the two years I've been here, management is lacking, but it is a good opportunity to learn how retail work really feels."
good,Working at JcPenny was fun at first but something happened and it wasnt fun anymore from the coworkers to the mangers people didnt have things going right and the place started to get sloppy like no one really cared.
good,"From working at JCPenney, I had to learn a lot in a short period of time. It was not easy at all but in a couple of days I had everything down. They depended on me a lot so it made the job very stressful. Honestly, I enjoyed meeting new people every day from all walks of life."
good,"Communication lacks, management struggles with proper workload distribution. Duties preformed by supervisors are thrown on experienced associates without proper pay raise, training, or official job title change."
good,"Work hours are okay. If you are a high school or full time college student I do not recommend. Management scheduling is a pain. They do not keep with what you ask for. If you need Mondays off for school they will still put you on the schedule to work Mondays. Other than the scheduling problem, its a great place to work. Managers are good, the people are good, most clients are very good. No need for any licensing. Skill needed are work work pace, easy to deal with stressful environment, and of course customer service."
good,"working at jcp I learn nothing from mngmt team, they have no communication skills, they do not know how to talk  to people. The most enjoyable for me is to help customers and new employees."
good,"The first thing when clocked in is go into the fitting room. The fitting rooms were always a disaster. It was my duty to rummage through the clothing to make it as organized as possible. Then I would return all the clothes to their proper location. Additionally, I worked at the cash register, especially in times of high demand."
good,"There were times when I really enjoyed the job. I loved the People I worked with and I loved my department manager. However, when my department manager was asked to do too much he would put things on us that weren't his fault but we were not required by our job description to do."
good,there are worse places to work if you are desperate for a job. the people here are friendly and easy to work with and its a low pressure job with easy tasks to complete.
good,I have worked for this company for 10 years and in my experience and over time my enjoyment and pride in working here has taken a major decline. There have been 3 CEO changes within this time and many direct management changes within my particular store. Our work place culture is never definitive and can change from day to day. The customers are never a problem that's why we are there to help them. There is no feeling of security or hope in career advancement .
good,"Management is not the greatest. They have their favorites and everyone knows it. The store is constantly messy but they don't do anything about it, like schedule more people to help maintain cleanliness and make the store presentable to customers. It seems like the only thing that matters to them is greeting customers and getting them to sign up for the credit card and do the survey on the receipts. Sure, those are all important, but I think the appearance of your store is important too. There are never enough hours and are constantly cutting your schedule shorter, unless you are a favorite or if you complain a lot. Hard workers are not acknowledged enough or at all but rather asked to do more than necessary and what you are paid. Most fellow associates are great to work with and you have a fun time working, only downside like I said is management."
good,I was hired holiday temp to hire. The manager cut my work hours to 20 hours a week. I could not financial pay my bills with those hours. I was working.
good,They not a bad company. They just need better management skills. I don't have to much to say about them. They pay ok. They are a fast paced environment.
good,"I had great team members in loss prevention but poor management throughout the whole store, you could report an issue and nothing be done about it. Management were really only worried about themselves not their associates."
good,This was a good job to get some income while attending school. The job was rather simple and easy to learn. They supplied employees with ample break time.
good,"With this store being so close to the home office, this job can be quite stressful.  The job expectation is not realistic of the allotted hours to get the job done.  Too much to do, but not enough people or hours to do it. Best part of the job is helping customers who you can see really need it."
good,"It’s perfect for a first job, if you intend to stay for a while there aren’t many career advancements. If you’re the type of person who needs to be recognized for you hard work.. it’s not going to happen."
good,"was with company for 5 years as salon manager, store manager wanted salon educator as salon leader and I was pushed out of the company. Penney,s used to be a very good salon to work for now the changes have made it a difficult place to work"
good,"the manager that was there at the time was new, and imo was not fit for the position, for one, she and her daughter worked together so there was favoritism and protection issues which resulted in a stressful environment."
good,no thank youSorry I have nothing to say job was season only for holiday purposes. I was hired for holiday help. stack merchandise of truck onto shelves .
good,It was an amazing experience working at JCPenneys it taught me a lot when it comes to customer service. All the new skills I learned here was amazing. I would love to work here again.
good,It was not bad working there for a part time job. The company was in good standings and had a large work force. That has changed due to so many stores closed and more expected to close.
good,"I have never had a full year of hours they're always been poor hours ,its always been dirty and everything is always out of order. Not all associates work they just play around"
good,"No Comment"
good,Wish they pay attention to their customer's needs more often. This company would be great if they actually treated their employees like the family they talked about in the interview.
good,Although the variety of merchandise is great they need to train employees more in home dept. Need to offer bonuses to the hourly workers not just management.  Also need to stop gossiping among managers during their daily Monday conferences.
good,The job it self was easy to do. It It doesn't take a rocket scientist to fold clothing and put them on shelfs. The best part about it was coming to work and having fun with your coworkers.
good,You can learn alot however when management changes hands positions are eliminated. And you are treated like cattle I learn alot even in a hostile enviroment  Visual dept Setting Floors etc etc
good,a very good place to be and gain experience and no more about retailing. they need to pay more depending o. the job that associates do in the company and also scheduling should be worked on.
good,"I have not worked at JC Penney for 2 years, but while I was there I was the first person in the department. I opened the cash registers and made sure the department was ready for the sales associates and customers."
good,well this was a job i had while going to school. there was nothing really worth while other than the cute girls that were working in juniors. management disrespected me a lot which made me not like my job and proved that all people care about is the bottom line
good,"overwhelming environment, after training you get thrown onto the call center floor, with very little knowledge or answers for customers. Very strict environment"
good,"Liked: Environment, Regular Customers, Employees, Online Orders, Employee Discount to Sephora"
good,While working at JCpenney I felt the environment was quiet but productive. All the associates are very knowledgeable about the products sold there. The customer service is better than most
good,"I enjoyed my coworkers, but JCPenney did not pay me a living wage. I had to work three part-time jobs to afford my expenses. The raises that were received after hiring were not equal to the quality of work or years of experience. People would start working with me and they would be getting paid more than me at their starting wage with no previous experience than I was making after working there for several years. The management would occasionally overlook obvious issues until it became a serious problem instead of dealing with it right away."
good,This particular JCPs was alright but the management and communication was lacking. It does pay a little over minimum wage and the discounts were awesome. I can't say how it's changed over the years but when I went into this particular store it seemed more disorganized than when I had worked there.
good,It was hard to get time off when needed.  The pay was low and they would cut your shift at the last minute.  I often only ended up working half my scheduled shifts.
good,"Was a great gig when I was in Highschool. The hours are not bad, however they do expect you to work every major holiday. The days would go fairly quickly."
good,I worked during the Christmas season and it was a very busy place to work. The workers were always willing to help each other with anything the may need help with.
good,"From the time you walked in the door in the morning always something to do,which is what I  "
good,I've been working in JCP for about 7 years and management is horrible. No communication whatsoever!. The most enjoyable part of my job is to help costumers and working side by side with fun hard working people.
good,"My position was seasonal. But at the time management was lacking. The current manager that had interviewed me was very polite and friendly but my third day did not show up and left second in command to handle opening and closing, without notice. Unfortunately she never returned. It was a hectic first couple weeks. I worked during the holiday season, which was amazing yet stressful with so many customers coming in every day.  In the end I really enjoyed it. The pay and hours were decent."
good,"I feel the job would be much more fun if the store was busier. The slow business cause other coworkers to try and steal sales, management to constantly blame the employees for the declining sales. I left because the environment was too hostile."
good,"Check-in, out , handle returns, schedule appointments, cancel appointments, Set Visual aids and give fashion/hair care advice. Fast-paced. Management was always changing, therefore job security was of concern."
good,"Working in Jewelry department helped people with engagement, birthday, anniversary presents. Daily opening and closing of the department.  Straightening costume jewelry and purse area."
good,"I must say JCP was one of the best jobs I had. I left because they couldn't give me full time and I couldn't support my family just on part time hours each week. Loved this place, people were great."
good,It is very difficult to balance your life and work with the work schedules. It is almost impossible to schedule a doctor's appointment. Even a fifteen minutes break is had to get within a five hours working period.
good,"I enjoyed my job when I first started, but they made so many changes with the company that it began to make things miserable. Getting yelled at by customers about things I had no control over got really old really fast. Then the new manager hired a bunch of gossipy people and it became a really unpleasant place to work."
good,"My typical day of work consists of putting jewelry away as well as handling customers care plans. I learn something almost everyday, but something I should have learned when they trained me. The management is not always on you. The workplace is fun at times but can be very competitive. The harderst part of the job is getting new hirees to stop standing around the cash register. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting the customer exactly what they need and them leaving with a smile on their face."
good,"overwoked; sales, cashier and photographer all in one work day"
good,I learned a lot more about photography than I thought it would teach me. I learned a little more about angles and lighting and selling. I will forever use them in my own practice.
good,"I liked the work environment at the company but they made changes too often but I understand it was because they were trying to find what worked best.  I also feel the company does not care about their employees, they just care about the numbers and set unrealistic goals."
good,I liked the job. The new manager was so rude!! I didn't like how they talked to people and they didn't really care about your well being. It was awful at times.
good,"i learn a lot at the Jewelry Department not only did i made friends but learn a lot on how to work at the Jewelry Department, the hardest part working at JCPenney Jewelry Department is having to count evey pace of Jewelry and leaving late what i like the most was the customers love working with people some times it gets busy most time it gets bording"
good,I was locked in on the first day and from that day I didn't really enjoy my coworkers. The managers sometime seem uptight and rude. I like to work on my own which I basically did all the time there. It didn't feel like a family just a regular job.
good,The gm is nice. It's just the schedule that I currently have that I don't like.  The people at work are nice. It's just some receptionist is not fair with other people.
good,"I only worked in the eye department. I cant speak for the store in its self, But it was a great experience. The eye department is ran separate from the store."
good,Management always pushes for more credit card sign ups. Always changing schedule. Keeps workers over an hour after closing to manage an understaffed store. Strict.
good,If given the opportunity to go back and work for this organization I would say no in a heartbeat. It was a part-time job only for extra money and I was on call.
good,There weren't as much great things working here .it was seasonal and around that time of year i think all retail stores worry about one thing and thats credit sales .
good,"While JC Penney is a fun place to work, it is extremely difficult right now to make the new sales quotas that have been set for the commissioned sales departments within the company, due to the economical fall-out right now.  While I have enjoyed the opportunity to work for the company, it is my belief that the time of the retail industry as we know it is at an end."
good,It was an okay job overall. Management was not the best and the pay wasn't great. There were not many opportunities to advance in the company or opportunities to get pay raises.
good,"The company is struggling to find itself again. There are many great people that have been affected by restructure, while strong contributors have been ignored."
good,"Management was not difficult to work for and co-workers were fantastic to work with. "
good,"Would improve business and profits if there were a decent security service, improved appliances, better management, more wheelchairs, and maybe 1 or 2 small buggies for those too weak to carry bags."
good,was a good start off job. Usual Retail job. You receive more hours during the holiday season. I learned patience and what i experienced was the fact customer will buy bulk load of items and return them.
good,aint much to say but if you like to fold clothes all day. then this place is the job for you and im saying this sarcastically.
good,There are not enough safety measurements in place for the loss prevention officers or any kind of physical training for a place where you have to be hands on. Office has the minimum and just a call AC unit that is very out dated and moldy.
good,"Overall the people that I worked with and for were very good people but it's just the general company policy that really screws over the employee, at least from a store level. There is a struggle for hours, not being allowed to work more than 34 so you're only part time and can't have benefits, only being paid about 9 an hour but that was bumped up because of experience."
good,"After 4 yrs with the company and being promised advancement, that has not been the reality of the situation. The main emphasis is opening credit applications, and this you must do to continue your employment,Those who excel at this are given more hours and those who do not meet the standard of 2 per week will see their hours cut gradually and will eventually be forced out.You are also expected to ask  customers for a review of your service, and their experience shopping in the store. As with all Managers, some are better than others. but don't be surprised if you are lied to. You are a body after all and can be replaced. "
good,"When I come in sometimes there is a schedule up to show which fitting rooms I am responsible for for the day. I am sometimes a cashier for the day or maybe a floor person. While working at J.C. Penney I have learned how to order things online, sign up customers for credit cards and also learned about pricing and SKU numbers. If communication.  between management was better, the company would be more desirable to work for.The hardest part of my job would be when management does not put enough employees on the schedule and one person is doing six fitting rooms the whole day. The most enjoyable part of my job is it is very diverse with age and culture."
good,The pay is below average and the work does not measure up to the pay.  Management can be very judgmental and lazy.  Coworkers do not work together.  You have a few that gossip and tattletale.  I enjoy my customers but not the work environment.  There is never enough help and customers have to wait patiently.
good,"JcPenny didn't give us a specific task, everyday was different and we needed to adapt. It's a great job if you enjoy working in different fields everyday; can vet confusing if your not familiar with tasks."
good,"During my time at JC Penney Meyerland I worked in the women;s department, the management made sure to overwork you and keep you 150% busy (even past the time you should've clocked out). Co-workers are very friendly and approaching. The hardest part of the job was making the credits and online orders for the week. The most enjoyable part of the job is making new friends with the customers and co-workers. As a sales associate, you work in the fitting room, the cash register, and keeping up with the cleanliness of the store. And this may not be a surprise but some customers are ... there's been plenty of occasions where we find clothes that have been urinated on the clothes in the fitting room, dirty diapers left open, and PLENTY of theft in the fitting rooms."
good,"I had a great boss. And even the company had every potential to be great. But the way it was being run, was messy. It is a good first job."
good,It is not such a bad place to work especially as a college student. They are very flexible with time. The hardest part is dealing with difficult customers. The enjoyable part is working as a team.
good,JcPenney is a store where you encounter a diversity of people and you I developed a reputation as an efficient service provider. I was an associate in the king Fs' department and worked in other departments as well. I operated the cash register and worked in the customer service department
good,JCPenny was the hardest and most frustrating job I've ever had. You pick up the slack that your co-workers drop off and you get no recognition for it. Nobody appreciates anything you do there and you barely get paid minimum wage.
good,"A typical day includes greeting customers, running the cash register, keeping fitting rooms clean, and keeping clothing in your department organized and folded. The whole operation is a bit cliquey. You get away with anything when you are friends with management and go along with all of the gossipers employed there."
good,"5pm-9;30pm hired for, but as years went on and staff was cut, you were made to do up duties and didn't get out till 12:00-1:00am. Management needed improvement, co-workers were young only there for the pay.  Hardest part was being made to stay for night recovery or told to find a different job.  Most enjoyable was working with the public."
good,"Friendly fun working enviorment. Great team members,Decent pay, However I think Management and employees need better communication."
good,"Started as a sales associate, when I was going to school. So everything  was good. But I transferred to loss prevention @ a different location and omg. They make it seem like it's some type of promotion by giving u a boost in pay ( a couple cents) but that's what they want you to think. This company is full of illusions and false hope. I applied for a supervisor position and totally got played. I was over qualified lol Now all the new hires are getting paid more than I am, and one of them isn't even badged to make stops. All in all it's a good job if your looking for a part time and want an unfair pay."
good,"I can only speak for this particular store, and what I've experienced certainly isn't great. You work long hours for little money, there are days where you don't get a break, and they understaff the weekend and over staff the weekdays. I received very minimal training (half an hour on the floor) and wasn't trained for even half of what I have to do. The company's expectation that you get two credit applications a week is almost impossible for the average employee to meet. Some cashiers spend one day a week at the register and the rest of the time cleaning, making it almost impossible to get an application. All in all, not the best place I've worked and not the worst. It's just average."
good,"I worked as an in home custom window decorator for a year. It was one of the most frustrating jobs I have ever worked. The biggest plus is the benefits but it stops after that. They make you drive hours away to appointments that most likely won't be a sale. They use iPads to place orders and create quotes (which is nice) but when you have someone without wifi or no where close to go you're out of luck or stuck driving miles out of the way. You do get mileage but it's not even the correct standard. Plus the wear and tear on your car is despicable. "
good,I sorted and moved displays in the junior's department. Dealt with customers on a daily basis. It was a great job for me before I started a family.
good,"Job was great. If my position wasn't just for the holiday season, I probably would still be employed with them. job had perfect work hours. I really enjoyed working for JC Penny. Thank you."
good,JCPenney has proved to me that it is a great temporary job. I have enjoyed the past couple of years but found when I was looking for an opportunity to grow and take on more responsibility that that was not easy for management to do. Many reasons were that we had such a strict budget and couldn't allow the training hours. My recent degree says I am capable of so much more but supervisors find my best fit is behind a register and It just doesn't work out.
good,"JCPenney  is a very laid back place to work, Management team very pleasant. The co-workers very helpful. The hardest part of the job was standing for a very long period of time. The most enjoyable part of the job rewards for being a team player and making department goals."
good,I worked at the JcPenney hair salon as a receptionist for a year and did not have the best experience. Most of the employees that I've worked with had made my job experience fun but others had made it hard being a receptionist. Most of the times I would be bombarded by some of them having me do multiple things for them at once when really it is their job to do most of the things they ask me to do. The management was terrible. The managers cared more about the customers than their employees and allowed their employees to get abused by customers.
good,I liked the people I worked with.  But the constant struggle to keep a store clean and deal with customers who expected things that you could not give was exhausting.
good,"JCPenny is a fast pace work environment and the aspect of retail itself is enjoyable although very demanding. What is not as enjoyable is the aspect of the company requiring Credit Applications to keep as an active store. Some managers do things to push for credit applications that should be promotional for the store and not as advertisement. "
good,job is very unorganized. shifts are decided highly upon favoritism. A typical day is very unorganized. Usually work place is under staffed.
good,"Driving Sales and Credit. Holding people accountable. Writing Reviews, getting results. Long hours, especially during peaks such as holiday and back to school. Great co workers who are driven."
good,"It was hard to move up in this company.  I was there for 3 years and every year I had a new boss and had to prove myself all over again. I had to fight to get raises and one of the times I wanted to explore the idea of a new position my boss actually told me that ""just because you are good at one job, does not mean you will be good at another.""  Selfish little thing was trying to keep me on her team for fear of loosing me and having to train another.  That was the straw that broke the camels back.  I found a new job within 3 months at a company closer to home, that paid way more, doing the job she told me I wouldn't be good at."
good,"The management is horrible, they do not enforce no bullying. The managers talk to you as if you're ""dumb"". If it wasn't for the relationships I've built with customers and co workers I would've had to quit a long time ago."
good,Lots of energy around transforming their FM program into World Class. There are many individuals that do well as 'Partners.  Constantly evolving
good,"My day at work is a fast pace and keeps you on your toes."
good,There many managers one said to do one thing and the other said the total opposite didn't know who to follow orders from. There were nice managers then there were the ones who didn't really care. It was hectic.
good,For the most part its a good job. Unless you are expecting them to follow specific availability. Also it is almost impossible to get requested time off even if it is well in advanced. You cannot advance in this job unless you are in  a buddy buddy relationship with managers. They do not care about there employees unless you are getting the most credit card apps. online orders ext.
good,Started working with the company at the age of 17 and by far taught me so many skills. Always felt at home there and as always they were family oriented.
good,Harsh environment. The company could do better by having good manager that actually carry to Golden Rule ideology of the founder.
good,Used to be fun with rallies and morale was relly high. People uesd to like coming to work. Now people don't come back after their leave. Everyone looking for another job.
good,A typical day working at JC PENNY  I would have to say is very interesting. Working at the company you had to deal with crazy management and coworkers
good,The managers have it easy while everyone else works crazy hard. They don't schedule enough people. It is really stressful.
good,I disliked a lot of things about working at JCPenney and would never work there again. They showed a lot of favoritism to people that they knew and never took the time to actually get to know there employees and how they felt about working there.
good,You get a 25 % off discount on clothing! Hours varied every week and pay wasn't as great. They only hire for part time too. You would ring up customer transactions and they pushed getting customers to sign up for a JC Penney card. Sometimes days were slow.
good,"Typical day at work consists of unloading the truck, unpacking and organizing the merchandise and putting it to the floor in a nice neat and timely manner. My co-workers are hard-working and easy to get along with it. Management is easy going and easy to get along with. Most enjoyable part of the job is getting my work done and knowing my check in waiting on me so I can spend it on my babies."
good,"There were really great people, but management had disconnects on several levels. Very limited upward mobility due to few positions. This could potentially be an excellent career for the right person."
good,"I don't have many other retail experiences to base off of, but I was not happy at JCPenney. None of the managers were on the same page, they kept us over 2 hours almost every night, and we could never do anything right."
good,"I was originally a holiday hire but it was expressed early in my hiring that retention was a strong possibility for the position I was place into.  I was hired for a position within the Jewelry Department.  The supervisor I worked under was very limiting in my abilities and did not utilize me to my full potential.  The store manager had to step in and instruct my supervisor to grant me the privileges and tools I needed in order to do my job properly.  It was very difficult to cope with my co-workers being the only male associate in an all-female department.  When pay standards changed from flat hourly rates to Commission based sales, there was very little in the way of courtesy between my co-workers.  When large sales or holidays were not available, my hours were drastically cut, to the point I may only work one day a week, possibly once every two weeks, with ridiculous sales goals that I somehow still managed to meet.  The most difficult part of my job became closing sales as my co-workers were very competitive in taking any customer available.  The best part of the job was helping customers find something that truly held their interest and genuinely loved.  Upper management was very easy to get along with and very helpful with my success, however middle management and supervisors were very dismissive and seemed more preoccupied with maintaining their own positions than assisting with the success of their teams and subordinates.  I had to file several complaints due to the treatment I received as an employee.  There were also no benefits available for the job, and at one point"
good,"Typical day at work usually was 5-7 hr shifts with walking around your area to offer help to customers."
good,i learned how to work in a fast paced environment. Also learned how to work the pallet jack and stocking the product. it was a over all good experience.
good,waited on customers fast and accurately.made sure my department was neat and clean at all times and had to handle cash. My co-workers were very nice to work with
good,"not all that fun and very stressful, really pushed to sell credit cards, very rude customers, little learning time and have to be able to multi task very well in order to work up front"
good,"I work for the JCP in Paris, TX and sadly, there is no room for advancement due to the selfishness of the store manager. I love my job, it keeps food on the table, but it seems like the manager tries to work his employee's to death, on an average work day there are maybe two associates at the front and maybe one or two LOD's(key carriers) that are willing to help with anything, the store manager has the schedule set up to where there is usually only one person at the front of the store no matter what time of day it is and usually that one employee is left with the entire store and cannot satisfy the needs of every customer, if a customer needs help, well to bad for them because the one sales associate on the floor cannot leave the front."
good,"great benefit was the associate discount and knowing when merchandise went on sale before anyone else, especially if u like to shop"
good,This is not the place to work full time. There are only a hand full of full time postions in each store and most don't pay what they should for the amount of work required.
good,"A company that's been around as long as JC Penney, you'd think would have made all the mistakes they could and by now be on track. Not so. Like many retail establishments they incorrectly believe that cutting corners (hours, pay, benefits, positions) is the answer to growth. No, the answer is to treat your employees so well, they are motivated to not only stay but to feel a sense of loyalty to the company. The retail industry in the last 15 or 20 years has become a worn out and tired one. Where workers are paid slave wages and given few if any benefits or hours. While the big corporate execs get million dollar bonuses."
good,I enjoyed my time working at JcPenney. I learned a great deal of skills and look forward to using them in my future employment.
good,work day involved traveling to and touring stores within the district. All stores received visit every six to eight weeks.  Learned the power of driving results through the action of others.  Found through effective team building and encouraging open/honest working relationships among store leaders drove effective results.
good,Working in JC Penney was very fast paced and fun. I learned to work with a diversity of people and different ways to manage  different situations. I learned to provide great customer service.
good,"Read Retail H e l l. "
good,This is a good retail job for a high school student or a retiree. I would not recommend this for anyone in college. My manager was not very flexible.
good,"because there is too many people working at one time, hours are sparce"
good,I work in kids dept and I like helping the customers with their purchases
good,Great experience attending customers helped with credit apps and checked out each customer in a different manner.
good,There is constant understaffment and no order. Managers neglect their workers and you're expected to take care of a million different tasks in the shortest possible time all just to save them money. The co-workers are mostly bearable besides those who don't do their job EVER.
good,"Lacked  autonomy, Micro Management, No room for growth. Frequently recruited instead of nurturing current talent."
good,Managers great to work with. Really nice coworkers. No work/life balance. No job security. No room for advancement.
good,JC Penny was a satisfactory place to work . The benefits were great but there was no chance to advance my career there.
good,long periods of standing with limited movement and short breaks for long hrs.
good,"6am start time"
good,Some of the people there were very fun to work with. My manager was hard to understand what she wanted me to do. I learned more about retail. I enjoyed everything about this job. I was only a seasonal hire.
good,I didn't have time to find out much but it seemed to be a nice place to work..
good,"I love that it was fast paced working at the hut, however when understaffed and trying to control labor, it can get very hectic. The hardest part of working there was dealing with company policies. such as phone surveys and prcs. (customer complaints.) It was fun but it would be very stressful if you chose this as your life career."
good,"Mondays and Wednesdays we received shipments of merchandise. My team and I were in charge of unloading the truck, opening the shipment, stocking on the floor and back stocking the leftovers in our stockroom. Thursday, we are in charge of inventory maintenance. We would go to our designated areas and carefully scan through our merchandise and compare the count we recorded with our previous weeks numbers and sales numbers. Sundays, we do our clearance scans. we read off merchandise sheets and find the specific merchandise to be marked down and take it to the designated clearance areas."
good,"Working at this job is not very difficult. It gets busy and makes the day go faster. We recover and bring out many items of clothing. The management is not very organized and not motivating. The hardest part of the job is getting hours, or being alone on a busy night. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping people, and working with employees who are good at organization. I've learned to not stress myself out for a job that doesn't try to motivate or help you when there is a problem."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is when customers was satisfied whenever they left MY chair! What I've learned from the JCP is that, ""people are going to be people"". You have remain confident in who are, and don't let anyone still your joy! Also, you have to set your own atmosphere, whenever times the atmosphere is not so good. Finally, management should treat their employees equally, and don't show favoritism!"
good,"I barely got hours as a high school student heading into college. Management was terrible, and co workers were not good either."
good,"I do not believe what JCPENNEY is doing anymore, with their business, and their associates."
good,"Part-time work in the evenings. Averaged about 18 hours a week. Worked in different departments and learning new items and prices. My main department was Home Department. Again, I loved my customers."
good,I really enjoyed my coworkers. Management wasn't too great and they looked down on the people that were lower on the later. Also a lot of negative gossip went around.
good,"I did many different duty, I gain many skills form the different duty, like solving customer problems, using a price machine, cash register."
good,It was okay as far as work and cashier. I always kept busy. Not enough hours in the day to finish work. Management under stress from corporate who confused things about the future of the company. No one knew who was next to go. Many changes all the time. Unorganized! Too many cut backs on hours from corporate. No one to cover all the tasks that needed to be done.
good,"I work with JCP for 5 years started out selling shoes. It was easy work for most part selling and customer service. Freight was a nightmare- you had to cut down 3-4 pallets by yourself , sometimes your manager would help and co-workers. It's a good job if you want a job on week-ends and nights to get thru college. I eventually made it to catalog supervisor and enjoyed that because customers loved me and I took time to order things for older people. Never made much money and always broke but I enjoyed helping others. No real future unless you go corporate. Managements a joke- I saw a lot of turn around with management and workers. Lots of stealing going on with customers and employees, but store managers don't care they get a bonus from loss prevention."
good,"The Managers would have you come to work and tell you your not on the list to work instead of calling you beforehand, extremely inconsiderate. A typical day at work was very fast paced."
good,You always had to watch your back and that was not a good thing
good,This would have been a dream job it they actually trained you for the position!!!
good,"I didn't really the staff, but I did enjoy being able to assist customer and pleasing them!"
good,I learned how to work under tons of pressure and keep a smile on my face
good,corporate cam into our company and changed things which didn't need changed.  Our positions as sales support dissappeared.
good,"It is hard to write a glowing review of JCPenney becaues after I helped them make millions in my nine plus years, I got let go because I was maxed out in my pay grade and the company had to cut back."
good,"I've been working there a few months and at first I loved my job and now my only reason for coming to work is the paycheck. They don't give me a lot of hours and the pay is bad, plus I get no benefits other than the employee discount card. "
good,"A typical day at work is hectic, with changes. Management can be stressful and demanding to keep up with all of the changes and workload, without the proper resources."
good,"I start my day usually opening the salon two days a week I am also responsible for closing salon, while there I am answering phones helping customers find the right products for themselves, taking appointments, stocking product shelves and cleaning all while taking my own clients,I learn, new things everyday by doing new things. my salon currently has no manager and has gone through two since I have been there. I absolutely love my coworkers we all work as a team and communicate very well, hardest part of my job is the constant changes JcPennys keeps making not only do they change the pay for stylist, they have also raised the prices witch makes it difficult to retain cliental customers don't like change. The best part of my job is not only do I love meeting new people and providing customer service for customers I like to share my knowledge with coworkers I thrive on helping people and I do just that."
good,not a good job if this is going to be your primary job. maybe this is only a job for a teenager only needing extra but NOT for an adult that needs to make a living
good,"•	Worked as a Men’s Clothing Expert"
good,"When I first started at JcPenney salon I loved it. I loved the environment the people I worked with the only part I didn't like was my salon manager was a friend before working there and working for friends is never a good idea. She had no professional management skills and I was constantly cleaning up her messes and making excuses for her. Then I caught her in bed with my Fiancee. I needed that job so I stayed while still looking for another job. Meanwhile penneys took on a new CEO who changed everything in the salon and store. Half of our salon staff walked out. We lost 60% of our sales and instead of trying to hire experienced stylists, the salon manager kept hiring people fresh out of beauty school and gave them no training or help. On top of salon staff leaving half of the store managers left or retired and hours throughout the store started getting cut. I told my parents that I was looking for a new job and my step mom slipped up and said something to my salon managers mom that I was looking for a new job so my manager started cutting my hours and hired 2 new people for my position. We were splitting 30 hours a week between three people. Also I had been there for over 2 years and learned that the people who got hired after me for the same position with no prior experience were getting paid over $2/hour more then me. After putting in my two weeks notice I went back to get some of my personal things in my work station including cards that my son had made for me and a couple coffee mugs and the things my son had made for me had gotten thrown out."
good,"The company was a fun friendly atmosphere to work in, except when the company took a new direction that eliminated the one thing that set them apart from their competitors. THERE CUSTOMER SERVICE."
good,I have learned how to multi-task.
good,"Good atmosphere, pleasant time working there, unfortunately not many opportunities for advancement."
good,Promoted JC Penney credit cards.
good,"The first thing I do when I get to work is check my email. I follow up with any customers orders or customers that are needed & communicate to my team what would need to be done for that day. I assist representatives with customer's orders, as well as taking escalated calls from customers. I learned how to communicate effectively with the team members of jcpenney & how to delegate work to others efficiently. I also learned how importaint follow up with the customer is. The management of JCP is accomodating to Work/Life Balance when business allows. My co-workers are knowledgeable with what we do. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to satisfy customer's requests & assisting with anything that is necessary."
good,"As previously stated, it's a good part-time job, but I am now looking for something more permenant and where I can use my skills. I don't rather like the direction the company is headed in and the management there is very unorganized."
good,"I like how there is constant work and always staying busy on sight,"
good,"For 4 yrs in Catalog I enjoyed customer service with our customers like placing catalog orders, opening a new credit card, and give customers their catalog orders. For 11 years, I enjoyed the challeges of sizing watch band and replacing watch batties."
good,Since a new guy has taken over JCP the company has went through drastic changes. The job security is no longer there. A typical day at work would be me assisting customers and trying to make their shopping experience great. I love customer service.
good,"The customers are the best, manager and the way treat employee was not the best."
good,"N/A, I do appreciate the learning at JCP but I don't approve of all the changes. I know change is important but when it affects the company, I have a problem with that."
good,The work day overall was ok. I love to work in the customer service field but the fact that I needed to be available for various shifts was a problem for me.
good,Its hard work but a fun job
good,I worked in all departments and learned a lot. It was a relatively fast paced job setting. From management I learned a lot about myself and what I expect from a job. I learned that while there was a lot of bickering between co-workers we was still able to pull together and get the job done. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers.
good,I love to shop at Jcpenney they have a wide selection of merchandise but when it comes to working there it wasn't what I expected. There are alot of changes happening in the company some are good and some aren't do good. I don't like not knowing if I'm going to have a job because they might get rid of my position like I've seen it happen to co workers.
good,It was a fun place to work for if you are in that highschool phase again. But I was 26 and over it so finding some one old enough to have real conversation was hard
good,"The management seemed to know and be able to do only about as much as the sales associates. I felt I would be more qualified for the position, due to the lack of motivation and outgoingness."
good,Great place to work located in the maill. Its easy acces to the public
good,"At JC Penney I worked in the Womens department(plus sizes).I did everything from ring up customer's place catalog orders if needed,orders from anther store weather it was local or out of state.(A Send's Order). Clean out the fitting rooms,and also at the register's put the clothing up and also rack maintence. For the most part I really enjoyed working in retail, and would love to get back into retail."
good,The clothing material isn't the way it use to be. The scheduling of hours is very unstable.
good,Since they kept restructuring the company. The managers had to do the job of 10 people and only get paid for doing one persons job.
good,"start off with morning meetings, headed off to unload merchandise from the truck assign it to the proper place using a handheld computer associating it. setting plan o grams setting visual displays some management great others not so the co workers was a great change to work with a lot of fun and serious when need be. leaving the job was hard met a lot of new customers who was the greatest but had to finish school. seeing the satisfaction on the customer faces was the best part of the job"
good,"i guess i got out of there at the right time, because i was actually considered for the supervisor position only 5 months after being hired."
good,A typical day was on average between 8 and 10 hours . The best part of the job was meeting and talking with the customers and seeing their smiles when they found what they were looking for. The hardest part was working thse hours without a lunch break.
good,Loved working for jcpenny they just don't pay enough jcpenny doesn't offer overtime at all and the hours sucked i just like the people i worked with very energetic happy and helpful
good,"A typical day at work included maintaing the visual appearance of the store while providing great customer service. I aquired many skills from working at JCPenney, for example, I learned how to operate a point of sale system, how to replenish and ticket merchandise, and how to engage customers while still maintaing a professional demeanor. My co-workers came from a variety of different backgrounds. I got along with most all of my co-workers with the exception of a few who I felt did not deserve to work there because they had a poor attitude and work ethic; and although I would speak to management about these people nothing ever seemed to be done about it. The hardest part of my job was that sometimes, although I did my best, I could not resolve a customer issue. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know my customers and there is no better feeling then when a customer comes in to the store looking and asking for you specifically, I loved building customer relationships."
good,"its difficult to express the things i went through at jcpenney. although i learned many things there, i know i learned them on my own. there was not much help from management. my fellow co workers were the ones who helped me get the hang of things when i first started. The hardest part of the job was dealing with 6 different managers a day; none of which was my actual department manager, she was never there and any opinion she had on a person could be deciphered down to about 10 mins. helping people was probably the most enjoyable part of working at jcpenney, yeah i got my share of ""bad"" customers, but i always had a few customers that made my day easier."
good,It's an okay Job while attending school for degree. Meeting customers and helping them is great! Pay rate is low in comparison to other Retail/customer service jobs. JCP mostly hires high school
good,It is a good place to work if you are only looking for part time hours. You have to be flexible because the hours you work are always changing. You also have to be able to work anytime.
good,a job to have until you get something better. not to flexible with schedule or hours. to many rules changing up from time to time. can be very stressful
good,I love the customers and the other employees but I had a head manager for the day tell me in front of customers I was not doing a good job because I did not write I did something when it was obvious I did it
good,"The company as a whole is failing. There's constant talk of new store closures; there's absolutely no job security. Most of management has worked for the company 15+ years and aren't very open to change. Things tend to be very divided by department. Not a ton of cross-department assistance which makes the stores worse. The corporate structure is ridiculous and difficult to navigate. "
good,Working at JCP is okay managers are not the best at communication and really dont have flexible hours and they want school kids who work there want to prioritize work over school which doesn't make sense to me.
good,Works with my availability great job for retired or college students. Will hire high school kids for a starter job great 1st time employer. Hiring process is easy and you feel welcomed by employees.  Family oriented company.
good,I worked during the Holidays for 4 years part time and then in 2018 I was told I did not fit what they were looking for.  I am 74 years old and look and act like in my late 50 or early 60's.  I believe I was discriminated against due to age.  I never received any negative feed-back for my performance and was always helpful and courteous to customers.
good,It seems that management has a different agenda than taking care of their employees. They cut hours but expect us to work just has hard if not harder to make impossible goals? While we are understaffed and aren't given the proper time and help to complete our work?
good,If your looking for a retail career it competitive. People literally will trash u to get to the top. Pay isn’t worth it . They push u hard to get people to signed up for credit cards which in turn drives most customers away.
good,"Started off great but when health issues became a problem, hours were cut and never given back after out of hospital."
good,"We held pre-shift supervisor meetings, reviewing prior shift production as well as the days production goals. I learned that an unorganized management team as well as old faulty equipment kept team morale low. It wasn't a very mentally conducive environment to work in consistently."
good,"Not at all competitive with other retail stores for hourly rate.  GM gives in to customer complaints all the time which makes associates and managers look bad when they are doing what they are told, their job  WE are known as the store, just complain and you'll get what you want plus you an return anything."
good,"JCPenny has been going down the drain. Ive been working there for a few years and the new management is awful. Supervisors don't want to be there, new policies are expected to be followed but, when a customer complains, the associates are expected to take it and do whatever they say because supervisors will just give it to them. It's not worth the minimum pay. When you work there for more than a year, youre expected to do a lot of things that are out of your job description and no raise is given.  The assocates are all college/ high school students so they like to gossip. Its a toxic environment that's not gonna get better unless they get rid of the bad managers"
good,"Not really comfortable working here , I did like my job at first but now I don’t . The person who is the manager at the store just really dosent cut it for that position . He hardly gives the people that work the most hours . Is always putting pressure on us . Dosent give us the days off we request even if we have not requested a single day off trough out the year . Not my favorite job at the moment is to much pressure and not enough recognition."
good,"The company needs to review the type of styles in apparel,price and sales.The receiving of inventory needs to be changed to become a less labor process."
good,"Meet a lot of people "
good,"Overall, it was just a job. It’s very important you make yourself look busy, otherwise, they make something out of nothing. It’s still a pretty easy job."
good,I dont want to do this. I just want to look for a job but talking about this job is marking  me made. So I am writing anything just to get this over with
good,"Some days good some crazy. Big sale is nuts. Must work weekends. They want you to push JCP CC , did not like that. Other than that ok working environment."
good,I would go back to work if I had the opportunity to work there again only because of the proximity and pay. Was promised multiple times a better position that never were received. I saw others benefit from lack of work by being promoted while I was taken from the lift operator job I had to work on a production line because I worked hard. I felt used and taken advantage of.
good,Most of the employees are awesome too work with. The boss is very rarely there. You are pushed to get credit applications on a daily basis. The hours are flexible but it's not easy for some to move up in this company.
good,Overall okay job. Worked the registers. Alot of folding to keep the store up. Management was okay. Good working environment. Friendly staff and customers
good,"Working a JC Penny was very stressful, you would get a schedule but because of sales you were sent home a lot to cut payroll without notice.  The manager didn't know what she was doing causing no one to ever get promoted."
good,"It could have been better the managers were always slow, some customers where so rude and they only had me for about a month due to seasonal help so I believe it could have been better"
good,"JCPenney is a quick and easy job, management respect their employees and ensure that the employees are motivated. Most needed during the holidays, and may need to consider seniority"
good,"I was promoted quickly, rising through the ranks every 6 months or so. Management was terrible. There was a lot of favoritism and pettiness going on. Worked some to dead and others skated by easy based on skin color. Management would cut hours if you couldn't work shifts she wanted you to. Used and abused employees. Many left before they couldn't deal with the managers. The pay was absolutely terrible. Great skill builder and resume builder job but get out as fast as you can."
good,You need to be on your toes at this company on how you open boxes with knives. They get a lot of boxes of stock two times a week and it needs to be unbox in a short time frame.
good,We have sales goals but no commissions.  Parttime hours so it is hard to get crrdit for be backs. I am a very numbers oriented and my motification comes from beating my own numbers. I am a professiol and driven. I have turned clerks into salespeople
good,"Management used to be great but when JCP downsized they retired most of management and replaced them with unqualified, power hungry, lazy people. (Some not all) These people would pick their friends for promotions and special projects. Age discrimination has begun to be an issue in just the last few years JCPenney was a nice place to work back when they still held the moral values and ideals of James Cash Penney."
good,"The work was fun and fast paced, I loved organizing the merchandise. The management was hard to get through to and was almost nonexistent. At first my schedule was good I worked during the week but out of nowhere was given 2 days a week and was told it would last a month at the most. After 3 I had to leave because my paychecks were hardly $50.00, just to find out i was unknowingly hired on to play catch-up."
good,"Typical day at work, you clock in go to a little meeting. You start your task whether that's cashier/.com/recovery team/management. What I learned from JCP is don't be afraid to learn new things, that the business is all politics who you know and if they like you. The most hardest part of the job is the pushy and sometimes rude customers. It makes you not want to come in at all. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers and sometimes getting the rare nice customers to lift your spirits."
good,"The job was great at first for a summer job. But as time went on I got to find out that the staff is extremely competitive and not really fun to be around. Nobody working there really likes it. The work is draining and it's hard to focus when there are so many tasks to get done. Long story short, I wouldn't work here again even if I was offered more money."
good,"9.00 an hour "
good,"Instead of promoting within the company,they  would hire someone not having any knowledge of the department and ask you to train him or her. That's al"
good,A typical retail job with nothing to get excited about. The turnover is horrible but the benefits are great. The company has great marketing and treats there customers very well.
good,They hired many associates that were bottom of the barrel!  Hired me posted by the government and then discontinued the jobs after 6 months and offered me Martine dock job!
good,"Fun place to work.enjoyed meeting new people,enjoyed my job tasks,hate that we got a new manager she is a true non caring person,she’s never at the store,she doesn’t know how to talk to people!she is very nasty,she’s nothing like our previous three managers!she shows no interest in the customers nor associates,she has hired a lot of her family members"
good,This company was a fun place to work at times but some managers were not pleasant and created a stressful working environment. The pay scales for most employees were all very low and some managers claim their pay was also very low. There was hardly any opportunities for advancement even after many years of service.
good,"As a company I love working for JCP. But once I started at this location they would rather back stab you then help you grow with the company... Doesn't matter how many years you have been with them, or how you perform your job, you can never do it right."
good,Very overwhelming . But very welcoming . Meeting new people growing a bond with the customers and co-workers. It can get a little messy but actually putting the store back together is fun .
good,"Two days breaking down boxes of merchandise. Two days of putting the merchandise on designated department. Sorting based on colors and sizing them either it is for men, women, children or babies."
good,"I absolutely loved the work that I did while at JCP, but the reason I left was due to the poor management and poor scheduling. I liked working with my co-workers, and loved doing the everyday workload because it was fast paced. But, whenever I would request a day off, it would get denied. And don't expect any days off during the holidays."
good,It's okay. The pay isn't great and the work environment is alright. They leadership group doesn't seem to care that much. It's the kind of job that is usually only temporary.
good,"As a long-term retail associate, I just feel that customer service has been sacrificed and, associates are expected to do too much for far below what should be a standard of quality living."
good,"work with great customer dressing them with my fashion techniques "
good,J.C. Penney was a fun seasonal job but the management was not good. They have good flexible hours for people in school as well. The hardest part of the job was the angry customers
good,Only worked there thru the holidays a few years as part time for extra money. Good place to work can get very busy during the holidays and hectic. But mostly a good place.
good,"managers did not do their job. I was forced to pick up the slack, without a pay raise. i was often left alone at the boutique without backup if we became busy. managers encouraged me to break company policy and did so themselves."
good,"enjoyable job however during the holiday season can get busy with lots of work to do with different departments, endless lines at the registers as well as meeting the quota."
good,a typical day a jcp was getting there early opening the register and ring for majority of the day.they were really strict about stay in the register area even though it was still our responsibility to clean our surrounding area. so we almost always stayed after to clean the store.
good,Not a good work place for someone who's in a wheelchair. I only got 4 hour shifts every month once a month and that wasn't fair. I feel like I've been discriminated against.
good,"Hours are usually pretty flexible, which is good for students working a part time job, or anyone who has a second job. The work isn't difficult, but you will be dealing a lot with the general public, so it's important to know how to be sociable and make a good impression for the company."
good,"Good job, nice people, pay sucks as do most retail Jobs. I enjoyed working there. It gave me the experience I needed to be able to branch out and get a better paying job"
good,I wouldn't want to do retail after working here. In my opinion. If you don't like long working weekends and low pay then look somewhere else if its possible.
good,"I think JC Penny is a decent company, however I personally have not been given the opportunity I would have liked for a first job. I have been working there for 6 months now and have asked many times to be trained for register because I think it's a good skill to learn but to this day I still have not touched a register. Don't get me wrong, there are some great people working with this company and I think a lot of my managers like me, I just think there may be some internal problems that could be fixed by the higher ranks. This is just my experience, I know many people who have had a better experience working here."
good,"Corporate expects you to have things planned 3 weeks in advance without giving you the proper tools to do so. And then they change things at the last minute- almost every time."
good,I enjoyed my work experience at JC Penney. It was a family oriented atmosphere. I loved assisting customers with their appliance needs. Black Friday was an challenge to sell appliances in a store filled with people.
good,"I've been working with the company for two years now as a sales associate. JCP has taught me a lot of really useful skills in customer service and merchandising, and the people you work with are very nice and easy going. It's a great opportunity if you're starting out as a first job and an easy one if you're trying to balance school or another job outside of JCP, but there are barely any opportunities to advance."
good,"The company is poorly managed in every way, from corporate management to store management. I'm currently doing the job of an assistant supervisor without any of the extra pay or benefits. Overall, it's an okay place to work, but not a long term sort of thing, especially if you ever want career advancement."
good,"JC Penneys:"
good,Getting laid off for not being able to get people to sign up for credit cards. There is the too much drama. The managers do not communicate well with each other.
good,The management was amazing for the first 8 months of me working there. We got new management and stuff started heading south. New manager pretty much kicked all of the old asst. managers out and in with the new and everything felt like a different company.
good,"Walk to my designated section where I would either ring out customers or clean and organize the sales floor"
good,"The job was pretty fun. The hours were flexible and I mainly just did accounting work. It taught me how to use Word, Excel, and Access. But I got laid off so there was really no future for this job."
good,I helped the customers find clothing and I rearranged the clothes on the racks to keep them filled up. It was an okay job but it just did not offer much benefits. It was not full time. My feet bothered me from standing up so I eventually had to let the job go.
good,"The best part of the job was the great co-workers and friends I met there. As a supervisor, you have to work twice as hard to succeed with little floor support and no incentives for good performance except for an annual raise. It was retail and had that high school clique vibe to it even though all the managers were well past that age point. I learned when I was let go from my position due to the dating policy at work, that it doesn't matter how hard you work you are susceptible to getting fired for an issue that happened outside of work, and the person I dated ended up getting my position. Overall I still hope Penney's does well in the future for the great people still there and I will always remember the fun times I had there. It's like a family when things were good, but was a minefield when things were not good."
good,The people are great. The job just gets nothing and hours get cut easy. Great for a holiday job to earn extra cash. But other than that not much else.
good,"Management not on same page with others. If you do well in your department, don't expect to move to another position.  Fast pace.  disagree with working on thanksgiving."
good,I used to work in appliances and mattress and it was great! I loved it. The only downside is I didn’t get many credit apps so they cut my hours. Not many people come in the back and if they do they already have a credit card. The twin where the jcp I work at is small. There is no way we get a lot of people in our store. I was recently promoted to AP. I didn’t want it but I was voluntold basically. It’s not that bad I make more as AP but the job is temporary. So at the end of August imma be back on register and my hours are gonna be cut again. One thing I can absolutely say I don’t like is how the managers treat everyone. There are like three that I love. I like the others but they treat some of the others employees and managers badley.
good,I was a seasonal worker. I learned the merchandise from researching on my own.  The store was undergoing a huge change due to new owners at the time of employment which caused a lot of issues.
good,Cared more about their customers then their employees.Managers let the customers that come and shop mis treat the employees very messy store good sales though
good,They had a lot of favoritism and the management was very messy. Good work and life balance. It was always very busy at the print center and it was a good place to incorporate your creativity.
good,If you not a people person that probably won’t be the job for you. You get to interact with new people everyday and you gotta be able to remain professional even if they are rude.
good,"When I first started this job was perfect because I had just started college and needed to make some extra money. Part time hours worked great for me at first but after the winter/ Christmas season there was a huge decline in hours! In a good week I get 20 hours give or take but never more than 25. Along with that jcp also has the tendency to hire more and more employees which takes away hours from employees that were there before. The scheduling manager favors certain people, especially if you can get the store credit applications! I think this company isn't so much focused on the treatment/ inclusion of the employees and doesn't try hard enough to make it fair for every employee. Be prepared to have tons of problems with hours and if you want this to be your only source of income, think again! This job won't cover any of your bills."
good,"Call center environment at times can be fast paced and stressful. Over I did learn a lot from this job regarding customer service  that required me to respond to customer inquires via phone about merchandise, systems support and sales orders.  I learned active listening and patience as I at times had to work with irate customers."
good,"I was unfortunate enough to lose a family member a couple days before Christmas, and really should have stayed home. However, in retail, the holidays are absolutely mandatory. Thus, I was forced to work Christmas day, even though the managers knew my situation. At the end of the day, you are just another cheap replaceable part in their money making machine."
good,Upper management is unorganized and always have scheduling conflicts. The people you directly work with are good people though. Operations is fast paced and you are never bored. Sales can be hideous and they really push for each associate to get credit applications.
good,"This job is best for students in the summer when home from college to make some extra cash.  Very low salaries and unless you are management, you can only get part-time hours."
good,"AS A manager I found the associates great to work with. I never had issues that they could not help me with. I lead projects with my team behind me. The management staff is something that concerns me. My previous employer seemed more organized and well constructed company. The manager seem like they were just given position. The lack of management skill seems to cause great issues through out the company. MY store manager pushes off issues on to his manager that relate to him and his staff follows the same trend. The management staff only provide opportunity to the ones that they favor, not to the ones that actually are working hard."
good,"ok place to work at.. discount is great, but really cant afford to wear dress clothes that will inevitably be damaged at work.  you need to pick up the others slack.. so the best employees have to do tons more work while others stand around and do nothing."
good,"Set up jewelry, help customers in selection of jewelry. Check out customers from other departments when they come to jewelry counter. Mark down of clearance fine and fashion jewelry. Also set up of handbags, socks and fashion jewelry in the department. Finally answering phone calls from customers."
good,"I began my journey with JC Penney's under a management training program. Every since my start date even going into my position, I feel like I have always been one step behind on responsibilities due to the lack of training. Even after being with the company now for a year, it seems as though new operations are introduced without proper training. The whole company"
good,Working at JCPenney was easy. It has a very calm relaxing environment. The management wasn’t very helpful you would have to figure out stuff on your own.
good,"Working at JCP could be stressful. There would be extremely busy days, like working on Black Friday, and at times it was a ghost town and you straighten everything in your section several times to help the hours pass."
good,The management at jcp is terrible and the hours are not consistent and are usually low. Supervisors talk down to you and make you feel beneath them and the store is always understaffed.
good,Decent place to work. Pay and schedule flexibility could be better along with not having to wear black and white clothing while working in the salon. Overall not bad.
good,Not many hours. Or Financial security but work environment was good and work is not hard at all management is also ok they pretty much tell you what they need and let you work
good,i am currently only receiving 8 or less hours a week ..supervisor is unfair and very aggressive towards employees not a great work environment to be in
good,"I have made plenty of friends while working at JCPenney.  However, management was incredibly rude to associates and even customers.  We use walkie talkies and they are primarily used to yell about getting customers signed up for a JCPenney Credit Card.  We are required to use certain lines to have customers apply for a JCPenney Credit Card.  Often times customers do not even realize that it is a credit card they are signing up for until it is too late.  And this is intentional."
good,I have never worked retail so this has been a new experience for me. I prefer the office or medical field where I belong. I do admit this company seems to be struggling. Just from when I started everything has seemed to go downhill. The turnaround of new employees has gotten worse. Even the management seem to be overly stressed which of course affects all.
good,"Its retail, either it's for you or it's just not. It most definitely is not for everyone but it's definitely worth a try to determine that. I had a lot of fun working at a JCPenneys, but it was more of a job until I find my career, kind of thing. Not to say their is anything wrong with choosing it as your career, to each their own."
good,My favorite thing about working in the Home Department was order merchandise for customers online.  This was particularly rewarding when I could locate coupons that reduced the sale price - making the purchase more attractive.
good,"lot of pressure,job assignment is not fair just based in friends,low level mangment,no incentives to stay in the company,no complaints are listening by supervisor or managers"
good,"JC Penney, or any retail environment is a great place to work to start out, but I wouldn't make a career out of this retail environment as it is underpaid and underappreciated."
good,"Although JCPenney is a good starting place for a new stylist, there is no way to work your way up. The staff is lazy and unmotivated and does not want to change. The people create an incredibly unprofessional environment for clients to be in."
good,"The management involved with IT Security had no intention of improving the security posture of the company. Multiple IT issues were raised and none of them were dealt with. There was a culture of complacency. Many members of the IT staff were completely unaware of the environment around them, and those same members couldn't tell you what they actually do. The new management laid off employees that pushed for change and pushed to make the company a better place."
good,"Worked on the Sales floor helping Customers. Put out stock, straighten clothing. Also cash customers out at the register. Professional Customer Service Skills."
good,This is a great place to work but the managers all do something different and aren’t in the same page the store looks horrible but they are worried about stuff being in the middle of the isles
good,"it was an ok place, but after a while it got too much back stabbing.,and managers were just not my favorite people. its great for"
good,I didn't like working for a company that didn't hire accountable workers for their duties. my boss and some of the old workers are great but new hires ruin the rest  without self starting attitudes
good,"JCPenney is more worried about their competition than their own business. The management is cutthroat and if they don't like your work you will get your hours cut. The Asset Protection team is ok, but the AP Leadership keep trying to invent the wheel instead they should understand what works and what doesn't work. I was employed 2 1/2 years and the Company destructed 3 times. No consistency"
good,"Unfortunately, in recent years JCPenney has turned it's back on customer service and associate loyalty  They have cut staff and staff hours.  Many full-time associates have been cut to part-time and are at risk of losing their health benefits.  Stores are operating with a skeleton crew, expecting associates to do many extra duties while still taking care of demanding customers.  Because there is no longer in-store security, associates are also expected to be on the lookout for shoplifters. Putting their safety at risk to deter a would-be thief. It must be cheaper for the company to write off stolen merchandise than to hire security to protect from it.  JCPenney has lost many of it's best store associates over the years due to unnecessary cutbacks.  Hiring younger and cheaper is fine as long as you still have enough of those older more experienced associates to show them true customer service. Especially since most of the younger hires don't stick around long enough to learn anything on their own.   "
good,"The team members are great, the over all work experience was not all that great. Long hours and not enough pay; Although, it does give amazing job experience."
good,They are used to a high turnover and therefore do not respect the employees they currently have. They treat you as if you are only temporary even if you have every intention of staying on.
good,"All started out okay, but went down kill as the years went on. They weren't family friendly. I had my first child and then they took all my hours away and never gave them back. Medical problems popped up and they didnt want to work with me even though it wasnt preventing me from doing my job, just needed more doctors appointments and flexibility with my schedule because I had to work around childcare too. It was also right about the change in ownership and all the pricing changes and sign changes."
good,"I loved my job until my old gm retired, managers left everything changed and all the new manager cares about is profit and credit, very disappointing."
good,"Management was never clear on what needed to be done inside the store. They also let certain workers slack off and not go to the front registers when it was busy due to them having worked there for a long period of time. I also felt that there weren't enough people working the registers and so the sales floor associates had to cover the registers, which left the sales floor empty at times."
good,I am not sure if it was because of the Supervisors or the Company itself.  I have to say that I had good start in retail because of thr position I held here.
good,"I started at JCPenney as the salon receptionist & intended to move up to stylist when I got my license in cosmetology. When I got my license I did switch & it started off okay. There are now a lot of new stylists here which makes it difficult to build a clientele quicker. You are not making much money unless you have a consistent clientele, so it is not the best pay if you are trying to save or have bills to pay."
good,"Security was more concerned with watching employees and accusing them of stealing rather than watching customers who were actually stealing. Security gets their roles confused thinking they’re management and can call employees at the register from their office asking them who they were on the phone with and telling them to get to work. Management will schedule you outside of your availability even though you made it clear when you applied what days you can and cannot work. BUT it’s not all bad some managers are very kind and helpful and will give you as much hours as you want and can handle, as well as assist you with your work when you need help."
good,Working there was okay but the people are lazy and they are trifling. The managers/lod's show A LOT of favoritism towards employees and there are a couple of them that are racist. Working in retail is always stressful but it is pretty much what you make of it.
good,"I learned a lot of things from JC Penney like time management, organization, and friendliness. I really did not like management. They did not accept my request to go on vacation to see my father even though I asked a month in advanced."
good,JCP used to be a great place to work but has never really recovered since the activist investors got involved and almost sunk the company.  Unfortunately it is only a matter of time.
good,"Most days I opened the jewelry counter. Counted the diamonds. What I did not like was the HR at the store would take away my OT if employees went over 40 it was deleted out of the system because he did not want to get into trouble. But if busy with guest sometimes it was hard not to go over. I got a .02 cent raise the first year. Did not get a decent raise until I was going to go else where."
good,"Must be available days, night's and weekends.  Must be customer service orientated and willing to help in any department.  Can be a fun environment with the right people."
good,People stick with their friends they have developed and treat new like they are not wanted or slow. Manger seem  like she either likes you or Don't depends on the day
good,"Typical retail environment long hours, not enough staff, ""what have you done for me lately"" attitude by management, expect high results with no tools to get those results."
good,The management at JCPenny did not give me the hours I initially signed up for. Other co-workers had the same issue. The management hardly ever had a smile on their face.
good,"My only complaint about this job was the pay. After being asked to stay after the holiday season, my pay rate stayed the same until the time I left the company."
good,"A great culture within a store setting, everyone is team oriented, but as for the company itself, it needs A LOT of work. They never give enough hours to the store to schedule associates leaving everyone spread very thin and resulting in upset customers. Maybe they should take away some of corporate office's luxuries and help out the store associates, rather than just laying them off."
good,"Fun place to work, always something to do, managers do not know how to let go of people, you may get stuck with more than half of your departments being people who don't know how to do anything."
good,"It's been so long since I worked in JCPenney and I don't really remember much but while I was there, I remembered a few. I started off at a seasonal employee and they decided to keep me based on my work ethic and personality. But it was a little challenging because it was a retail work but I handled it pretty well."
good,JCPenney taught me how to work in fast pace places . The management need a bit work. They were flexible with my school schedule but there was also a lack of hours.
good,"Busy place at times. Management expects you to stand for  8hrs, even if no customers in area. They hired me to sell Beds, on partial commission, and have me selling everything and doing stock work in other areas. This makes it hard to sell beds, since you can't see department."
good,"They don't give us enough hours, we literally get like 20hours a week if that and there is always new management. we don't get any  benefits either. However they  do work around your schedule which is a plus but id love to have more hours"
good,"JCPenney's Golden Rule is ""treat others the way you'd like to be treated"". There is very poor management in the store. The leaders do not know hot to normally speak to the employees. The WORST thing is that management would sometimes change people's work schedules WITHOUT telling them."
good,"It was a good place to work when I started 8 years ago but now they’re very understaffed and the workload is too much to handle for the small crew we have now "
good,"JcPenney is a great company. My experience with a certain branch just didn't work out. This is due to poor upper management. It slowly transcended into a very uncomfortable place where each associate was walking on eggshells, worrisome of who would get fired or scolded next."
good,"easy"
good,"A typical day at work would always be busy because I would stay on the register for my 8 hour shift since there are always coupons even when it is the slow days. I have learned how to communicate well with the customers and always convince them to apply for a credit card and tell them about the benefits and they would actually apply. I have made a decent amount of credit care applications in a week. The hardest part of my job is recovering the clothes, the fitting room and dealing with customers about complaints about the price of our items. I love going to work and most of the associates always say hi angel in the morning."
good,The work environment was negative and I was promised many advancements that I did not receive. The management was very unprofessional and did not care about the stylists.
good,Good if you want a part-time job or seeking advancement in retail as a career. Work hours and days off all over the place. Expect to work every holiday except Christmas day and Easter day.
good,"JC Penney is a traditional retailer that is best suited for people who enjoy basic satisfactions out of life.  Go to work, drink coffee, do a few e-mails, have lunch, and go home."
good,"JCPenney's has a fun, relaxed environment.  The managers are friendly and helpful people.  The work may be physically demanding at times, but that is to be expected of a retail store."
good,"Hardest part of day trying to achieve sales when we are not busy. Coaches and managers will write you up if you do not produce for them, evening if you are trying."
good,"I enjoyed the work that I performed and the people I worked with, but the hours and low pay became too much."
good,Fast-paced and fun environment. Dealt with customers on a limited basis. Old company with a very thorough culture. Processed new freight and conducted price changes and positioning of signs.
good,"there is never enough employees, its embarrassing to see customers in long lines, and there is nothing you can do. "
good,"JC Penney strives to give excellent customer service and maintain an organized work environment. However it does not apply the same attitude to its employees. A rewarding experience for an associate is to successfully assist customers to the best of their ability and have them be pleased with their service.  It is disheartening when management focuses on how many credit cards an associate has opened and prioritizes one the staff that have the highest applications, as if it were the most important skill."
good,The location that I worked at lacked training and well-balanced management as well as an inconsistency in my scheduling and communication with specific supervisors. I would love to work JCPenney's but probably at another location because it is a great business to work for and work at.
good,The store I worked at needs better management.No manager or supervisor knew how to work a cash register. Penneys  was a great company to work for they treated you well.Unfortunately I was one of the few that had to retire early or be let go(downsizing 2017)
good,"What used to be a fun place to work, has become very stressful.  When I first started, it was all about Teamwork.  Now there are so few scheduled that nothing is accomplished in a timely manner.  Always being pulled away from my dept to cover an absentee position.  The pride I took in knowing my dept was clean, well stocked and set according to plan, was taken away, due to the fact that I was always needed elsewhere.  They even took the registers out of my dept.  Customers who needed that one on one service, now found themselves abandoned."
good,its a good first job for those who are just graduating high school or are still in school. some may enjoy it more than others. there are no health benefits.
good,its retail nothing you can really expect out of it. paid higher than most retail. management was horrible. alot of favoriting being done. hard labor. very stressful for a retail job
good,"While I was employed there, management was very poor. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and we worked very hard and were paid very little.They expected alot from their employees and pushed very hard."
good,Store was always busy and there was always something to do.  Lots of demands from customers and management.  Employees had to compete for recognition.
good,"Worked there through the holidays was great to work there as a teen , learning how it is to make your own money and be able to help your family.Employees where always willing to help and train you when you asked."
good,En esta empresa se aprende a reconocer las necesidades del cliente y de esta manera ayudarlo a satisfacer sus necesidades. También se logra entablar una relación con el cliente para garantizar el regreso del cliente a la tienda.
good,"JCP is a great place to work if you're a student or nearing retirement, but other than that, I would stay away. Some stores are very flexible when it comes to hours, but not all are like that. If you need to take a day off, you have to put it in months in advance. Don't expect to climb the ladder and become a store manager, they only usually pick the most unexperienced people who work at the location and then wonder why sales slump dramatically. The job for me was fun, as it gave me a chance to meet new people and help customers, however some of the people who shop there are nasty and will try to pull one over on you, but this is common in retail. If you ever want a decent raise, you better become good friends with the HR worker as that is your only real chance."
good,I enjoyed working here i was able to learn how to do everything and was always open to take more hours but i never went over thirty hours.The health benefits were not great they do not offer great plans
good,"•	Responded to customer inquiries in a timely manner. Provide high profile leadership and direction by maintaining positive customer service and employee relations. Accountable for all aspects of store operations."
good,"Have worked for Pennys for many years and many have come and gone. This use to be a good place to work but benefits, hours and commissions have all suffered over the years. Management has suffered because of cutbacks and many good managers have left or retired early. This is no longer a company one can feel comfortable in having a position until retirement age. Probably not bad for entry level sales people but many of the young ones only want to draw a check."
good,"When working at the call center you are receiving incoming calls from customer in regards to all different reason. Customers call in to place the order, check order status and assisting with any issue that they have with the website. I am floor supervisor so I deal more with the escalated call when customer are not happy with the their service, order and other concerns."
good,"Customer service was bad and rude co workers."
good,I worked in the Optical Department so the management of the department was a different company and was poorly managed under the higher ups.  My local department manager for the Optical was excellent.
good,"horrible management but lovely co workers made up for it"
good,Merchandising Supervisor was allowed to sit in stock room and watch everyone around her unload the truck. I was hired to be the Human Resources Supervisor and was changed to Operations Supervisor within 6 mos. This apparently was common practice and had occurred multiple times before I was hired.
good,"This is a great job for someone just getting into the workforce, but not a job for much potential moving forward. The management could use some upkeep in the way the company is run. The best part of the job is helping the guests who come in."
good,Working here has its ups and downs like any other job. But when management does not match with the flow of the store than everything is off.The staff if personalities are normal can be cool to work with.
good,Worked with great people for the most part.  Company has lost its concern for its employees. low pay high stress working conditions.  the stores are under staffed which makes it difficult to get work done and give great customer service and management doesn't care.
good,"I liked the environment and my coworkers but it was just the management that made me dislike my job. They'd never make Thinks clear and just send you on your own to survive basically. My first day on the job, with my bare minimum retail skills worked a 14hr shift because apparently majority of the employees called off and since I Was Already there I had to stay. I Sat In clearance and organised clothing for about 8hrs and worked register the rest."
good,"Don't get me wrong i enjoy every moment with our customers and reactions from young carless children but we don't get recognized nor do we get paid enough for our hard work. Management so worried about going over labor hours which leads to not enough help in studio. Hours based on sales average but we don't get commission  ..."
good,I have been at J.C. Penney's for almost 3 years and love my co-workers but don't really have a passion for the work. I am trained in the Medical Field and need to return.
good,"I've been with penny's as a stylist for almost 2 years now and the receptionist makes more than I do, and I went to school!!! It's very discouraging sometimes because they don't want to build you as. Stylist they just want you to make 8.00$ an hour and give you like 20 hours. It's nearly impossible to make commission. You can do a great job on something and not get any money from it. I'm an adult and my passion is hair but they are making me loose my passion by paying me so poorly. Although we do have a great manager, it's just hard to make any kind of money. Other than the money situation I love working there, it's a great environment."
good,"Overall the workplace environment was unwelcoming and unenjoyable. Management was incompetent, and was unopen to criticism from other store executives and new ideas from employees."
good,"A typical day is really boring. The tasks are very repetitive. Would not recommend working here unless you enjoy doing the same thing everyday. Management is good, everyone is nice and willing to help you with anything you need."
good,"This job was okay, Management was not all that great. Overall I enjoyed working with other associates. Always something to do, never bored. Can't really complain about this job."
good,There is a lot of micromanaging. For me i did more duties than what was even close to my job description as a receptionist. As a stylist they lead you on about how much they will help you.
good,Was laid off at JC Penney. company is really down sizing. not a good company to work for. alot of turn over. my manager was good but it was out of his hands.
good,"Advancement is hard and the pay and hours were not good enough to support all of my finances. Management was okay. A lot of the supervisors from the various departments purposefully defied the OM and were unprofessional with each other. Coworkers were great and I enjoyed my time while I was there, but it just isn't a good job to have if you need to make more than $400 per pay period."
good,"It was ok but i was talked to like i was stupid especially when i asked a question, this was my first job so i was unsure of everything. However if you have expirence in retail i think you would fit in well here."
good,Productive workplace friendly atmosphere.  Most managers pleasant to work with. All associates are friendly and pleasant to work with. Are flexible with schedules. Are expected to have a minimum of credit cards applications processed per week
good,"In a typical work day we where under staffed, but it taught me how to multitask,the management was under a lot of stress, the workplace culture was friendly, the hardest part of the job was when the systems would upgrade, and what i liked the most about my job was interacting with the customer."
good,It was a good job to have while l was in school.  The pay is not that great but it is acceptable for the work that you would do. There is high turnover and this job is better suited for young adults and anyone looking to make some extra money working part time.
good,"Warehouse work, decent schedules. pay could be a little better for the amount of work. But it works with your life schedules."
good,I sold shoes part time. while we were on commission it was great because I earned my paycheck.  turnover was horrible. say goodbye to your weekends and holidays because of blackout dates.
good,"A good place to work, as long as you dont have kids or go to school, they wont work around your kids schedule or your school schedule. Only if your management, they will, good luck getting someone to train you or find someone in the store"
good,"So, I totally loved working at my store considering I had amazing coworkers in my department and shoes department was never slow and kept me moving. It sadly had its downfall because the managers and leads push you to open JCPenney credit cards, at LEAST four times a shift. A few four hour shifts I worked I was told by three people above me to push for more credit. I did all I could but if people don't want credit cards I cant force them. Times that I did open credit, management would be super happy but tell you to open more and that they now knew you could do it... It really made me feel like I warn valued as an employee but more so looked at as a number helping the store meet their goals."
good,"I only worked here for a short time because my position was seasonal. While I was here, no managers bothered to learn my name. No help was there when you needed them, most co-workers did what they wanted and not what they needed to do. I basically felt like I worked an entire three-floor store by myself. The hardest part of the job was not being able to get help when you needed it. The most enjoyable part was the discount that we got."
good,Provided exceptional customer service. Completing each transaction in a quick and efficient manner. Preparing  merchandise for display and implementing all visual merchandising standards. Helping customers try on or fit merchandise and assisting customers with purchase decisions. Assisting in physical inventory counts. Making sure every customer is greeted.
good,Retails has its ups and downs because of the non work-life balance. Being in retail causes a lot of away time from your family because it is not your average 9-5 job.
good,It's a nice environment created by your co-workers. You basically go around all day helping customers in your department. Management is pretty lenient. The hardest part is waking up in the morning and going to work. It's just the same thing every day. Pretty boring.
good,"Theres no where to advance really in pay or career opportunities. "
good,"Too long ago to remember, i have nothing else to say for crying out loud i do NOT dwell on past BAD experiences that does not apply to my passion or teaching skills,."
good,"Most of the times, if you are seasonal they will take advantage of you."
good,The salon is pretty relaxed and a good steady place to start. Unfortunately the salon isn't a major priority of the store.
good,the company doesnt care about their associates. they dont give enough hours they dont care about seniority.bI have been at jcpenney for a year and now for no reason they have given someone else from the floor my schedule
good,"It was a seasonal job my expectations are not very high. A decent environment. Heavy season of the year. Gives a very good idea about the company policies at the time of hiring."
good,"The customers are nice, they tip decently. The problem comes in when you're going home 2 hours early or coming in 2 hours late because its slow. If you don't make commission and your hours are getting cut, good luck paying bills if you're a single parent such as myself. The company is a nice company to work for overall but be careful working in the salon if you're coming in without clientele especially if you have responsibilities."
good,"JCP was a good place to work, this was a part-time job. So if you need to make some extra cash this is the company. Management was excellent."
good,"I worked here for many years. I loved this job at one point. But I didn't have job security towards the end so I had left. I did love the co workers, I miss them the most. I knew all areas in the warehouse. I just wasn't in love with the one that was my actual position. Tried to relocate and the way the business is set up now its almost impossible to change positions."
good,"started my first retail job at JCPenney, was a fun experience. Gained knowledge and great customer service, However did not provide enough hours to maintain."
good,"Im not a person of negatives, but Working at JCPenney was not the best experience because of solely the management. I do not believe that JCPenney is bad company as a whole but store where i was employed didn't leave the best impression on me."
good,"Working at jc penny's was very challenging , but fun and productive . The managers are terrible at their jobs but you always had that one that did the job right ! I enjoyed working with great people , meeting new people and helping others"
good,"A typical day at work, no matter what department an associate works in, centers around making customers feel welcomed to the store, so keep the store neat and clean, keep displays neat and aesthetically pleasing and be warm and welcoming to all customers, as well as answering all customer questions to the best of your ability and assisting customers finding specific items."
good,the hours are not flexible enough for students. There is not enough pay for the amount of time you work and the amount of work you do for the company.
good,Need To Take Workers Thoughts In Hand And Not Be So Hard And Rude Be More Helpful And Consider Customer Matters! Other Than That Great Sales Associates And Love Helping People
good,I worked as a Sales Associate for JC Penney in the women's shoe department. We would decorate the displays and mannequins for any upcoming holidays or events.
good,"While we employees pride ourselves in quality customer service, the company overall is not so pleasing. Too many online orders gone wrong via the manufacturers, having to deal with hostile coworkers even after talking to multiple managers that they are a problem and yet not getting listened to. Managers who task the sales associates with more than what our job really is, examples being we sell off the floor and help out customers but also end up have to restock merchandise, fix our own signs which is definitely something we aren't ment to do, and set up displays which again isn't part of our actual job descriptions. Most of us work part time now, benifits are getting taken away from full time employees and sometimes part associates work longer hours for a lot less pay just to save the company money. And sometimes breaks are forgotten by managers because they sit in the back and just talk on their phone instead of covering the floor."
good,Jcpenny was a great place to build a a stylist on your skills and clients. the benefits and pay was horrible. Customers took advantage of the rules just to get over. management does not defend stylist.
good,"This salon might work for you. If you are located in a high traffic area this might also work well, if not then good luck."
good,"Looking to pay for college or at least books for college, this place is great.  Had wonderful bosses.  And the community that shopped there was amazing."
good,"For the time that I worked at JCP, it did not take long for me to realize that this was not the place I felt I could advance in, or would continue to work for long-term. From my experience, if you had a personal relationship with staff, some employees were granted extra attention/opportunity for advancement. If you were only there to work, you were looked at differently, if looked at at all. The schedule most of the time didn't fit with what was going on outside of work/couldn't get fixed. Most areas of the store were usually not tidy, but weren't kept after by employees. Access to help requests for a customer often went unanswered, and assistance calls weren't responded to in a timely manner."
good,The company seems to slow each year more and more. Management is not there to help build the company as it should be. Co-workers come and go frequently not enough clients to keep stylist at the job.
good,"I learned to deal with a lot of angry customers, leaned to listen and have a lot of patience. Very fun place to work, get to meet new people every day and help them out with their fashion, put together some of your favorite pieces as well as theirs and watch it become something they really love and be super happy!"
good,keep to yourself just picking orders. Making sure your always on time. Other than the machines running its quiet. Good thing is we are able to listen to music.
good,"Was one of my first ""big girl jobs"" adapted around my busy school schedule well and offered a competitve pay compared to others."
good,"Worked in Womens dept. was typical to have to work Juniors, Misses, Womens, and Plus which meant having to manage up to 16 fitting rooms at once, and walk across the entire building to go back and forth. Manager at Johnsburg, IL store is extremely unprofessional, and doesn't show any leadership towards employees and very clicky with department managers. After the previous manager left, she also jipped me out of the raise that I was supposed to have gotten at the recommendation of the previous manager."
good,"In the beginning the typical work day was busy and interesting but in the last 3-4 years I was there it was hard. Hard in the fact the company wanted the associates to care about them and the customers but they didn't care about the associates. Management  wasn't approchable. Moral was the lowest I'd ever seen in any place I've ever worked. And it, moral, starts at the top. I'd go to other JC PENNEY stores when I'd go out of town and the moral was the same in those stores as it was in the store I worked in. You could tell who were the ""pets"" and who weren't. ""Pets"" could do what ever they wanted. I worked with some great people and what kept me there for longer than I should have was those great people. Turning in my resignation was one of the hardest things I've ever done but by far it was the best thing I've ever done for me."
good,"typical day at work, co workers were lazy yet did my part through out the day so well my manger would leave me in my area to conduct my sales alone through out the night without assigning anymore employees to my department."
good,"A Typical day is mainly at the register as well as making sure the department looks nice. Supervisors are good at working with employees and treat everyone the same. Management, not so much. Some can be rude if they don't like you. They are also unfair and don't treat everyone the same. Most coworkers are great but there are a few that will make you dislike working there because they slack off a lot and put all the work on you. There is nothing hard about this job besides meeting your goal for the moth of credit apps. Most enjoyable is the friendships that you build with coworkers."
good,"You have to have patients working with different personalities but management is less to be desired. If your looking to grow with this retail company you might want to start off in management,"
good,"if you work normal 8-5 hours, you'll never get ahead. you need to work 10-12 hours a day to have anyone feel like you're doing a good job."
good,"I worked there for a little over two years. I worked in the children's department. They would only schedule one person to close the whole children's department purses and lingerie. They expected much more out of the children's staff than somewhere else in the store like juniors and we often had to stay later and go in early to help them put away carts/clean their fitting rooms ect. I understand sometimes it gets busy but the reason they didn't have their stuff done was because they were screwing around. Management still gave all of the raises to that department. I got one 22 cent raise when I was there they couldn't even round it to 25 cents lol making a total of 8.22 and I'm a hard worker my bosses would ask me to stay later than my eight hour shift almost every night. There was another person who the bosses did not like that got hired after me and she even got sent home before for not doing her work when she was a closer and they gave her 3 raises and she was making 9.50. That just wasn't right. Management also has unreasonable expectations. I got the most ICAPS (credit card apps) in the department but there were some days I would work four to eleven and there would literally be one customer the whole night and they already had a credit card but management doesn't consider the reason why places with more traffic and more expensive items get more icaps. "
good,It started out good but then went downhill when HR started to avoid me. I wanted to stay past the season but it didnt work out. They all seem nice but I feel that HR doesnt really care about its employees.I would work there again if they werent semi rude.
good,"a lot of work involved in running a retail store.  much more work involved than one would expect.  very physical."
good,"Typical day consist of helping costumes, ringing up their merchandise and organization."
good,I would not recommend this job to anyone.The company totally went against their own guidelines and harassed me during my time of bereavement. I was never given the correct hours that complied with the hours of my childcare.
good,A typical day involved checking in motel guests and doing office duties.  The best part of the day was interacting with different people from all over.
good,"This company was OK to work for, Business very slow at times and you were only given a few hours a week unless a special event was approaching, the growth potential is very slow. What I enjoyed most about this Company was working for the Christmas holidays."
good,Working for JC Penney was very challenging for me. I was able to enhance my world class customer service expertise. I loved my co workers.I gained more retail knowledge than ever.
good,"Answering phones and scheduling appointments everyday, management could be better, co workers are a joy to be around,"
good,"JCPenney was like my second family. It is a family oriented team environment. Fast paced and always changing. "
good,"Typical day is slow, learned how to use devices to assist customers, management isn't much helpful, co-workers has on and off days, hardest part of the job is to convince customers to join credit with JCP, lastly, most enjoyable part is restocking shoes."
good,"I truly believe that JCPenny as a company needs to improve their management.  I felt as if I was always completing everyone else projects on top of mine.  This job really helped me with my customer service skills, time management and etc."
good,"JCPenney is a good place to work if you are single, a college student, someone looking for a second or part time job, or even if its your first job. Associates are friendly and work well together. Management works well around your personal schedule. For the most part, hours are flexible."
good,"Even though this was my second job, most people that were there before me had only had this job as their very first. This job works well as a first job because it shows you how customers and people can truly be in the real world. My managers when I started the first year were amazing role models and all around cared for everyone. The good thing about this job is the co-workers are easy to get along with, you truly develop relationships. This job is not difficult at all, or at least I thought. I enjoy talking to all of the customers who would come in and happily start speaking about their day!"
good,"A typical day at work was folding clothes and assisting people in finding clothes, management was not very good, my co workers were okay, the hardest part was closing cause they wanted everything PERFECT."
good,"depending on which division you. are work in, you may be able to advance, great opportunities for new fashion graduates."
good,"Company had pretty decent benefits, work atmosphere was decent though a little childish and silly with paper decor that reminds me of a kindergarten classroom."
good,"•	The work environment is always friendly"
good,"Hardest part of the job is the extreme employee turnover/morale that diminishes overall productivity of the store and makes for stressful times for the employees that do care"
good,"There is room for a lot of improvement with the associates, management and competitive wages when it comes to other companies."
good,I enjoined the expertness the job gave me. Although it was not something i enjoyed doing like I do design and working with computers.
good,"low pay, low hours, not a stable job, constantly get moved around or asked to do what someone else above you should be doing. Under scheduling for shifts so stressful on other employees. Employees that slack are not punished but good employees are."
good,"Work life balance not good, Work culture not motivating, politics , new ideas not welcome, outsourcing, management does not care about employees"
good,"Worked with diverse type of products in quality assurance, interact with different type of cultures as the job required traveling to different places and countries."
good,"slow,good stylists need to advertise the salon they have training, management doesn't communicate correctly, the people are great, getting clients in, doing hair creative"
good,"I enjoyed working as a sales associate. Co-workers were all very enjoyable to work with. Most of management were good to work with, however one boss in particular thought it was her lot in life to bully me. The company benefits were very nice, loved the discounts."
good,"While I worked for JCPenny's my mornings would start by checking if there were any sales that needed to be staged for the upcoming days. Then I would proceed with my team to setting any sales/clearance or RTV's that needed to be done for that day. We each were in charge of signing 2 departments each. While with JCPenny I was able to increase my typing speed as well as learn what it takes to manage a team.. which me and a fellow employee took charge for a short time while our manager was out for surgery. We completed all RTV's, time management for the days and also the schedule. I also learned that to be a good manager you need know all the regulations in your division as well as listening to your employees. Also that positive feedback goes a long way when trying to get through to an individual. I learned this from my experience with some of the management there.. I had experienced unbiased scheduling and favoritism as well as having lack of knowledge of certain processes. There were also managers there that were prime examples.. great brainstormers, hard working and exceptionally knowledgeable beyond there departments. They were admirable. The most enjoyable part of my job I have to say was the schedule, the physical aspect of it and the people. The people were some of my best friends and working with them and being on my feet all day made the longest days go fast. The hardest part of my job was when big sales overlapped the clearance, RTV and price change due dates. Overall I had a great experience"
good,"Always more more work to do than there is time for. "
good,"I enjoyed being employed with JcPenney, mainly because I loved working with the customers. I always provided my best customer service."
good,Learned the call center environment and how to multitask through about 10 open programs open at once on the computer. My co-workers were fun to work with and helpful when there was questions that I had.
good,"Working at jc penny's was an ""EPIC FAIL"" the lady that was training me only showed up one day and the next day she had me waiting there over three hours to be trained and I never got trained I went to the manager she wasn't there, went to one of her co-workers and she wasn't there so there was practically no hope from that job and my car broke down away so I had to quit due to lack of transportation but I have transportation now ."
good,A typical day started with you ringing out customers and putting back merchandise they returned. I learned how to deal with difficult people in a better way. The management was very good at solving the customer's problems in a timely manner. Most of my co-workers were rude or mean. No one really liked anyone who worked their. The hardest part of my job was the days I had to work the register alone  when it was busy. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet all the new people everyday.
good,"The management at JCPenney was the worse kind I met. I was forced to do jobs that were not in my job description and they would not listen to helpful suggestions. The management at JCPenney also pushed their workers to far. One instance, this coworker of mine was pregnant and she had to do the same heavy lifting as the rest of us. She was 30-35 weeks when I noticed."
good,Helping customer find what they needed in a timely fashion. I learned how to identify the clothing so when to customers came in the store I knew what they wanted and could help them effectively.
good,"Walked in on a daily basis reviewed my goals for the day and began with answering customer calls and returning customer calls with merchandise and concerns about the customer service and staff."
good,"At JCPenney, I loved my coworkers but micromanagement was very evident. No room for advancement no matter how skilled one is. The store is very customer service driven, so I did get to obtain skills in that area that I would have otherwise not had."
good,I did not enjoy working for this company. I never made enough money with the way they split the sales and services performed. The salon was also not  busy enough to support all the hairdressers they had on staff. Many hairdressers were fired for not meeting a certain quota.
good,majority of day is spent walking around finding something to do not a very exciting work place
good,"A day to day schedule in JCPenney included communicating with customers, describing benefits of the store, and giving information on merchandise products. At JCPenney, the most important knowledge I gained was the use of an RFID Scanner. It allowed me to understand its purpose, uses, and how to use it. It's a state of the art technology that reduces workload by a lot and increases work efficiency tenfold. Management was adequate due to the number of employees that resigned due to poor management skills. Co-workers were an good role model to follow because of their amazing professionalism, politeness, and generally fun attitude that put a smile on everyone's face. The most difficult portion of the job was mostly cleaning up the mess that most customers intentionally left behind for unknown reasons. However, the day was not as bad because there would always be co-workers who would help out when days are tough and make it easier to go through the day."
good,work day consist of mostly labeling there was not many meetings and discussions
good,cash register customer service online orders store recovery cleanup and presentation. Pricing visual and opening and closing duties.
good,"I think that JcPenney is excellent for the college student fresh out of high school. They provide flexible work schedules. A typical work day can consists of ""go backs"" and maintaining the fitting rooms. The management team is very welcoming to new hires and makes the training process comfortable and easy. All of the co workers i work with really pitched in to help guide me to learning about the company. The hardest part was learning the 'technical names to each of the clothing items.(which i learned). The thing i loved about the job was the fact that it was constant customer service and i could be really active and involved with the company as well."
good,unlikely to advance to a higher position. Don't receive benefits or raises.
good,Sales and excellent for first job experience. Learned sales and how to read programs from corporate.
good,management needs to improve on how they treat employees. Overall it is a good experience.
good,"Fold clothes, ring people up, answer questions, clock out."
good,Excellent staff and the company has great prices. I worked with a wonderful manager who was also my mentor
good,"A typical day at work would be helping customers on finding merchandise or ordering something we don't have in the store. Taking a customers payment, helping them with their credit card if they had questions. Also ringing up customers while cleaning and organizing the clothes. Talking with co-workers about what needed to be done, also discussed our plan of action for the day. The hardest part some time was having a long line and I was the only one on the floor. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping my customers with everything and anything they needed help with."
good,"A normal day at Jcpenney consist of coming in at least 10 minute early because of the hectic parking, security check in and the lengthy walk through the warehouse. After the basic clocking in and pulling up all programs the day is really rather simple. Taking incoming calls dealing with whatever the customer on the other end of your line needs may be. Rather that's placing an order, tracking a package or transferring a call. Handling this in a timely yet respectable fashion. Overall Jcepenney is a great company as long as you can remain on the head people in charge good side. Seniority weight is used a lot by management and they will remind you of your roll often. The attendance is VERY uptight leaving no room for slacking. The co-workers are pretty normal compared to any call center job ( if you've worked call center you understand that description). The work it self is more then simple. The hardest part of the job as would be with any is the mix of confusion between management and lack of communication."
good,"Was a great place to work until the company started going under. The store that I was at will be closing soon so it was a great time to be let go.  I got let go unfairly and fought and won my unemployment, management was unfair at this store"
good,"see attached"
good,"Developed and trained direct reports to create an inviting customer experience. To develop customer relations for life. Trained reports to meet daily sales goals and levers, such as credit."
good,"Sold J C Penny merchandise, Catalog orders and processed credit application"
good,This company has changed over the years. Lots of discrimination and unfair practices.
good,"At this job, there is way too much emphasis on getting credit apps, and what few raises they give, they seem to be exclusively based on how many apps you get. Raises are way too little and VERY far between, and not based on merit. There also seems to be a huge disconnect between the employees (and what is feasible during their work hours) and what management wants accomplished in a day. (e.g. sorting through and organizing an entire section of shoes, keep the sales floor looking decent, as well as the fitting rooms, and checking out customers every few minutes because the entire store is shortstaffed, all in 6 hours)"
good,"A typical day is basically cleaning up after people.I've learned time management skills, however, management has really changed making it harder in the work place. I am constantly stressed. I love my co-workers and thats probably the main reason I'm there. hardest part of my job is being able to keep all tables clean simultaneously. Best part is being able to interact with fun and enjoyable people."
good,"Hardest part of my job is dealing with management and co-workers who show favoritism and lack motivation to readily assist a customer."
good,JCP is a good company to buy merchandise from. Great prices and quality.
good,"i'm a young guy that enjoys my personal time and work time twice as much. Working here i was surrounded with anti social coworkers that were 2x older than i am. I've learned that in a clothing dept. store you have to always be alert for people trying to ""jip"" the store for their merchandise."
good,"I once worked with a team at jcp that were like family. Its as if some of them had a no man left behind policy. And then there were some who just weren't like that at all. While there I have worked with different managers. Some would roll up their sleeves and help out, while others just didn't have that type of attitude. Some were understanding and human, which made you want to give more to the company through your work and availability. Some make you want to hit the door thirty minutes before quitting time. Some coworkers at the very least smiled at you or spoke, while others just give you a funny look. Working there is overall okay. As long as you maintain a positive attitude and stick with other good workers, then you and your sanity should be okay."
good,It is a nice place to work. Very friendly associates. I enjoyed it until I had unexpected medical difficulties and management did not keep their word in helping me like they said they would.
good,"JC Penney  was a learning experience. I would go in and find out what my job or jobs was for the day. I would start my jobs, and sometimes they would transfer me to somewhere else, depending on what changed that day. My  co-workers for the most part was easy  to work with.The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the customers. The hardest part of my job was the managers did not know what  the other manager had already told me to do."
good,"I enjoy my coworkers but my managers not so much. The job in itself isn't bad, its the way its managed and your talked to. Its all about what you make of it."
good,"Waiting on customers"
good,"I've learned a lot working at JcPenney, how to handle escalated issues with customers.  Not everyone can handle upset customers"
good,"JCPenney is a great company to work for if you are looking to be holiday help or temporary. If you are a regular part time/full time worker, you will not receive the same treatment as if you were temporary. The Co-workers were great, i made many friends. Management is a joke. The job is hard when you have 4 different people in charge telling you to do a hundred different things, refusing to help you. The easiest and most enjoyable part of the job is the pleasant customers."
good,"sales was a main part of the job"
good,"Nice store to work in, just needs better Leadership. To many Chiefs and not enough Indians. Always felt like I had to watch my back. No teamwork."
good,"Definitely brought me out of my shell being comfortable behind the chair. Been there and haven't taken one class not much education available. My management was a hit or miss when the manager was there she was great! and half the time she wasn't so that means we got to do what we wanted most of the time. Co-workers are great especially the ones that have been doing hair for long periods of time always willing to help you out. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning again why I went to beauty school. The one thing that wasn't great was the clientele the salon brought in, most of them were there for the coupons and you never see them again."
good,Have enjoyed most of my time here but ready for a change after 21 1/2 years
good,"Open store; process prior day's sales business; prepare tills for the day's business; plan selling floor associates assignments; process daily payroll; engage, coach & develop all associates."
good,The hardest part of the job is selling credit cards to customers. The management constantly harasses us about selling credit and threatening what few hours we do have if we do not meet the goal for the day. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the customer interaction. I love helping the customers and seeing the smiles on their faces when I help them find what they are looking for.
good,JC Penney is an American institution but they need to listen better to their employees.  The company is struggling and for good reason their communication is lacking which hinders execution and success
good,"Upper management should all be replaced. They forget about the loyal associates that made them the company they are, or I should say were<"
good,Top level management was terrific; hours were perfect; coworkers were supportive and helpful with training.  Helping people purchase special jewelry items and answering questions/customer service very enjoyable.
good,"It is very monotonous and tedious. overall, it is decent. the pay was miniumum, and not very satisfying."
good,"I worked in the men's department for about eight months. My manager was understanding and efficient. I was on the cash register most of the time and the other times helping my associates clean up the store. In Jewelry, on the other hand, I learned more of one on one time with each individual customer. I politely greet them and ask them if there is anything specific they are looking for. I assist them in picking out the perfect gift for themselves or that special someone. This job was a good learning experience for my future career in business."
good,JC Penney's taught me how to work in a retail environment and how to provide the best customer service to customers. Working in such a big store resulted in little communication with the management which lead to few advancement opportunities.
good,"A very uncertain work environment. Very unorganized, I would not recommend working there."
good,"working at penney's for 13,yrs the hardest part of the job was watching the co-workers loose confidence in the store. Management had their hands tied on the appreciation of the associates, such as thank-you lunches, etc. The morale is now very low. Learning at penney's was hands on and associates are more than happy to help one another. My experience of a typical day was usually taking on more than the job described. The supervisors are well under paid. The most enjoyable part of the job was pleasing the customer."
good,A typical day I cashiered and helped customers. I liked the job but felt un-appreciated by my boss.
good,"I enjoyed my job at Sephora, however, I was asked to do something, and against my better judgment did what was asked of me. As a result, I was under a week suspension while the company reviewed my actions and interviewed fellow co-workers, I was then terminated along with my manager who had told me to do what I did.  My biggest complaint is that the company was dishonest and as a result I lost my job that I enjoyed."
good,"Customer contact is an enjoyable experience, usually pleasent. Management will not address serious issues between employees. There are rules and regulations to handle all issues. Co-workers are pleasent and hard working to ensure customers are taken care of in a  professional manner. Most enjoyable part is customer service."
good,"•	Lead a support team to accomplish various floor plan and display objectives"
good,"A typical day would include the following: process customer sales and returns, place orders for out of stock merchandise, put out stock, do markdowns, straighten/clean displayed merchandise, clean out fitting rooms and return merchandise back to correct departments."
good,At JC Penney's you help customers with anything they ask for or about. You check them out in a timely fashion and provide them with great customer service. I learned how to treat customers even when they are rude and upset with the company. I learned how to turn a customers bad day into a good day. The managers are really helpful as well as the coworkers. The hardest part of my job was working in another department I knew nothing about.The things I enjoyed most about this job was being able to help people find exactly what they want and when they didn't know what they wanted.
good,Most days I have the opportunity to make sure that customers leave the store happy and satisfied.
good,"I did not like working at JC Penney's at the Brea Mall.  I liked the people I worked with and some of the supervisors, but I did not like much else.  The main thing that I did not like about working there was there was no loyalty.  It seemed as if I was unappreciated as time went on and they would keep hiring new people."
good,"A typical day at work is basically talking with customers, helping them find the product of their needs. Everyday i learn something new whether its with a new system they put in or a new strategy with customer service. The management is okay, and the co workers are also. I rarely find anything hard about this job. The most enjoyable part is seeing the customers happy. "
good,"Starting off at work, i'd come in a get right to work, great with retailing, when finished i stay after plenty of times to make sure things are the way its suppose to be, and that its the way its suppose to remain until the next morning. I've learned how to deal with people better, i learned how to do consultations with the customers/clients, of their likings, i learned independence, how to respect people although most of the times they don't respect others.; i work well with other people i do not know, i fit right in, i do as asked of my managers, supervisors, and head chiefs, i love working with co-works, they teach me new and improved things. i follow all rules, i'm very out going, bubbly , i'm very trustworthy, i smile all the time, even though things aren't great, i walk into work with a go for it attitude, personal environment and issues are left at the door when i enter. ; hardest part of the job would be, accepting new changes, as far as different times having to work as well as getting used to new managers that you may be used to working with. ; most enjoyable part of the job would be whenever i receive a raise, or when i get compliments on my work ethic,"
good,It did not pay much but I learned some valuable skills. I learned how to deal with customers in a friendly professional way. I learned how to use computers. I learned how to offer a store that's prices always matched the ads and sale signs.
good,the basics can be learned here. associates are very friendly but most will not want to do their own jobs
good,I learned a job I never did before and became the top person in it. There wasn't a hard part to my job. Learning was easy to me. I enjoy helping people decorate there home and business and the end result was a big smile on their face. Management(no comment)
good,it was easy job. as long as you do your job mangement dont bother you
good,"I worked at JC penny while I was still in high school. They worked great with my schedule but I was hired on for the Christmas season only, I loved the dress code at JC penny. I got to go to work in a suit and tie. It made me feel like I was important to the company even though I was so young."
good,this was just a seasonal job so I had no idea how day-to-day business ran.
good,good work place. good team. gave time off when needed. work with your schedule.
good,A typical day consist of constant customer service. Making sure your work environment is neat and precised. Lastly use of the cash register. The hardest part of the job is the fact that it sometime interferes with my schooling. 
good,"Meeting with your lead person, going over what has to be done for the day. Being able to work well with each other to help one another out in finishing the task. When trucks come in to unload and unpack shipment quickly to get it out to the floor. If prices or signs have to be done, to make sure they are correct for the up coming sales. Being able to help the customers find what they are looking for and if we don't have it available on the floor we make sure we are able to locate  the item or order it. "
good,I learned how to use big fryers and i also learned how to work the cash register and count my drawr.
good,slow and boring
good,"I learned patience & alot about the retail industry. I helped customers feel good about shopping. I worked in the kids and plus size area so I would clean 2 fitting rooms, manage the floor and assist customers the best way I could."
good,"Customer service is number one with JCP. You start your day greeting and serving customers they are your priority. I loved working on the sales floor with customers and associates. Opportunities are found while working the sales floor. JCP has some great associates working for them. Management is supportive of decisions that need to be made and changes that need to be done in the units. The hardest part of the job is really running out of time in a day. It is fun working the the associates and helping customers. I enjoyed working the floor, unloading the truck, putting the clothes on the sales floor and watching them sell. I loved every part of JCP. I spent 30 years learning every aspect of the job from cashier, to store manager and everything in between and respect the associates that have to do those tasks. I love a customer service company."
good,"This was a difficult job for me because the only requirement I had was cleaning dressing rooms, putting clothes back on rack, issuing credit cards & was a cashier when needed."
good,✓ Change prices
good,This was my first job in high school. It was perfect. Managers were a joke though
good,"Its a typical retail job, I had to leave because I was a single parent and this job didn't work well with my life as a single parent."
good,unload merchandise from trucks is how most of my day is spent and anything else needed from me. management was a bit rude most people feel the same way. hardest part was to be over worked for 7.50 per hr unherd of to me for ah dock worker most enjoyable part of the job was the co workers
good,Typical retail job. Good working hours. Great relationship with co-workers. But lacking professionalism by management.
good,I enjoyed working with the public. Unfortunately the pay was not acceptable.
good,i would schedule appointments and take pics oof diffrent customers
good,It was a very completive salon. I'm an older stylist and was a little difficult working with younger stylist. I had a good work station and enjoyed the discounts the stylist received.
good,"I had fun working there, and thought I would be there permanently, but they laid me off after a month and told me I had only been a temp(when I was hired as permanent)"
good,"Management was sometimes helpful but not always there, Also the co workers that I had did not really want to do their own work so it ended up with me doing it all most of the time."
good,I worked very hard for this company. I started at a pay rate of 9.25 an hour and got a raise to 10.25 in a two year period. I received a plaque for employee of the month and 9 service awards.
good,It has been several years since I was employed at this company. I left to pursue other options that became available to me at the time. The thing I found most enjoyable here were the patrons.
good,Not only was this job stressful but the management didn't care about their associates.
good,4 Hours 5 Days a Week Employee Where Nice Job Was Plesent Customers Sure Can Make a Mess
good,You're a slave to JCP. It's a degrading job. Not enough staff and too much responsibilities. It's the most underpaid store job out there.
good,"My only problem with this employer is is not knowing how many hours a week I would be scheduled. That is the downside of working in the retail industry.However, being a person who needs to plan her budget closely, it does make it difficult."
good,"I really liked working in the store, but my coworkers, weren't very motivated to do anything but complain. They should be greatful to have a job now days."
good,I enjoy working with our team. I am in a position to grow because the education pennys provide.
good,"I enjoyed working there, but they only hire as part time employees. You can't get full time hours with benefits unless you advance to a management position. This leaves you unsure about how many hours your going to have on your next paycheck."
good,"Overall, a nice place to work! Neat and clean workplace. Friendly employees."
good,In the midst of a transformation right now; trying to move from the old environment to new. Hopefully that will eliminate the chaos and lack of proper planning.
good,Great place to work. But there is no advance ment in the company. I am a hardworking individual that will give all my best to the company.
good,I enjoyed working with the customers; floor design displays; solving problems and demonstrating learned skills from the retailer's prospective and buyer's prospective.
good,"I worked in sales. Basically, the typical day was fast paced. I learned how to rearrange floor plans, sizing and colorizing clothes and work with the pricing team. Management was fair, but did violate ethical work practices. My co workers were very friendly. The hardest part of the job was hanging the objects up to advertise, because I am 5'2, and I would have to get on a tall ladder and post these objects with little or no help. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,"Prepped the store for opening. ( cash office applications,scheduling)."
good,"A typical day at JCPenney would start at 8:30 a.m., in which I would be responsible for the cash count/opening of all jewelry registers, displaying jewelry in appropriate show cases according to plan-o-gram, and straighten all merchandise on floor, and restocking as needed, before opening of store. Help customers with selection and purchase of jewelry. Take in repairs & document, and then send to proper vendor."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Jcpenney is the wonderful people you help along the way.
good,"Don't mind working there for extra money in my pockets. But, Managements are not really motivated. When managements are not motivated, it makes you as the associate less motivated as well."
good,Management was horrible. Co-workers were nice people. It was a fast pace workplace.
good,"A decent job, customers friendly, exceptional co-workers, good management."
good,a basic day at work would be organinzing clothes an taking clothing out of the stock room . I learned how to understand others. The hardest part about working was the distance.
good,"A typical work day included the assistance of customers in the store or via telephone, cleaning of work facilities and working on the cash register.I learned about marketing and design, by working in JcPenny. My managers and co-workers were considerate and professional.There were no difficulties, for me, at this job.The most enjoyable part of this job was assisting the customers."
good,"The hardest part of the job was the back to school sale. the co workers were very nice, I learned that customers are always right. The most enjoyable part of the day to me was the rush time, i loved being busy it makes the work day go buy so much faster."
good,"A typical day at work was either taking things off or putting them on the truck. Or Putting Price tags on Clothes, Opening Boxes see if they Have Tags on Them. Unload 4,000 boxes in an hour"
good,"Great commitment for little pay. No benefits, but great work for students."
good,Typical day at JCPENNY was very busy. Dealing with frieght customers and management projects kept you pretty busy! I really liked doing the visual part of projects. It got my idea of a great look on the walls and it screamed me all over it!
good,"JCPenney was a great job for high school students and individuals looking to make a little extra part-time cash. Management, however, was under-qualified, and stricken with a power complex. Most employees were unhappy while at work."
good,"I think the store is a great store, we have very good products much cheaper than others. The store is going thru alot of changes but in the long run it will be good. We just don't get alot of hours. I am a single older person. I need job security, They can't promise you hours."
good,I enjoyed working for JCPenney for 18 years. At times it was a great place to work. The company has undergone many changes which eliminated many jobs.
good,its ok but the hours and compensation arent good. lots of changes
good,"Managers do not care about employees, not enough pay or hours and disrespectful customers"
good,I would recommend this company only if you have a second job. They pay minimum wage and they told me that I would receive commission as a hairstylist but it all averaged out to be minimum wage. I worked for this company for almost 3 years and could barely pay my bills. But the great thing about this place is I met some great clients that was willing to follow me into my own beauty salon.
good,"The only think that bothered me was the number of items we as were suppose to try to push on the customers at checkout;magazine subscriptions, rewards, emails, and store credit cards. Your hours depend on it..otherwise your schedule will get butchered."
good,"Busy days involved always being productive and always moving around. Interesting new work experience. Managers there were nice, but they weren't always around when you needed them only because the workplace was huge."
good,Working there was not hard at all but at times I did not feel welcomed. Some employees were rude and nasty. At times it could get really busy but overall it was a nice experience working there.
good,Need to encourage and promote diversity.  Need better wages and benefits.  Lack of working hours.  The job needs more clear tasks and responsibilities.
good,"No respect at all; some people are very abusive, good worker’s aren’t appreciated. For college students would be an ok job. Under staff all the time, favoritism"
good,Easy job cash people out and recover by folding and putting things where they belong. Management was hard to get in contact with. High turn over rate. Most enjoyable part of the job was the discount you receive off purchases
good,Good job and was a decent pay for seasonal although cut hours towards the end of seasonal holiday but the savings you can get towards working there through employee discounts are not bad.
good,"They were extremely unorganized, the managers barely knew what was going on. The job had good hours and a lot of them, which was the best thing about being employed there."
good,Pretty easy but very credit based if you are not selling credit you are not gonna last long. They drive credit and sales that's the most important thing there
good,Working at JCPenney was never a career move for me. I went there with the intent to earn a bit of money while developing my customer service skills. I made a few friends while working for this company and the management was pretty fair and understanding.
good,I love jcp. Its a good place to work. Management is kind. Stick to yourself and everything will be fine. Work environment is pleasant.  Stay busy answer all questions.
good,"At first, I was excited about working in JCPenney, for it was my first job. Little did I know it was going to be very bad... For starters, the store is massive! And as such, one would expect that the store would have enough employees to cover a section each... That was not the case. The amount of staff for the size of the store was ridiculous! The entire store had to be fixed, bottom and top floor, by 8 or 9 people at most. Add to the fact that associates had the tendency to drag new associates to their gossip, leading to problems within employees. It was disastrous, to say the least. Add to the fact that they did not heed my scheduling needs! I specifically told them that I was a student, and as such, I couldn't work the morning shifts. I check my schedule, and to my surprise, I was scheduled to work from 11:00 am to 4:00 pm... Hours I explicitly told them I was not available for. Then I would get called in the middle of class to ask if I was going in that day. It was horrible, and I only worked there for a month or two at most."
good,Great company for benefits and discounts. The management is all for self. Advancing within company is hard to obtain. Supervisors are rude and not properly trained.
good,Not to much to say about JC It wasn't what I liked very much.was not to interested in.thanks for nothing I'm all set with that company good bye to you
good,Working at this company had its ups and downs. Coworkers were friendly and the managers were amazing. I spent most of my time stocking and cleaning and on register
good,"Worked in recovery.  Fixing messed shelves and returning clothes to racks.  Dept manager was truly stuck on themselves for one thing.  Didn't help with floor questions.  Finished my section to find coworkers went behind me and messed it up again so I I looked bad.  Grow up people, this isn't high school!  Quit next day."
good,"The job was alright, not too bad not"
good,JcPenny is a good environment to work in if you enjoy working in a fast paced and busy setting. I enjoyed the company employee discount on merchandise. But they really need to organize their teams and departments with good managers to help lead their team.
good,Management positions are always changing so you get new supervisors and a new person doing your schedule every time you turn around. A new manager shoves credit down your throat making it a priority that you get people to apply for the JCPenney credit card and dismisses the topic of customer service at all. So many new people being hired that every time you go into a shift you don't know any of the people you are working with. They are flexible with hours so it was a good first job for that. But they do require you to work thanksgiving and black Friday NO EXCEPTIONS! So if you are a minor and want to have dinner with your family on Thanksgiving JCPenney will not allow it. There is no advancement opportunities really unless you are out of college (or around that age) with customer service experience. No regular associates are full-time so you get no more than 39 hours a week. Pay is not worth the work I put in.
good,"It is a good place to get started when learning retail. There is a lack of advancement and meaningful wage increases. "
good,"The management team is extremely lazy, And uneducated in their departments. Never any help around. And if you call a manage be prepared to be yelled at like a child in front of customers.always waiting till the exact last minute to get things done. And when they don't it's never on their poor planning it's on that the employees weren't working hard or fast enough. Besides theanagement the co workers are great"
good,"The second in command of the store told me I didn’t know how to do my job, asked if I was even trained properly, and I didn’t follow directions. Every other co worker in store including the actual store manager (first in command) knew I excelled at my job. Only get $9 and you don’t qualify for the raise until you work there AFTER the year mark"
good,"This was my first job, so I didn’t know what I was doing. I was only offered one day of training, then thrown out to the sharks. Unfortunately, the sharks were Black Friday shoppers. If I was properly trained, this would have been an amazing place to continue working. After the holidays, my hours were cut DRAMATICALLY."
good,JcPenney used to be a great place to work; however in recent years the store has taken a nose dive.  Management can be heard arguing from the back offices and seldom gets along.  Schedule is inconsistent with management denying school availability and changing schedules without 24 hour notice.  Growth is near impossible as titles are made up and stripped without warning.  Many of the younger associates have tendencies to stand around on their cell phones while on the job.  Registers and fitting rooms are rarely cleaned.  Overall moral around the store has dropped and it is reflected in nearly every facet of the store. Feel if things do not change the store will close.
good,When your on the merchandise team your job is to make sure people can see the clothes and shop. But when you have yourself and 3 other people and 3 registers with returns and 3 fitting rooms full of clothes to put back on the floor you main job is to just put clothes away. You barely could fold the store and keep it clean because the fitting rooms got full within an hour. And management was angry and would talk down to you and  make you feel awful.
good,I worked at jcp for over a year. They are not very transparent at all. I came in and did my job and when I put in notice that I was leaving they let me go. It doesn’t matter if you work hard and do the right thing here. You can half way do your job and keep it. They do not reward hard workers here.
good,"Management was awful. They do not know how to do anything or how to treat customers with customer service. There was always people stealing and they did absolutely nothing about it. Schedule 9 days in a row at times. Do not know their extended hours so they don’t have anyone scheduled for those times, then have to beg you to stay late."
good,"Jcpenney is very competitive. Fast paced, but if dedicated enough you can make management, plus full time hours. Friendly, not so helpful at time. I suggest you have some kind of experience of retail if you want to work at JCPenney."
good,"I loved my managers but was not happy with the store manager at the time"
good,"Overall it's an easy job, though it gets very stressful during peak times. Upper management is not the best, but most of the hourly associates are great people who are fun to work with. Being short-staffed is a constant problem. I would say the hardest part of the job for me is doing my absolute best and getting no recognition or appreciation for it. Pay is pretty poor for the amount of work many employees do. My coworkers made work not just bearable but fun most days. The best part about retail is getting to work with some amazing people."
good,My training could have been so much better. never really trained. Managers are not serious enough for where we work. To much messing an screwing around. Workers need to be more supervised. But I love the brand and stuff we sell.
good,"The pay isn't the greatest for the work load they have you do. They sometimes don't give people any breaks, can gave very poor scheduling with not that many people scheduled, leaving lines long."
good,"Starting off I loved working here, I looked forward going to work and had so much fun doing it. Even now looking back I would still consider it to be my favorite job (if we are strictly talking about the job itself and not the management). Unfortunately some of the managers were not good. 99% of the managers were amazing and I absolutely loved them! However, unfortunately that 1% caused me to reach my breaking point and quit, this 1% was extremely rude, abused her power and was notorious for playing favorites. I am one of the most respectful and hard working employees and would never think to disrespect anyone especially my managers, which is why I was so surprised to be treated this way by a “leader”. It still saddens me to this day that this was the case because I absolutely loved this job but once this situation started effecting my everyday work and my emotional state, I decided it was my time to leave."
good,You can only grow so far in the company before its time to move on....if you want more! Wish they had more positions to grow in the beauty world for people who have a lot of knowledge to share.
good,"JCPenney's was a friendly organized workplace.  Most workers worked hard, though there were a few that didn't care at all.  Management was not really looking at friendliness or helpfulness for giving out raises, only at those that got the most credit cards opened."
good,"Jcpennys was a great work place, it was a good environment. Easy job once you understand everything you are responsible for. One manager was a consistent problem for multiple people, the issue was taken care of."
good,I enjoy this company because everyday it was something different to see and do.. I've learn about the different products that they offered as well as understanding how to sell them to the community
good,"It's like being in high school working at JC Penney. The management is touch and go, it just depends on who is there. Closing shifts sucked during holidays because we would get stuck there until 2am, just cleaning the store. I loved that the store had to be cleaned before leaving, but when everyone doesn't pull their own weight, it makes it impossible. While working in the men's department for a short period of time, I was sexually harassed by the customers often. No one did a thing about it."
good,They don’t care about you just what and how much they can get out of you! I love helping people is the only plus because they have me a platform to do that although it seems they fight you all the way.
good,The supervisors there need management classes. They can sometimes treat the employees like garbage. There’s a lot of great people and talent working there. If they would just utilize the potential they have now.
good,"This was a fun place to work but there is a lot of favoritism and it really gets in the way of fair treatment. The discount was very good, and came in handy when I moved out"
good,"Company consistently changed job structure, lessening jobs available but adding more work to existing employees without pay compensation. Not sure about all locations, but the one I worked in wouldn’t dare give OT, no matter how much it was needed to better a department."
good,I enjoyed working at JC Penney very nice people worked with great help in beginning of running register which had no prior experience. It was a relaxed job in home department. I changed to children's department towards end of working here. This job was temporary as to what do next preferably in my field of study from school.
good,"The biggest problem they have is poor management. Which causes confusion and makes basic projects hard, but I can say that you do learn valuable skills."
good,"Just like any Job, this one has its ups and its downs. Management was terrible and coworkers often didn't pull their side of the work load but it wasn't always terrible. I made some great friends at work!"
good,"There is no work life balance just work, work, work. You work mandatory OT almost all the time especially if you're crossed trained in other departments, management hate their jobs, you have to pick up the slack for others when they call off. It's constant walking and bending a lot of workers have had surgery at some point from working here."
good,"I often feel like I can't do enough for the ghost of James Cash Penney and that he rolls over in his grave from the continual disappointment. There's really nothing I can't do, but I have to prove it to management that only got where they are by shutting down people that reach up like me. I like working with my co-workers fairly often but any little thing can get blown out of proportion and turn into a drama item. They pick things to be mad about because they can't keep up with the demands of the people above them, who just seem to neg the middle management into results. It's not a great place to work. Hard pass."
good,"Typical retail work environment. Managers push for higher sales, the good ones work along side you and then there’s the ones who talk the walk. High turnover rates for most sales associate positions."
good,JcPenney is a good part time job. I've learned quite a bit in my time with the company. The work environment is pleasant and I enjoy the benefits that come with being an employee.
good,Regardless of your hard work. Unless you sell lots of credit cards. Your treated disrespect fully no room for advancment. Just a job.  Manage ment does not care
good,"Everyone there is great! You make friends instantly. Downside, management is very terrible. Recently someone worked there for 4 years and we got a brand new PO and this PO reported this worker of 4 years that she was giving too much discounts. The thing is we need a managers approval to give the discount and this worker was not a manager. And the PO reported her to number 1 and suggested she should be fired. Number 1 knew this worker all the 4 years and never had a problem with her, but yet took up the suggestion and fired her on the spot. I would just be careful working for this company, the job itself is not all bad. But the management is very awful."
good,"Working at jcpenny,it has made me learn to interact better with people getting to know people,by helping them if they need help.It is great working at jcp"
good,"I love working here, but it's mainly because I have an awesome team. The management has attitude problems and there's also a lot of nepotism. The structure of the store does nothing to support the fitting room, in which case the fitting room attendant has too many tasks to do any work effectively, let alone get customers to sign up for credit cards which they want everyone to sign up for. They also don't follow State regulations for breaks so nobody takes accurate breaks if it's not on the clock."
good,The problem with the store I worked for was decent. Most of the issues are with management. I believe that the store needs a new manager. The store lost a great employee when they let me go but things happen for a reason.
good,"I worked her part time and it was one of my first jobs. I was first a sales associate but the constant verbal harassment of customers made me switch to working on pricing and stock. That was a much better fit for me, but the management heavily favored those on their team that they had relationships with outside of work, and did not make the other employees feel welcome."
good,"I usually start out the day checking emails, and seeing if there are any estimates for repairs on fine jewelry and watches. Collect and send out defects. Check in new fine jewelry, repairs, and  special orders. Transport all new jewelry and repairs to the floor so the staff can work on them. Go and check in fashion jewelry, and have it prepared to be put out on the floor. Complete any new sets that have to be done. Scan merchandise to clearance and closeouts. make sure that during downtime all associates remain busy and productive. Assist in selling to customers including all jewelry purchases, protection plans, selling store credit card, returns, exchanges, and  special orders. Answer all questions from customers and associates. Help to train and coach associates. Assist in associate evaluations.Supervisor duties throughout the store."
good,"Managers have favorites. Overwork. Low on employees. No opportunity to advance. Pay is low, $9/hr. Although, it was flexible for students in high school or college."
good,"I worked for JCP in total more than 20 years. I met a lot of great people and learned a lot, but times change and management doesn't always get it right. Too bad they don't listen to the people that actually do the work."
good,"A typical day at work includes folding clothes,checking dressing rooms, ringing up customers ,and putting clothes back.It is a laid back area with not too much to do."
good,"I loved working at JCPenney, loved my coworkers and the customers. But, it was very stressful, there was a lot of expectations from associates no matter how hard you worked. Overall, a good place to work if your manager is a good one."
good,"The workers themselves were enjoyable. However, management was okay, scheduling was awful, they were hardly flexible considering school circumstances. It was very slow all of the time, got pretty boring."
good,Supervisors don’t care about their employees. Turn over rate for employment is high. Its hard to keep people because you could be force to work 13days straight and 10hours day them the next week you could be lucky to do 20hours a week
good,"Management loyalty was not graded upon skills and experience for the most part instead management and promotion was entirely dependent on ""personal opinions'."
good,Not a horrible place to work.  A typical day is normally pretty busy and you don't get much time to just stand around.  The pay I need thought was very fair and not very good at giving raises.
good,"Good beginning job. However pending on the time of year, favoritism is there and hours are limited. You can bust your butt off and never once get told you’re appreciated or promoted. Overworked for the salary. However management is like family. Wouldn’t want to work there forever and feel like stronger policy’s need to be enforced when it comes to background checks and thief prevention."
good,Working there was a good job even though it was a seasonal position... I was able to communicate with many people everyday I put back and folded/hung clothes
good,"If you like taking pictures and want to improve your knowledge of studio equipment and photo sales jargon, you'll definitely get that experience here. But be wary of the holiday season; working from 8am ~ 8pm every weekend in late November and early-mid December will make you lose your mind, especially if you're already in school during the week. Managers vary depending on location so it's pure luck whether you get an amazing, understanding manager or a nagging, scolding manager. The work environment is crazy with 15 minutes in between each available appointment on the busiest days and only 10 minutes available in the camera room. You have to be creative with your photos and take the required poses and zoom-ins in such a short amount of time. I decided not to continue because, even though taking pictures is my strongest passion and what I want my primary job to be, working there slowly made me unwilling and nervous to take pictures."
good,"The higher you get in the company the more time you spend in meetings and doing very little else. Which means that if you are a Staff Accountant or lower you get the grunt of work thrown your way."
good,Was a fun time at the beginning but then turned out to be much more stressful than paid for. Flexibility is not very good. Working most holidays and holidays hours are horrible.
good,"We had to get customers to apply for JCPenney Credit Cards and that is very difficult to do. When you would get a credit app, the incentive was an extra $2 that would be added to your check unless the managers would tell you to grab a snack from the snack basket. Most times we didn't have any coupons to give customers just for trying (applying and not being approved). The hardest part of the job was getting credit applications and being in the department by yourself on busy days. I loved seeing my regular customers and being able to see how they are doing."
good,"The JCPenney in Lebanon, NH was a pleasure to work for. The managers made the work environment fun and they were easy to talk to. The departments were clean and easy to access."
good,"A good first job, a good seasonal job during the holidays. Competitive pay. A job to get experience in customer service. Register and folding clothes is a big part of the job."
good,I worked seasonal but it was not a good enough pay I also had to work on thanksgiving and Christmas. the lines can and will get out of control and you have to get a certain amount of people to sign up for a jcp card i don't really understand why we have to get more then your employees.
good,"Working in the Human Resources department is where I learned the importance of interactiing with high level executives, maintaining confidential matters and strong communication skills."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.  co-workers, supervisors and customers.  It was my happy place.  When i could help a customer find what they needed, it was extremely gratifying."
good,The job was a great job. But for some reason some of the managers were very rude. Their were many times were people were not treated as they should be. To me when working at a job everyone should be treated fairly.
good,It was a fun after school job.  We did stay 2 hours after closing to straighten up the store. Trying to get customers to open up Jcp cards was a nightmare. It seems to be a unrealistic number. Some people don’t mind hounding customers to opens a card but that shouldn’t be the goal.
good,"First time doing retail so the experience is greatly appreciated.  The supervisors and managers are easy to talk to, you can go to them when you have a problem or need help with something"
good,"learned skills to do my job, got training on new product, flexible hours, great team, great employee discount, hard to really make a living based on pay"
good,At the time I was working here the main managers kept getting fired management wasn’t any good they cut a lot hours leaving employees and some managers to look for a different job . This was 2 years ago
good,"I've worked here for over a year and its fluctuated on how they would treat employees. There a few select managers that are very nice and have respect for everybody, others since they are above they just demand."
good,I didn't enjoy working here. I was an emerging leader intern and this just isn't the type of career for me. I wasn't good at it nor was I truly interested in the role.
good,"Responsibilities:"
good,"I was promoted twice. Was responsible for hiring,training and was familiar with every area in the store. Helped Associates with returns or problems. Cash handling experience. Markdowns and Merchandising and Recovery"
good,"I'm sure management varies by location. Most of the managers where I was at were disinterested, and unfriendly. Did not take scheduling issues into consideration."
good,"Average day was putting clothes back that customers tried on. And occasionally going to the registers during our busier times in the day. Fixing racks, picking up and folding clothes. Helping customers find a cute outfit. Maybe check the back for something advertised. Put in online orders for a customer or check if a nearby location had it to put it on hold. "
good,Lack of supervision. Many times had to work department alone even when busy. Sometimes missed lunch or breaks because of lack of coverage. Stayed late to help clean up in other departments. Were called into work on day's off because of lack of coverage.
good,I enjoyed working with the people at jcp. They allowed for the work environment to be very productive and engaging. I look forward to working for a company like jcp
good,I completely enjoyed working for my last department manager. He was very helpful in training his staff. It was a part-time position as the upper management said I had to be let go with the holiday help. After that the company let go of most of the department managers. I can say that working with different people has always been a joy but then there are those people who you would rather not work with.
good,"If you like getting out two hours after your shift, keep it. If you like unfair supervisors, keep it. You'll be doing most of the work if you're not a certain skin color."
good,"The job itself is fine if you're looking for something that offers a few hours. The work schedule can be extremely flexible. If your looking for something that is full time, this is not the job for you."
good,"Jcpenney is a retail that I recommend work if you are starting a new job, managers are not well trained and complain more then the customers, they help you but in the same time put you down because you did not know how to handle the situation."
good,"as a photographer a typical day at work would be going in clocking in and getting right to work. Checking customers in and getting them through as fast as possible without making it seem as they are being rushed, as well as getting great photos. We also have to edit the pictures that need editing and create some collages that we think the customer would like. All of this within fifteen minutes."
good,"The environment was great, but management was not they abused power. They work you full time and over but don’t give you benidits they tell you that they don’t have full time positions, but they will work you like a dog. They have you share your register log in with the new hires in training and blame you if the register came up short."
good,"Dedicated employees working under unknown shifts, days and hours per week.  Management a little lax in duties but never overbearing or looking over your shoulder.  Most enjoyable part, working with customers with all different characteristics.  Hardest part of my job was not knowing from week to week what my schedule was, what days I would be working or how many hours per shift I would be working."
good,"When I first started working at JCPenny last year they rewarded credit applications with a cash bonus, we were encouraged to help customers get the most for their money (""get their penny's worth""), staffing levels were adequate, and associates were empowered to correct pricing errors on their own authority. I liked working there because even though it was retail and I made minimum wage, I felt JCPenny respected both their customers and employees."
good,You must be willing to adapt to change often. Due to the company ups and downs you never know what the day will bring. My best advice will be for you to be open minded and flexible. the management set the tone for the store.
good,"Weak team of supervisors, scheduling is a mess, new hire season is where longtime employees hours go to die, hard work is hardly ever rewarded other than ""great job"" maybe, favoritism is strong between the manager and supervisors and supervisors and associates."
good,"Cleaning up the floor, putting out close on floor. working registers, hoping people find what they  was looking for. working in cash room giving out money."
good,I loved this job but the hours were too early in the morning or too late at night for me to have a solid sleeping schedule or keep up with the rest of my life.
good,"This job was alright I liked the wages but everything is unorganized including the hours ,the dress code was unclear"
good,This was a fast paced environment. They did treat all to lunch and breakfast often. The hours were limited. The workers seemed frustrated by the environment and lack of hours.
good,"The managers of the specific branch I work for rush everything,shame you for not being fast enough,and cannot keep a single person around for more than two weeks."
good,"JCPenney can be a very nice place to work out, but do to lack of management and a change in the system of workers title changes it has left workers confused with a lack of hours. The company continues to hires and takes away hours from workers who have been there longer, which is very sad."
good,I learned a lot by knowing what needs to be put in each section. I learned how to handle customers in an appropriate manner. I also liked the people that worked there.
good,"The typical work day is folding clothes, picking up clothes, checking out customers, and asking them if they need a credit card. Manage ment can sometimes be a pain, in that they aren't understanding, but there are a few that can comprehend your humanity."
good,the managers don't care about productivity unless theyre getting in trouble by the company supervisors that come in at random and  thats when everything is the employees fault (task team) the task team is the most underappreciated team in the company and they do all of the work. the cashiers are the laziest and literally dont do anything and dont know anything about the products all they have to do is sale the jcpenny credit cards.
good,I like working with all my coworkers they try to make Work a fun place to be .. love all of my customers that always come in so that I can help them fine what they need it make my job a better place to work ..
good,I had to work in the back when I wanted to work as a cashier. Cashiers get opportunities to get a raise by interacting with customers but I never got that because i as put in the back.
good,"A typical day at work here would consist of trying to cleaning up a messy store, while also trying to check out customers on the register."
good,"I love that I can move around and not be stuck to the desk, most of the time. However, the workload isn't balanced with the pay. I work 3 jobs for the pay of 1. Management is pretty easy to deal with as long as you do your work and completed all your tasks."
good,extremely busy around holidays or when their were special sales. working at jcpenney I pretty much stayed busy their was something to do unless their was a football or basketball game on a Sunday.  also important that you got along with co workers and worked as a team together
good,"Temporary job, management changed during the time multiple times. Management did not communicate with other departments but trained us to work within those other departments."
good,"Working at JCPenney is stressful. Work/life balance is horrible, unless you force yourself to balance it. The expectation is that you are there working all the time and forget about your outside life commitments. The company's direction is not great, and they expect you to do more with less. There is never enough payroll to staff the building correctly or efficiently. Customers are always rude and angry, and their complaints stem from long lines, not enough staff if the building to help, and a messy store. These are all problems that would be solved by having more people working, if we could hire more, pay better, or create a work environment that was desirable for people to work in."
good,All the employees work as a team assisting one another. It was a healthy environment everyone got along with each other. The hardest part of the job was standing on your feet for hours.
good,"The managers at the time were not trained for their posting. The Human Resources person did not what they were doing and were not  cooperative, would not accept day off requests and was rude to employees and customers. Duties and responsibilities of a manger were pushed on to underaged employees. It was hard to get promoted and get a raise. All of the sales associates were fantastic to work with, very kind and accepting. It was very easy to get shifts at times, but hard to get rid of shifts. Because of this position I learned how to make someone feel worthy and feel like someone cared about their opinion. There were some very loyal and very kind customers I got to serve often and your occasional tricky customer. It was very rewarding to learn to hold your tounge in stressful and upsetting situations."
good,I good boss is key to a good job! I work in the Men's Department and do very well with sales. But I learned that if you change a department and like it they will take it away.
good,"Not the best company to work for if you're looking for a work-life balance. Great compensation and bonuses, when you work hard in upper management. Corporate isn't giving stores enough budget to even staff your store properly!"
good,It's a good job but you need to have a lot of patience if you are going to be a photographer for a family company like this one otherwise you'll go crazy.
good,Normal day was me working on the clothes from the truck. Sorting all of them getting them ready to be put out on the floor. After working on the truck I would go to the floor so I could sign the tables and racks for our daily sales.
good,"Fun first job, had a great time working with nice people and making new friends while gaining working experience as a high school junior. A solid first job."
good,I worked with the morning team. I assisted in the unloading of trucks and quickly moving the merchandise to the floor. Very little organization so it was hard to merchandise properly. A friendly environment save for the people I worked with directly.
good,"Low pay for the very physical work required. They were usually many days short handed. Was a great store and wonderful discounts. No room for growth. "
good,"The supervisors were not always professional. There was a lot of gossiping among the leaders which led to work drama. Sometimes you can get along with the leaders but not always. If there is a line of people waiting to be checked out, they would call someone else instead of jumping in and helping. The supervisors spent a lot of time sitting in the back gossiping instead of helping out on the floor. If you were friends with the supervisors then you didn't have to complete your job every shift. You could leave your department a mess and not get in trouble for it. The key to working here was becoming friends with the leader that day as well as other employees. You have to be careful with what you say and who you say it to. If you work a 6 hour shift you would only get 1 15 minutes break, however there were many other employees that would take over a 30 minute break. They would schedule you when you have class and it would be up to you to find someone to cover for you. They would also change your schedule without telling you."
good,"J C Penney is an average retail job. cashiering, product placement, restocking, and organizing. A process or procedure will be implemented only to become obsolete or forgotten a few weeks later."
good,the hours are extremely flexible for people who are still attending school. good job for people beginning to join work force. only problems are not enough hours during the slower season and not enough associates to work on a daily bases.
good,The management team at JCPenney was not the best. They asked a lot without any praise and were stealing from the company. But it was a great job until I found Banner Health
good,Jcpenny is a good company. I just don’t feel as though it’s as good anymore. There’s no place to move up nor do we get raises. This is a company that will hire someone off the street before promoting someone who knows the job and what it takes to get thing done
good,"typical work day would be helping at register to lower lines while maintaining the floor and register clean and tidy. Most enjoyable part is helping people find what they want and see them leave happy and with a smile, the hardest part is when customers misread signs and take out their anger on cashier."
good,"I loved working for this company almost worked for them for two whole years. The only bad thing was that I would rarely get hours, working 4-6 hour shifts 2-4 days a week. I enjoyed the people I was able to work with but management was not always the best."
good,CEO and Senior Leadership have great intentions and are on the right track. This is a company that could make a huge turn around. However it was my experience that their message doesn't truly resonate down to the field leadership. District & Regional level managers are operating in a way that deviates from the message at the top.
good,The job was stressful. It was also too demanding. It was hard to execute the idea of a supervisor when they are not specific and do not show you what they have in mind but still expect you to know exactly what they want and how they want it done.
good,Jcp is a good place to work.. I enjoy working with the people that I work with. I have met some pretty amazing people in JCPENNY. I have made that emotional connectivity with a lot of them. My passion is customer service.
good,I just folded clothes in the department and tried to look as busy as I could so my day would go by faster. It is a good job if you are young and getting a job for the first time.
good,"Relax and friendly, all about the numbers and quotes, sell, they stand by thier products will accepts just about all exchanges and returns. use coupons"
good,"I had high hopes for my career at JCP when I first started.  I LOVED the company and all of the people (started at a store in another state).  I wanted nothing more than to advance and retire within the company.  Fast forward a few years and a move to my current state - transferred stores, then promoted to a third store.  The manager at that third location killed my love for the company.  He treated me so poorly that I got sick on my way to work every day.  That is not a healthy working environment."
good,"It was interesting to work here. It could be fun depending on who were the managers for the day/night shift(s) and if there was some type of event going on for the store. It would get frustrating when you would start doing one thing the way you were told to do it and then a different manager would come around and tell you that you weren't doing the task correctly or when a manager doesn't know exactly what to do, so I feel like there was a lack of communication at times between the managers and then also with the employees. It gets frustrating at times because again, depending on the manager, they push you to almost force a customer into signing up for a credit card, even when they say no. One of the managers that currently works at the location likes to talk down to employees and customers and belittle them, so if you do apply for the location, beaware. Overall though, most of the staff is pretty chill and fun to work with and it usually is a fun environment to work in. They provide food during certain holidays and events and the dress code is business casual, so you don't have to worry about buying uniforms"
good,"great environment to learn and gain basic experiences "
good,I got hired on for seasonal and it was okay to start until all the other people who were hired on with me quit and i got stuck working ridiculously long hours with hardly any days off and it only got worse as black Friday approached. there were only 3 people in my department and management did not seem to care so I decided to leave.
good,I was excited to start there only to find out that a lot of the employees hated the job. It was a high paced job and they jumped me all over the store with no appreciation. After about six months I went from getting full time hours to getting four hours a week.
good,at first working there was fun and I enjoyed it.After being there for a few months I noticed a recurring problem of certain employees slacking off and managers doing nothing got frustrating very quickly.
good,Really a VERY fast paced environment to work in. If you like the challenges of retail you will love it with this company. Very challenging environment to work in.
good,"Working at JCPenney was fun at the beginning, I started during the Christmas season and even though it was stressful because it was so busy the associates kept each other up. Management doesn't talk to the associates at all and then you get punished for not knowing."
good,"The company is not concerned about the employees well being at all (we had a employee get threatened physically by a customer on Black Friday and instead of asking the customer to leave the employee was asked to, then they fired him the next day when he did not even retaliate). Our latest store manager mocks employees to their face and gossips with other managers constantly. Other store managers will be rude for no reason towards employees as well. They do provide store potlucks regularly but I think personal treatment is more important than receive treats around a holiday. Starting pay for associates on the sales floor is good for kids in high school. They will promote employees to MA frequently because of turn over."
good,"Typically, I was responsible for setting appliance displays, pricing and recruiting new appliance experts. I learned how to lead new inexperienced associates and how to resolve numerous customer service issues that were not my fault. Management knew very little about appliances and their was a disconnect from the corporate goals. The workplace was hectic with ""hair on fire"" management. The ambiguity from management was the hardest part and the long commute. The comradery was the best part."
good,"This place is great for a secondary job. Otherwise, you need to look somewhere else for more hours. Employees are regularly dropped to very low hours, even during the holidays I was getting about 8 hours a week (2 days). Co-workers are generally respectful. I've appreciated that managers typically ask questions before accusing their employees of faults. Like most retail workplaces, there is some gossip issues with certain ""cliques"" that can create problems. The workforce is generally younger (college-aged students)."
good,Worked in a fast pace environment.  Worked with provider.  Sold glasses.  Worked with lab for patients Rx for correct prescription on glasses.  Balanced money at the end of the business day.
good,Its really a great job qbecause at the time i worked there i was young and it was alot of younger people working there. Good work atmosphere. I liked that job.
good,Woring there is not as fun as it seems. Working part time does not provide many hours and the managers are not very good at answering bac phonecalls about hours.
good,I worked as a stylist for jcpenney for one year. As a licensed cosmetologist I feel that the starting rate should be a minimum of $9.00 hr. Great products.
good,"JCPenney was an alright first job. I enjoyed my coworkers and management was alright. Unfortunately, hours were way too inconsistent and we'd often be short staffed."
good,"management does not always participate as part of the team, the store is messy due to not enough hours to schedule proper staff, not enough hand held equipment to be proficient"
good,"I had a great time working in JCPenney. The people there were incredibly helpful and taught me how to use the register, they always helped me when I had questions, and I would definitely recommend working there, it was a great first job."
good,"Training of new hires for registers and sales. Worked on sales floor as a supervisor, provided customer assistance when needed. Provided instruction to sales associates on sales floor as needed."
good,"typical day working registers, learn to trained employees. Management hardly seen, workplace slow at times.hardest was inventory, Enjoyable was christmas"
good,"A typical day at JCPenny began with opening registers, clearing fitting rooms, providing customer service, and checking out customers. I learned how stressful a retail environment can be. The management was great at first then began to seem somewhat unfriendly and wouldn't comply with schedules and work times needed."
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is if you like busy work and enjoy staying busy there are a lot of projects that you can assist with. Managers like to see that you are busy and take initiative.
good,"When it comes to the work environment at JCP, it can differ per quarter of the the year. Usually the first 2 quarters consist of recovering from the holidays and so the work load can extra occasionally on weekends. When it comes to the holidays, the work load can double much of the time. When it comes to management its been more organized recently but leadership can be lacking in some of the newer leaders on the floor. The hardest part of the job is keeping the floor clean while giving customer service since both are expected in an efficient pace. It can be fun though when you have co workers you can communicate easily with or happy customers."
good,"It was decent until the home store closed, the mall location was horrible. Pay was fine for a low end job, and the managers were nice but its not like they actually control anything."
good,"There are many opportunities to move up however many positions are temporary such as HR, recruiting, and training. Others are able to become permanent such as supervisor, corporate customer relations, chat, level 2 customer service. "
good,JC Penney was pretty slow all when I worked there. I always thought they were going to end up going out of business. The only time it was busy was on Black Friday.
good,"Typical day of work was basically cleaning the whole store by yourself, management was a joke, due to the lack of leadership from the store manager himself."
good,Work is good and steady paced. My coworkers are helpful and for the most part enjoyable to be around. I love being a cosmetologist and this company has given me and environment that is conducive to the work that I do.
good,would not reccomend trying to make a career out of this job. it can be fun but also stressful most of the time. closing shifts are the worst because you have to still till everything is all cleaned up and organized perfectly again.
good,Courteous Staff and willing to assist with clients helping and finding item they need or to provide options for various packages they need in the photo department.
good,"Day consisted of all Areas of Cosmetology. Hair cutting, coloring, perms, eyebrows, ear piercing, pedicure, nails. Booked appointments for the salon and answered the phone as needed. Must sell retail hair supplies."
good,"fun place to work but sometimes stressful and lack of hours and NO OVERTIME. great people to work with , loved working with them , sometimes management in the store was clueless/lazy"
good,management is fairly friendly but pay is low and very seasonal work hours. not ideal for longtime work. I have a learned a lot through customer interaction and that part of the job is nice. there is no place for advancement unless you want management positions or you have a degree in business management.
good,I worked in JCP salon at wiregrass. It was cut throat all the time. Being at the front desk you were getting screamed at by clients all the time. Management come out and blame you for the reason of the client so upset. When reality was the turn over rate was so HIGH the clients were tired of seeing new faces.
good,Ok to work for. They will work around your schedule if you are attending school or working another job. Would still be there if they hadn't closed down.
good,I loved the people that I worked with. The job wasn’t hard as long as we all worked together. Great discount. Good environment. Loved the regular customers. The store manager however was never there and when he was he never helped. He is a gossip and likes to hire his friends and gave the rest of us less hours because of it. I honestly don’t know how he still works there.
good,"The hardest part of the job are the hours at the store level. Although flexible and great for parents with school age children, if this is your only source of income, you lose every time. This is typical retail pay. At this store advancement is based on who likes you and what previous managers may have said to current managers about you. Other associates are great to work with and are willing to help wherever needed. Minimal training for the job. Not hard work but can be very stressful with time restraints."
good,"The first couple weeks were fun, but then they really started to get on me about not selling JCP credit cards and they told me it would start taking a tole on how many hours I worked.  I asked almost every customer and they still didn't think I tried hard enough.  They also are not very appreciative for anything that I did for them."
good,Corporate culture is fair with a heavy focus on diversity which is great.  Leadership has recently changed with a heavy focus on growing revenue in new categories.  Difficult to gauge long term viability of the organization with brick and mortar dying.
good,"I learned how to do online orders, cashier, and close register. The culture there is good as well. Everybody is all smiling, laughing, and taking care of business."
good,"The company decides to close store down , but do not allow you time to seek new employment before hand because they continue to change date with out notifying you. "
good,My job was to capture memorable moments in the lives of the guests that visited the studio. We were to create stories for the guests and sell albums and any additional perks we offered.
good,"This job shows a lot of favoritism. Although you may work extremely hard, there is not much room to move up if you are not a favorite with certain people. The position that you do move to are not an increase in pay, it is just an increase in stress. The coworkers are amazing but management needs some work."
good,"I gained a lot of experience in customer service and sales and also learned a lot dealing with the back of the house and the support side of things. It was a great first job. I loved being able to help out people, that was most enjoyable for me. I am leaving because I have outgrown it. They have become unprofessional and I want something with more stability as I start college and move out on my own. The company never has any hours to give the workers but still expects all the work to be done in half the time."
good,I clearly am giving review for call center not the retail store. I was advised the call center in Carmichael Ca. was closing down and if i were to move Arizona i would have a job. I loved my job there as a catalogue order taker.It ended way too soon.
good,My manager was wonderful and I had a great team however the company uts self was very money hungry and would continue to dump more duties and responsibilities on our group with no pay increase or incentives because they wanted to Elimonste jobs
good,"The company itself offers great benefits to employees. The environment is very relaxed. The job is often times very dangerous, stressful, and complicated. There is not a lot of room for growth as the management team does not properly train anyone. It often feels as though no one has a clue what they're doing. The job takes more than what it gives."
good,I was the salon coordinator. I basically ran the entire salon! It was a very fast paced environment and was cut throat at times. I didnt make a good hourly wage or have any benefits but I did make a good commission off of the products that I sold. Unfortunately JCPenney had to shut down this position due to company wide downsizing.
good,"Working at Jcpenny helped me a lot as far as talking with customers and keeping a great attitude. A typical day at work was stocking and cleaning the floor, talking with customers and really creating a relationship with your customers. The stressful part about working there is people are extremely rude but If you just keep smiling and do exactly as you were trained to do then it should be okay. The best part about working there is the discount and the ability to grow."
good,"* my job was challenging"
good,I'd recommend  a job at JC Penney for anyone looking for a job while in school or in between jobs. The job requires you to stand on your feet all day long so I wouldn't recommend it for someone with health problems.
good,"The only perks were break room coffee and a community cabinet of snacks."
good,JCPenney is okay for a starting job but I would definitely not recommend for someone to stay there. The pay isn’t nearly high enough and there’s hardly ever any chance for advancement. The only way you would get a promotion or pay raise is if they really need you to stay or if a manager or supervisor gets fired.
good,Production base job. I learned how to work hard and not have time for my children. Management had their picks but it did not stop me from doing my job. The culture was very poor. The hardest part of the job was not a continuous work flow unless it was peak season. The most enjoyable part of the job was you had your own workstation and you were on your own to produce.
good,"Working at JCPenny was a good experience. But as a retailer, there are goals that you have to set a goal for yourself in trying to convince customer to open up a JCPenny credit card. Within that first month you have to get to the goal they set for you or at less your own goal. And when you don't get to those goals they would keep on bothering you to get customer to open one. When they don't even understands that some customers already have one or just doesn't want one."
good,"I worked in the salon. The girls were nice to your face but as soon as you left, they talked bad about you, including the manager. The only reason I stayed as long as I did was because of the money. I made good money, but I left every shift hating my job. I was constantly being cursed at by customers and told of all of the things I did wrong. I honestly don't know why they had my position, it wasn't needed and the girls made sure I knew that."
good,"Corporate's expectations are too high. They need to pick what they want more, clean stores or customer service. There's not enough people to cover the floor, ring people out at the register and keep up easily with go-backs. Forget about speciality associates having time to do their jobs either."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty moderately paced. Come in early to check clients on my book make sure there weren't any cancellations if there was fill the open time slots with clients wanting appointments that called the day of/before and left messages. Then I'd prepare the products I need and set up for my first client to get a good head start on the day just in case there were walk ins. Our busiest days were Friday and Saturday. Those were the days I had to be most prepared for a hectic schedule. I had to master time management to be able to take walk ins and deal with over lapping appointments. My first manager was a nice person and good at her job for the most part she struggled to get certain products we needed to fulfill a service but some of that had to do with the orders not properly going through in the system because of out dated software, or so we were told. The hardest part of the job was resolving client complaints but it was always satisfying to dispute the problems and accommodate clients when needed. The most enjoyable part were some of the people I came across and the experience of multitasking and understanding the ins and outs of that particular part of Cosmetology."
good,"The work itself was easy and simple. However, customers where I worked as well as management were stressful. My coworkers were pretty fun to work with but the loss prevention staff was very rude and often tried to find reasons to get sales floor associates in trouble."
good,My general work day consisted of walking around with clothes to the right destination and helping customers.  A couple times I was cashiering since I was bilingual and a plus to the company.
good,"Hard working supervisor.  One competent buyer, one semi-competent buyer, and one incompetent made some days more frustrating than others.  The supervisor and two other buyers, usually helped unfoil the mess the other buyer made when working with inventory.  Very good Buy Com team."
good,"Company was pleasant to work for until the new CEO came in 2011 and changed everything both in respect to the employees and the customers, then things went down hill."
good,"It is an okay place to work. Hours were horrible but it is a retail job, so whatever. Everyone that works here is great. Never had a problem with anyone."
good,"Not a good store to work for. i worked at the North charleston, sc store and loved it came to this store and it was a nightmare! Management really sucks here!"
good,The job started out well but after a while the managers began to demand things that were not in the job description. It was not bad at first until they make you go above and beyond for minimal pay.
good,"A typical day at work was taking care of the customers in every department, working the register, cleaning the store and especially the changing rooms. I learned how to work as a team member. Management always pushed to earn the company more money. Some managers would make you do their work and go gossip to other employees. A few of the managers treated certain races better than others. The hardest part of the job was picking up the slack from the other employees/managers not wanting to do their job. The most enjoyable part was working with the managers/employees that actually did their job and cared about the other employees."
good,I was hired on a certain pay they moved my position and my pay with out confirming with me. Management was very poor didn't help with anything and very unprofessional
good,"Enjoyed working with co-workers.  Was flexible with hours needed off.  Enjoyed keeping Departments organized and presentable.  Helped out where needed, i.e. Cashier, etc."
good,"A typical day at JCPenny is high paced.  Customer service is very important and keeping the selling floor stocked make it very appealing to the customers."
good,"Jcpenney is a good place to work. The time goes by fast because customers are always shopping because we always have great sales and coupons. The benefits of working at jcpenney are the 25% associate discounts plus us using coupons on top of that. Plus, associate get discounts to sephora inside jcp too. I love my coworkers, they are literally filled with positive energy. The only down fall is management. Some managers have favorites and are not very flexible."
good,Store manager had been working for JCP for 2 weeks and thought he knew everything. District team countered every decision he made. He is extremely rude and does not care for any employee. One of the assistant store managers was an awesome person.
good,"Management was very rude at times, although most of these people do not currently work there anymore. The pay was not good either. The hours were long and they would keep you there past your shift many times."
good,"I loved the people i worked with. i felt as though they made my day go by so much faster along with the catchy music they play. there was always something to do and that i loved. management was awful. they always heard you when you spoke but never listened. they let go of good people for whatever reason. they called it "
good,"I understand it is a low-end job and you receive a quarter more than minimum wage, but you're just a number at JCPenney. Your value as an employee and member of a team is dismissed."
good,"Great staff , co workers are wonderful ,        "
good,"Very busy and easy. The time goes by fast, while your organizing shelves, cleaning dressing rooms, making sure all clothes are one hangers and shoes are placed properly, At times to retrieve online orders and stack appliances."
good,"I worked there for a good while and at the beginning I LOVED my job. The energy is great and it is a fun atmosphere. It is great assisting clients with their skin concerns and playing with the newest products is always fun! The downside is hours, of course. Holidays are terrible because the store closes at midnight sometimes in December. My experience at my store was great when I started but I quit because the Sephora manager is unprofessional. 10+ girls have come and gone under her time as manager. It can be a great place to work if you do not get close to the management team. Stay neutral! Good luck, dolls!"
good,"I survived because I had a great supervisor, she cares for her people and make sure our schedules were as close as what we need it them to be. Company wise the pay is low for the work that has to be done, as all customer service jobs, we have to put up with very unfriendly situations, do a lot with little incentives($$), no benefits at all  and only one person  in the department, the one with the most seniority get to have the full 40 hours to be able to get benefits. Corporate tries to squeeze people as much as possible. I needed the job, I did my best, even though they don't pay for that and most of the people were very nice."
good,I would say that the worst thing about JcPenney would have to be the scheduling. They schedule you 2-3 days a week and call you in on the rest. Then they don't schedule you because you said no.
good,"A typical day at JCP consists of manning the registers and doing endless go backs. I learned how to handle stressful situations and to take initiative and become more social and speak up. Management tries extremely hard to make sure everything is running smoothly. And the hardest part was dealing with unhappy customers that did not want to hear what I had to say, believing that only being just an associate meant I did not know what I was doing while the most enjoyable part was being around people and learning new things."
good,Wasn't impressed with management or the fellow stylists attitudes or work ethic. MAnagement was very catty and messy always back bitting and starting confusion.
good,slow but you get into the flow of things coworkers are really nice. but you dont really get that much perks except an employee discount. pretty good first job.
good,"Although JC Penny is a wonderful work environment it is also a place that I feel I am not being used to my full potential. I complete my tasks daily, help customers, and enjoy my job. I feel as though JC Penny is not a place I can build a career which is my intent."
good,"Is a good job to start earning some cash if you're a student. Management could be more organized. The workplace culture is good. No promotions or whatsoever, they always bring people from the outside to fill the supervisor and management positions, which is a shame because there are so many talented and educated employees who aren't given the chance to grow in the company. There's absolutely no thinking outside the box mentality, no appreciation of good ideas and initiatives, so but besides those things, the job is not bad."
good,"This is a pretty decent job overall, but would not tell a friend to work here because it is so stressful, and they are always wanting more from you without offering you more of something."
good,The holidays are especially a crazy and stressful time of year to work here and the pay is not alluring whatsoever nor is it a fair rate. No insurance or many other benefits for part time employees including no paid time off or sick days. Have learned a great deal while working this job however.
good,"A workday consisted of unsatisfied customers with employees not being at registers, and managers running around not being able to handle problematic situations."
good,"The hardest part about this job is sometimes the computers can be a little slow and if one employee is not there, then the whole staff suffers. Everything else is exceptional; the staff, the prices, the clean-ness of the place is well deserved."
good,Good place to work for a starter job. Flexible schedule. Great customer service. Average benefits. Good incentives. Family environment. Fast paced. Good people.
good,Employees are very friendly and fun to work with. Managers do a lot to try and motivate you to get more i caps and talk to customers. Also managers try and have fun days for their employees.
good,My supervisors and superiors didn't handle the departments the way they should've. They didn't give direction often and when they do it's slightly confused.
good,"work environment was stressful. Unattainable goals are often put on employees and incentives aren't the best. Enjoyed many of my coworkers, learned many skills cross training"
good,"But is getting better now has new management, loved my job they loved me ... I worked great hours most of the time and my boss was very helpful ..  daily customer service support, clean area ... and working together was great place to work overall.."
good,"I didn't have the best experience working as a short-term seasonal portrait photographer. The manager was very strict, complained about her job there, complained about her employees, and she didn't train me properly for the job. My 2nd day on the job she scheduled me to open the photography studio alone, and I hadn't been trained for more than a day shift the previous day. I had to call every employee to ask for help because I was unaware that I was opening alone that day. I did all that I knew how to do, and learned as I went until the end of the contracted seasonal job was finished in January, after New Year's."
good,"The schedules were all over place, I would get calls on my days off while in class asking me to come in because someone who was scheduled to work would be confused about their hours. Management would tell you something just to make you happy, but when the time came they'd pretend it never happened."
good,"The job is easy. I folded cloths, cleaned dressing room, made orders, and did a bit of inventory. They were unwilling to work with me schedule wise and it was hard to find a balance between school and work."
good,"It's a good first job, but it is hard to move up and the expectations can be unreasonable. The pay is not good and the hours are long and tiring, and it leaves almost no time for social or family life, especially during the busy seasons. It feels like they don't care about the little guy so to speak. It's a good supplementary income."
good,Working for JC Penney has been a fun and lesson learning experience. The job culture here ranges from those that have been with the company for over 40 years to new fresh minds ready to help. Great stepping stone.
good,This job is a great one for a starter job. Management wasn't the best but all in all it was an easy job to begin the workforce in. It opened me up to the public in all different avenues and gave me confidence in my customer service skills.
good,This is a great place for College students who just need a part time job while going to school.  Most of the time they are willing to work around your school schedule
good,"You start day out with morning stretching , thank meeting with supervisor ,  same thing everyday, they don't like taking the time to train you in new things."
good,"Things have change so much in the last few years. They don't recognize the hard work of there employees. No raises have been given in years. They don't appreciate their employees, they keep putting more work on their employees for less pay."
good,"A typical day at worked involved clocking in at the designated time, then going to the terminal that you were assigned.  From there, you either started checking out the customer's, or helped them find the products that they were looking for.  If no customers were around to help, straightening up the area was supposed to take place."
good,"Job isnt neccessarily hard, but management is terrible. don't know how to communicate. Have no job security. Breaks are sometimes cut short due to needing help on thke floor. Very understaffed & often doing others jobs because there is no other employee there to do it. Also when helping out others all the time, there is no raise available other than your scheduled department hourly rate."
good,You are consistently expected to work well past the scheduled leave time even on nights where you either have to get up early to come back in the morning or you have school or another job to get to in the morning. Some coworkers are awesome but there are many people that don't do their job and the management won't do anything to deal with them as long as they get people to sign up for credit cards. Few managers understand the need for a schedule change or availability change. Although you are promised a 15-minute break every day you are commonly working alone and therefore cannot leave to take your break. What you receive as an associate for pay and for benefits is not nearly enough to deal with the horrible customers that cause you problems every day. The good thing is they commonly give out $5 certificates to those who get credit apps and you get a 20-25% discount on most items at the store.
good,"It's retail, so there is a lot of folding clothes at all times. They are very stringent on great customer service as well as credit card applications. It's a pretty fun environment and they usually have quarterly parties or events that are fun. As all retail jobs, during the holiday season, they have blackout months from around October - January so if you are wanting to take time off during that time, it's not gonna happen."
good,"I have worked here for a little over a year and it's ok. As a stylist in order to make money there has to be foot traffic, and as far as it goes here in Greensboro there is not much going on which affects the bottom line."
good,"Pay is low, hours are few at the moment. Management sucks, whenever you call they never get back to you. You give them certain hours to work and they will schedule you for ridiculous hours. It is honestly not worth it!!"
good,Some days are slow but other days are really fast paced and stressful. My coworkers made it easy working here otherwise probably would've left sooner.
good,Management is very lackluster. No room for growth. Made 18 year Team leaders. Late nights because the kids hired mess around too much. Incompetent management team.
good,While working at J.C.P  Its a Good job to build clients while getting an hourly rate. You will also be able to use your associate discount while working  for house hould and clothing.
good,JCP is concerned about sales. Everything is done based currently sales. Must pay for benefits out of paycheck. Benefits coverage is very limited. Management are very uneducated about jobs that are done.
good,"the co-workers here are very friendly, this would be a great part time job for someone who is in college.  a typical day at work is standing fro a few hours, welcoming customers and organizing clothes"
good,"My experience working at Jcp is very different. Many times I was put on the schedule without notice and when I didn't show up it was held against me. Other times I was taken off the schedule without notice, so when I showed up I wasn't allowed to work. I've came in for other people within a 30 min notice, I stayed over 3-4 hours because my coworkers called in and nobody was going to be able to cover me. During the holidays I worked almost 10 hours 6-7 days a week and now with the holidays over I'm on the schedule 1 day for 2 weeks. And many times I've been the only person to close or open in one of the biggest departments in Jcp. Although the management isn't the best my coworkers really made Jcp feel like home. They are kind to not only myself but to the costumers."
good,"Retail is always long hours and crazy schedules. That should be expected. JCP is a pretty good company and I really enjoyed my time there. The pay is very competitive better than several retailers, but you must have the experience."
good,"Decent place to work if you do not want to move up and ok with fluctuating hours. Management ok, but they often have bad attitudes and take sides. People pass the buck and when its time for them to take accountability, they will not."
good,"Balanced cash register. Scanned area for shoplifters. Did a walk-around to deter theft. Processed customer purchases at point of sale and the online orders. Filled in at different departments for lunches and breaks. This was a seasonal job which became permanent. "
good,I went to work operated a pallit jack and carried some boxes unpacked stuff manegment was good co works were not the gratest. Grate holiday job if you need extra money
good,"it was enjoyable, always stayed busy. the job was pretty easy, no complaints on the difficulty of work. management was decent"
good,"There isn't much moving up to do within the company. An okay job, but not a life long career. Management has been doing some changing recently (new store manager). So who knows the route the store will take"
good,"As an associate, you're required to pull at least two credit card applications a week. If not, you may have your hours decreased significantly. "
good,JCP was a good place to work at the beginning.  But after advancing it became more and more difficult to understand why they operate the way they do and why they expect what they expect of their employees
good,"- great place to work overall"
good,"Merchandising the floor"
good,"JCPenney has always been a place that I love shopping at. But when it comes to actually working there, it is terrible. The amount of ""Black Out"" days (days that you cannot take off) is absolutely insane, and does not offer a fair balance between life and work. Also, on the schedule, you might as well disregard your end time. You are not allowed to leave until your supervisor says so (even if your posted time has come)! "
good,"Great place to work part time during the holiday when you are needing the extra money."
good,"I hardly ever get scheduled with other people, and if you try to talk to  coworkers in other departments you are quickly punished."
good,A typical day at work was to arrive at registers if there were to be costumers in need of help.If there was not costumers then I would have to check the fitting rooms and organize clothes around. Also would attend costumers who call through phone and help them out through orders and pick up as to with deals that the store would promote.
good,"A typical day would include assisting customers, folding merchandise, clearing out the fitting rooms, sizing, colorizing and fixing clothing."
good,"The job was not a bad job. It didn't use much brain use, so it was very repetitive to me. Management was good, they helped when needed."
good,"even after being there for so long, managers still tell you how to do your job, fussing, ""last minute visits"""
good,I though that the job was okay for the most part. The only thing that I did not like was the scheduling and the pay rate. The people were awesome and they always made you feel like a part of the family.
good,"The company invests in their people offering specialized training.  The work life balance is not that good especially when staffing is cut and it requires more weekend work.  On a good note, upper management does allow input from supervision to improve process.  There is a good culture of process improvement."
good,"JCPenney is a good company to work for if you're just starting out and need to build up some work experience. However, it is not the best place to stay long-term as compensation can be fairly low and opportunities to advance are limited. If you're flexible and work hard, you can learn various skills and work in many different departments including the sales floor, specialized departments and support. Hours and days will vary so schedules are unpredictable. Full-time hours will get you some benefits, and after some time, 401k. Coworkers are very pleasant to work with and will probably be one of the biggest pros of the job."
good,"You normally process transactions, returns/exchanges, credit card payments, and online orders"
good,"Good place to work, with current sales trends positions are eliminated on a regular basis. Company is on a turn around and will hopefully stabilize in the future"
good,"Typical day at work would be replenishing sales floors along side assisting in customer service/sales."
good,Had a wonderful experience as a general associate but hit many problems when I was lead into a newer position. I was lied to in order to fill the position and within two weeks my hours had been cut in half and my peers were being treated poorly. I quickly put in my two weeks notice.
good,"Many opportunities for developing skill sets, flexible hours, easy access to parking and public transportation, great downtown location, good benefits and advancement opportunities."
good,"Co workers were lazy, managers sat in their office all day while associates worked hard. Associates were left alone during rush hours. Job got stressful and if you are not a favorite to one of the managers they did not care about your opinion."
good,Was an okay job for an beginner but they had too much favoritism and they barely gave any hours . i learned more than expected as far as duties and opportunities. There werent that many workers as there should be but they did pretty okay as a job for me. I left because i had 1 child at that time and was not receiving the hours necessary to accommodate her needs as a parent.
good,"The pay is good, it has to be when they have mandatory overtime 6 days a week for almost 6 months of the year. Very strict on attendance, which deters most candidates. Health benefits are laughable."
good,Very busy upbeat . Great customers alot of sales and sportsmanship . I learned how to deal with people of everyday life.My co workers were wonderful people to work with . Hardest part was not enough hours.Most enjoyable was meeting new people .
good,"Typical day starts with counting tills. Checking the floor to be ready to open. I learned management skills by helping to create schedules for my dept. Learned to read reports and how to see what sells fast or slow. How to listen to the concerns of associates and customers alike. Most co-workers worked as a team. Hardest part of the day is when you have to get off the clock but you have that one last customer that needs help. My enjoyment came from talking with customers, helping them to find that certain item that they've been everywhere but can't seem to find it."
good,"Working for JCPenney's in this area has been a rewarding experience  due to the diverse customer base that I encounter everyday. I enjoy all the areas and job duties that I perform but, the company lacks the ability to have in store opportunities for advancement and keeps most workers at a very part time basis."
good,"Good people, but under JCPenney is under intense financial pressure, leading to very insecure job situation. Associates are under a lot of pressure and are spread very thinly."
good,Management seemed to be lacking in communication skills so it was  a struggle knowing what to expect from day to day operation. A very customer oriented group but lack on the one on one feeling with the co workers. Hardest part of the job was lack of leadership. The most enjoyable was customer relationships.
good,"We most definitely were not a busy salon. Since most people didn't know we had a salon or where we were located we hardly drew a crowd. I liked being a receptionist here however, the stylists were very sweet. I never once had an issue. I would've loved to have more hours though, i only worked on the weekends."
good,I had the chance to build my customer service skills and worked on a team that helped each other. I had a variety of responsibilities at this job.
good,I didn't mind working there everyone was really nice and easy to get along with. management was great by the best ive ever had. the hardest part of the job was probably learning to fold dress shirts.
good,"Opportunity to work with great people in a demanding and fast-paced environment. Good employee discount but, insurance and other benefits are standard for a company of this size."
good,"I enjoyed working at JCPenney because everyone welcomes you as apart of the JCPenney family, and everyone works together. Only thing that I feel isn't right is that it is hard to get in touch with the proper managers when there is a personal problem and you can't get to work. So that makes it hard to let them know when you just cannot make it in to work."
good,"The hardest part of the job is handling unhappy customers but it doesn't happen too often."
good,"If anything happened and you couldn't make it to work, they weren't always understanding. I was getting yelled at for things I didn't do. They focused more on selling their credit cards than making sure their employees were comfortable with a lot of things."
good,"Typically 6 hour work sifts, with recovery time after. Schedules aren't very organized but teaches very good skills for communicating with others. Co workers are so friendly and fun to work with."
good,"I loved the fast paced environment of working in retail. Working with the public offers a new and exciting challenge everyday. "
good,"The management overtime got worse, and worse, since the management changed. They're really nice at first, and then after a month or two they just completely don't listen to anything you ask if you need certain days off for something important, and they'll just generally ignore you availability after awhile of working there,and schedule you when you can't actually work."
good,"good place to work while in high school, but wont always allow you to attend school activities, wont even allow off for family vacations"
good,I really enjoy providing excellent customer service to the customers and making them feel like I was at work just for them!
good,"co- workers were always uplifting and fun to be around, manager was good a her job, and it was a very fun easy work environment"
good,"Longevity is not appreciated at this company.  When the company changed it pricing plan, it ruined itself.  One of the worst retailers to work for."
good,"The company is reinventing the brand, working to generate foot traffic in stores by implementing digital enhancements for the customer to shop in various ways.  The new digital platform with cell phones, tablets, and PC's has caused a new way to think about shopping retail.  Moving product to the store as fast as possible while limiting inventories in the store and in logistic centers, has made it a fast pace environment, always changing to best fit the needs of the customer.  Day to day operations within IT measures on being more effective at reducing downtime, while providing up-time availability on systems.  Cost savings are a top priority, managing assets and budget dollars on a daily basis to eliminate waste.  Great people are in place and working within the company at all levels."
good,"I worked from the ground set up of this store, until leaving before the holidays.  Retail is fun, but psychically difficult with heavy lifting, ladder climbing, etc."
good,"Typically I cashier, assist customers, take phone calls, restock items, sign up Jcpenney shoppers for our in-store credit card, organize, clean. "
good,"Nothing in the job description of customer service associate said anything about being on the cash register all shift long. I liked the idea of welcoming customers and asking them if you could help them but no one ever had the time to do that. In the 4 scheduled weeks I worked there the most hours I got was 12.5. The last week I worked there I originally was scheduled the same but for some reason was cut back to only 4.5 hours, which made it not even worth going to work. I had always had an office job before so retail was new to me. Working the cash register was new to me as well but at least I now have experience in doing that so that is a plus. I'd always been a morning person. You are required to work all hours. When I tried to put in my end time availability at 6pm I was told they can't do that, I'd have to work to closing at times which was 9pm. So I thought what is the point of asking me what my availability end time is if I really have no choice. Over all it wasn't a bad experience the job just wasn't for me. I was a little surprised when on the first or second day of ever being on the cash register to look up and find myself alone."
good,Good retail store to work if you don't like the stress of having to constantly be meeting sales quotas. You do get out very late if you are closing during holiday hours.
good,When first hired I loved my job ! but then there were changes in managment and I began to hate it. It was a easy job because I loved to do it and be around clothes and organize them.
good,"Throughout the years at JcPennys I have learned many valiable and knowledgable information about every day life. I have gained very good people and math skills working there. Typical days include helping customers find what they need, cleaning fitting rooms and main floor, and also selling the merchandise to the customer."
good,"Co workers were like family."
good,A typical day requires preparing inventory to be made ready to put into store and to assist customers in their search for the items they want to purchase. I learned how to deal with employers and customers in a friendly and efficient manor. I learned how to work and get along with co-workers and make the process more efficient to complete the job in a timely fashion. The hardest part is to work on a part time schedule when I need full time work. The companionship of the team I work with.
good,Company has no clue on what direction they are heading.  Constantly changing policies on a day to day basis.  Glad to be out of here.
good,"My typical day would be helping customers, doing floor sets, answering phones, organizing merchandise, and checking in special orders."
good,"Typical day involved watching for external theft 75% of the time. Internal audits are the hardest part of the job. Management felt they needed to be involved with loss prevention activity too much, but failed to communicate effectively. Advice from loss prevention on how to better reduce shrinkage was not heeded by management. Associates were very apathetic and dissatisfied. Turnover rate was high. Technology was very poor. Antiquated CCTV system, ineffective communication devices, still using Windows XP. Very political atmosphere."
good,"better management needed, good co workers, less pay and hard work. a typical work day on a holiday is very busy. i wont recommend to work their for a career!"
good,This is a nice job for teenagers however I would urge people that are over 21 yrs. old to get a better paying job especially if you have a family. This won't pay your bills.
good,A typical day at JCPenny would be easy and laid back. I have learned some great customer service skills and managerial skills from this job. Management can approve when it comes to certain points. The hardest part of my job was to stay after closing for 3-4 hours after a 10 hour shift during the holiday season until the store was cleaned to tip top shape for the following day. The most enjoyable part of my job was being surrounded by customers.
good,Help customer to look with right merchandise. Be friendly and help the store after closing.  Co-workers are real young people
good,Knowledge of principal and processes for providing customer and personal services. Listening what customer needs and evaluation of customer satisfaction if they complete survey after you close the sale.Good team to work and communicate with.Actively looking for ways to help people.
good,Depending on who one knew the better one's chances of advancement. My co-workers in the shoe department were amazing. The hardest part of the job were customer demaning items. The most joyable part was talking with customer.
good,"Unloading industrial pallets from delivery truck, while organizing merchandise, then proceeding to break pallets down with further specific organization of merchandise based on size and style. Merchandise was then carted to its appropriate vendor location within the store with its aesthetic look in mind. On other days simply maintaining the visual appeal and organization of merchandise, while engaging customer inquiries were required."
good,"Sales, guest service ,training development of team, daily objectives ,inventory"
good,"Worked at JCP for 18 years.  Excelled in leading salon team, and working well with management.  Best part of job was working with stylist and clients alike.  Totally loved the challenge of turning an unhappy client into a happy client.  Challenged staff daily to rebook clients to return to our salon.  Hardest part of job at Strongsville location, was a store manager that ran hot and cold.  Total bully, to all salon and store employees alike."
good,"The job was decent, Management could be kind and motivating, however the job can be tedious with little reward."
good,"While the environment was usually pleasant, the opportunity for advancement was just not there."
good,Good place to work for if your in school or a recent graduate from high school.
good,"Haven't been around much to other positions or stores, but JCP provided a decent enough beginner position for a kid still in high school."
good,"Very busy and always something to do, but the managers in the store are hard to get a hold of and don't care for any advancement interests you have. The actual stylists are amazing and very nice to be around."
good,"very nice place to work, but salaries were not comparable to make a decent living."
good,management at this establishment was so relaxed that most employees did absolutely nothing. meeting people from all over the world was pretty interesting. The best part about working in retail is you learn a lot about products and the latest fashions in modern society
good,Took  job as it was better than unemployment. Basic store associated waited on customers and endeavored to satisfy their needs
good,"A typical day in the men's department at J.C. Penney's include ; measuring, fitting and accessorizing customers for a new suit, dress shirt, ties, socks and belts. recovering department so it is neat and all merchandise can be easily accessible to the customer. Maintain the goals for credit applications and on line orders. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers. Helping them find the item that brought them into the store. I would say the hardest part of the job is dealing with the old computers that are always offline and go down right in the middle of your transaction on a regular basis."
good,I really enjoyed working here other then the store manager. she makes it very difficult to get along with. she always acted like she was better then her employees.
good,The day can be filled with positive and negative people all at the same time. I have learned through it all to focus on what I need to endure for that day. The management team have to pull together in order for the staff to become a whole. My hardest part of that job was dealing with all the negative issues. My enjoyable moments were seeing a smile on the faces of customers that were grateful for my assistance.
good,I worked all the display shoes to make sure that they were priced and and organized by size. I ensured that the stockroom was organized and easy to find product. I did price changes and inventory processing.
good,"Before working for this company, I like many really did not understand what is involved in the day to day operations of how, where and why merchandise is displayed as it is within any store. In all honesty, I didn't care. When you are a customer, you want to just go into a store, look around and perhaps make a purchase. "
good,"mostly start off doing mark downs on items before store opens then when store opens still doing some of that but then may move to unloading new items or restocking racks."
good,did not care for all the traveling but the enviroment was nice andfriendly Prices made it hard for customers
good,"co-workers stealing clients off the books, manager couldn't control employees, coworkers stealing others coworkers supplies, coworkers telling clients that an employee no longer worked there when they did"
good,J.C. Penny was a fun place to work. You always have somehting to do. Management was very concerned with both customers and staff. The hours were flexible and i was comfortable with the workplace.
good,"Typical big business. Mostly part time hours, all about profit. Employees that are not supervisors get very little hours, which shows in messy display and very poor customer service."
good,"Typical retail experience here, low wages (didn't expect anything more of course), started out as seasonal in between jobs thing, still there.  Some managers are cooler than others.  The ones that know this isn't there career, are the ones I like more.  Its a job, you can tell though that the company is going through some stuff, like our hours keep shrinking even though were are gaining sales etc.... Cutting costs and inventory at almost every corner.  Don't know if this company will make it through another 5 or so years."
good,"JCpenney is a good company to work for.  Their pay, hours and work load are ok.  Most associates including myself wish there was more pay and hours and less work load.  Management is good but there is a large push on Credit card sales and that sometimes is unreasonable.  I really enjoy my co-workers and JCPenneys customers are great.  Hardest part is the credit card sales.  But all in all JCPenneys is a great company to work for."
good,"I have learned to display items costs inventory,love the customer service and working with co-workers and managment ,replenishment the hardest part of the job was to leave..."
good,"Basically, a good company to work for with potential for advancement . Company has it's rough patches. Good for those with prior customer service experience."
good,"Greeting and assisting customers’ needs"
good,"Work with customers to access their needs, filled orders and restocked merchandise. I learned how to understand the needs of the customer and make that fit in with the desires of management. "
good,"Working a JC Penney was a good experience for someone just entering the fashion retail business. During the holidays there was a lot of great team work between sales associates and the managers. We were able to communicate effectively and whenever someone needed help there was always an associate there to help. After the holidays though, they didn't really keep the hard working people. Mostly the ones who didn't really work and stood around and talked were kept. During the holidays as well, they had a lot of trouble keeping people on because it was ""too stressful."""
good,"We have created a place where strength in numbers can accomplish extraordinary things. We celebrate our differences. We live by a code to treat others the way we want to be treated. That is who we are. We are a name you know, but we are more than you expected. JCPenney still lives by the Golden Rule and ensures that the customers, and associates, are treated fair and square."
good,In a typical day I help customers and contribute to the accuracy of the pricing and signing of the store.  I also help with putting out merchandise.  The management is ok.  They are more concerned with how good productivity is and less with helping the customer.  Though I believe this is do more to how corporate is trying to run things.  My co-workers do their best but that is really all we can do.  The hardest part of this job is trying to keep up with productivity and try to have great customer service at the same time.  The most enjoyable part of this job is the discount that they offer.  25% helps a lot toward getting new clothes and home goods but the stress of working there is not worth it anymore.
good,"worked there from 2011-2013. At first it was great but when they started doing the changes for the company, it started to get bad. In my opinion, management became worse with the changes, not as many customers, lack of communication everywhere, the list goes on."
good,Hard working associates and Supervisors who are dedicated to doing their job well and providing great customer service run this store.
good,"daily work routines "
good,"good job "
good,"The company has gone to part time alone. Outside of management, they only allow about 4 full time positions."
good,JCPenney was a good place to work for and I probably would have been given the opportunity to advance but now it is closing in May.  I have learned what a work family was through all the nice people there that cared.
good,J. C. Penney needs better management team and the need to pay their employees better wages.
good,The typical day is waiting on costumers and providing them with customer service. I have learned procedures and patience.  There are many supervisors to coach me and help me improve. Co-worker are mainly women that can be difficult to work with. The gossip never stops. I enjoy having conversations with pleasant customers that appreciate my hard work.
good,not much to say... a lot of backstabbing and accusations among management.
good,"Nice place to work, Needs a lot more organization to run a successful loss prevention department."
good,"The reason I liked working there was the customers ,they  were great, you were always meeting different people, managment wasn't all it could be, you were asked to more than was in your job description and when you did you got no praise for you work.but I have three kids and I had to do what I had to do."
good,I enjoyed my job and working with all the coworkers. The manager is about to retire and doesn't seem to care about individual issues or work related issues.
good,"Enjoyable place to work, great discounts, and fun co workers."
good,Cares about the customer more than the employee. Everyday is a different challenge.
good,this job is okay for high school or college students and/or a second part time income for someone.
good,not a career job unless you are hired for a management position.
good,JcPenney is good however the managers and stuff they was not organized most of them didn't know what they was doing and barely gave me any hours to work with my co workers was great I got along great with them I learned about team work my co workers helped me out a lot the hardest part of the job learning where everything was because they would change it over night every week my most enjoyable time was meeting new people and making people happy and meeting my co workers who are now friends of mine
good,"* work was always fast paced, which is good"
good,I worked here in between jobs. I didn't stay with JC PENNYS for long before I had to resign because I was working four jobs and going to school.
good,This company over works employees and expects each employee to do their job and 7 others.. Very poorly pay also Manager is not very personable and does not really help out in the store just barks orders.. Other employees are great though and made great friends. the company doesnt seem to care about employees though.. My opinion only..
good,"fitting rooms, making sure all clothing is put back on the racks, and helping out with cashier, when they were busy. sizing and folding clothes all day. I enjoyed the associates that I worked with. Did not learn a whole lot from this job, the most would be from the register.  the hardest part of the job was the register. "
good,"I love my workplace and the people that I work with. The major part I don't like is the management at my job. They are selfish, inconsiderate, overall they show that they don't really care for the associates. They act like it, but you can tell they don""t care. Also, I've been with the company for a few years and haven't received any type of raise. Things change over time and more money is needed. I love the people I work with and I love what I do."
good,Didnt love it and was boring I cant really recall anything great about it that I was young when I held this position so not much to share.
good,"Good and unfortunate rolled together.Combination of customer service and maintaining appearance of departments.  I've learned more ways to make customers happy from other associates. Management is ok but some leads will find fault with one person for not doing something but ignore another person committing the same offense.I will give management credit for rewarding positive performance. Some co-workers have been there a while and are very confident in their job to the point of being critical of newcomers.  Others are extremely freindly and helpful. Hardest part is asking every customer to apply for credit card, charity of month, customer service survey, you know they're tired of hearing about it all. Best part of the job is the customers all of them no matter what brings them to the store"
good,"Typically, the store would hold a meeting in the morning to share percentages and direction in the store for the long and short term. Immediately after we would open our registers in the department we are working in for the day.  Throughout day we are to interact with the customers and make a comfortable, easy, and fun shopping experience.  I learned how to use a register, handle money, but more importantly how to interact and work with people form different backgrounds.  The management team is great, but they are in the middle of major change in the higher management positions.  The other associates there are mostly nice and easy to get along and work with.  The hardest part of the job was dealing difficult customers that can be hard to serve sometimes.  However, the most enjoyable part of the job was to make a wonderful shopping experience for customer who has had a bad day. It takes some stress off their shoulders by making their shopping experience easy and fun.  At the end of the day, we are close our registers and stay an hour later to put the store back together from the mess that was created throughout the day.  The size of mess depends on how busy the store was throughout the day."
good,"Inventory and sales were main priorities. Competitive sales floor, especially during holiday season."
good,"Customer service"
good,"Great for a part time job, flexible schedules. You do work very hard for little pay. Good for a starting position."
good,"I usually came after practice/school and closed. I learned how to stand up for myself and work for what I want. The management wasn't to my liking, but at the time I was the youngest employee there. I liked a few of my coworkers and they helped whenever I needed it because it was my first job. The hardest part was learning to actually deal with people and learn how to deal with confrontation of the customers when they didn't agree or like something. The most enjoyable was working with my trainer, she taught me a lot and stuck with me through it all and still is my friend to this day."
good,"A typical day at work consists of getting tasks handed out by our team expert. The things i have learned to work in a fast paced environment, multitasking.The management is fair. My co-workers are very hard working easy to get a long with and can get the job done in a timely matter. The hardest part of the job is as a team to keep up all the marked down items meaning not enough hours in one work day. the most enjoyable part of the job would be working with a very good team, working one on one with customers and fulling their need in product."
good,"I prevent revenue loss by performing CCTV and direct surveillance, working revenue reports, apprehending and prosecuting shoplifters, maintaining safety procedures, and testifying in court as needed."
good,"I worked in the Catalog Department, 2 years ago, before everyone in the store needed to know how to do it. Those of us who worked in the department were tasked with assisting the customer with online orders, processing returned products (online and in-store), processing and preparing to send online product back to the warehouse, taking customer phone calls, and processing credit card payments. My shifts would vary, from early morning to early evening. On my downtime I was able to work on homework or de-stress by reading."
good,"Beautiful merchandise and easy to sell;came to this job with extensive knowledge of Fine Jewelry;co-workers are great and always available to customers with knowledge and product services; love working with our customers and to involve them in the sale; typical day is openeing department, make sure all the cases are cleaned, straightening the stock in the glass cases, just being ready for our fabulous customers. Hardest part is making sure everything is done perfect for the manaher of the department. Big push for the Care Plan within the body of the sale. Customers do not relaize this is for the protection of their purchase. My job is to explain what the Care Plan is and how it will help their purchase."
good,I think the Company has been through so many changes in the last year that everyone is confused and scared of not having a secure place to work. The Associates are great to work with they just need a little reassurance of where this company is going.
good,I worked here when I was still in high school. The workplace was average but the hour did not let me get anything done. I worked in the shoe department. I was a nice steady paced position. 
good,this was a very slow paced work place not very many hours but its also not over bearing
good,When I  worked for penneys I did everything I was asked to do. Did every little job that I was told to do with no question. I was moved around from one department to the other yet I never had a problem. I asked for more hours and was stuck in the stockroom as the reciever without even being asked. When they started laying off  I was laid off with no good explanation and the manager didn't even have the respect to do it himself or even say nice job. I was late a couple of times and admonished for it . In my defense they did switch my hours from 7 am to 4am and it took a little getting used to.I needed my job and it was taken from me. I was unhappy about it. 
good,"When I would get to work ,we always had a meeting to discuss how things went the night before.After meeting I'd count the money in cash registers & wait for doors to open.When I'm not doing anything, I found something to do.It could be cleaning or helping a co-worker.I got along with everyone.If I had a problem I'd talked to management.The hardest part of working there was the holidays when we were very busy.But then again the hours went by quickly.The most enjoyable was the people.Sure there were a few that were not too kind,But I've learned to deal with people like that.I don't take it personal.I really enjoy talking to customers."
good,"dealing with the public can be challenging and rewarding, dealing with upper management can be challenging "
good,i did mostly stocking but i would like to up too assisant manager with training. if they would ask assoiates with 1 or more years exeriance too step up.
good,"I helped unpack the trucks, help costumers and make sure that the store was keep up."
good,"No room for advancement, no benefits, no full time but expected to work weekends and holidays. I spent many years of working on Christmas Eve and others got it off. "
good,I didn't have enough time to really experience this job as I would like since I was laid off . 
good,A typical day started at 6 am and ended at 10 am.I learned how to use and read a scanner and prep merchandise for the sales floor.Management was very crude and unorganized.Coworker were easy to get along with.Hardest part of the job was that management didn't train their employees right and were barely there to help.Most enjoyable part was it was early morning so we could move a lot faster. 
good,"The typical day at work for me was providing communication that satisfied email inquiries/complaints/requests of customers, store managers and warehouses.I would also field incoming calls to satisfy customer complaints. I learned how to effectively communicate via email. My co-workers were enjoyable to work with and helpful when additional insight was needed. The hardest part of the job was telling the customer they were out of warranty and we were unable to assist. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to resolve an issue and get a feeling of accomplishment. "
good,"Positions are being emilimated, customer service is the main focus but the tasks have not changed in years. Teams are still very loyal to the company. Long hours to work."
good,Great place to start your working chapter of life. Good place to start friendships.
good,This definitely was not a terrible job per say. They definitely are always trying to keep you on your toes doing something. Even when there is absolutely nothing left you can possibly do and you haven't had a customer in over 2 hours.
good,Not much security. Jcpennys is laying off a lot of employees.
good,"I loved working here because it was very easy going and fun. There was the occasional difficult customer, but it always felt good to be able to help them as best as I could in the end. Most management was great and very easy to talk to, while others were not at all. My co-workers were awesome and always willing to help and include you even in after work plans. They did always expect you to stay much later than scheduled without any warning."
good,"lack of benefits and pay. Great environment to work in, get to meet and great customers, work on sales experience. You learn how to sell credit cards, be a cashier, work the floors and even how to dress yourself better."
good,"Worked part- time early morning merchandising; not much opportunity to learn different areas. Management did not give much attention to our team. The tasks were fairly basic, but I did enjoy my co-workers and the visual results of my job."
good,had one of the greatest managers ever and later one of the worse. probably typical of large companies
good,"This is part-time only. No positions were ever scheduled for 40 hour per week, except the poor supervisors who were made to run around like chickens with their heads cut off due to the pressure the store manager placed on them."
good,i liked my job but management made it hard. was up for a promotion but was told no because i was well liked
good,You work with customers daily with benefits of making friends on the job. Some of the rules of the work place are unreasonable and customers can be grumpy.
good,Fast-paced environment with lots of challenges locating just the right products for our customers. Fun workplace with great co-workers.
good,It is a part time job. If not a full time employee for years benefits not apply. Not enough hours. There was no place for advancement.
good,"JCPenney is a competitive, hardworking work environment. Working at this company gave me the opportunity to built my skills in customer services."
good,"Only good thing i can say was the coworkers were fun to work with and some customers were pleasing to serve. I never knew what was on the minds of Higher management, its like they pull ideas out of a hat."
good,They posted your schedule and where you were going to wok regardless of what you initially sighned up for. Hard to get days off when needed. Moral was rather low.
good,dont miss any days or be late it takes 90 day for occurrences to drop
good,I began at JCP as a part time employee looking for a little extra money. It took less than three years before I advanced to nearly the highest available position in the store without relocating. For someone wanting to stay put JCP offers limited advancement long term; without which the pay scale quickly becomes un-impressive.
good,"What you were told would be what you made, was not what you took home. You had to wait a week before you got your commission and if someone took back the merchandise then they would take out that commission right away. Most people did not feel like they were trusted, no matter how professional or dedicated you were to the position."
good,"Jcpenney is a great place to work, the Management Staff and the associates are like family, they get alone great. Supervisors and Associates work together as a team in making sure the store is open ready for the Customers. They enjoyed interacting with the customers. We enjoy answering the customer service calls, set planners, displaying the merchandises and scheduling. The hardest part about working there is having the hours cut."
good,"As a sales associate I work with the customers to make sure they had great customer service in finding everything they need. I handle customer’s check outs, returns, exchanges, and bill payments. I update every customer with our newest sales and promotions to help them save and have a better service. I maintain the cash register at all time, unless I am helping a customer. I keep the registered updated with the right amount of cash during opening hours and I closed the cash registered and count the money before closing."
good,"I started working there after we transfered back to Texas because my mother got a job at JCPenney as a salon manager. I know not all of them are alike, but this one was ridiculous. The management doesn't care about you, you're just a number. They want to pay you dirt cheap for a job that you pretty much take a beating for when it comes to the rude and messy customers. I've seen grown women cry because it was just that intense sometimes."
good,"Customers were cheery and friendly, most staff was fun to get along with. Store manager was unprofessional, abusive of power, and had anger issues."
good,"Make sure you were logged into the phone system and always available to receive calls. Worked 12 hour shifts, sitting elbow to elbow, working automated incidents, implementing emergency application/system changes, monitoring batch processing and resolving issues. Taking phone calls, opening incidents and working with the caller until issue is resolved. My coworkers were pleasant and fairly easy to work with, but had those 3-4 who did as little as possible. When I first went to work there each manager had 30-35 people and I learned quickly to toot my own horn, which does not come easy. Another layer of mgmt was created where each one had 8-10 subordinates and most of the new managers came from our area and understood what we did. Then upper management changed, started bringing in managers off the street, creating a bit of chaos. Penney's had home-grown software which met the needs of the company quite well. But also made it very difficult to learn and understand how it all fit together. I had 21 years experience prior to Penneys and it was like a different language. Most of the employees had been there 20+ years and grew up with the software. When early retirement was offered, several employees supporting this software left the company along with several let go when the new CEO arrived. With continuous reduction in work force, my team of 6 were responsible for work previously done by 16 people and the work for the PASRs and Monitors It was the first place I have worked where I felt management was only there to please their upper management and no one stood up for their employees."
good,"managerment very friendly, they wont have you do nothing they wouldnt do. Co-workers mostly teenagers but friendly. hardest part was you never get to leave on time always work over closing time. Most enjoyable was the shopping experiences and the discounts."
good,Fun place to work. Loved working with customers and jewelry. New management not very understanding.
good,"I would warn people that in certain stores it is a popularity contest when you are a manager, meaning if you meet the store managers not the companys expectations you will grow. Certain managers managed with a chip on thier shoulder and were poor leaders."
good,I didn't like working at JCPenney people were rude and disrespectful and very unprofessional.
good,Work was work. Because I worked in a commissioned department everyone was very aggressive. That was good because it kept ou busy.
good,"J C Penney is great work of starting in retail. Detail converse in sales, and light tasks. Management takes on most responsibly. Workers follow their instructions and duty task in you assigned department. Co-workers are generally easy to get along with and are dependable. The hardest part of my job is taking returns and the transitional changes in the company itself. Most enjoyable is work environment."
good,"They managers were good at the beginning, when a new store manager came, everything changed for the worse."
good,The salon was a good job.
good,Nice office environment and short commute. Access to in house day care facility and fitness center.
good,It was alot of work. Standing on my feet for long periods of time. I learned how to work well with others commincation was real important.
good,Typical day at work for me is to make sure all reports are filed. Print out a daily attendance log. Review all invoice. Review footage on CCTV . To make sure all trucks and containers are in the correct locations.
good,learned the ways of JCPenney and their Policies. Able to interact with customers providng them with excellent service.
good,My review of this job would have to be that i loved the atmosphere and the people i worked with and the people who came into the store. It was always fast paced and kept u busy most of the time especially during holidays. It could get a little hectic at times especially during holidays but i learned to be patient and to just go with the flow of things. The hardest part of the job would have to be during the holidays putting out all the merchandise that can fit on the sales floor. The most enjoyable part was that it was at the mall and got to interact with a lot of people and make customers happy.
good,On a normal work day it can be busy at times and very slow and very few hours ranging from 4-12 hours a week.. Not a job to reli on or job security.
good,The most i liked about the job was the other workers. They were (exspecially the older workers) very supportive and genorous. The long hours of standing was something to adjust to.
good,"There was not much to do during the work week or even on most sundays. If it was dead then the time was very slow. I learned customer service skills and to be kind to those who even are rude to you. The management was ok it could have been better because when you needed the managers they were no where to be found but the people I personally worked with were amazing people and brought out the best in me. The hardest part of my job had to be dealing with people out of your comfort zone, but the most enjoyable part had to be working with people that made it fun to work there."
good,"The job was fun in the beginning then managers started showing favoritism towards certain employees. I stayed there long enough i even tried to transfer but my boss wasn't fond of me and denied it,"
good,"Good benefits and opportunities for advancement. Great company for anyone who loves retail. This was a new store launch so there were a lot of hiccups with the grand opening, but overall, a good company."
good,My typical day at work was unloading trailers in the logistics warehouse. I learned the safest way to unload a trailer while still keeping up speed. In my opinion management cared more about the production levels in the recieving department than the health of their employees. Personally i had an allergic reaction to perfume and cologne from the Sephora pallets. Management told me to deal with it and continue unloading the trailer. I came close to anaphylactic shock and therefore had no choice but to quit for health reasons. That was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was feeling like I was accomplishing something good every day.
good,Greeting customers and giving information about product knowledge. I learned how to be a better customer service representative. Management is good never had a problem with my supervisor or co-workers. The job can get stressful especially during holidays but overall it great.
good,A very fast pace with 80% travel.
good,This was a temp job while I was take some classes on computers.
good,Cashier/Customer Service/Maintenance. I learned how to work in Retail. The manager was nice to the customers. My co-works we easy to work with. The hardest part was keeping the clothes straight. The part I enjoyed the most was working in fashion.
good,"I worked in both Jewelry and shoe sales, the commission was good during sale events and I learned a lot about jewelry. Most co-workers where fine to work with, some where a little difficult, but never hindered my performance. Management was fair and good to work with. The hardest part of the job was in the shoe department, searching for shoes of different styles and sizes, some co-workers would not return the shoes to the proper place after a customer tried on the shoes. Also, the floor became crowded when sales associates did not clean up or return shoes after being tried on by the customers during and before the shift was over. It was enjoyable working with people with different likes and styles. Different characters where also noted. It was a good place to be."
good,"ever since JCP has made its changes to the pricing system alot of things has changed. As a result of change i was laid off. However it was not a bad place to be, i was there for almost 3 years and made lots of friends or atleast pleasant acquaintances lol wit associates and managers. One thing JCP does well is support its associates, with appreciation parties or little lunch-ins for sales I-caps (creditcard applications)."
good,"I was the Salon Customer Service Specialist. I scheduled appointments for clients and saw to their purchase needs. I compiled monthly reports on volume of sales for the salon as well as each stylist. The stylist were moody, particular about the way things were done as so much of it reflected in their pay and/or tips. My supervisor was arrested while I worked there, and had no morals, which made the job atmosphere unpleasant. Upper management was okay. I was awarded the employee of the month a short time into the job for my excellent customer service skills, and friendliness."
good,"Good place to work if you are looking for pocket change, not a good place to work to make a living."
good,i just need a job that will work more than once a week i love my coe workers its just i cant survive on those hours
good,"Poor Management skills,you should make sure u have enough people workin not just on holidays,"
good,"Retail works you to death as usual. But, there is a chance for advancement as well as ""rewards"" for doing good. It's not a bad company to work for if you have good management unfortunately my manager was a bit of a nightmare."
good,"This was a perfect job of me for many years. I was able to work part-time and be available for my young children. I worked many different shifts, whenever needed. I normally worked 4 days a week. I found the work pleasant and challenging."
good,I enjoyed the intetaction i had with the customers. A few of the manegers were nice to work with. Jc Pennys was a good job to get some Retail/Customer Service experience at. The hardesdt part of my job was when i woukld leave for the day i would make sure everything was put away and that their was no fittingroom carts but when i woukld come back to work it would look as if nothing was done.
good,"there was little to no communication between management and staff. schedules were always made with conflictions to availability, despite any explanations otherwise."
good,"Flexible loss prevention policies protect LP employees from most rookie mistakes. Management and legal department willing to defend employees from legal threats. Loose dress code, can wear jeans and a nice shirt."
good,Its a really fun and fast pace environment. Friendly and helpful managers and supervisors. The pay its a bit low for the work it has to be done.
good,While I liked most of the management staff there I was often given the shorter end of the stick because I was younger. One of the managers let me prove myself but the other managers would put me in a category and never let me try and succeed at any new tasks above my average work everyday.
good,Do your job to the best of your ability and try to always stay busy. Ask every customer if they would like to apply for a JCP credit card. Always be as pleasant as possible to both your coworkers and the customer.
good,I learned to have great communication skills so that costumers feel welcomed. making costumers feel welcomed at your job is very important. Always keep a smile on your face!
good,It was okay. There was nothing really happening I didn't mind it but I really wouldn't recommend it to someone that likes to do things in a fast pace.
good,The overall direction and support for a new supervisor was minimal. You were left to your own devices to figure out what company tools to use and how to use them.
good,"Can get busy quickly, managment depends on location, if the can help they will. Can be rude at times. Pay kinda sucks raises don't happen very often.."
good,"job was easy, fun, and enjoyable. enjoyed my coworkers, also the work i did, but i had prior commitments to fulfil before the end of the year as well as it beings seasonal job."
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with there very willing to train you. I gained lots of customer service skill working for this company. Though I had trouble with so management it was a great place to gain experience
good,"My time on the floor was great. Wonderful people and environment. Managers are great. If you are looking to advance in the company, that process is slow."
good,I had fun working at JCPenney but I had to find another part time job during weeknights and weekends because I moved to another city that will  it's farther.
good,"The company was foreclosing at this location. There were hours that I worked but didn't receive payment for, and there was no one to talk to about this because it seemed like they were unreachable."
good,"The culture at JCPenney has definitely changed over the past years. The restructuring has meant that they gave you more work with the less pay. Just never really enough time to finish a task at the time that I was there for such a big store. And we're never able sparkly staff the store. The associates and management staff work very hard to satisfy the customers needs. ,needsit'neveseem to be enough"
good,Struggling company. Expensive for what the quality actually is. High turn over. The employee discount is great. Pay is standard. No career advancement.
good,"Everyone there for the most part was very open, friendly, wanted to work together to complete a group task..... I felt like there was too much drama within management for my skills to be usefull there."
good,"Very laid back job at sometimes until the holidays, need to be very clean and sanitized for the old building also needs security. Some of the staff was thinking they were managers"
good,My review went great they told me that they would call me back in couple days and they did call me back and I got the job....they gave me onsite training...and let me go from there
good,"They could use some small improvements while managing. Personally, they worked pretty good with outside activities when having to request off. They could improve in that area a little more. Overall, they’re motivating and know what their doing. They work as a team."
good,"The company had been a great stepping stone for my training as a manager. The degree of expectation and experience I received was sometimes demanding."
good,It was always slow unless there was a huge sale. I never had anything to do and just walked around most of the time. I did like the people I worked with.
good,Just a normal retail store. Not too many issues or complaints other than the unrealistic pushing to make customers buy the credit cards. Management wasn't bad although held too many meetings placing blame on certain people.
good,I worked in management for JCPenneys for 25 years. It was some of the best years and some of the worst. I never felt fairly compensated for the responsibility I had. I was always in management. I started as a trainee and retired as a senior merchandise manager. The stores were reorganized in 1998 and I was asked to take an early retirement.  I complied.
good,"If you’re anything like me, you can get managers to work with you and give you a different schedule. Most people don’t get that luxury though. Pay isn’t the greatest but it’s something."
good,"The managers are very good and fun to work with, a good work ethic is something needed. Slacking is something no tolerated despite what many think about retail jobs."
good,"There was a lot of miscommunication, non communication, everyone had their own ideas, everyone wanted the "" rules"" followed but some didn't follow them themselves, lots of favoring of one culture of people. I felt set up to fall a lot! I heard I don't care from several employees. I enjoyed some of the people I worked with! They were super good to me when my brother died them a month later my mother died."
good,Unorganized uncooperative supervisors no one to stand up for you.. had a customer yell at me with no one to help you . It's been my first job and not sure I will ever like to work
good,"JCPenney is a wonderful place to work "
good,"The management is really bad. JCPenney did not schedule enough people, so it was always understaffed in every department. You had to do all the work for little pay."
good,"JCP was difficult to work at due to management never showing up and a lot of employees having to wait almost a week after checks came in to get them. I ended up working from open to close for 8.55, while walking over 2 miles to get there. My work wasnt appreciated as an employee."
good,The job was nice because I really didn’t like talking to people like that till I got this job. The management at JCPenney was alright when I first started but then people left and new managers got hired and that’s when management was at it worst. The hardest part about this job was that they weren’t good on break coverage and scheduling. I enjoyed working here cause of the associates and the friendly customers .
good,Can be a productive and rewarding place to work if they ever get the right management team to train and work together.  Need  a stern HR manager to recruit the highly motivated worker.  Need to spend more time on training employees.
good,"There was alot of work to do here because of being understaffed. I was constantly told to attend the fitting rooms and put away go backs,which was alot of time on my feet cleaning fitting rooms that customers may have peed in or left piles of clothes in the room or on the sales floor. Management wasn't terrible,just not very attentive to employee needs. Overall,just the basics of retail."
good,"During my time at JCP I saw many policies not being followed but they continued to keep these associates because 'they needed bodies in the building'. Additionally if you are a female on the team your opinion is just pushed to the side. The manager will always go to the male supervisors first. They will not promote from within and they have no training programs, just a sink or swim mentality. The phrase most often said at this warehouse is 'if it has worked in the past don't try to improve it'. So no continuous improvement, no real technology. Theres no job security in under the year I was there they went through 8 different supervisors. The ones that came on saw how bad it was and quit. The ones that stay, stay because they dont have to do much to keep their jobs. Favoritism is rampant in this warehouse and will destroy it eventually. You will not see your manager at all during the day and do not get much direction for what you are supposed to do. Employees that had been with the company for 40 years (multiple people) told me to get out while I can and while I am young enough to find something else. When I left so did they because they were done with how you get treated at this company. My manager also talked about strippers and other inappropriate things often. They did not know the policy for breast pumping and had an associate pump on the floor for weeks before I said something. The manager and AGM did not know a policy and had no directive to give her."
good,A typical day working at Jcpenny was to help customers work on go backs and there were times that we would have projects. I learned that when you work in retail that you have to have a lot of patients with the customers and with management as well... I worked in Jcpenny for 5 years and its not bad but after 5 years i thought that i need to leave and look for a better job
good,"Not a bad place to work or shop, just depends on management skills and how well you can work in retail. Always put a smile on your face and make the customer feel welcome"
good,"As a whole the company as a lot to offer. Great benefits for part and full time employees and lots of opportunities for advancement. Unfortunely at this particular location has poor management, lack of communication and poor company moral. Also a lot of nepotism."
good,I worked there for almost 5 years and at first it started off great...I had the job I loved but about 4 months afterwards I got put on another job task back and forth( just helping out) but when I knew anything it became my permanent job..then the manager hired a person to take my position...I was upset...I asked y was I moved ..he said he needed me more on the job position that he put me on but that should have been a choice for me..so then we get a new manager and I told him I waned to come off of the position I was placed on to go back to the floor as cashier..he moved me but soon afterwards he asked me about another job position and. That would come with better pay and I would be certified but that was a lie...I worked that position for about 6 months and had to quick because the standing was too much on the legs..so now I don't have a job anymore.
good,JCPenney had a hard time keeping up with my unusual schedule considering that I had very small children at home and a husband that works the midnight shift. They would schedule me for days and times that I was just not available which were the days and times that they had known about when I was hired in.
good,"Medium paced receptionist position"
good,JCPenney was a interesting work experience! The staff was great to work with besides the rude / horrible management. Overall it was a good time working at JCPenney’s.
good,"If you are interested in working at a department store than JCPenney is a fine start. "
good,Great co-workers and ok environment. If you are good at your work they would expect you to do your co workers job. Merchandise Manager bad under pressure.
good,"I was happy when I first accepted the job. I was hired on the spot but as the months start to roll around. Managers starts to show there true colors. Your hours are basically based off of productivity. You need to get careplans and JCPenney cards which is sometimes hard because the customer either doesn’t want another credit card or the warranty is just to high. Overall, I enjoy working in the jewelry department and I also enjoy some of my co workers."
good,It was okay but the managers had their favorite picks of people that was lazy and did nothing. It didn't have good management and people slack on their work.
good,I would not let my children work there. Not a pleasant work environment. Store manager is a bully. Advancement is dependent upon how much you’re willing to tell on fellow coworkers.
good,Worked at J.C Penney for over 2 years and I hated every day of it. Every day was the same. Very repetitive and boring work and very low pay. I would never work retail again!
good,"Getting to know your co-workers makes the job a lot easier. The culture was decent. I learned how to responsibly work with customers, but the hardest part of the job was keeping up with people that have been there for a longer period of time."
good,the store manager was new so he did not make a good impression on team members and my self he was not friendly. The department managers were over heard talking about other associates that was very unprofessional.
good,This was one of my first jobs and it was okay at the time. I liked most of the people I worked with and yes everyday was different than the next. The hours were not my favorite.
good,The work environment is very fast paced. Management was unorganized at my particular store. There is no communication between associates and management.
good,"I don’t expect any job to be easy or simple but I do feel that professionalism should be met 50/50 consistently and not to a certain extent. In this case, managers and supervisors are professional to a certain extent. They show favoritism, expects one or two people to hold down one department let along keep every single thing organized while you have a line of customers. So, picture your one human with two hands and two feet having to juggle 5 situations while others meeting with coworkers to gossip. Schedules were flexible to a certain extent. Our schedules were online so that means that they could be changed any minute in a day. My last straw for me when people started to show up late while my shift was over 30 min-2 hrs ago. JCPenney is a great place to work for but not a good place to work for with poor management!"
good,I enjoyed onboarding employees.  I disliked dealing with upset customers. We had a diverse work group.  Learn to work with different aspects of operations.
good,This job is a great first time job in sales. The staff are very friendly. You get great discounts in their products for just being an employee there. I was a temp here so I worked holidays and I loved it.
good,My manager was awful and very sexist. He favored male leader roles and the hours changed all the time. I was in high school 16 years old working 30 hours a week!
good,"Okay place to work, not a career style job. Being a retail environment means having open availability and working holidays. Otherwise, its not too bad if you are okay making little per hour."
good,"Tiende a ser inestable, pero la administracion tiende a ayudarte y si sabes lo que haces la pasas bien ambiente muy movido."
good,"I liked working for JCPenney, because my co-workers were absolutely amazing! They were very kind and generous people. The management, was good at first until the management got changed I wish I had a better experience."
good,"A typical day at work would be greeting customers, organizing merchandise onto fitting room carts, folding and hanging merchandise to make it look presentable and working on the registers. I have learned how to have more patience and have better customer service. The management team is easy-going and fun to be around. The workplace culture is very organized, trustworthy and adaptable. The hardest part of this job is to try and finish things by a certain time. The most enjoyable part of this job would be the friendly environment."
good,"Not a bad place to work.  The compensation is relatively poor, however, it is retail.  Management is very supportive.  The atmosphere depends on the season or holiday and everything is results driven."
good,"Many times they would ask me to work doubles and I would always say yes so that they might eventually give me a raise for being a hard worker, but I never received one. I would work multiple 10 shifts a week, come in on my off days, come in earlier and leave later than I was originally scheduled and when I finally asked if I could get a 25 cent raise, the manager actually laughed in my face and walked away."
good,Not the best place to work if you like flexible schedules or hands on training. The location that I was working out I had very apprehensive people working there and among other things there is a problem with management other than that it was a nice place to work. On floor staff employees were very welcoming and nice.
good,"It is a decent place to work, the management is nice and they try to work with you, but it's difficult at times struggling with not getting hours and going sometimes a week before you are back at work."
good,this was my first job I learned a lot and gained a lot of skills just a lot of drama with associates and a few people are mangers favorites but it is a good job to start of with
good,"It all depends on what type of department manager you get. I had some great ones but I never really got the opportunity to advance in the company. Many felt a racial discrimination at the time. I left as soon as they discontinued the health insurance benefit. That was the only reason I was there for so long. "
good,I loved working there but they do not tell you that you are done for the season. They just stop putting you on the schedule. Employees were great to work with.
good,"The job I had at JCPenney was fun and I learned a lot from my experience there. Though, as a single associate getting paid hourly I did a bit of everything. I was hired on as a merchandise operator but I also worked as a sales associate, cash handler (balancing drawers and managing bank deposits) as well as working some in Sephora. I worked as much if not more as managers in the store, not getting paid overtime or getting any sort of raise that I was promised apon hiring for ""doing a good job""."
good,I worked at a JCPenney inside a mall. I like my Co workers that help me learned new things about that work life. But they are either old retired people or young people who needs a job like me. That’s creates a huge problem or at lease in my JCPenney’s. The reason being is that the manger care about the older people than the younger people. I know that sounds good on paper but it’s not. That means that the older people get more breaks(paid) than the younger people who also worked the same amount of hours or more. Also the manger treats the younger people like dirt or low respected  while the older people get praised. They also wants us to keep the place in order. Which it should be. The problem is that the majority of the costumers are the people who flip clothes everywhere or leave clothes or items where they are not suppose to go. Not saying it could look nice but I’m saying that theres gonna be a few spots where costumers flip clothing everywhere. I had one manger that threatened 2 other co workers and me that we would lose our jobs if the place is not “perfect”. By the way that story was on my first week there.  We got the place tidy up but then the hordes of customers came and trashed it up again. So we had to do it again. While we where recovering the place the manger came up to us angrily. Saying that “I told all 3 of you guys to cleans the place up.” Then she decided to split us up into different departments. That made me angry and wasn’t expecting that from my first job. Even though my co workers and I did the task. That was also on the same day as the last story. Do
good,"opened registers and setup jewelry in display cases. waited on customers. "
good,Had its advantages and disadvantages... I don't know one stylist that stayed with the company that was there when I was there. Horrible turn over rate... discount were heaven sent.
good,"I would say that working with JCPenney is easy. There is not much hard labor to the job. However the management of this company is horrible. There is an extreme lack of order and organization. The push for ""Credit Apps"" is insane. They focus most of their efforts towards getting people to apply for a credit card and do not recognize the efforts made by those who work hard on recovery and clearing fitting rooms. Currently they are hiring, but do not provide hours for the associates that have been working there. Several associates are leaving due to this issue."
good,"When I started working for Penney’s the manager at the time saw great potential and promoted me; I’ve worked as a supervisor in lingerie and women’s plus, home, furniture and Windows, fine jewelry, and men’s. All management except for GM were great. Lots of retaliation from GM. I’ve never been wrote up or spoken to about my preformance and always had go yearly reviews. Never did I think because I witnessed harassment from the GM towards another supervisor and got questioned about it by the district manager would I then be target to retaliation."
good,"This was my first job and it wasn’t a terrible start. It’s not too hard of work and works good for a high school students schedule. It is pretty slow paced and in my opinion the shifts often drag by. Pay isn’t great but if you are in high school, and/or don’t have expenses it might work for you."
good,"I would say JCP is a decent first job. Not the worst, not the best. As most retail jobs go, you will always have to deal with difficult customers, but eventually you get the hang of it. It would help if management were better. There are several manangers that are great, but the ones that aren't can make working there a pain."
good,This is a fun place to work if you know some of the other employees. The associates are nice and the benefits are okay. The pay isn't all that much but there are ways to raise it. There are sometimes changing rules that aren't always specified when they are changing. The breaks are way too short IF you are allowed to get one.
good,Folding clothes and checkibg customers out. What I learned at this job is what not to do even though it may not have been the best experience it still taught me something.
good,"They do not give benefits to any part time worker, the coworkers were very nice as the supervisors. They push you to set up credit card applications but it is not as hard as it sounds."
good,This job was a part time job on weekends and evenings due to full time employment elsewhere.  I had the opportunity to expand into many departments by my choice in order to continually be busy on slow shifts.
good,"The job was extremely physical. I hadn’t worked in a warehouse since 2015. It took some quick adjustments but I got it finally. Unfortunately, my body never recovered. I had daily aches and pains and my feet hurt nonstop. The job requires a lot of walking and standing for long periods of time."
good,Worked here for a short time. It was okay to work here. Manager wasn’t really understanding. I took over shifts for people and it was very slow. Didn’t like working the nights.
good,"Is very good place to work but we don’t have a chance to go up on positions , no opportunity to expand career. No enough hours always less then 40 hours and is not good. No recognition!!!"
good,"First off, it's retail so I did not expect too much from it. Although, it was my first job I was excited and happy to work for the first few months. But, the hours started slowing down, we went through numerous employees the 2 years I was there, and the management was close to terrible. I enjoyed the customer service and interaction as I am very much a people person, but when the customer became a problem or a little bit out of hand the management did little to resolve the issue."
good,Working there is fun but definately does not pay enough. There needs to be more help from all management. Most of tbe responsibilities of customer assistance fall under the cashiering managers and sometimes it gets overwhelming.
good,"Management was very relaxed, decent hours, co workers love to help each other. The days went by quickly during the weekend and sometimes during the week. Overall it was a good working experience. The only bad part is the wage. Some of my co workers had been there 3+ years and never saw a pay raise. I started out folding clothes and keeping up with fitting rooms, easy stuff. Then I was promoted to jewelry specialist where I had hours of training, I was responsible for all jewelry in the store, including high end diamonds. I never received a pay raise which seemed odd due to my extensive training and far more responsibility/liability."
good,"10-15min walk to time clock, depending on what area u work in, ... It's sad how there's no grace period with such a long walk just to clock in! I got firEd for being late too many times and I had only clocked in 1min after time due to the walk.... Call it my responsibility, cool, whatever, however everybody's life isn't set up on such a schedule to where they can be on the dot!! Minus ANY excuses!!! That's ridiculous,... I got paid well, no complaints on that... HOWEVER I felt like a number there and not a valued  person... If u don't mind not being valued, and adhering to being there 30min to an hour before your shift starts so your not fired no matter how good of a worker you are... Have at em... 2018-19, they paying 12-19 an hour depending on the area u get hired for.... Get ya coins, cuz they will dismiss u within a heartbeat if u mess up and FIND SOMEONE ELSE with the quickness... As to why they're still posting on indeed *slaps forhead* and fired me 2 months ago for being late 1 dern minute .... Smh.... Even Walmart has a dern grace period, y'all a trip fr, but it is what it is... Smdh"
good,It is a fun place to work. I had been trained in all departments and that helped me move up in the company. They quickly look for your potential and get you moving in the right direction.
good,Worked seasonal and was not notified that i was working seasonal. Management needs to communicate better with the employees. Too many daily mishaps due to lack of communication with employees.
good,"All employees were very welcoming and it was easy to get along with most everyone in my department. However, your relationship with management could be difficult to navigate depending on the day, what mood they were in, and how they felt about you specifically. There was a lot of pressure to get credit applications and constantly be assisting customers. The low pay did not always make it worth it."
good,The only thing about job is standing all day. I learned to always stay focused on providing great customer service. What I enjoyed most was knowing that I delivered excellent service that would help to make someone else's day better.
good,"there is a lot of pressure to sell, but not many people to sell to. dealing with customers is not always pleasant. quick employee turn over rate.  also pressure to sign people up for credit cards. the only positive is the people that do work there are pretty cool"
good,Management of the reception desk for 15 or more professionals can be chaotic. A fast paced ever changing profession. Working with management for daily procedures improved productivity. Sales commission is offered as well as per hour.
good,"I worked in shoes/luggage department...I met friendly people and for the most part, enjoyed being there. This was a part-time job for me and a typical shift was four to six hours and very routine."
good,"Hopefully the new CEO will bring clear direction. There are many talented people who are willing to give their all in making this company a success, but lack of clarity in direction and a lack of strong leadership has caused this once proud company to mire in mediocrity. Many in upper management are scared of making mistakes, so they take few chances and do not question direction, even when it seemingly contradicts the brand or is not customer focused."
good,I wouldn’t recommend this job if you’re looking for a solid full time job that you can rely on for most of your income. It’s a good partime job that will work around availability if needed.
good,When I first started out there they had a good management team that cared about their staff and needs. Once they switched to a new manager things went downhill fast. You could have open availability and get 10-15 hours a week. They under staff the sales floor and took away any staffing for shoes and make it self serve instead of that helpful hand you use to expect. They don't train their members before sticking them on the sales floor and tell them to push credit card sales. Turn over for management was low but the few times they did promote was to the few under qualified slackers who were their best buddies. They also bring in outside management.
good,"Lots to do at JCPenny! Coworkers are generally friendly, management is communicative and feel for my well being, however it is very corporate, scripted transactions, little to no change within stores when issues arise, and low pay."
good,Loved working in this store but favoritism was very highly in this store. Customers loved me always asked for me when I wasn’t present. Today I’ve learned a lot and I’m so proud of my self.
good,"Between the store being in a ramble most of the time to the managers never really seeing the situations with any troublesome customers for themselves. More times than not, the associates on the floor are left to take the blame and ill manners of customers who are unhappy with many of JcPenney's advertising techniques."
good,A typical day in work would be that you clock in go where you need to go and just go with the flow. Not too much goes on in the workday everyone just does what they need to.
good,"All of my managers, but one were awesome and easy to work with. "
good,Fun job was just never enough employees because of corporate. Corporate and management overall ruined the job for me. Corporate kept cutting more and more hours till there 3 people working and we always needed more help. Managers would never keep everyone updated. Key holders always quit and would always be offered to the least deserving person. Was nicknamed the “manager” of the store because all the things I would do for other employees and the customers. Always had the most credit card applications and was never recognized for it. A lot a racist managers and employees. At the last couple months at that job I had to make discrimination report and had to get corporate involved and it was definitely not a fun time. But I liked working retail and helping customers. The job would be so much better if corporate actually made things realistic and if managers took a few ethic classes. Also pay was decent but pretty much have to beg to make more.
good,I enjoyed my time there.  I was part time supplementing my income.  The Managers were nice and friendly.   They were not very understanding after the death of my father. I was 22 and needed a week to get myself together and they said I couldn't do that.   I did anyway.
good,there is alot of turnover in leadership making difficult to balance work load if the right people aren't in charge you wont get much done and training is awful. If you come in will experience and the attitude to swim vs sink you'll make it and it will be a nice place to work
good,Great people. For the past 15 yrs the company has gone thru ups and downs. Its competitive fast pace work environment. Will definitely recommend it to family and friend.
good,"usually I called customers to do a presale on an upcoming sale. I kept a client book with names, phone numbers and what my customers purchased."
good,"The company has not been doing well,  stock market at a low,  management is very negative and criticizing, lack of communication, Inconsistent hours,  have to work all holidays rather than being with family"
good,"You are not given the option to work your available hours,you are just put on the schedule and if you cant work, then you are given an attitude. The work load get harder each day because the staff is short with out any new hires. The management does not communicate with the associates unless there is an issue. Only plus is discounts.Management spend most of the day gossiping and taking selfies on the phone and making fun of employees. This department has lost more employees in 7 months than they have hired,3 each month because of poor management!! Too much favoritism"
good,"The hardest part about working at my particular JCPenney is that there isn't a proper training program. When I first started, I felt very unprepared and unaware of what my job was supposed to be. There are so many different situations that employees are thrown into everyday that can be overwhelming to an employee who does not have prior experience in a retail background."
good,"New employees were happy to work there when they started. But after a short time of employment, some were looking for a new job. I started in 1978 when benefits and wages were great. The CEO""s during that time, seem to be more caring about the employees, than business issues."
good,"This company has changed for the worse over the past couple of years, and I really don't see them being in business much longer. Corp has recently made changes that will hurt the company, and they really don't seem to care."
good,The job culture is based around getting customers to sign-up for the credit card. The incentive is a few dollars extra per applicant reviewed under your name. The management made no sense and rode you until you listened or fired you.
good,"There was a great deal of turnover. Management wasn't fair and had favourites based more on popularity than work performance.  Hours at holidays were awful, especially at Thanksgiving."
good,"I worked for the optical department at JCPenney, and though the job was not horrendously stressful, I felt as if the amount of work that we did was not indicative of what we were paid. The paychecks were roughly half of what a medical office setting such as the optical would be considered. A job with responsibilities such as that, and low pay makes for incredibly unhappy employees."
good,"JC was one of my favorite jobs. Great discount, fun, liked customers. The management made it so miserable people left that had been there for many years . I was a full time employee with a part time status which left me no benefits at all for the first year even though I was working an average of 40 hr weekly. no sick time,no holiday, no vacation, NOTHING"
good,Overall good experience but hours were never consistent and only part time work. Management was nice and people were friendly.  Good work atmosphere and easy to engage with customers.
good,Worked closely with other associates to ensure team building in sales and training. Ensured product information to customers. Great work place environment to grow in sales.
good,"working here is like working in a factory.Many of the times its always busy and they only give you a little 15 minute break for working 6 hours or less.Your on your feet all day and much of the times they work you to death.they basically make you work nights even if you say no.Also, if you cant wear what you want to wear so if your looking to express yourself in your outfits DON""T WORK HERE.I will say that they pay well but this job is def. not for teens"
good,"It's not a bad company to work for, you just can't have this as your primary income or you will not survive. Management is cool. very easy workload. Good job for student!"
good,"A lot of what happens in the store and moral depends on the store management. The first 13and 1/2 years were great and then came our next manager and it all went downhill. Every one leaving, very hard to work with, no support and store moral the lowest I have ever seen it."
good,If you want to learn you can always find someone that can teach you. There are a lot of opportunities but everything is very slow moving to do so. There are a lot of hours and full and part time employment. The scheduling can be very flexible depending on the position. The biggest issue I had was communication and getting time off. And when I had my miscarriage (which started on site) I got points for it even though it was a medical emergency that I had to leave.
good,loved the people I worked with so much. I just didn't like the management they were rude would get mad over tiny things and blamed the associates for what was wrong with the store
good,"JCPenney is a decent first job, I got it after I graduated high school going into my first year of college. But it is definitely not a job I want to work the rest of my life or even a few years."
good,Keeping the departments clean and neat. Management helps with what they can. The job is not hard. It's very enjoyable to work at your own pace but get the job done.
good,Team I worked on was blamed for a lot of the problems within the store which was ridiculous. The managers were very lazy and just sat around and did nothing but complain.
good,Everyone's experience is different and new hires really like the company. It also depends on the team you are on and your management to decide whether the company is a good fit.
good,"The pay at this job was not ""competitive"" as they typically claim it is. The work itself was fairly easy, in both of the departments that I worked in. I learned some skills through my work, but nothing worth writing home about."
good,"When I started I was working 35 hours, and I had vision and dental insurance available. I was promised PTO and paid holidays. My hours were cut down to 24 hours a week which made me unavailable to benefits. I also never received my PTO or paid vacation even though I reached the requirements (which was 30 hours for PTO) Walk in traffic isn’t the best."
good,This was my very first job and it taught me a lot about my communication skills. I loved the environment each day that I worked. I gained a lot of knowledge.
good,"On a typical day, I would walk into the building, clock in, and set down my belongings. Then I would go to my register and count it before I start working. If my register is good and there are not any customers I would go around and tidy up my quad and make sure all the clothes is organized. When a customer was ready to check out I will smile and check them out while holding a nice conversation. The most enjoyable part was when we have food in the break room."
good,My coworkers really made this job bearable. Most times we would stay late after closing to clean up from the days activities and there would be mountains of clothes collected. The coworkers I had were of so many different backgrounds and ages and I had so much fun and learned a lot about life from working with them.
good,A great work enviroment really good co workers very flexible with your schedule and the only bad thing was the management i could be bette rand could teach you a bit more
good,"Stock schedules were pretty bare, but it was easy work that was over fast.  Opportunities for advancement were pretty rare, I wouldn't have minded being a sales rep to get more hours, but I was refused several times by management."
good,"Good boss, nice co workers.  Enjoyed helping the customers with anything they needed.  No major issues during my time there. Holidays can be a bit stressful."
good,"Friendly environment. Quota push on credit applications, with fair incentives. Has a nice employee discount program for merchandise and services. Would have enjoyed a better amount for the work expected."
good,"JCPenney has employees in and out very constantly because of the poor quality of work. I worked there for 2 years and it took about a year and a half to get a .25 cent raise because that's how long it took for them to even conduct evaluations. They try to deceive you with higher positions with lots more responsibility without any compensation. Managers have their favorites and don't keep up with the staffs needs. "
good,I worked with good people. I enjoyed the relationships I made with those people. The work wasn't difficult. It was hard to move up to management. Didnt feel like I was recognized for my accomplishments and didnt feel compensated for what I provided them.
good,"Omni dept is the only dept which is fun, enjoyable and able to have a stress free day in retail. cashiering is the most difficult aspect of retail but if you are just looking for a job this is the right place to work while your are doing school."
good,"My review was from a long time ago when I was in management.  I enjoyed working here, but I know the culture has changed quite a bit since I left.  It was a good job when I was there."
good,"Store manager does not treat everyone fairly. Can be rude but also it generally comes from wanting the associates to improve. His management style is hard to deal with."
good,"Except for holidays and the summer season, it is extremely boring work. However, you can always find things to do if you look for them. Two biggest problems working here: 1) the general public. 2) even though phones weren't allowed on the floor, it was common to see another employee relaxing in the fitting room texting away, while you are backed up and attempting to run clothes back and forth."
good,"A typical day at JCP for myself was opening the truck, getting merchandise out to the floors before customers enter the store, handling heavy and large boxes, engaging with customers helping them with any needs."
good,Great and friendly customers. Great place to work as a temporary or seasonal job. Have to be competitive with other employees over credit card sales each week.
good,"Operations department, 12 hour shifts, working out of ticket queue, automated and in calls "
good,I gained experience by working at Jcpennys however the management and pay was not the best for what they ask you to do.  he was not the best  ideal job  as a young professional college student.  The Hours and time off was limited and the store was ran unprofessionally overall not very satisfied
good,This company offers great discounts on items you purchase. Very long hours during the holidays. The pay is very low for the job that you do. Management is ok but not the best.
good,"Constantly changing environment kept work interesting and allowed for a high degree of technical growth.  Staffing reductions resulted in large amounts of responsibilities and single points of failure, which kept things challenging.  Culture is very team oriented / collaborative."
good,"I worked at three different locations. Johnson city, TN, Altamonte Springs, FL, and Brandon, FL."
good,"It's an ok place to work, people are nice and hours aren't long. Not really my kind of workplace culture but as far as corporate apparel companies go it's pretty standard - the office is in Soho instead of Midtown which to some people might be a plus."
good,nice clean environment to work. there was drama among employees. the work was easy and simple to follow. though was boring at times. mainly unpackaged freight and stocked to sale floor. had to interact with customers at times.
good,"My job was great and really hard all at the same time.  I processed payroll, schedules, responsible for hiring, training of all new associates.  Upper management really needs to visit more stores and see how things are at the store level.  I was hired as a sale associate and within 3 months was promoted.  I like how they hire from within.  I love working with the customers, but that's also the hardest part of the job at times...working with the public."
good,I worked while attending college I made some good friends there that I still talk to. A lot of your focus is going to be about selling their credit card.
good,When I first started working here everyone was very nice an helpful and would make sure you understood and felt comfortable. Typically as a sales associate you work the register and check customers out and put away the clothes and clean up the tables. You also have to close the registers at night before you leave.
good,Good place to work. Associates feel like family. Company is mare concerned with the bottom line than with the associates. Internal advancements available.
good,"Used customer skills and cash register. Organized merchandised. Re-ticketed items, when there were no price tags. Organized return room. Tagged defective items. When changes are made to the cash register system; learned easily. Helped train new associates. Management was there to assist. The hardest part of the job, was insuring company integrity, by resolving customers problems. The most enjoyable part of the job, was problem solving."
good,"Working at jcp was great until new management came in. Lisa is rude, disrespectful and demeaning. I had to work the entire womens department on my own while still being expected to help ALL customers, put back clothing and not be able to go to the bathroom since there was no one to cover my department."
good,"Wasn't there long so I did not get to take advantage of benefits."
good,"Performed Merchandise associate  duties . Received all sorts of payments, orders and invoicing . Adressed customers needs . Arranged display of merchandise in retail store."
good,It is a great place to work and learn new skills. Not happy they are closing the doors soon and not willing to relocate the call center to keep jobs available.
good,The people are great to work with.  It is a relaxed environment.  A typical day is unloading boxes from pallets and putting the boxes in their appropriate spots in receiving and sorting through the boxes to put the merchandise onto carts or clothing racks to take out onto the floor.
good,I have learned a lot about the merchandising of products and the correct displaying of furniture and other products for customers to view. The fast pace has helped me to improve my skills as a merchandiser.
good,A typical day would be busy cleaning and restocking. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up before closing. Although the pay was bad the company did care about you and your family.
good,Constantly on us about getting credit applications. Putting away clothes and providing a smile and helpful attitude for my customers whom have returned to me.
good,"Usual workday 4-7 hours, start at 5am."
good,very quick paced but will definitely enjoy getting to know the customers and helping them find what they need. management changes quiet a bit and some management is not needed due to their lack of wanting to work.
good,I work for the company for almost 5 yrs. I enjoyed my time with my fellow employees & the department manager. Its a great part time job for someone in school or with a family that's not looking for major commitment
good,"First off, I worked at Jcpenney for a year with little pay. They were hiring new employees at a higher rate than the people who were there first. I was making 8.44 after being there a year while these new employees were making 9+ a hour."
good,"The job is very quick paced. Always try to remember the discounts and where the brand sections are, just in case a customer ask you for a specific brand or if you simple need to go to a certain brand section."
good,I did enjoy working at JCPenney. My manager was a very good manager who took personal interest in making sure all of her team members achieved success.
good,"Working at JCPenney was a fast paced environment, especially when sales were going on. Kept things in order, worked in different areas when needed. I learned how to manager the register which was something new to me and I enjoyed it. Management was helpful and co-worker to. During sales and keeping up with replenishing clothes was the hardest part. The most enjoyable was being able to help the customer find what they needed."
good,It’s a really laid back job! I guess the pay is decent for the type and amount of work you do there! During the holiday season they have daily activities and gifts for you! It’s a really nice atmosphere around that time!
good,"not enough hours and or compensation, no benefits  for part time employees, typical retail employment. sometimes have to many people, other times not enough, can't seen to get the right number."
good,"Relaxed work environment, can get busy and fast past. Unreliable work schedule. As a sale associate you would be standing on your feet all day. You only get a 15 min break for anything less than 7 hours and a 30 min break for more than 7 hours. So it would be a good idea to bring in food. Wear comfy shoes.... your neck and feet will be killing you by the end of the day. Sales associates work at the cash register, do recovery (folding clothes that have been disorganized by customers) and doing put backs(putting back items where they belong since a customer did not want the item). The only thing I didn't like is the unreliable work schedule."
good,Not a bad place to work. The pay was low but for the responsibility it was fair. Management wasn’t the best but they treated everyone fairly. The only bad part of the job was the lack of full time status and the short shifts that you could be scheduled for
good,"Everyday walking in you had a meeting about the day before an the day that's bout to start an what you're expected to do for that day. You was pushed every day for better, you are rewarded for your accomplishments. the only thing really is they over work you, deserve more pay for the work."
good,"Fun to work there, busy, fast paced, customer oriented, Promotional events were often the busiest and most fun. Alot of responsibility laid onto part time workers, no benefits, no pto, no overtime, no holidays off, no guaranteed hours,"
good,A lot of clothing in fitting rooms especially during holidays. If you stay relaxed and just stay focused on getting them clean then it isn't hard. The customers are more than a hand full and management are somewhat fair. Customers ask a lot of questions about products and where things are located as well as prices of items. I learned not to let people get to you because they most definitely will try at this job.
good,"The only thing this company has to offer is an employee discount. The longer you have worked there the better hours you get. Even if you put any availability you will get stuck with the bad shift unless you are old and have worked there forever. Raises are a joke as well. They start you at minimum wage and you pretty much are stuck there unless you work there forever. It is a good starter job, but not worth the effort."
good,I worked here when I was in high school and it was great! My bosses were fun and we had a great time. I actually met some of my best friends today when I worked here. Perfect for high school students.
good,"JCP isn't the type of job to retire from, benefits aren't that good and pay not great. You can't raise a family on that type of money you make there so I only recommend it to highschool or college students with no kids. Raises are on a few cents ever year as well while managers get bigger raises. Management do show favoritism and pressure employee's too much. Moral is also low at the second JCP I worked at but the first one in FL was pretty good. All in all it's a great starter job but wouldn't recommend long term."
good,People surrounding are amazing but corporate are not. Meh pay. Very flexible hours and understanding managers. Love my coworkers. Good if you can work under stress.
good,"I liked selling custom window treatments, however the commission is so minimal and the competition with furniture sales people made the work unrewarding.  Oftentimes, refunds and merchandise returns made commission sales almost worthless."
good,"I like working for JCP because of their excellent discounts. The workplace culture is friendly and inviting.JCP is a great place to work part-time. However, their benefits are lacking for their full-time associates."
good,"I loved the job itself, but my ""team"" wasn't much of a team. I experienced a lot of racist comments from fellow coworkers and management didn't seem to care. Some weeks I didn't get a day off, was promised things that I never received, and when the end of the season was over, no one told me, I just stopped receiving hours."
good,Jc Penney is a very fast paced company in which you are always dealing with the public. Its a great job for high schoolers or those looking for their first experience in Customer Service
good,"Its all about how fast you can move the product. You are put on teams where you score points according to how many trucks you unload. That determines pay. ""How much Freight can you scan in is the name of the game."""
good,the store was clean except for the air vents which would spew dust on the clothing  i mostly worked unloading trucks and getting merchandise to the floor as in most retail the employee is not considered in any way.
good,"A typical day at JCPenney's is very stressful there are various tasks that are required to have a working store. Starting with the customer. At the store our main priority is the customer and that they are satisfied when they leave to do so we are required to greet, thank, and customer service the customer. Aside from we as a team have a quota for credit that we have to push our team to make goal each day. Also. the floor must be at standards for the customer so they can easily find the merchandise that they are searching for.  The hardest part pf the job is having to face different views from general manager, and district mangers voicing their opinion in the set of the floor and them not agreeing. The most enjoyable part of my job is learning new things each and every day. I also love the fact that I am able to interact with various people on a daily basis and working along with my peers/team."
good,"Summary says it all, I worked here for almost 6 years, and only moved up because someone retired. But the pay was not enough, and once I moved up, the company cut my full time position back to part time, so I never received benefits, and only received annual raise twice in the six years that I worked there."
good,"I enjoyed working there in the beginning until the company went through all those changes with appearance, pricing, employment, benefits, CEOs and store mangers. The employees neither the clients were happy."
good,Could be extremely stressful due to lack of management at times or lack of hours. Being scheduled alone made it difficult to fully assist customers at times and when you are trying to meet goals it makes it almost impossible for most associates.
good,"As are many retail companies, JCPenney is competing with online retailers. However, they have plans to keep striving for excellence by taking care of the customers needs."
good,"don't not apply"
good,This is a great place for discounts and sales because you knew them before everyone else plus you had your employee discount. The work days are inconsistent depending on the holidays or store sales. They don't pay as good as they should.
good,I enjoyed working here and as long as you're working they wont mess with you too much. The only downside to working here is the low pay and the fact that you can't enjoy your weekends or the holidays if you work here.
good,worked in the salon as a receptionist and sold product. Received commission for product sold. I was ranked at number one within the district and number 74 throughout the world.
good,I was in pursuit of a career and improved my education to qualify for a higher position but was not given an opportunity as they would come up.  I was overlooked a couple of times even though y recognition and work said differently.
good,"The environment in the workplace can be toxic and sometimes difficult as many of the aspects that are focused on do not help either the employees or the loyal customers. "
good,My experience at JCPenney has been good.It is a great place to grow as a professional and improve in skills required to be successful in any environment.The workplace is very friendly. Some days may be challenging due to customers but  the job teaches me to find ways to become a better individual by dealing with good or sometimes hard situations.
good,"I did enjoy my time there, Its a great place to work if you're in college or high school. Not a lot of room for advancement in the smaller stores. My store closed or else I would have stayed."
good,"At JC Penney, credit and online orders are mandatory. Goals are manageable, but it varies depending on sales, coupons, etc. With the closing of stores, individual store management teams are pushing sales goals now more than ever. Little focus on workers' needs."
good,"Its not bad working there but, u don't get paid enough for all the stuff u have to do that's in ur job title, and then u don't get paid extra for doing all the other stuff outside ur job title."
good,"Fast-paced environment with great challenges, career opportunities, and fabulous benefits. Perfect place for young professionals and MBA graduates. New employees will experience how companies address competitive threats and changes in consumer behavior."
good,it can be a fun place to work at times but it all depends n who you are working with and your job title. This job is very boring at times or extremely stressful due to the way management goes at  certain events coming up.
good,Work environment was pretty relaxed. Nice coworkers. Learned a lot by doing almost every duty except management. Only issue was pay and no raises annually.
good,the biggest problem is never knowing if you will get a full week or not.management is OK they try to be positive they need to listen to the employees more. benefits are important most companies are trying to get out of having good benefits or retirement so in that case jcpenny is not so bad
good,"Love working with customers "
good,Very customer service oriented. People are willing to share their knowledge of day to day duties. Community involvement is important. They do different events such as back pack giveaways.
good,They are very strict when it comes to clock in and clock out also they have you doin more work then 1 person can do. The manager there always had a bad attitude and when i would ask for help or i would give my thoughts on what can help out the work department i was given attitude and wasnt listen to
good,This is a good job if ur in college and need the extra cash and have the extra but not if u looking for steady pay steady hours. They r good for none single parents who.
good,"Worked in mens acc. learned to to size dress shirts and suit coats. was a cashier. wasn't so bad, seasonal employee as well. job was easy, pay was minimum at the time."
good,"A typical day at work would be folding clothes non-stop for 5 hours straight, some customer interaction here and there, but mostly recovering and maintaining the store."
good,I really enjoyed my time working for J C Penny. The work environment was well paced and relaxed. It was a seasonal job that I hoped would have turned into a full time position. That didn't happen but I am grateful for the experience and the opportunity.
good,Just go to do my work.hardest part was coming back from a day off. and u have to fix everything the person did not do.When u have to takeover another persons register. the tilt is short n you get dragged in it to
good,"It's a great job if you're in high school, it is your first job, or just need something for the weekends while in college. It is not a place to grow however. They say they promote within but that is not true. I have been with the company for 2 years and the managers refuse to promote me because they would be loosing an asset to the department that I work in. That is not fair considering I am going to school for Fashion Merchandising, so I would like to go up in the company and I have stressed that on multiple occasions but they do not care. Basically the only way to get hours is if you get credit applications or do whatever the managers tell you to do."
good,Productive work place some days are better than others. It is a great learning experience. A lot of different departments to learn different things. With the new management it is just a lack of communication.
good,"JCPenney was a nice company. I wish I learned more from being employed there. I did learn how to interact with consumers better. Also, learned how to handle difficult people. I did not have much management here, luckily I did have awesome co-workers that were a wonderful help."
good,Its a good place to work at and you get to meet a lot of people because of the many departments here. Downside of this place is hours get cut after holidays
good,"Jcpenny is a fun working environment, but can be very stressful at times and you have to deal with some angry and rude customers, but you do get appreciated for your work. But not as much as you would like."
good,Retail has become an interesting area for work.  Not stable nor does it pay that well.  Would be good if you are only looking for part time but be prepared for ups and downs in the stores needing staffing on any given week.  Good for a first time job
good,"Hard works need to be rewarded and advance, non hard workers needs to know their boundary and rules that should be implemented and abide by. Management needs to know how to implement the rules."
good,"Good training.  Work was fast-paced and yet, relaxed.  Workers all worked well together and cooperated in an exceptional way.  Pay was standard for retail.  Management was good."
good,I worked here for 16.5 yrs and utilized my customer service and management skills! i started here right after high school and worked all through college!
good,It is not a secured job because it's not known how much longer retail companies will be around for.  No chance for increase in pay once you reached your maximum production pay grade.  Poor health benefits.
good,Nothing horrible about this place just definitely not something I would go back to. The job was just not for me. Too much standing around waiting for things to happen.
good,"Working at JC Penney gives someone many tools that will be helpful for other jobs in the future, but you have to be willing to give it 110 percent. Overall would recommend."
good,Helping customers find their right style and making sure that they leave with the best experience and go above and beyond for them and make sure that they continue to come.
good,"You have to be tough mental cause those customers can get to you. Its a fast pace job and is only meant for certain people. If your super kind hearted, this job will tear you apart mentally."
good,customers are extremely nice but management needs some help they are not always on the same page and is confusing at times who to listen to. overall its still not so bad to work their.
good,Great place to learn the aspects of buying and learning how to run a big box retail system.  I would give a thumbs up!  Great start for a recent college graduate.
good,It is a good starting point for recent hs grads and hs students to get some experience under their belts. It is a tad stressful only because of the fast pace and high expectations they set.
good,Fun coworkers and amazing customers.  There seemed to be a lack of focus on some issues that felt important to me. I was given a lot of creative autonomy to set things up the way I wanted them.  The management team really cares about employees. Overall I'd work there again
good,My work  experience at JCPenney's was  definitely a interesting one because it changed my views on customer service and how it truly  where you have to be patient with certain  situations and problems.
good,"They treated their employees well, we were encouraged to get applications for the J C Penney credit card and were give $3 cash for each app we turned in, we were also recognized on a white board each day for who had the most commissioned and non commissioned sales each day. Sales floor was very large in each department so you got very tired walking it on a long shift!! My manager was a stuffed shirt but the others were pretty nice, I worked with a bunch of nice ladies in the men's department and also worked in receiving if they needed help. Enjoyed helping men pick out the right dress shirt and accessories to go with their new suits,"
good,I would check in at the studio before going on my in-home appointments. These varied daily and while there I would access the customers needs and advise products and courses of action. Upon returning to the studio I would place the orders and follow up on previously placed orders.
good,JCPENNEY was just all about getting a customer to sign up for a JCP card which I did not like that much because it was almost as if us as employees were forcing the customers to do something they did not want to do.
good,The management and people here were great. Was not the most flexible job for me since I am a student and there's not a lot of chance to grow. Great experience though
good,my experience at this job is getting stressful and could be better. They are low on staff for kids department and majority of the time i'm always closing by myself.
good,It was a great job to have during the holidays because it was a second income and help me find great gifts for friends and family.  I enjoyed the job so much I stayed on after holidays and then they began to down size and cut many hours.  I soon just stopped asking to be scheduled.
good,"A day at work is typically busy and filled with problems. It was fun, the workers got along as a family, we watched each other grow and graduate (from high school). We were there for each other and loved each other (sometimes). The management was great at first but slowly started to breakdown along with many other things. Computers were constantly crashing and areas were overstocked to the point were clothes and other products would spill. It was simply cluttered. Workers were forced to comply with things that seemed to be against company policy due to the customer's rage and the manager's compliance. Workers are often left alone on registers with no help and the scheduling was constantly fluctuating and out of balance. However, working there has made me grow and the customers could either truly ruin your shift or make it the best time on Earth."
good,"All they care about is getting numbers.  Seems like that's what the job is, but it cuts into the moral of employees.  New manager seems to hire young girls, who do nothing but stand around.  You must push sign-up people to credit cards.  And I mean push to the point where some customers get mad.  Management seems to hide in the back until a customer gets mad and calls for them.  Fun at times, but over all I would not recommend."
good,Management was not hands on and rejected supervisors that were. Typical day was nonexistent as tasks varied widely.  Workplace was fun and I looked forward to going into work daily.
good,"If you need a place to gain experience with work this place is a good start. It can be a very fast past job, but there is a lot of slow time depending on what time of year it is."
good,I Work Four days a week and also a Ten hour shift. i enjoy my coworkers. i enjoy the work that i do sometimes it get a little overwhelming but somehow i manage
good,The pay isn't decent and the customers are rude sometimes but you can make great friends here and the hours are flexible if you're attending school. Great customer service experience.
good,I was able to keep busy by going above and beyonce but because of management I was not able to get were I needed because I would not lower my standards for any individual
good,jcp was good to work for even though the management was poor. the physical environment was good and most of the co-workers were good people. the hourly rate was decent and the bonuses were good. benefits were ok except for the pension plan
good,"Working there I thought would be fun, but it had unfair moments and long stressful nights. It really didn't pay enough for having me work overtime a lot. Working with my coworkers was amazing. Everyone was friendly."
good,"It was ok I really never had many complaints , I really just came to work to work. I made the money I made and I just continued on with the rest of my day m."
good,"Penney's is an overall good place to work, but if you struggle with social anxiety it is a nightmare. You are pushed to sale credit cards nonstop, and are encouraged to meet goals by selling the cards. The customer is always right, even when they are terribly wrong, and most managers will not stand by store policies regarding customer transactions, and coworkers."
good,"I worked as a stock associate and it was seasonal the people were great and enjoyable. It went quickly as we unloaded merchandise and folded and organized clothing, toys, shoes, etc."
good,"It's okay. The people can be rude sometimes. You have to clean up a lot because, it's always a mess. They always want you to get people to sign up for the credit card."
good,"Good place for first time workers with costumer care experience. But it's a mentally tasking job as you do the same thing daily. Not a mentally challenging position, but if you like other people, you get to meet new ones everyday."
good,"When there's an event there's usually food where you can eat. However, the manager usually gets subway. So if you don't mind eating subway then this job is for you!"
good,"A typical day at work included managing the sales force, making sure everyone had what they needed, checking sales signs, making sure presentations were nice, ensuring the store was clean, and covered."
good,"Working at JCP, you have a ton of discounts going on every week, and whenever you mess up every customer is extremely rude, also managers are very pushy about reaching ICAPS ( card sign ups )"
good,This is a job where the experience depends on the skill of your management and coworkers. I was often confused as to my duties because 3 different managers would dictate my duties and it always changed.
good,"If you are people oriented, enjoy smiling and providing great customer service, this is for you. "
good,"There were long work hours with short breaks and some employees seemed to have unfair advantages and favoritism was shown often. I gained plenty of skills in cash handling in customer service though,"
good,"this was my first jon and it was seasonal, it has its ups and downs but i strongly recommend it for anyone that's looking for a job, its a great start in a customer service."
good,Jcpenney was overall a good work place but the amount of gossiping and trash talking going on really ruined the experience for me. I thought it would be a professional place of work but even the managers gossip about employees to other employees. I just didn't love the workers there.
good,"the typical day is to much for a high school student whos also involved with marching band when i worked there, the managment was okay not the best, i learned that to many coupons can get you fired."
good,cashier system is really easy. fitting rooms are responsibility of everyone in department no one is designated. you can be very over worked and compensate for others.
good,"Confidential, currently still employed there, so I will not go in to detail. Great place to start your career. Will train with no experience for the right person."
good,"I had an alright time working for JCPenney, the staff was amazing, the hours that I was working were not my favorite, the hardest part of the job was refolding the pair of jeans that you just folded, the most enjoyable part of the job was that I was working with my friends!"
good,Some managers were nice and some werent it depends. Ive been there for almost two years now I wish I could just get a good raise. Went from 9.00-min 10 when the minimum wage went up only didnt even get a raise which sucks cause I work soo hard compared to other associates. Id like it if I could get a good wage and if we get out at the time we are supposed to.
good,"Typical day at work consisted of checking fitting rooms for clothes left behind and putting them back on the racks. Ringing up customers and offering them the JCPenney credit card for additional percentage off. Management wasn't the greatest 6 years ago, as customer satisfaction wasn't in their best interest. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with a clean store during the holidays. The easiest part of the job was interacting with regular customers."
good,I would come in and start folding clothes and as well check customers out at the register and help them with there needs. i leared alot of cusotmer service skills here. i think the hardest part of the job would have been really nothing.. the job was really easy and straigh forward. the most enjoyable part is the interaction of customers and helping them out.
good,"Presented and sold fine jewelry in a professional manner, participated in various incentive contests designed to support achievement of product goals, opened new JC Penney accounts for customers, shared product knowledge with customers while making personal recommendations, worked as a team member to provide the highest level of service to customers, made sure work area was always cleaned and organized"
good,It's an ok working environment. Mostly focused on the productivity of the company. Also more cautious about the safety of the workers. the people are friendly.
good,The other employees there can be nice. The managers lacked communication. It was just a place to work if you need work. I learned how to be self-sufficient.
good,Simply too much to do and not enough people to get it done in the time limits given. Overall it was okay. Pay was acceptable and raises were given pretty regularly.
good,"Any retail job is very busy. At JcP you will either have a very busy or very slow schedule. Sometimes its hard to balance work and life at this job, but it is manageable. Everyone in JcPenney is super nice, and I love the type of work environment that is set. The hardest part of the job has to be customer service. Sometimes it can be hard to handle, but as long as you are polite and honest, everything will turn out okay."
good,"It's not too difficult of a job if you can remain detached. Customers get really upset sometimes and it won't have anything to do with you, but you need not to take it personal. Their attendance policy is strict and they aren't very flexible with schedules. You'll be on the phones all the time, so there isn't much room to make friends. Management is great."
good,"management is the worst, they have no training they basically throw you in the department to sale and you figure it out on your own."
good,Its a good job for young people to get some money for college and the co-workers are nice and support you with the sales. Managers in each department support each other and give feedback to employees and help you gain commission when available.
good,"A typical day at work includes ensuring all customers feel welcome, training new employees, checking customers out at the cash register, and straightening clothing at the end of the day. Working at J.C.Penney has taught me how to work well with other people with different personalities and skills than I. The management at J.C.Penney tends to be inconsistent, The hardest part of the job is being able to have a lot of patience with customers and co-workers. The most enjoyable part of this job is the relaxed work environment and having different projects to do daily."
good,I learned about my overall ability to work with difficult associates and managers while working here. Gave me great experience in personal management.
good,Good transitional job with nice people to work with.  Feels like family working there and I met many good friends.  Because I like the managers and associates I do not want to put down anything negative.
good,"I moved through this job fairly well but there was no give in hours worked to compensate for family time plays musicals school performances, the pay could of been better was not enough for a family with a single income to meet expenses."
good,They can't give full time unless your a manager and they have no management positions available.  And some of the managers are very rude to there employees.
good,"This job was my first real life experience job and it was ok. I made great friends with my coworkers, I did my job very well doing more than what I was supposed to do. I was hired as a seasonal, I mainly folded clothing within a section, organized the hangers, made the store look presentable. I never got taught how to do cashiering even after asking from the moment I got hired. My supervisors were great, teaching different skills and always greeting me making sure I was okay. My coworkers are the best, I love and miss them all. The hardest part of the job was being fired for calling out one time because I was really sick and needed to rest seeing as how I go to school and was working here and volunteering elsewhere, and the cold was getting to me as well. But this job was a good experience, I know how they are now, and hopefully ill find something better."
good,"I have been working at jcpenney's for a long time and I have noto liked the direction the store is going. The store used to be such a friendly environment, filled with people working hard as well as having fun and store and staying productive. Every holiday and special event was really something to look forward to in the store and everyone respected and worked well with the other. However, with recent management things have really gone downhill. The managers are rude, they don't have any compassion for associates, and expect too much out of a less than minimal staff leaving associates to be the ones to take the hostility of angry customers. Not to mention the high rate in which people apply and then quit. Many of the managers do not know the information about the store that they should either. It has become an incredibly unpleasant work environment over all."
good,"Every day was a new experience, you were given new customer to "
good,"As a first job, this was a great start. Great customer interaction time. Great training crew, really prepares you for customers. Typical day was ringing up sales, folding clothes"
good,"Unloading the truck unpacking the merchandise, organize, size and colorize the merchandise put it out on the floor where it belongs in each department. Also help pricing team with mark downs and customer service. Taking merchandise out of the stock room to keep it clean and organize so we can drive sells up."
good,The job overall was fun but a lot of the time many employees felt unappreciated and just no incentive. I had a friend who worked for the company for two years and never received a raise or anything although she had high JCP Credit Card sales. So this is a good job if you are trying to build some form of retail hours but besides that at least for the location I worked it it was definitely nothing special or to write home about. Stay for at least a year and keep your mind open to better opportunities out their.
good,this was a fun job to have had. I spend most of my time on the sales floor. I enjoyed working with Fine jewelry. the women I worked with at the time where 40 years older then me and it gave me a great advantage.
good,"If you're just starting off or going to school, then this company is a good one to work for. The hours are flexible and the pay is decent. The associate discount is always a plus! However, if you are looking for a career in retail I would suggest against this company, or at least this store. There is something to be desired of the general manager and the possibilities of advancement are slim to none. But, if you enjoy working with people (and can muster the patients of a saint from time to time) then it is a great place to work!  Wonderful for a nights and weekend sort of job."
good,"Always on point with everything and very organized . Need to be on time clock in & out at the right time ."
good,"Not exactly the hardest job, and paid that way. Very cheap company that treats you as expendable and demands the most out of you with nothing in return."
good,"Working in the jewelry department of JcPenney consists of assisting customers with  important jewelry purchases, as well as assisting with minor watch repairs. When not assisting customers we insure that all the jewelry is in its proper place and tagged with the appropriate price and sale price. "
good,"Good company before the closing of different stores. Each department use to have a department manager, but after closing many stores two managers overseer the entire store, difficult. The typical work day consisted of customers trying to bring back items used from decades ago without a receipt, lol. The culture was fun for which there were everyday morning meetings with celebrations to the employees. Employee appreciation was important but they began to forget about their managers. The hardest part of the job was during the holidays, you work all around the clock but you miss our those hours not being with your own family for the holidays."
good,"The people are absolutely what keep me at JCPenney. The current CEO has a solid vision & great work ethic and the teams are working diligently to turn things around, but retail is tough. So far, I have been comfortable working long hours to contribute to moving things in the right direction because the pay is competitive & you get the sense that all of your co-workers are working toward the same. That said, management is under a great deal of pressure & the teams have been cut to bare minimum numbers at corporate. It's rough to work as hard as the teams do & not see the stock/customers responding as quickly as we'd hope. Some of the financial perks help, but we're human & fatigue is setting in for some."
good,"Overall, it was a good place to work.  Management was nice and easy to get along with.  The only downside was getting off during holidays or during a busy season.  This is something that comes with retail though."
good,"The work environment was pleasant, and helping out guests was rewarding as well. Management was encouraging as well. The only down side is the long hours on your feet and short breaks, for slightly higher than minimum wage salary."
good,"Originally hired for price changing, moved into the stocking and shoe departments. Nice, friendly work environment."
good,"A typical day was nice and quick moving. Fun, exciting, tolerante place.I learned how to communicate well with other's including the customers and it was a nice experiance. The management was nice and open minded people. The co-workers well they were ok, we all worked together so it was a good team. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with certain non-happy customers but being calm help deal with the situation. The most I enjoied was that it was a nice open minded place."
good,Having a typical day at work requires me to be aware of my jobs duties. I would make sure my area is well organized and my racks we well set up.
good,"I worked at Jcpenney Salon for a long time. The amount of foot traffic and all the tools the company provides to help you build your clientele, is amazing. You get to create your schedule, benefits, 401K, plus a store discount. The only downside to working here was the pay compensation. They no longer did hourly+commission, it was just hourly and everyone had to start from the bottom and work their way up again to higher pay. It was minimum wage. I feel that with some stylists' including myself, whom had a large clientele and provided a lot of services for the company everyday, week, month, and year, should have been viewed differently as far as pay went. I was no longer able to afford to work there and take care of my household. It was devastating to say the least, because I thoroughly enjoyed working there and management was great to their employees."
good,"There aren't many ""typical days"" in retail. Be prepared to review business acumen to access wins and opportunities, willing to be creative with set designs, willing to be stretched very thin with responsibilities, every store is different and that goes the same for management,"
good,If you are one of the luck one to make it. It a good place to work. The co- worker are good people to work with. Management need a little help
good,"I learned a lot working at JCPenney, many good things.  Work/Life Balance in a big box as a manager is non-existent.  I loved the people I worked with."
good,Working at JCPenney was very fast and up beat I mostly loved working the holidays because there was always something to do.
good,If you want to work for a company that doesnt care about there employees this is the place for you. No Hours No money No raises but you get a good discount
good,Customers are difficult managers are unorganized and the pay  is low. Cross sales is a big part and you do get small rewards for that. its not a hard job but it is tedious.
good,Well JCPenney is an okay job to have. I've learned a lot being there gained a lot of customer service skills as well. You have to have a lot of patience.
good,Appears to be family like yet it does not fulfill the needs to provide for your family. Change of management every year with one person losing his or her job
good,"JCPenney taught me to be good at anything you do. Being a department store, there are many opportunities to learn a variety of things under the same roof."
good,Providing fantastic customer service and supplying clothing on sales floor. Enhanced my social interactions and communication with associates and customers alike.
good,"I very much enjoy working with customers and my co-worker the only  complaint I had was the management. The managers were very mean and flip floppy, but it did teach me how to still work hard in a uncomfortable environment."
good,"this would be a great place if you wanted a part time job, my hours went from 40 to 20 in a matter of months.my job want also liquidated twice will i was there."
good,"Its a great way to start and build you career, the job offers lots of support and movement to higher teers in the company.it also has a high demand for walkins so it makes it easier to build youself up in the industry."
good,"Since I've been at JC Penney for over a year, I've learned a lot about the job from sales, support, and pricing. Its not the work that I like but the people that I work with. The hardest part of it all is trying to get everything accomplished all at once."
good,"A typical night (it was originally a second job) at work consisted of straightening up the children's departments (or the various women's departments), working as a team. Having done this kind of work before, it was often long, tedious work. Give or take the occasional nitpicker, the management was at least helpful, with no drama/strife from the co-workers."
good,Business was very slow.  Alot of one time customers. Walkins and appointments excepted. Fall and winter months extremely slow.  Management is cool. Hardest part is building a steady clientele.
good,Great place to work until you make too much or receive too much in benefits then you're gone. No warning or indication of job loss.
good,"I loved my fellow employees that I would see on a daily basis, but the management was kind of a mess. The salary management anyway. The Human Resources Supervisor is very inappropriate. She will tell you very personal facts about herself. The merchandise Manager and HR manager and friends and will sit and talk in their office for hours. They aren't willing to help you, when they're both working, because they would be too busy gossiping about fellow employees. A typical day at work is seeing them chatting on the sales floor, ignoring customers. But, a lot of the older, regular employees are very easy to talk to, and will help you when a problem arises."
good,"severely understaffed. management could use more training on time management. People are friendly, and feel fulfilled at end of the day."
good,"co workers were nice and friendly.  management was not the best, lots of favoritism and unprofessional. not a lot of help from management"
good,"A typical work day for me at Jcpenney typically went as follows: I would clock in and begin to take incoming calls from customers and assisted them with a wide variety of issues such as account help, account trouble shooting, providing tracking information on certain orders, as well as assisting with placing some of those orders and even giving credits on accounts when justified."
good,"We work together as a team when prepping the truck, no supervision around too much.. To keep things running I usually take the lead, but we work together.  There is a different standard for the sales floor and our team of support"
good,"If you're looking for a 9-5 kind of job, this is not the place to be a buyer. Upper management doesn't want to hear the real issues on the floor and if you're one to voice concern, you'll be looking for another job quicker than you'll be seeing results."
good,"Typically just did register, a lot of the times when it was busy I would go around the store to different departments and help fold clothes."
good,"Sadly after I spent most of my life working for this company."
good,"I enjoyed working there until I was laid off, even though I was exceeding all of my goals. They often provided food, and the co-workers were fun to work with."
good,Company changed in my time there and the changes have created an unstable work environment. Staff are over-worked and have become disgruntled.
good,"Everyday when I would get into work I would check the scheduled paper to see what department I was in and what my assigned job is.  What I learned from this job is to have patients with people no matter if they are mad, sad old, or just as confused as I am.  I also learned how to multitask.  At this job they had me doing a lot of different things at the same time and i had to get it all done by a certain time.  Management was very nice and some were really good at working with you they were all really good examples and would not let anyone slack off.   I got along really well with my Co-Workers and they felt like my work family.  The hardest part of the job was trying to get people to sign up for JcPenney credit cards.  Not everyone was happy with me asking them if they wanted to sign up so they would get mad at me.  Also not many people have good credit so they wouldn't get one.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when they would have really big sales and everyone is there working together as one big family for example black Friday."
good,"I normally check jewelry in, which is new merchandise. Then I also make sure the customers get their own jewelry that we have sent out to be sized, or repaired in some way. Then I also call to make sure all online orders are picked up in a promptly fashion. I also try to reconcile customers."
good,"Enjoyed the work, the customers, my co-workers, however, there is no way to advance unless you have a friend on the store's management team.  Very inflexible with work schedules.  Showed preference to some employees regarding work schedules."
good,The managers were encouraging and helpful. The co-workers were normally happy and engaged into helping customers. The hardest part of my job was constantly being on my feet. The most enjoyable part was just being able to interact with co-workers and customers.
good,"JCPenney is a friendly workplace environment, I felt welcomed instantly. However, the management team failed to view the salon as a salon business model and modeled it like a retail store. While JCPenney is a retail department store, a salon needs to be run accordingly. The marketing and advertising of the salon was poor, resulting in a low client flow, which continued to decrease in my time with the company. All in all, I don't see JCPenney as a place for a stylist to flourish."
good,My supervisor is very rude and gets away with it .. the store manager is very friendly and cares about all customers and employees
good,"Overall the company is a good place to work, but the hours are too long and the expectations are unrealistic. Working there was a good experience overall."
good,"Can be a good company to work for if you're in the right store, salon was typically pretty empty, great manager, not a good color line to use"
good,"a typical day at jcpenney would be great customer service and laughs with coworkers, but i dont really like the management team i feel as though they are very unorganized. if your not a manager the pay is terrible unless you have no bills at all."
good,"Greet associates"
good,"Coworkers are friendly and lively. Customers can be very nitpicky about their coupons. Hardest part of the job is trying to please everyone involved, but that's always impossible even out of the work environment."
good,I love the energy retail environment has especially during black friday. I love it when it is busy and fun interacting with the customers
good,The best part of my job on a daily basis is getting to meet new people by the minute and connecting with them on a more personal level when it comes to the occassion and a persons personal fashion....Management has a hard way of showing the appreciation for the amount of wpork and time it takes to deal with each and every customer not knowing what to expect.
good,"This job is ok, but I'm looking for more hours and better pay and more flexibility.  I have a lot of experience in management, retail, customer service and sales and I don't get the shifts and departments I would like."
good,I wasn't there very long. I broke my toe during there remolding stage and was let go. The others that I worked with where nice.
good,"If you're looking for a place to make some quick money and they give you the opportunity, take it. It's not terrible and the pay isn't the worst. My overall experience was just okay."
good,"I love my job I enjoy what I do on a daily basis"
good,"Managers are very unorganized, professional once they finally remember about you as an employee but very unorganized."
good,"Like most jobs in retail, it was great workers but the management was subpar. The turn over was high and the veterans were not treated with the proper respect."
good,"In the little over a year that I worked here, we went through THREE store managers. The one they finally landed on was very particular on how hours for employees would be. If you could not work 9am-3pm or 3pm-9pm, you would not be working there at all. He also would only schedule you for 2-3 days a week. You also only make minimum wage, and I never received a raise in the year I was there. Other than those things, the job itself is not bad at all as long as you like working with customers and clothes. Your co-workers will become like a second family and I enjoyed working with them."
good,"•	Assist customers"
good,"Typical day at JC Penny would include going around the store making sure everything was neatly set. Organizing the store until everything from size to color was in place. Stocking the store if they were out of the jeans in women's see if there were more in back to restock them. Pricing items in the back of the store when new shipments came in. Cashiering when you saw a costumer by the cash register. I learned how to multitask and how important it is for a store to be stocked and organized. The management needs to work on how to listen to employees that have an issue with something instead of ignoring it. Co-workers were upbeat and positive, There were no hard parts about this job. Moat enjoyable was you got to do you own thing and at your own pace,."
good,"The hours were alright, the team was kind but management did not know how to balance a schedule, the HR department was not well managed."
good,They are great with working around your schedule and the job has offered much need working experience. The co-workers are fantastic and make it very enjoyable to come to work. The hardest part about this job is not having enough traffic flow to reached the sales goals given to you.
good,"Good and Bad just like with any place. You will enjoy the people the benefits can better."
good,"A typical day at work now, I open shipment and arrange them on carts coordinating to table sets and locations in the store and then set and re-set departments. When I used to work on the register i learned the most about customer service and how to accommodate for a wide range of customers. With the door to floor team I have learned about organization and delegating  responsibilities. Management has been very unstable for the last couple of years due to the companies change in CEO and change back to the old J.C Penneys. Not much order held with in the store. The coworkers are the highlight of the job, very family like cooperative environment to be a part of."
good,"Although the pay was good, I don't think that this would be a long term job for someone who is trying to move up in the rank. They are very strict about time and if you are only 1 minute late back to work from your break you could loose your job."
good,"On a typical day in JCPenney for me was lovely at times. I would get to work ready and enthusiastic for my customers and the suties of my job. I would grret the customers with very friendly and inviting customer sevice, and assist them with all they may need. Keep store  clean and presentable. Management was around sometimes but not when you really needed them, Some co-workers were more friend based employees, and single you out.The hardest part of this job was the holidays. We had to change the stores around from tip top and put up new fixtures and merchandise. The most enjoyable part about this job was the experience of working in a different field of fire."
good,"There's no room for advancement in the company because it's such a small store. You get one 15 minute paid break if you work 6 hours or less, and one hour unpaid break if you work 7 hours or more. The people there were nice, but management was all over the place. No one was on the same page, and one person was straight up RUDE. JcPenney does offer an online anonymous reporting system. I got minimum wage, and no one got a pay increase for two years. The hardest part is that you are not allowed to confront shoplifters, which is ridiculous. Another thing is the signs. Some aren't right, some are confusing, and it makes the customers argue with you. The best part of the job? Um......"
good,"overall my work experience was great here, strengthen my leadership skills, as well as strengthen my abilities to work alone and with other to complete task required by jobs"
good,It's a good place to get job experience and maybe move up on rank. i basically met alot of people who'd been there for many years and hadn't gotten the raise they deserved.
good,"Made signs, helped customers keep store clean. "
good,"I can't remember a typical day at jcpenny, but I enjoyed working for the company. I learned about there products and how to open up credit cards for customers. I never really had to interact with management but I seen and sometime over heard them getting the job done at hand. My co-workers made the job a lot better because of there positive vibes they gave at the job. The hardest part of the job was the holidays and management because they never really interact with employees, not unless it was important. If opportunity presented itself I wouldn't mind working for the company again."
good,"I wanted career opportunities, there were none and not many benefits. it was a nice discount for jcpenney. I made a lot of new friends! Great clothes and had fun helping customers pick outfits and gifts. I also got a lot of exercise which was nice. Also, we always had a pep meeting to get everyone in a good mood which was really nice."
good,At JC Penny I had a fun time. it was a fun work environment but the pay wasn't good.
good,"I'm not the first one to jump at the chance to work in retail, but JCP wasn't half bad. If you've ever done retail then you know what a headache it can be, but if you have a good team, it doesn't last as long."
good,JCpenny was a enjoyable place to work that allowed merchandise to be purchased at a employee discount. I learned a lot about customer service and working face to face with customers. Co-workers were friendly and helpful.
good,"working at jc penney was my first experience in retail"
good,Very good place to work.  Not much advancement at my store.  Lots of events to keep the associates involved.
good,"Jcpenney has some great advantages. The discounts for the employees and the work environment is great. If you are looking for a job with great benefits, more pay, and extra hours, JCPENNEY will not be the place for you. You may get lucky if you can get 35 to 40 hours every week. Overall, Jcpenney is a good place to start if you do not have any responsible."
good,"We had trucks almost everyday. We would unload the truck, separate the merchandise according tot departments, and then take to sales floor to stock. The co-workers I had made the job fun and exciting. The hardest part of the job was being there at 5am to start working."
good,"JCPenny was an ideal place to work, however management lacked and co-workers had a tendancy to complain on just about everything given about a single work day."
good,this would be a good part time job. This is where I learned the value of great customer service and how to grow in a working environment. The hours are here and there it is retail. But it is flexible if that is what your looking for.
good,JC Penney is a good place to work. The atmosphere changes all the time with the customers. I learned great customer service working here. Employees were great and the pace could be challenging.
good,"While working at JCPenney, I learned to handle myself in different situations. Everyday was a new learning experience because you never knew what kind of costumers or type of activities you had in-store for the day, so it was always exciting. I loved the element of surprise! Not only did I learn how to use a cash register, I also learned how to be a lot more organized with my work and better communication skills."
good,"Worked in the women's department, greeting, and cleaning up. Most of the people there were there to work. The hardest part of the job was the management, treating people like teenagers. Never one to take a long break, would always get told I needed to hurry for a break. Never went over in a break either. Other than that it was pretty good place to work."
good,"I felt like I had no life working here, they didn't treat their employees so well. it was a rough job and to also not being paid as much."
good,"Typical days were standing at a cash register checking out customers while straightening the floor to make it presentable to shop from."
good,"A typical day at work for me is greeting customers and helping customers find what they need, ringing up customers and making sure fitting rooms and merchandise are cleared and clean."
good,It is a great place to work at because everyone is so friendly and we all work as a team.
good,"An environment with a diverse cultural background. Enjoy working with my peers , also enjoyed associating with different customers or patron that comes in the store everyday. Most enjoyable part of my job is help a customer finding and specific outfits that they are looking for .Also , some individuals may be having personal problems or issues but with helping encouraging words can enlighten their face making them  feel better than before."
good,"JC Penney is an alright place to work at. The hours can be flexible, but your availability impacts it greatly. The management is not the best. It is very centered around their own departments. Credit applications are a lead push at this store."
good,Work was pretty good. We had good relationships with customers.
good,"Working at JcPenney was very hard for me. I liked the work and constantly staying busy, but the workers were very judgmental and would talk bad about the customers that weren't easy going. I was outcasted because i genuinely cared about what the customers wanted. The management staff wasn't too bad, but they weren't very honest with me. They had hired me as a regular associate and ended up changing it to me being Seasonal so that they could let me go. The hardest part of this job was the security and honesty because the only people that made me feel welcomed were a few of the assistant managers and the store manager. The best part about the job was the work, i sincerely enjoy working hard and feeling accomplished at the end of the day and JcPenney provided me with that."
good,"Typical sales coordination position and fast-paced. Your co-workers become family, but there isn't much room for development."
good,it was a nice job for it to be my first job. i enjoyed my co workers but not so much the management the mangers was cool though. you do alot alot alot of work but your pay checks dont reflect on
good,"I worked for JCP for almost 8 years. In that time I went through 5 department managers. I loved all but 1, he was not a pleasant person to begin with, then add the stress of being over worked on top of it and who could blame him for being cranky all the time. The top management over works the lower management and treats their employees like trash. It trickles down to the employees. Some highlights of the job were the people I worked with everyday. some became my best friends. The job its self is not hard or difficult. I think the hardest part is standing around trying to figure out what to do next."
good,I enjoy working with a team. I m very dependable but I need a better schedule set for my young children. This job requires a couple nights a week to work and every weekend. Im a single mother so its important that I have that time with them.
good,Enjoyed working with my supervisions before they fired most of them. Over worked me most of the time. Especially during the holidays.
good,"I loved the decorating and consulting side of this job, but not the sales side."
good,"Unloading Trucks"
good,"Most of my duties involve ringing people up and making sure that the storefront is kept clean and safe. It might sound a little mundane, but I get true satisfaction from making sure that all of our customers have the best possible retail experience. I have found that if you are honestly happy to help others, no matter what the circumstances, your effort is appreciated and a positive experience has been added in association with our company name. People don't always shop in certain stores for the prices or the products although those things to come into play. They also shop for the experience that they receive when they walk into the door. All of our managers are extremely positive and upbeat which helps to keep the rest of our team encouraged as well for those days when we really need it. The hardest thing to deal with on the job is customers that are rude or inconsiderate of the work that you do to help them. Although this can be trying and discouraging I have learned not to take people's negative attitudes personally. My favorite part of my job would have to be the complete opposite of my least favorite. I truly enjoy helping people find what they are looking for. There are some people that are honestly appreciate the time and effort that I put into finding what works for them."
good,"While this job did give me the experience with a cash register, it had limited growth opportunity. Applied many times for advance placement and company ended up hiring outside. Management at the start was well and fair and that manager was transferred. New management was very controversial on methods."
good,"I worked in the shoe department. A typical day at work included maintaining professional-looking displays, helping customers find shoes that were a good ""fit"", and ringing them up."
good,Main responsibilities included checking customers' purchases and completing cash and credit transactions.  Organized Women's department and kept online clothing items neatly folded or correctly placed on racks.  I assisted with online ordering for customers when items were not in stock.
good,"Strategy changes due to poor company decisions has made it a very tough couple of years.  The people that work there for the most part are great and very welcoming.  Pay is above average, but it is difficult to get a raise unless you move positions.  Great facility and beautiful campus."
good,"I enjoyed working there part of the time. Half of the managers would treat you well, as others were not so kind unless you were management."
good,"A typical day at work would be very busy cleaning and hanging up clothes."
good,"We open registers, raise cases arrange jewelry according to planogram and according to core standards.  Responsible for receiving jewelry and repairs (notifying customers), taking care of defective and returned merchandise all while maintaining sales goals and quotas  I like the smaller store, the associates and the personal attention we get to achieve with our customers."
good,Not very friendly people. a lot of cliques start to form in store.
good,they treat you like family. good place to work. easy to move up
good,Working with my Sephora team was amazing love love love them!!
good,A typical day at JC Penny consisted of greeting each and every customer who walked through the door. I would enjoy approaching customers and offering my help and later following up if they declined. I  handled sales transactions offer and open credit as well. I handle credit inquiries offer online ordering and processed online orders when they came for pick up. Recovery was a must to help maintain the store .The hardest part was not being able to working among people who didn't love their job . The most enjoyable part of my day was  when customers would thank me and mention me in the survey.
good,"It's a fun Warehouse to work, just to many people there whom don't get along with each other."
good,Didnt Mind It. I do not want to review anymore but Indeed makes you type a minimum of however many words.
good,"political bullies, other than that it offers good benefits."
good,"I am currently a seasonal support specialist if you want to put into technical terms. Basically everyone that works there can do anyone's job, except for management of course. Everyone that I worked with was kind and friendly, although with every job you always have that one guy or girl that is grumpy. Management was very cool and fun! The best part of the job was helping people find something or just talking to people, I learned a lot from some of the customers. The one gentleman I spoke to told me that he used to work for JC Penneys back in the 40's, he had a very interesting story. The worst part of the job was when it got boring and there was nobody in the store, then the time just drags. The pay isn't good but I didn't expect it to be, but as a worker you get a 25% discount on anything in the store which is awesome!!! So if your seasonal make sure you take full advantage!   This rating is in comparison with a perfect job."
good,"I worked in the holiday season back in Nov in 2011 I liked the job at first but began to lose interest in it after I saw a lot of people laid off after the holidays was over. Working in my department felt competitive and felt like workers would rat on you for small things or mistakes. I feel a lot of seniors did not like the new brands or renovations to the store, sort of like pushing them aside. They would complain for no items in stock or cheap brands, they were used to good brands with good quality. You are also expected to sell a lot of membership cards but what if they don't get approved your sales will definetly go down, and have to deal with managers."
good,"This was also a temp service job. I liked the pay, but i did not like that some days you came in just to get sent home."
good,"I filled the role, I was an excellent cashier and I never made any mistakes.  I also learned a lot and had fun,  I met a lot of return customers.  They took our commission away a week after I was hired.  I sold many men's suits that season I worked there about 1 year.  I  tried to live on their 6.00 an hour."
good,"JcPenney is a fast paced environment. In retail, just like any other place, there are the good and bad type of customers. The service will always be positive and customer first objective. I have learned that a back up plan is always needed such as school. This place is God's waiting room because it is hard to prosper from JcPenney; however, I do imagine the same goes to any retail store. It is easy to be recognized, but hard to be appreciated for excellent work. Have an education and keep moving ahead in life."
good,"My day would normally start with seeing who I am working with. I head to my department,check the fitting rooms, put clothes away (if any), and I check if there is any projects or ask if managers need help. I use the cash register, I helped customer when needed too. I've learn how to be more independent when it comes to making decision for the my department. I've learn other people jobs so I can help. Mangers enjoyed my company, but many were unprofessional. My co-worker are amazing. The hardest part of the job was when it became and I didn't get much help. I love the customers. I had amazing time with my customers."
good,It was a job.I worked solo on second shift and reported to no one.I learned to follow my gut when problems arose and most of the time I solved the problems correctly. My boss was very busy so he trusted me to do the tasks he set before me. The hardest thing about the job was having to lift 50 lb. The best part was working solo.
good,Morning meetings with reviews of store goals for the day and any other concers based on days before always great communication and team work. I have learned great time managment and setting personal goals. The most engoyable part of my job is providing excellent custumer service when customers come back and have great memorys of you.
good,"Typical day included cashiering, reviewing orders and assisting customers with orders. Management was attentive and helpful. My co-workers were fun to get to know and work with. The hardest part of my job was having to get up at three in the morning to be at work by four on holidays. The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing I was keeping my customers satisfied."
good,"Assist in all facets of sales, trained new employess, balanced cash drawer, responsible for upkeep of fitting rooms, processed credit applications, assist in inventory process, processed catalog orders, validate id."
good,I love my job i work with very nice and knowledgable people. i have learned how to perform many transactions and can accurately and efficiently handle money there aren't really any hard parts of my job but you need to be fast and and know how to multitask. I love helping people smile cause they found that special piece for them selves or their loved ones.
good,"it was a nice place to work, decent pay, great people. I might work there again."
good,"As a shoe sales associate, helping customers find the correctly sized shoe in their desired style was the main task.  This often involved running a cash register and working with other employees to handle large numbers of customers."
good,"Work load is too big and pay to little, definitely a job for a high school student. You will not get hired full time, maybe the most 4 days a week. the store closed at 9 and we would stay until 11 p.m. and 2 a.m. during the holidays. little room for advancement and raises are pennies. On a positive note the discount is great and customer service is excellent, will go above and beyond for the customer."
good,"Typical retail job. Loved my coworkers, but hated that they would hire new people while still cutting current employee hours."
good,There was not much I enjoyed about working for JCP.  Retail is not for everyone.  
good,This was my first main job. I loved it!!! I made advancement from pricing associate to visual merchandiser. This was in about a year. I also learn how to be on the repleshment team. By 2 years I control the mens and home departments. Only thing I hated was how stressed out managers would get over cooperate. Plus the pay wasn't that amazing. 
good,"A typical day at JCPenney involves greeting each and every team member and each and every customer. Each day at JCP offers new and valuable information especially since the company's change within the last year. Team members vary in age, from 18 to 70 something and stil each member learns something new daily, from how to work the libby's, company policies, new clothing lines, etc. Management at JCP works on an open door policy which is the best thing about the managment however, the job security in managament is not very good, and neither is advancing for sales associates. I enjoy my co workers at JCP they are all lively, extremely knowlegeable about the clothing, clothing lines, and very customer focused. My coworkers make the job so much fun and exciting. The most enjoyable part of the job is a satisfied customer and my fun coworkers."
good,"JCPenney is a great company to work for as a part time job as long as your schedule fits around theirs. Since JCP went through all the pricing changes over the last 2 years there have been mixed reviews about the way JCP does business. Although they are almost always hiring, the management at the Sioux Falls location expects associates to have perfect attendance, even if the associate is clearly sick. The management wasn't usually understanding over the entire time I worked there."
good,"Schedule day to day work activities such as marketing, pricing and singing events. Coach team members in customer service, selling techniques and store merchandise updates. Meet with Store Leader and review current weeks progress and update next assignments. Coordinate weekly freight projections and adjust schedules accordingly. The most enjoyable part of my  job is the interaction between myself and customers, identifying their needs and finding products to match those needs. I enjoy coaching team members in customer service, spotting and develop talent. Create presentations and visual aids for company meetings, weekly work schedules and daily work assignments. "
good,Once an associate is known as a good worker the employer takes advantage and abuses the associate. The moment the associate is unavailable they are shunned and hours are cut.
good,The JcPenny catalog ordering center closed down over a year ago but it was cool while it lasted.
good,"Alright job, pretty boring and tedious. Worked too many hours and closing shifts."
good,"A day at work consisted of ringing up customers, checking fitting rooms, returns and ordering items online for customers if we didn't have the item in stock. At closing we had to recover the store. That was a major flaw at that store because it was a model store eveything had to be picked up organized and folded no can leave untill the entire store was clean. So if you were closing you had to stay beyond your scheduled shift. Working here is like working with family eveyone gets along I made a lot of great friends here. Management was ok they were there for you when you needed them."
good,Loading trucks.  The co-workers were a good bunch of people. The hardest part of the job was the quota's that had to be met.  The co-workers were fun to be around
good,Good people to work with understand family and having kids. Hours are bad though work nights weekends and holidays 
good,"The hours were long, but bearable. I learned how to deal with negative energy within the work place. I didn't care for parts of the management. Some of the managers were mean, made us cry, and were mean to the customers. The co-workers on my team were great most of the time, but there were times some of them were lazy and I and 2 other people had to pick up their slack. The hardest part of the job was working until 2 am on a school night. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to get work experience as well as making new friends."
good,Great place to avoid a desk job but retail drains your energy and its hard to advance past store roles 
good,"Great people, you get out of it what you put in to it. JCPenney has wide variety training in the Loss Prevention field. Corporate office is in an uproar. Not the company it once was. Hopefully they find there way back. "
good,"Jcpenney's is an alright place to work if you are in school and not paying bills. The managers can be unfair sometimes but that's life, you have to deal with unfair things. My reason for leaving jcpenney's is because they do not pay enough and i am looking for better opportunities. If i get a job with you all i will be sure to work very hard and complete every task that needs to be done just like i did at every other job."
good,Great place for advancement although managment tended to micro manage and constantly had something to pick apart. Co workers were very petty and not interested in team work. I enjoy being a hairdresser and the oppurtunity to meet different people in different walks of life.
good,Very busy. Management needs improvement. Fairly flexible hours/work schedule. Enjoyed meeting and helping hair clients.
good,"As everyone knows, J.C. Penney is going through many changes. There is no doubt that most employees are wondering right now what ""color"" category they are in. On the other hand, the people I worked with were very friendly and I wish them the best."
good,I enjoyed working with customers and gaining retail experince. Also got a chance to get discounted real and costume jewelry during the holiday season.
good,"With the uncertainty of the company right now, things are very scary. I love the people I work with and the merchandise. The new CEO and his strategies scare me. We have lost alot of great people, yet they still hire for the positions they vacated. This does not make good business sense to me. Things are very uncertain. You do not know if you will have a job from day to day. I realize all jobs have a certain amount of stress, but not 24/7. I want to work, I love to work. Retirement is not the option I want to look forward to and Penneys at this time is not helping."
good,"Typical day at work would be answering phone calls, making appointments, helping customers, filing paper work, stocking shelves and entering daily lab. I learned all my customer service experience through JCP. Management is changing a lot but is good. Co-workers are nice. Nice to work with. There was no hardest part to the job well dealing with diverters. Enjoyable part was them working with me personal schedule to accommodate my family."
good,folding cloths give out gift baskets and greeting any customer that comes in your way
good,"Starting a day at JcPenny was walking in to chaos if certain staff members were working. The positive part of working there was the customers. the satisfied look on their face after assisting them was enough gratification one needed in knowing that the accomplished what they clocked in to do. As far as management, really never associated with her or got to know her so couldn't comment."
good,enjoyed talking to the customers and working with clothes. Some days were hectic but others were okay.
good,"my typical day was usually slow, having clothes to straighten, some customers to help, other days would be really busy. Some of the management were pretty disrespectul, I loved almost all of my co-workers they made working a lot better and more fun, the hardest part of my job was having to keep clothing straight and neat even after a customer destroys a table or shelf. And the most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers and sometimes I would have a lot of fun with my customers. I learned that a department store, especially the size of jcpenney, takes a lot to maintain and to keep neat and clean"
good,I was a cashier at jcpennys and also worked on the sales floor.
good,Typically busy during Christmas holidays but moderately slow thereafter. I've learned how to count real diamonds. The management is awesome. My co-workers are great for the most part. The hardest part of the job is making sure everything is done at the end of the day being that there's a lot of responsibility required. The most enjoyable part of the job is a great discount.
good,it was a okay job! not the greatest but not the worst either! you had you customers that love you and you had the ones that hated you. but it all was okay. some days were better than others. it was a stressful place to work at because of all the constant changes.
good,"The associates were all really nice, but the managers didn't really listen to the needs of customers or the needs of the associate. It was a great 2 years of working there but they really need help in the management retail department."
good,"A typical day at work involves problem solving and being the best customer sales associate that I can be since we once worked off of commission. I learned patience, better analytical skills, customer service. The management is not the best that it can possibly be. The co-workers make an excellent team and work hard together. The hardest part of the job is the amount of hours that the associates receive which is very minimal. I enjoy being praised when I accomplish something great."
good,"The job was easy, but could be stressful and frustrating also. The pay was low with little opportunity for raises. Once the holidays started they scheduled me as much as my availability would allow, which didn't leave any time for homework or family."
good,I would help out every customer that needed my help rather it was in my home department or another. I would do my all time best to show that customer a product he or she was interested in. I would cash them out at the register or return an item they wanted to bring back or even exchange the item for them. I would bring out stock as need and rearrange the department as needed.
good,good opportunities within the DC's if willing to relocate. Corporate was very unstable as positions get eliminated often and lack of security among workers often cause safe decisions and micromanaging.
good,"Productive and fast pace,learn team work,no management,got alone with them and team player,the hardest is pushing cart everyday thats was to heavy,most enjoyable was serving the customer."
good,Retail provides interactive opportunity with customers to provide a great shopping experience.
good,"JCPenney was once a great place to work for. However, due to corporate restructure, most experienced managers and associates were replaced with younger, inexperienced personnel. Current focus of upper management seems to be more about getting ahead than the caring culture it used to be. Job security is a thing of the past."
good,"check out customers ok management,cool co-workers. Nothing hard about it just not enough hours to pay my bills"
good,"A typical day of work consists of counting money, folding clothes all day, being on your feet for about 8 hours which at first wasn't too easy, making sure all is organized and where it belongs. I learned to provide people with good customer service and helping them with their needs in a kind matter and patience! Management and co-workers wasn't the best of people but you learn to get along and make it work cause it's all you got. The job was fairly simple, not hard in any sense but well I enjoyed when I got paid the most. Hard work pays off!"
good,"A typical day at JC Penney depended on the day of the week, but most of the time it was an enjoyable day with a comfortable amount of customers shopping everyday. The management there were cool, but gave most of the hours available to their favorites. Most of the co-workers there were friendly and willing to help at all times. The hardest part of the job was dealing with uncooperative customers, while almost everything else was enjoyable."
good,"Very fast pace environment. I lead 5 to 8 people a night in price changes store recovert, store set sell(product fixture placement) key holder manager on duty every night during closing cash handle as well as providing customer service"
good,friendly coworkers and easy job doing customer service. over time was awsome. i was killing the hours during the holidays but as soon as the holidays were over its back to part time hours.but i had to leave because i got bored doing the same thing everyday. i wanted to do something different
good,Typical work day: provide customer service
good,Jcpenney was a great learning and culutarl workplace. Penneys was very diverse and they believe in promoting diversity. I had the oppurnity to work in each departmnet and learn about the whole Jcpenney network...
good,It was a pretty decent place to work. When I returned to school my boss gave me the option of quit or be fired. If I was fired I would never be able to work for the company again. This was because I was no longer available to work the hours she wanted and was not willing to work with other availability for me.
good,"I Loved Working there doing what i do best. I went to a rehabilitation center after I got fired , I have been sober since."
good,A typical day is a busy day and lots of customers. The fast pace is nice but the work is not and the management is lazy they usually sit in the back and conversate or walk the floor to give you an assignment that they wouldnt do themselves
good,"Recent experience: as Fine Jewelry Specialist, learned how to check stones and rated, plesant environment fun to work but not enough money to provide for the family."
good,It was an overall good place to work. The associates were friendly and easy to get along with. The management was okay. A typical day at work was greeting customers and helping with the purchases. The hardest part of my job was dealing with very difficult customers which was not very often. The most enjoyable part was being able to interact with the people.
good,-I learned how to manage people in an ever-changing environment
good,"Great customer service, cashier, maintaining floor and having customers apply for credit cards."
good,Good working conditions but no job security for anyone right now.
good,"Don't have much of a life working odd hours and no set schedule. It is not a bad place to work, I just feel that they promise you so much but then don't follow through with their promises. It is a very diverse group of people and I do like that about the company."
good,"great work staff,"
good,Loved the job and helping people make good decisions. Zero sense of security on job future.
good,"I only worked there for the holiday season but from what I can deduce, JCPenney is a pretty good place to work. It's standard retail. They had a great break room with multiple vending machines, and even one with frozen meals you could heat in the microwave that was available. Most of the managers were friendly but some were a little unreasonable."
good,Enjoyed working for this company but after five loyal years and great yearly reviews still did not have affect on job security. With the company change a lot of jobs were lost.
good,"A typical day at work was assisting customers with anything they need help with, stock shoes, change the look of the department. I learned nothing really was a easy job. Management was fair to okay didn't communicate that My co- workers were great and helpful. The hardest part of the job was dealing with grumpy customers but i made the best of it and turned most of there atitudes around, and the most enjoyable part was helping customers and making them happy."
good,when my shift start i find my supervisor to see what projects she have for me for the day.
good,"I like the flexibility of the hours for when I was in school, and helping people find the products they need. I didn't like the late hours that we are open sometimes. I think that the management reward those who are the best and brightest without doing so, the best will leave for better."
good,Store has new management . cut in hours and not enough organization
good,evaluated the sales floor on what needed to be done and prioratized to get it done in a timely manner.
good,"The employees were wonderful to work with but the management, I felt that they different really respect the employees to well. I learned to have alot patience will working in retail."
good,it has a good variety of different jobs at Jcpenney. Its secure and have a good value of customer service.
good,"A typical day at consist of opening the register, helping customers with their needs and also keeping the work place neat and tidy. I learned a lot from working in retail. You meet many different people of all races. My co workers were very helpful and outgoing. The hardest part of my job was when it sometimes became fast paste but we got through it."
good,jcpenney was the average political and inward thinking corporate experience.
good,"A typical day is to open and and wait for customers to come into the furniture department and showcase our beautiful pieces. I've come to learn that my customer service skills have not dulled in any sense and I love to help people in any way I can. The customers are the heartbeat of the business, they deserve the best that comes from me. I've noticed management's main concern is cutting hours, overworking the employees for as little as possible, and doesn't care if people have rent to pay or mouths to feed. They are only offering 8-12 hours a week for 3/4 of staff. Management receives the full 40 hour week schedules, not the employees, who make the store run on all ""cylinders"". Co-workers there at J.C. Penney's are great, we work as team and will always help cover each other and help in any way we can to lift each other up. We like to have everyone succeed. That must be one of the enjoyable part of the job, also helping the customers is the # 1 enjoyable part of job."
good,Opened safes for merchandise to be pulled and set up in cases. Opened registers for buisness. Verified Diamond count from night before. Checked Emails for updated infromation needed. Process paperwork for repairs to be shipped out. During certain days checked
good,I had no benefits since I worked part-time. I was scheduled to work from 10 to 32 hours depending on the week it was. Holidays were always a plus.
good,"A typical day at JCPenney catalog department would include opening registers, greeting all customers, answering phones and directing to appropriate departments, placing orders via telephone, internet, and catalog, fulfill all customer inquiries including credit card inquiries and payments, maintaining stockroom and quad, communicating effectively orally and written with managers, customers, and fulfillment centers, making decisions and being a team player. My co-workers were great, we have become like family and keep in touch often. Most enjoyable part of the job was my customers and being able to successfully fulfill all there needs."
good,a good company going through changes do save itself. Good culture and people.
good,Jcpenney was okay. They could of had better management. Thats all I have to say.
good,Just make sure you do your job well. It can be very enjoyable because you meet a lot of different people. The job can be very demanding and you will work many hours due to the retail life.
good,I worked Tuesday to Saturday morning on the Replenishment Team. We worked between 7-9 am to 1-2 pm. It was good. No one was on your back and team work depends on who you work with like any job.
good,"typical day at work involves:doing manicures and pedicures and in between answering phones,confirming,making,rescheduling appointments properly so there's no over booking,ringing up customers,cleaning work station, wash towels and restock back bar.hardest part was no team work for all those duties and enjoyable part was customers appreciation."
good,"business model is changing rapidly, new concepts everyday"
good,liked working with my coworkers but during the holidays the customers were really rude
good,"I worked for JCPenneys before their new ""pricing strategy"" rollout. This was when things were much different, internally. I was given a lot of freedom and responsibility to help and make decisions to drive business. My input was always accepted. Management had issues which was the hardest part of the job. Often dealing with lack of communication. I expressed interest in being promoted within and trying to move up the company ladder. My requests were ignored and therefore I left the company shortly thereafter."
good,most enjoyable was my co-workers
good,"I offer stable employment history, working consistently at J.C. Penney while completing my degree in positions requiring project management, technical, quality control and interpersonal communication skills. I have proven ability to orchestrate multiple tasks simultaneously and adapt to different environments and challenges."
good,"good part-time job, have to work flexible hours. Every store is different. Employees get a 25% discount. part time benefits after a year."
good,"I worked at this company for a long time and every year there are lay-offs. I finally got let go, in a group setting with about 25 other people. Other than being unstable, I enjoyed the work I did and most of the people."
good,JCP has the integrity in a company but run the store so short of employees that it is very difficult to give quality customer service. I thought there would be a chance of advancement but I have reason to believe this is more difficult than explained to me. The hours are reasonable but need a full time job and even with experience I believe it is all about who is the buddy to the management.
good,Fun place with good training. Managers were nice but inconsistant. I enjoyed helping the general public.
good,it was great working there the people and mangers co workers were great
good,"Cashier, towards the end of the day all of the associates helped clean the store and put clothes together. I learned more about customer service. Management was decent. Not too involved. I liked my co-workers very much. Only part I disliked were the late hours the workers had to stay sometimes left around 12am."
good,"The work experience depends on the immediate supervisor/coach. JCPenney is experiencing setbacks in its business so the stability of the job is not good, stores and other facilities are being closed to consolidate the company's assets. The instability can lead to job losses."
good,I enjoyed my time there must of the other kids my age were all great people super friendly. The managers were really great too it’s just the assistant managers that seem to be very rude they think very highly of themselves while managers helped to fold clothes and clean the place during closing the assistant managers refused and just walked around bossing others to pick up clothes even though they we’re standing right next to it.
good,"For a time, had somewhat regular work hours.  As company changed corporate management, the culture was turned upside down.  Nepotism was rampant.  ""Little children"" were promoted to management."
good,"J C Penney  is a great  place to work. I loved assisting the customers,  it made the day go fairly well.  My co workers  helped me whenever I  needed to understand more about  my job and  responsibility."
good,"Great for begging in the beauty industry , however the traffic wasn’t too busy . Hours aren’t full time . Part time only , managers changing constantly ."
good,"Every shift for me was a bit different. Some days I was cashiering, other days I was helping with signs and read floor plans for new stock. Management put a lot of emphasis on signing customers up for credit cards, which began to feel like it was the only thing they cared about. Employees were constantly coming and going, so the store was always understaffed. I loved being able to organize merchandise but it was often unrecognized due to the main focus being credit and not store presentation and shop-ability."
good,"JCPenney is a good company to work for if you’re still in high school. It’s not for someone who’s trying to make a living or has dependents, unless you’re a manager and can work full time."
good,"Good job experience at handling or labelling,  shipping or receiving.  Friendly work environment.  Flexible work hours.  No benefits. Life and salary not balanced."
good,It’s really a easy job as long as your doing what you are suppose to do. Some days are better than others but it gets better. Hardest part can be persuading customers to become a member of JCPenney.
good,"Always something going on, never a dull moment."
good,I enjoyed being able to go in and work on things. It gave me a sense of accomplishment to be able to see an area transformed to look good. I enjoyed helping customers.
good,"I worked there for a while and I didn’t enjoy it. I wasn’t trained properly and made many mistakes that I wouldn’t have made if I had been trained. By far, one of my least favorite jobs."
good,"Working for JCPenney Warehouse is ok for now seeking more of a new challenge ,I like the hours pay is ok I'm looking to gain new employment elsewhere and start a new venture."
good,With the people I had worked with seemed pretty casually and in order. With working their seemed pretty good work experience. The work place was in order and real nice place for employment.
good,"The company lacks ability to help employees grow in the company. I wasn't able to expand my knowledge and skills, based on what I am learning in college majoring in Fashion Merchandising at ECU. I felt stagnant."
good,"Good job! Loved the people I worked with. Early morning job, was ok but I needed time with my kiddos. Also I was part time and didn’t have the benefits I needed."
good,"Work like balance is already a struggle in retail industry. They did the best they could with respecting that, however, it is the balance of workload and available resources is what made the job harder on the manager and the general employees."
good,The employees work hard to keep workspace clean and work efficiently to keep clothes neat - folded or hung - and put away. Respectful and kind to customers and helpful with finding or orders clothing.
good,"Loved working as a customer service associate in the fine jewelry department. Schedule was difficult during holiday season. Wages were low, and dropped several times during my employment. Very few opportunities for advancement."
good,this was a great part time job.  if the cal center had not closed down i would still be working there.  The call center had a high turnover.  I had 15 supervisors in the time i was there.
good,"Great place to work at if you want to get by. Great for college students."
good,"I enjoyed my time with JCP.  They accommodated my school schedule very well, sometimes even on short notice. However, how they treat their managers is questionable, often requiring them to transfer stores on short notice."
good,The company has a great working environment with a valuable team. They provide good benefits and offer the opportunity for advancement within. You can also relocate for even bigger opportunities at the home office.
good,"An employer who has lost their way and has struggled with finding the right leadership to identify and solve problems plaguing its enterprise. Jcpenney overlooked its internal leaders who understood the business and hired external executive leaders who destroyed the culture, quality and service of its offerings."
good,"I love working here. I love my customers. I eventually will leave to better myself but managers also treat it like high school. For example, waiting to pick up a need for assistance to see if anyone else will get it first. This leads to upset customers taking it out on workers."
good,The company has changed drastically over the years. It was a company that took care of there employees but it is now a company that has lost focus of the associates which are what keeps the bussiness going as a whole.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was being available to customers who needed advice in re-furnishing an entire home.  Have the opportunity to help them find what they needed and helping them make informed decisions about fabrics, patterns and gifts for their families and friends."
good,My gm was the best person you could have working up top . Customers and employees were always put first . They understood and took care of things if your child got sick among other things about daily life . always got help if you asked
good,Working freight was good if you needed a paycheck and only had early mornings available. Perfect for a student who needs to attend class in the middle of the day.
good,"Working at JCPenney is a fun  friendly place to work. It's fast pace depending on the day. You meet new people everyday. You get help them pick out clothes, make them laugh. Also the customers get to use coupons Everytime they shop."
good,Enjoyed working meeting new clients . Slow days we practice on eachother. Work the front desk. Manager was great. Had lots of walk ins. Free classes.!
good,JCPenney would benefit from incentives and fun activities with coworkers. I think this is a good first job for the younger crowd to learn basic customer service skills.
good,This is a great flexible part-time job. I enjoy working with the customers and my co-workers make it feel like a family. Management makes you feel important to the company.
good,"When I started I arrived at 3am to work freight and put merchandise on the floor. Most enjoyable part of my job. If needed I would help with signing and pricing. A total of about 30 hours a week. Six months into the job I broke my arm while working. My job changed to just pricing and signing. My hours dwindled to about 10 a week. I talked to personnel about the hours, changed availability but nothing helped. So I resigned"
good,"good managers and such but when I was working there the management was a mess, and the studio was disintegrating into chaos. I was a new hire and they werent able to properly train me due to it."
good,Learned proper customer service and to deal with problems that came up unexpectedly in a professional manner. Enjoyed working in teams with co-workers
good,I loved working for this company. That is until my location got an inexperienced new store manager. There were many reliable hard working employees that were bullied out by other staff members and the new manager acted before researching and asking questions. I witnessed an amazing team get torn apart and I was caught in the cross hairs. I opened a case with the internal affairs group of JC Penny along with others. I had moved up so quickly with this company and had hoped to work there till retirement like my mother. I was heartbroken to go through this experience.
good,"I was hired on the spot while working in Fine Jewelry at Herberger's of Edina during the last days of the closing liquidation.  I felt I was hired to update with my suggestions for Fine Jewelry procedures at JC Penney Eden Prairie...I did that...however management, sales associates, and assistant manager of Fine Jewelry, took credit for my suggestions and knowledge.  Human Resources Dept was very helpful and supportive, however.  Sales associates were very competitive and at times ruthless...but I did what I could to help, and then decided to move on."
good,"Working here was good, coworkers were amazing. Most management was good at there jobs. Working with schedules however did become a bit of a problem for those who had school."
good,"It was a good job, but then management started micromanaging and became almost hostile. I worked in appliances and management started bringing clothes over to put on hangers saying we weren’t acting busy."
good,"It started out great with a beautiful Manager then they let her go and brought in someone else who did not have a clue how do deal with employees or customers. Then a new Manager after about a year. Never knowing from one day to the next what to expect.  One day when following Assitant Manager's instructions I hurt myself. That is when everything got ugly.... They did there best to get rid of me and made work unbearable. However, I remained there until the store closed."
good,Working at Jcpenney can be fun but the managers are bad at realizing their coworkers feelings. However being there for holidays is also great because of the additional pay.
good,Management would bring meals for everyone working holiday shifts. Expectations were clear. Pushed promotions heavily. Paid for your goal reaching accomplishments.
good,"There was never one person you could go to for questions during the job, each part of the store was ran by a different manager who felt their way was best or your miserable. The higher up workers were given multiple breaks through out the day whenever they wanted but the customer service workers were  only given one 30 minute break. The management wont even fire you in personperson but I guess that's what you get for it being retail."
good,"It was ok job. Stocking clothes on your own pace. Talk to customers, locate merchandise for them and helped other employees in the store. Working there was alright. Could have been better, to many supervisors."
good,"Working in a retail environment can come with its situational stress, but working here (at least at this specific store) was stressful all the time. Recovery used to be the main focus until they started focusing more on earning credit card applications. As long as you manage your time between the register and the sales floor evenly, you should be able to get both of the jobs done and be home before 11 PM. "
good,Jcpenny over all was a good job however my manager was very very unreasonable. I would have to leave school to go into work and she cared nothing for any education for her employees.
good,Me gustaria tener la oportunidad de aprender mas de las diferentes areas
good,"JCPenney was my first job and I worked primarily in the fitting rooms and with recovery, although I was a back up cashier. On most days it was a relaxed working environment but as with every retail store, there are certain days or holidays that bring in droves of people, turning a low intensity environment into a high intensity one. The managing team is super friendly and will tell you what exactly needs to get done. One thing I personally struggled with was the lack of employees scheduled on busy days, where there is only one person on the floor (not including cashiers) covering up to three departments at once. "
good,"•	Positively demonstrate the company’s core values by developing trust and respect among peers and management, working in teams and partnering through collaborative work ethics."
good,"I would recommend working for this company. It was very relaxing and smooth paced. I love clothing so this was the perfect fit for me. I worked for the company for about seven months. I had become pregnant and my husband had gotten a better job so I didnt need to work at the time, which was my reason for leaving."
good,"It was good experience, I learned a lot as it was my first retail job, I worked hard so was everyone, we helped each other, I liked the diversity and the culture."
good,This job taught me some good life skills but the management is hard to work with. They ate not very willing to help you train better and they do not like to give you time off when you need it. Benefits are offered to only full time workers and or have to meet a certain year requirement
good,"Great first job if you can survive low hours on non peak months. If you can get past that, and apply yourself, you can advance. My immediate supervisors always had my back."
good,"Some areas need improvement, But with room for improvement gives associates a chance to find a solution that will benefit the team. Leaves room for discussion to consider all sides of the table. Learning what works and what does not. Understanding Differences is what makes a lasting impression, and makes a healthy work environment go round."
good,Jcpenny is a Good for someone’s first job. This job helps gain customers service experience. It’s a fast paste environment..the holiday pay is good and the schedule is flexible for school
good,"I liked everyone there. Everyone is very nice, I love being around people n kids. I joke around with them and always say nice things to put a smile on their faces.. I'm a happy person n I like making other people happy too."
good,this job was the best part time job in retail i have ever have. even though the pay was not good. it was still a laid back job as long as you did what you was supposed to do
good,"I enjoyed working with customers, however, management had little interest in the satisfaction of their employees. Raises were not based on merit in any way."
good,"No free weekends, No advancement, Stressful retail environment."
good,"25% discount (or less depending how you pay.) They will work you as much as possible not caring about your home/family life. I don’t believe they care about you as a person just another worker on their ant farm. They will give customers whatever they want even if customer is wrong, which doesn’t show me integrity is high on their scale. Pay is pathetic but discount is nice."
good,"Part of my job task was inspection of incoming clothes to verify if the stores receives what was ordered.  ""Go out on floor to audit incoming supplies."
good,The company needs a clear Job Description for each tier for Technical Design positions. Felt like lower level associates performed more than their fair wage.
good,"Must enjoy helping people and be willing to give extra at Holiday time. It's too bad you have to be concerned about theft, but it's part of the job. I really hated watching people and having to make a call about their shopping behavior. Really appreciated the store discount."
good,"I would go to each employee and see what they were doing and come up with a solution on how they could make their job easier to understand "
good,"No matter how hard-working the employees are, but the management is poorly challenged; is no fun. Managers should stop micromanaging and let the associates make their own decisions. That's the only way for them to be challenged and to grow Be there when they need you!"
good,All Managers are not on the same page with each other and tend to do things their own way. Coworkers are talking of they don't like this person or that and I hear a lot that it is not their job. There is nothing about the company standard of WORTH
good,Originally started out on the floor as a customer service rep (cashier) and it wasn’t terrible except for the managers constantly pushing for us to get customers to apply for the JCPenney credit card. The managers created a competitive work environment because of it. However once I started working on the pricing team it was actually a great experience but a lot was expected of the pricing team and only a limited number of hours were available.
good,"During my experience with the company, you're treating replaceable.  Additonally, men were addressed Mr., while women were called by their first name, even if the woman was in a higher position."
good,"I very much enjoyed this temp job although if a customer or employee needed management help with anything it was near impossible to get help, customers will yell at you for not getting extra help when your cashier line is nearly 30 people long , and management just walks by and avoids eye contact "
good,Most of the employees in the department work as part of the team assisting one another as needed. Most share commissions without complaint when both worked on an order.
good,I really have never felt comfortable of the working environment at JcPenney. I got very few hours after the holidays. Benefits are too expensive for the salary.
good,"It's and overall great place to work at with amazing people. The atmosphere is great with lots help from all the associates and managers. For any type of first job for anyone, it is a great place to learn manners and good workmanship."
good,Too many CEO changes with no consistent direction for the company.  Top management needs to be more knowledgeable about be a merchant.  They only look at the numbers.
good,"Younger inexperienced Managers are given opportunities to run stores with little or no experience. If your store manager likes you, it can help your careers whether or not you're qualified."
good,The hardest part of this job is holiday hours.  You can work till midnight on those hours. They start you with a good pay if you have a good resume. There is a lacking in empathy towards employees. Over all i think it is a good fit for most lots of people.
good,"During the holiday season tensions rise throughout the workplace due to the fact it was a retail store. It was hectic and fast paced, often not allowing me to efficiently complete zoning or other tasks that I was specifically asked to do. I would often times work through breaks or miss my scheduled break time to satisfy customers first."
good,"I was recruited from Kay's in Pittsburgh Mills to work at JC Penny Jewelry Dept in Pittsburgh Mills by a sale representative.  Sales rep was impressed with my sales approach to my customers and offered me a job. I did great there had a large clientele but the manager didn't like me, so they decided to deduct my pay.  I asked what was wrong and did not get a good answer so I decided to fine work else where."
good,"I started working at JC Penneys after high school. Its fair retail work, gave me lots of experience working with customers, getting orders, folding clothes, etc. Defiantly a good starter job."
good,"The pay isnt great, the breaks are limited, and what is asked of you is a lot. Youre on your feet all day and you have to deal with horrible mannered customers."
good,"30 minute unpaid lunch if you work over 6.5-7 hours, otherwise you get a 15 minute paid break. some customers were especially difficult and there was a constant issue with shoplifting. management/supervisors were good and listened to employee concerns very well."
good,"The entire company is going through a rebuilding phase which has resulted in departments being morphed together and workloads being doubled and sometimes tripled. Compensation is still on the low side of average and in the 1 year I worked there, three store managers were changed."
good,"As a starting job, it's a pretty good one. But the pay is terrible for all of the work that they expect you to do, especially since it is always understaffed. It's not necessarily their fault, but many of the reasons that people leave is because of the management. Terrible communication between them. Other than that, you become close with your co-workers, and the discount is nice. That is all I can really say about it really. Not much room for advancment unless you live and breath Jcpenney."
good,great management. fun environment. don' t care to work at another JC Penny. at the location I worked at was not typical everyone at this location worked well together.
good,Holidays were hectic & breaks was hard to get on busy days. A person needs to be quick & be prepared for helping with customers. The employees were enjoyable because we were close like family & always willing to help each other out when problems came up.
good,"I enjoyed working at JCP. "
good,"Great seasonal job. Pay isn't that good. There is a bunch of hours during the holidays, but not many throughout the year. I recommend this job to anyone looking to supplement their income."
good,Was part time seasonal so i was kind of upset when laid off but its part of being seasonal. Schedule was good close to home. Fun environment. Good company..
good,My fellow employees and management were helpful. It was easy to stay busy. They gave ample of hours to work. It wasn't a bad experience for the time I worked there.
good,I learned a lot of things like how to approach people about getting credit cards. Learning how to do upsells and cross-sales. You can pick up a lot of good tips from people but you always have to be willing to learn. You can also learn how to do online pick-ups and returns.
good,Family oriented work environment. Supportive managers. Flexible hours.  Offers opportunities for advanced training.  Safe work environment practices. compliant with OSHA standards.
good,great job for a student not a good lifetime job. fun for younger people who just need a few hours a week. I liked the people I worked with dislike like the company as a whole.
good,"slow paced, not a fan of the manager. It was a smaller store but she always expected us to work - there was never enough to work on. I would want better pay"
good,"Helped direct people to the right sections of the store. "
good,"The store I worked at was a fun place to work with great supervisors. I was one of the harder working associates and cashiered often, but I was quickly moved up a position. You can understand my excitement for moving into another department so quickly, however around a month later, after I was comfortable, I was moved into recovery (folding clothes, etc), because they hired a new person to do the job I was doing more than adequately. This was unbelievably disappointing as I was already over-qualified to do that job. Also, management would often schedule me when I had said I wouldn't be able to work (I warned them a month in advance), and when I asked to be taken off that schedule day they told me I'd have to find someone to cover my shift."
good,"The job was fun and easy to do, other employees were nice and so were most managers. However the managers were irresponsible, unwilling to listen and work with employees, and would slack off on their jobs. There was an incident where I needed to call out sick for my shift and when I called, the employees wouldn't pick up sometimes and other time the managers wouldn't pick up when my call was being transferred. I ended up called 8 times that day and got ahold of no one and hung up on 2 times by managers."
good,"Good for retail experience, and if you are a student in school/college they work with your schedule overall. Perfect for someone who is  in school and willing to work only on weekends or for someone who just wants a part time job with minimal hours."
good,"The company did not pay as well as others, and the culture was ok. Management would sometimes be in the way of production. The medical benefits were expensive and did not cover very much."
good,"Retail is always a good first job for a young person to start out with or work while going to school. Not much of a social life if you are a younger employee, you will get scheduled the later shifts and weekend shifts. But worth it in the end if you need  job."
good,Our salon was VERY understaffed. Maximum of 3 stylists working at a time in a place that could hold a max of at least 20. Sometimes had to turn clients down because we were understaffed. Management was great when there was someone there. Most of the time I was the only one there.
good,"Definitely a place to be if you're looking for a low key gig. I worked there during college and they were great about working around my schedule. When hours got cut, that was rough seeing as I had rent to pay!"
good,"This job provides little to no training when you start and you basically learn everything you need to know from your fellow associates. It also demands you do almost every job in the store, but still barely pays you any money.  Instead of hiring people for specific jobs they hire people to do everything so you are a cashier, but you also work the floor and help customers, but you also have to check the fitting rooms and clean them, while also cleaning the store and making it looks nice, but wait im not done, you also have to put back all the clothes you take from the fitting rooms after you finish rehanging them because customers are very rude that come into this store and just throw the clothes on the floor. You are on your feet the entire time you are working constantly walking around and if you try to sit you get yelled at mean while the managers sit down stairs in there offices all the time. Also this job is very big on getting customers to sign up for credit cards for their store, and that's all they really care about is getting credit applications. The pay is better because you do start 15 cents above minimum wage but the job does get bad after a good month or so of working there. I would suggest this job to someone that wants a discount on nice clothes and needs a not good  but better then minimum wage retail job."
good,"This job taught me how to be fast paced. Being in the location it was, it always kept the store busy which meant more cleaning needed to be done. The workplace culture was amazing. I got to work with different people and met a lot of people working there."
good,"Store management worked well to provide a stable, safe and structured work environment. However, there is very poor communication between corporate employees resulting in mixed messages during corporate visits. No one visit was every the same because of this."
good,"The JCPenney I worked at was very stressful due to employees acting as if they weren’t on the job and causing a lot of drama, managers not knowing how to manage the store. There were fun times at some points but there was one time on Black Friday where we didn’t get breaks or it was hard to get a 15 minute break."
good,"Working at JCPenny was fairly interesting, as the human resources supervisor you have a lot of responsibilities including human resources, scheduling, payroll, omnichannel sales, credit acquisition, department sales goals, store sales goals, office management, recovery, fitting rooms, banking, and forensic accounting to determine cash variances and more."
good,very diversified environment. company offers flexible hours. lengthy and long training programs with plenty opportunities to move around withikn the store.
good,The Store Manager did not spend any time training me.  I had to learn it all on my own.  I feel I did an outstanding job.  I had sales goals set for all of the department supervisors and updated them on a daily basis.  We always exceeded the goals and beat last year sales.  I worked on some of days off.  The District Manager and I had several meetings about the Store Manager and the way he would assign me projects that I was not responsible for.  He made me do them anyway.
good,"If management is poor, then there's little to no chance to be recognized for excellent work ethics nor advancements in the company. If you're simply looking for a paycheck, then it may be worth the time."
good,"JCPenny was a great company that had a family feel to their team members, they always had a set goal that gave the employees chances to receive prizes and compensation for their hard work."
good,"I was fired by the corporate level managers and my direct managers in the store were very upset that they decided to let me go. It was a decent place to work for a first retail job, but they only care about you if you get people to sign up for the credit card but if you don’t do that well but everything else amazing they don’t really care about you."
good,I used to love working at JCPenney in the beginning but now not so much. The management has changed all good manages that have been there for years were let go or left.
good,"Jcpenney is a very forgettable job depending on department. The associates were good people, but the management and the requests that were made were just senseless and they weren't optional. Overall the job isn't the greatest thing."
good,"it was a fast paste job like working there they work with my schedule for the other things I had going on the management was okay ,the hardest part was nothing really but the long walk to time clock"
good,"It was a nice place. Clean for the most part"
good,Normal environment for a call center. Nothing too special. Only real benefit was the employee discount for JC Penney Merchandise. During the holiday seasons you had to work overtime.
good,"typical day, tell me my tasks and i set out and do them"
good,"A day at work was the same every shift.  No advancement, no guidance from management on opportunities. I often offered to cover shifts for others, yet when needed I could never find anyone to assist. Although HR was good about working with my school schedule, if a need for me to request off unexpectedly, I could never get in contact with management. The best part about the job with the discount and then seeing a happy customer."
good,"I would never go back to retail again. this store was a nightmare every day. There was never enough helpers, and the whole store would end up on the floor."
good,Easy work once you get the hang of it. Recommend that you adopt organization skills before applying if you don't already have them. Most customers are easy to work with and coworkers are very friendly.
good,"It is a very unorganized place. The management  team is inconsistent with desired work, plans of accomplishing tasks, etc. Some of the management team are not qualified for their positions."
good,"This job was a good stepping stone to learn necessary skills, such as customer service and sales. However, its management and corporate structure is fairly disorganized."
good,"Each day we are expected to reach certain numbers to stay in compliance to keep your pay. The work was fast paced and stressful. They did have fun events and gave out prizes, although most of it goes to management. We were given the option to work weekends on holidays."
good,A typical at work like a normal work day. I learned it was only good enough for a seasonal job. Management was pretty nice. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping nice customs
good,"JcPenney was a cool, down to earth place to work. There was an opportunity for growth and improvement there, however I just maintained the seasonal position there."
good,"Working at JCPenney is very hard, but the job culture is not bad and therefore it makes the time spend at the company stressless and if you work hard your job security is not bad"
good,A normal day at JcPenny's would consist of folding and organizing clothes and and asking customers what kind of assistance they need and then showing and showing them similar products to increase sells.
good,I do not remember much about this employer. Retail is customer service driven and hours are based on known busy months or weekends. Great first job for students.
good,long hours on school nights. we would close at 9:00 oclcok but we wouldn't leave until almost 10:30 11:00 regardless if its exam week or if we have to wake up at 6:00 the next day.
good,I understood the policies are stricted but i had to take time off for my grandfather surgery that happened suddenly. i need more time off to deal with the  family emergency. They didn't give me enough work balance day which they only give you three days.That's not enough time to give to your employees through out the year.
good,"The typical day as a Loss prevention officer requires courage and confidence while working unsupervised due to the loss prevention department size. The work culture in retail requires an individual weekend and schedule are flexible but not predictable. The hardest part about the job is detaining shopflifers. The notion of detainment requires professionalism due to approaching a stranger who might be concealing a dangerous weapon ( most times). While mannerism is of necessity, understanding intersectional experience of an individual from afar and reasoning with he/she in his criminal behavior."
good,"A typical day at JCP can be stressful, it is a face paced environment.  I have learned alot across the company in my 7 years there.  There are no advancement positions in the field I am in, however compensation and paid time off are competitive. The most enjoyable part of my job are the ever evolving changes, and the creative people I have meet through the years."
good,Enjoyed most customers and team members. Love the sales and discounts. Did not agree with the cut back in hours after the holiday rush w.as laid off .
good,This workplace was pretty average. Not really any room for promotion or advancement. I’m a hungry man and there wasn’t much for me to eat at JCPENNEY.
good,You can learn a lot about customer service here at JCPenney. The team is very Family oriented and love to help each other when a problem occurs. There are a lot of bonuses to this job and some negatives
good,The management there was a rude. I didn't enjoy working with but two managers there the others were cruel and although I only worked a seasonal job how I was let go was very unorthodox. They just stopped scheduling me and kinda were like here have coupons to make you feel better. They gave good hours and breaks though.
good,I enjoyed working for JC Penney and the opportunities that came my way from working there.  The salon side in a retail environment can be challenging but with the right store managers it worked well.
good,The company would be better if they paid their employees a little more.  The up side to working there is that they do work with your schedule.  They also give there employees a discount.
good,I used to love my job at JCPenney. Recently things have changed and it's gotten worse. Those who actually show up for their scheduled shifts are getting their hours cut while those who call off all the time are getting hours.
good,It is a very cut-throat business there is no fun it's just all business all the time and I think it's just time for me to make a change I have been with the company for 19 years and it's not like it used to be so it's just time to go I believe so that's why I'm trying to see what else is out here now
good,Is a fast pace job had to work a lot for over time if departments want clean you weren't able to leave or they will send you to other departments to finish up restocking shelves. Some coworkers were friendly when others didn't really get a long well I felted like I was in high school with all the fights between departments not really good environment between some departments.
good,Retail is very demanding and does not offer a good work life balance since you are always working on important holidays you should be with family. Plus there is NEVER enough time to get all of your job responsibilities done!
good,Eliminated large portion of their work force and cut the pay for the remainder. Hours were sparse after that and job titles were changed. Employees were made to work in departments they were not trained for.
good,"over time it was not so good, my las t 6 months with the company they fired 6 managers, and brung in 2 new people. who came in like the military, and it disrupted the vibe and culture. making it hard to work in peace."
good,I would say my experience there was pretty good. All job's have at least some kind lack of communication. But it was a good place overall.. The hardest part was helping customer's that have bad attitudes but i smile and help them through their day.
good,"My day usually starts at 4 am changing all signs for that day. This signs typically last no more than 3 days and I then need to change them again. It is more difficult now because a lot of people have been let go so my small team, which is now smaller, has to pick up the slack. I also have another responsibility that needs to be done before 9am."
good,Over all JCPenney is a good place to work if your a collage student.I worked part-time while I was working on my masters degree.  My boss was nice he allowed me to have the days off I wanted.
good,Overall wasn't happy there. Was getting overworked for the pay they was giving everyone. Gave too little hours. Our main boss wasn't there half the time.
good,"Store level environment is not terrible."
good,J C Penney is a quick paced place to work with little hours and lots of tasks.  The people are friendly and downsizing by the day.  Lots of tasks to keep you busy while you work with customers and tasks are unlimited while hours are very short.
good,"You need to give great customer service, communication skills a plus, let the customer know you are there for them at the same time go ring and clean out the fitting rooms, your next fellow associate wont be there for 3 more hours."
good,"Been here for 7 years, my loyalty for this place is unwavering. I believe in this company and the products we sell. It's fair to employees, but some of the management is a bit iffy."
good,The managers were not too bad. They would be hard on you but as long as you got your work done they are really nice. Be careful around the supervisor. Strict on attendance. Other associates were funny and awesome.
good,"The day would consist of 4 hours to 10 hours and while the people are good to work with, the amount paid was not enough to live off of, especially when one does well hocking credit cards and barely gets paid to carry a store."
good,"As an installer being on time was just as important because you had several customer to install curtains, blinds and etc...You only have a certain window to get everyone installed. Some short days and driving a company vehicle was at my convince."
good,"It wasn’t to much fun. All I did was fold clothes because they said I couldn’t be on the cash register. Black Friday was fun, but it was a lot of cleaning up to do. Managers had me all different places of the store when I was only supposed to work one spot. Unbalanced schedule. I was supposed to get rehired, but that never happened."
good,Typical day is very fast paced. Each of the  employees have plenty  of responsibilities  so last even through  the slower hours. My management was awesome an fast paced .
good,"Was hired as a Seasonal Sales Associate. It was okay at first, had fun interacting with some fellow co workers and customers. After that, it went downhill fast. Hours were very long and there could be lack of breaks (if you got one) since they were always understaffed and have high turn over rates. The management was poor as well. There were cliques and didn't seem like there were many ways to advance. This may be a good place for students, but be careful. They were aware of student schedules, yet scheduled you to work at times you couldn't make it and refused to fix it. If you can make it work, this may be a good place for you!"
good,"I worked as maintenance for almost 2 months, and honestly it was horrible. They treat you like your lesser and they would split shifts. I would have to come in at 6 in the morning and then 8 at night, even though I lived 30 minutes away and they knew that. Management was awful and the other associates were not great to work with."
good,I worked there for months and i believed I was underpaid for the amount of work I put in. We could only get raises by selling credit cards which most people did not want to buy.
good,"They're too focused on credit applications for a small population of people. You have to get the credit limit, but most people already have the card. My specific manager was amazing but the store managers assistant was horrible and mean. She was rude to everyone even customers and gave work to other people."
good,"I enjoyed working at JCPenney while I was there. I didn't like how the managers were so pushy to meet the charge card quota each day. I loved the section I worked in and the girls I worked with. I wouldn't mind going back to the company, but work behind the scenes instead of with the public. Most of the customers were fine and not memorable, but the few loud ones made the counter ""fun""."
good,"At the current state, management talents has changed from top tier to close to bottom tier.  Many initiatives lack components to make execution possible at the higher level.  Training program is almost non-existent.  Operational processes are astoundingly unacceptable.  The recent years, the company has lost its identity which they are still in search. Copy-cat practices are quite apparent and there are no innovationsl"
good,"My job was very overwhelming at times I had a very heavy workload and not enough time to get it all done in the hours given, which made working there at times very stressful. I feel management overlooks many issues and only acknowledges them when it’s convenient for them. I feel they need to look into the way associates use the time clock and address the issues with it. Overall management need to communicate with each other better and when it comes to the verbal warnings, written warnings etc. they need to have something like a signature from the employee to show that it actually happend."
good,"I somewhat enjoyed my job at JCPenney, however I feel that it had started to be terrible towards the end of my time working there. I had a new supervisor who constantly treated me worse than all the rest of the associates. I never worked with other associates I am actually friends with, and they are one of the only reasons why I stayed. I worked for months to find a new job to finally get out of working there. Honestly, some great managers, but the supervisors aren't so great."
good,"good place to work if you are a teen or are going to school. hours are flexible, and people were fun to work with. starting pay not great, raises were on a % scale and not great."
good,"I only worked here for just under 2 months but I liked the work I was doing. I was a sales floor associate who checked people out at the registers, organized the clothing on the sales floor, and cleaned the fitting rooms. There were a lot of employees and no matter the age difference they were all still friendly and talked/helped out whenever they could. The hardest part of the job for me was trying to sell the credit cards to people. I didn't have any experience with this and parts of it were hard to understand. I also didn't have any training while I was working here, and the person who was supposed to train me never did and just went off on their own. The most enjoyable part was actually when the store was closed for the day. All the employees would clean up the sales floor and make sure the fitting rooms were empty. I would just walk around listening to my own music doing my own thing and I liked that the most. The only reason I left this job was because it was affecting my school performance with the amount of hours I was working. I asked for less and they wouldn't schedule me for less than I already was."
good,"Overall, as in any retail store; you will have stores that run properly and ones that lack the proper system management. My old store, I would recommend a hundred times over, the newest one, I wouldn't recommend in the least."
good,Management seemed confused at the time and the dock station was almost always a mess. There was a lot of new hires that made my own hours decrease. The turnover rate seemed low.
good,"JCPenney is not a really bad job, it’s a good start to open many doors like it did for me. I learned to be a team player., retail can be overwhelming but working at JCPenney showed me that even tho it can get overwhelming it also can be a fun place to work. I had good co workers and the guests where very nice too."
good,the job i had was hard on the body and fast paced but i liked it okay and it was easy to understand. i thought that pay was a bit low but it was after all a temp job.
good,"It was an ok job, since I thought I would stay, I got tired of it. I needed something new. You always HAVE to be doing something. The management would get on to you if you do not have customers apply for Penny's cards."
good,Lack of hours throughout the employees. Consistently folding clothes and managing sales floor presentation.Credit application quota for all employees.
good,"JCPenney is a decent job for someone looking for their first job. Most of the staff is young. A typical day at JCPenny is rather relaxed, other than cleaning up after customers in the fitting rooms"
good,"I worked during christmas season, so it was seasonal. The managers were on us a lot, my fellow employees were great. This particular time of the season made the store a mess, due to the mess we would stay late recovering the store."
good,"JcPenny was a good starting place, as it was my first job. They didn't work with my schedule after a point, but the management wasn't bad.  Shifts were often less than 6 hours and you'd rarely get over 20 hours each week. You meet some cool people as they hire for the holiday season, but you also deal with extremely crazy customers. Also, credit applications (at least when I was there) were a big deal, like they nag you about hitting that goal whether realistic or not."
good,"I was really happy working at JCPenny.  I loved how it was always non stop never a slow moment, but i would say the hardest part was the long hours on my feet.  other then that i was a great experience."
good,"Most of the support team are 45 - 60 years old (with the exception of a couple younger employees) yet they cant help but act like children. Lots of drama, gossip, and excuses for poor behavior."
good,Nice place to work. Can develop and grow with company. Management is nice as well as the supervisors. Great people to work with and can quickly move up
good,"Fun place to work, great atmosphere. Always learning about new products and make up applications. Great retail job. Nice that they provide uniforms. Over all fun place to work."
good,"The work is easy. Straightening up the sales floor, helping customers, and ringing customers. The managers for the most part a great and helpful and very encouraging but the customers. Customers can be so rude. Not all of them of course but it can just drain you from their negativity and constant arguing. If the customers were better the job would've been much more enjoyable."
good,Management was initially very communicative but then became harder to reach. Long hours standing up with very little time for breaks did become difficult. I often had to have family drop off food that I could quickly eat within a 15 min window. That was not enough time to actually go purchase and eat food well.
good,"A typical day at JCPenney is puuting the Associate First and making sure their needs are met .  This creates a great customer experience environment!  We are to display WORTH behavior to associates and customers at all times.  W welcoming, O offering, R respecting time, T thanking, H helping!  "
good,"During the weekdays they only have one person in each department so it gets really really busy, so basically you will be on the register your entire shift."
good,"a typical workday was super busy extra long lines "
good,I enjoyed working with people both coworkers and customers. JC Penneys is a well known retail store with quality merchandise. The coworkers were very respectful towards each others.
good,Did not like management. They think they can do whatever they want with you. No consideration for family life. Only remained at the job because there was nothing else available at the time.
good,A very stressful environment in a high volume customer service flow. Hours were long and not distributed fairly. Learned how to multi task in a fast past environment.
good,"Many tasks per person with an overwhelming sense of never achieving what should be done by the end of the day. Customers are very unwilling to be civil and understanding with coupons. They people and work environment is great. JC Penney's does a great job at appreciating their workers, but with the economy it seems harder and harder to achieve goals."
good,"It was a seasonal position, however, the work environment could have been more friendly. The people I worked with were okay, but the manager was unprofessional and teased us all the time."
good,"The job was fairly okay, but the area in were it was located made it stressful. Most of the managers where helpful but others seemed to not care as much."
good,I planned on working at J.C. Penney's temporarily.  It turned out to be a career.  I worked there for many years and was promoted several times for my hard work and dedication to the company.
good,"A typical day depended on the sales, or the holiday."
good,"This salon was overpriced, very few clientele, learned product knowledge and met some lovely clients, made many friends inside the salon and out on the JcPenny floor"
good,Good place for part time work.  Good discounts.  Entry level pay and raises are a joke.  Worked their full time for a short time and would recommend for PT.
good,Very simple and straight forward job. Very nice and sweet management. However you are doomed to fail if you are not willing to become a sales person and convince everyone that approaches you to open a credit card with high APR. You have a weekly goal and if you do not meet it it can seem like your job is on the line. Other than that management tries to keep your spirits up with snacks and praise and are very nice. Holiday season is a nightmare but that's true in every retail store.
good,Did custom decorating a d shade instillation. Scheduling would provide the jobs for the day I would report any issues with the instillation and move to next location.
good,Jcpenney is an okay place to work for. However the point system is tuff. We can have a better attendance policy to cut down the turn over rates.  Jpenney can also be more flexible with schedules.
good,Always smile no matter how crazy the day gets. Make sure you are aware what great customer service means. Don’t be afraid to ask questions if you don’t understand something
good,"holidays are super busy while the rest of the time is hit or miss"
good,I worked behind the scenes before the store opened setting up store displays and events that were running for that week. Working with different managers made my job enjoyable. To learn different parts of the store and the expectations that were expected.
good,"I started as a sales associate. My hours were low and all over the place; morning, afternoon, nights. I just kept busy and picked up as much task as a I can. My hours started to pick up. Eventually they appreciated my work and asked me to be part of the morning team. My hours are more consistent now. The harder you work the more hours are given. Jcpenney is strictly part time unless your a manager."
good,Credit division no longer exists. Office has been closed and outsourced to someone else. I don't know off hand who runs the credit division for JC Penney.
good,"The workload is entirely too high. They are cutting back on headcount and leaving the rest to deal with the pain. If the area you work in isn't driving sales, they don't see it as an area that may need help. The focus is often only on major sales driver areas, creating an imbalance in workload from area to area. The culture is fairly decent.. People are nice, when sales are up. When sales are down, people tend to show their frustration. There are a lot of opportunities for training, as classes are constantly offered. But, keep in mind workload is high... so the odds of you having time to attend the classes is slim to none. BA Management is supportive overall. The hardest part of the job is earning the respect of your peers, as the BA role isn't highly respected by the merchants."
good,"extensive benefits, lot of empowerment, lot of paid vacation. sales schedule made it difficult to use vacation in more than a day to day basis due to extensive sale sets and ovelays. could only use vacation for more than a day or two here and there except in january."
good,"I gained a lot of experience working at JCPenny, everyone there was friendly and very helpful, it was a bit demanding especially during the holiday season, the biggest problem would have to be the costumers"
good,A typical day at work consisted of organization an communication with costumers and their comments/concerns. Management was very vain; deal breaker. Pay was below-avg.
good,"Friendly environment. Rather slow paced in the Home Department, where I am stationed.  What I enjoy most is assisting guests in designing their window treatments.  It can be a long and detailed process, and I enjoy the opportunity to get to know the guest as it helps me find appropriate ideas and solutions for him or her."
good,"Typically consisted of keeping tables clean and clothes folded, helping customers find items they were looking for and helping the customer leave happy and satisfied with their purchase. Learned a lot about customer service and retail, management was mostly nice and productive. Hardest part of job was pressure to sell credit cards when most people do not want to apply, most enjoyable part of job was working with coworkers and helping customers."
good,"As an internal support employee, I heard numerous stories of overwork and lack of control over schedules. My own department was a good place to work, but hearing about the low morale was disappointing."
good,At jc penneys you are in a very fast paced work environment. You deal with customers all day. You receive a 25% discount being an associate there. Everyone is kind and very helpful
good,"Responsible for qualifying, interviewing, designing, and selling interior design projects. The products are primarily window treatments, however, we also sold bedding and accessories."
good,"The management was very disrespectful to its employees and the ones that work the hardest don't get alot of credit or raise for the work they do.I wouldn't really work this job if I didn't have to but, I needed a job and they where the first to call back."
good,"I loved my job, had a good manager and good coworkers.  It worked well while going to school.  The company it self is failing and the store I worked at was shut down.  The upper management has made many poor decisions over the years that have speed up the decline."
good,JcPenney was a okay place to work. Management was not the best from the top all the way to the department managers. They never assisted with help with getting what you needed to perform your job.
good,Good benefits. Hard dealing with the managers when each one wants to you to do something but will contradict each other. Very good being flexible with school and family life
good,"I only worked at JC Penney for a couple months and it was over the winter holidays, so it was always so stressful and people were not always very nice."
good,"Great management training programs"
good,This place used to be fun. Too many favorites. Knowledge is selectively given and management is sometime arrogant. Typical day is full of telling and someone minding business of someone else's.
good,I was promised great training to become a full time hairstylist while I was receptioning. Never became one. Also the people were kind of rude and it was always slow. Cut me down to two days a week
good,"its good for experience.. heavy hours and too much work for very low pay! very busy and hectic during holiday season. management is ok,  not the best . wouldn't go back , that's for sure ."
good,"Friendly and fun Call Center answering calls from customers placing orders on the JCPenny web site, researched orders - tracking, arranging deliveries of furniture and bulky items with trucking companies and customers"
good,Its ok the job seems to care more about the company than the associates themselves you have to work on thanksgiving you have no time for family during the Christmas holidays
good,I love the place and the team members keeping it up. As far as benefits there was none. I am sorry to say I had to quite had someone stalk me all over the place and bugged my home to  control me.
good,"JCPDMS (acquired by AEGON) was the Direct marketing division of JCPenney corporate.  Before the acquisition, the Company did quite well financially and as a result of this successes this branch was sold off."
good,Working in SSC is a fast paced job that you need do accurately. It gets very hot in the summer. Some weeks 36 hours other weeks 50 hours. Christmas peak very busy.
good,I had parts of my car stolen in a security parking lot and was not able to get anything solved. I end up paying my deductible out of pocket to get a new one and the security staff did not want to give me a copy of surveillance to show to my insurance.
good,over all a good working place people are friendly and the customers normally are nice. They are sometimes disorganized but their communication isn't all that.
good,"Most of the employees are just there as part time employees looking for the paycheck. A typical day is standing behind the register, fixing displays, and pushing as hard as you can to get customers to sign up for JCP cards."
good,"I was hired on as a temporary associate for a reticketing project that was a new concept for 2017. This temporary project was very simple and I definitely felt like my 8.25 pay an hour was worth this for this task; however after completion of this project I was hired on to the truck team and this is where things turn sour. The truck team in my store seems to be responsible for a lot of tasks that it shouldn't be. I feel like a lot of our time is wasted following processes that are either developed from habit or store policy. If the procedure is a habitual one whenever you bring up a new idea it's almost frowned upon and the senior employee makes you feel inferior and that makes you never want to bring new ideas to the table. I also think that the company needs to revamp their entire logistics program. They constantly over send merchandise that we have 100's of items for and our store discourages back stock so we have to work it onto the floor. Our shelves look cramped and unorganized which in turn scores low on look and feel surveys. One time we got a truck with 1700 pairs of shoes on it, then a week later we received 1100; and the majority of the pairs were the same style of shoe. Our entire stock room was cramped and we had to just put the like styles of shoes out on the floor on folding tables. People will say this is just retail, but I feel like this is just a poorly managed distribution center. Another thing that irritates me is when I ask superiors for answers and they answer with I don't know. Most of my inquiries are about a schedule change and or new tasks and it is"
good,Multiple tasks to do in a fast-paced environment. Many challenges that require a level-head and ability to multi-task and prioritize. Must be able to handle stress and be willing to work long hours as needed.
good,All in all the atmosphere is good the associates are okay the store manager is easy to talk to but other Management in other departments are very hard to get along sometimes and when you are probably some things like achieving goals people seem to forget who you are so unfortunately I had to look for something better
good,I enjoyed working for JCP. a great company to work for. They respect their employees and retirees! I think a lot of that. They were willing to work with my schedule needs.
good,I worked here when I was a student. It was a great to get extra income during the summer months. The workplace culture was normal. A typical day at work was dealing with customers.
good,"Starting out in work field, or need a little exta cash type of job. Started when iwas 19, needed something to wor with while in school.  Got in during holidays."
good,"Simple job, mainly consisting of customer service. Help customers find what they were looking for them check them out. Nothing to serious, yet provided a peek into the sales world with incentives and bonuses when you got customers to sign up for the JCP Credit Card"
good,Very fun place when you are trying to juggle school and work. Great managers and your job is easy. Would really recommend working there if you want an easy fun job.
good,"I would get the department that I would be working, worked cashier, offered up sales to customers, answered phone calls from online orders, helped customer find merchandise."
good,"I love dealing and interacting with the clients/ costumers. Its a fulfillment when you see the customers happy leaving the store. I learned a lot on this job. I have a great Boss, I had a good relationships with all my superiors. They respect and treats them like family.  The hardest part of the job is when there's a lazy gossiper co workers who loves to talk at the back."
good,"Under my time at JCPenney I managed three departments, simultaneously. In the Women's Accessary department I supervised 8 associates, in Fine Jewelry I had 8 associates and the Shoe Department I had 20. Aside to being responsible of my three department employees, I was also responsible for the entire working staff as an opening/closing TEAM manager.  Along with the responsibilities of taking care of a store there were the usual requirements as a manager: maintain client retention, sales gains, customer conflict with positive resolution and most importantly team building."
good,"Overall, the associates are fun and laid back and the customers are generally pleasant to work with. However, the management needs some work on their communication with associates. This isn't in all locations though. I generally like the company and people there."
good,"With numerous realignments and changes in vision due to frequent changes in leadership, opportunity for advancement has disappeared, along with job security. Many positions outsourced. Work-life balance was an issue highlighted in associate surveys and message given was that if you don't like it, look elsewhere."
good,Great people and fun atmosphere.  Met friends who became family. Money was okay for a high school job. Learned every department.  Had knowledge of various things when i left
good,"JC Penney has been a very good place to work and has greatly expanded my work experience. Management is exceptional, as is the work environment. The cross-training allows any employee to step in and help with multiple jobs on differing equipment. The hardest part of the job is working indoors without air-conditioning in the summer months. The most enjoyable part of working at JC Penney is that the employees all focus on veritable tasks as a group, and there is a real family-like camaraderie."
good,JCP is a great place to work if you're going to school. Management works great with school schedule. Friendly environment and great atmosphere. I have made life long friends from this company. Holiday hours are pretty hectic but it'll keep you on your toes.
good,"I do signing, clearance, price-pointing, and unloading truck. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to unload the truck. I have learned a lot about working in the warehouse setting, it truly has improved my abilities."
good,"I absolutely loved my job for the longest time, the associates and the customers! There was always something to be done to make the experience better for the shoppers and the associates. We always created fun ""spirit days"" for the associates and fun games to get them revved up for their sales and credit goals for the day. But really, the only good thing about the job was the people and the customers you worked with to improve their shopping experience or the associates skills. Many of the associates were high school kids. I loved seeing how they transformed after 6 months to a year of working with the company. "
good,"your expected to work on the register and on the floor at the same time, customers are rude, they are messy, and hard to deal with sometimes. they expect you to do credit card applications, sometimes they cut off hours unexpectedly too"
good,"Is a good place for work but sometime the manager dosent have human recurs for all employees. I worked happy and I did my productivities all time but it is a work very streesed .Obscenities, discriminatory language,there dosent have oportunities for good people but all oportunities is for relationship."
good,job physically hard but liked people I worked with. got to learn alot about merchandising and they had a good discount program The pennys team was like a family and all got along well. They gave incentives to employees for doing excellent jobs
good,"JcPenney's was a fun place to work. It was hard work but the staff had a lot of fun. A typical day was folding clothes and helping customers. The hardest part of the job was that I got bored at times, I have to stay busy. It was a long time ago so I have a hard time remembering the ins and out."
good,"Needs better trained personnel."
good,"JC Penney gave the opportunity for professional development. Very metric driven, JC Penney allowed for skills to be developed in all areas necessary to drive and run a retail business. I learned a great deal and was glad of the opportunity to work for them."
good,"A typical day of work entailed lots of repetitive conversation and tidying, I don't really like having to repeat myself all day so that part of the job was a downside. I also don't think I was trained very well so there were things on the register that still confused me. The management was friendly enough, I like how positive they were for every person that sold a card, it was very encouraging in the morning meetings. The hardest part of the job for me was not knowing policies for certain things, so trying to figure out the best course of action in some situations was nerve wracking. I enjoyed the times I got to go out on the floor on my own and tidy up the clothing, and I liked my discount. I didn't really like having to interact with so many people every day, but that is because I have social anxiety, so overall the job wasn't for me."
good,"its good for high school students and college. there are limited hours even though they may hire 20 new associates. its a good environment as long as you are schedule with those who are there to get paid for well done job. if you are just there to get paid, sure. Management if fine. like anywhere there are good ones and bad ones."
good,Overall it is a great workplace and it offers super flexible hours. Coworkers have always been super friendly and management always keeps everyone well informed of policy updates or any company changes.
good,This is a nice place to work. I enjoy working with my peers. The benefits are nice. I work in the chat department and the stress level is at a minimum.
good,"Multitasking was easy, especially when there's plenty of people to work with and to help out.  However, I do wish that the manager would have trained me a little bit more, so that I could be more knowledgeable with opening new credit cards, gift cards, exchanges, and returns."
good,"Not room for growth"
good,"Working for the above company has been a great way to gain experience when dealing with customers. The culture is overall pretty relaxing and no real high stress situations. If you lack experience with dealing with customers/mitigating problems, I would recommend the retail business above. "
good,Great work place but the positive inter relationship between managers and sales associates were lacking. Good benefits and reasonable/ flexible hours.
good,The hardest  part of the job was putting the clothes away. It wasn't that I did not know how to do it it was making it look how they wanted it. The best part was meeting the customers the different personalities and races it was the best part and also the employees made you feel welcomed.
good,Great work ethic with middle management associates on down to the store associates.  Too many strategies put in place and no clarity from  upper management.
good,It was nice place to work . The people are  nice and caring always helping out . Its a good environment to meet new people and how to learn how to work
good,"Men's Department Supervisor was definitely challenging, which was good. However, there are no nights, weekends or holidays to yourself in the retail life"
good,"I worked as a sales associate for two and a half years. Its not a bad first job. It teaches the life of customer service. The ups and downs of it. This job has taught me people skills, ad what to do in stressful environments. All the associates are very personable and fun to work with. As far as the work itself, expect a lot of complaints from customers. Jcpenney is not the best company. They are struggling so hours are cut, and not too reliable. But if you are just seeking a part time job, apply!!! If you are in high school or in college, not a bad place to work. Flexible with hours."
good,"This is a great place if it is your first job, I would not recommend making a full career out of the company. I only say this because of the bad experiences I had with management. It was a fun place to work at and also had great associate discounts and rewards. Management just needs some improvements."
good,"Working in the salon with talented, fun, and helpful stylists was great. The salon manager, on the other hand, was never really there physically and/or mentally. She kept messing up our schedules, causing issues in our books, but when a day off is requested, she never hesitated to approve it, even if that approval meant there wouldn't be anyone available to work that shift."
good,When I started it was a cool and fun place to work. Going through different mangers in a short period of time made the work place difficult for some associates to work there. The hours varied by week which wasn't enough for anyone.
good,"A typical day consists of running cash registers, cleaning dressing rooms, and fixing tables and racks on the sale floor. All of the employees are nice and act as one big family."
good,"A typical day at work included me coming in to a messy under staffed work place. I learned that unless you ask questions they will not teach you anything. Management was not good at making sure that the departments had enough people to get jobs done. They expected me to be able to maintain an entire department, work register and do go backs all while being the only one working in the department."
good,great management and great co workers. Hardest part of the jobs keeping up with all the customers and often multitasking.
good,My first retail job Ive learned what is like to customer service and also how to help a customer finding what they need. Ive also learned how provide extra benefits for a customer as far as discounts and opening a new credit card.
good,Managers weren't too helpful. The atmosphere is really set on selling credit cards that customer support is forgotten.
good,"Meet a lot of people  in all different  walks of life. After the grand opening,  I was a cashier / customer service  representative  for the shoe department,  I received  a new job."
good,Training was great.  It was hard standing for hours on end.  Hard to deal with customers who were angry or upset.  Not a lot of room for advancement until after a couple years.
good,My supervisor was nice and fare to everyone. No problems in the shoe department. Go to work do your job and everyone is happy. No complaints.  Very good department to work in
good,"The customers are horrible, pay is fairly lousy, you have to take abuse from customers with a smile no matter how bad they get.... It's retail. What did you expect? The year the CFO sent us all a postcard of himself in Bora Bora thanking us for working on Thanksgiving Day was the year I decided to leave."
good,"If there's one thing I can say about JC Penney is that they really work with you and your schedule and are very understanding of many mishaps that could interfere with punctuality. they also were very understanding of sudden schedule changes. They're cons sure do out weigh the pros I must say. If it wasn't the favoritism its the bias and if not that, the laziness and nonchalant management. Managers expecting you to do your part when tey barely do theirs which in turn makes your part harder. Scheduling minimal amount of people on the floor. Missing my break or leaving an hour later was not out of the ordinary. Not to mention constantly getting new GMs."
good,"Good first job or for older people.  I enjoyed meeting and assisting customers,and Stalking product. I did not like the pressure of getting customers to sign up for charge cards. The management was not very nice and played the favorites when it came to permotion or hours scheduled."
good,Loved the people that I worked with but disliked the pay and the management. They didn't treat us fairly. I learned a lot of customer service skills. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers and basically doing most of other worker's jobs.
good,"Depends on the management. With a good store manager, this place was amazing. A bad manager, all the employees starts quitting and there is too much work for such few people. Daily job is normal of retail. Most coworkers were nice, others were gossiping, whining 'cliques'."
good,Most management is awesome but some departments need work . The hour lunch is nice . Getting and employee discount is good and its fair .. The store manager for lakeland isnt the best to work for .
good,"It was okay, a little unprofessional at times but not too bad. Felt like high school instead of a work place. Managers showed favoritism and in order to get what you wanted or needed you had to find the right manager."
good,"It has poor management skills for the salon. It could use a new manager due to the poor skills of the one that it has now. The salon manager in the beginning states that they have no favorites, but indeed they do. Will tell you great job one week, then cut your hours the next week. Co-workers are like any where else, some are good and some are bad. The hardest part of the job is that the salon is tucked back in a corner of the store and it makes it difficult to find new clientele without the salon being visible. I think the most enjoyable part of the job is having a chance to give somebody a haircut/new style for my clients."
good,"People work full time after 5 years in the company cut they hours, vacations,  and hire only part time."
good,"A typical work day at JCPenney truly varies from each person, each day, and each shift. Each shift has a different responsibility throughout the day. Luckily, i have learned and excelled in the duties of each one. Being my first job, I have learned what is expected of each individual in the workforce. Hard work, dedication, initiative and responsibility. Although there are frustrating times, iIve learned to cope and push through my daily objectives. I've also learned a lot about myself. When it all comes down to it, I am the type to get the task done myself, rather than rely on other people. Although, in contrast, when needed, I am also a team player. I am able to motivate each part of the team to insure a quality result in each task. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing your results after a hard days work."
good,"very lenient with school schedules ,very comfortable break areas,"
good,"I enjoy working at JCPenney. I have never had any issues with any of my coworkers, the only issue I have with the money is the pay. I feel like at JCPenney, I am not evenly compensated for the amount of time and effort I put into my work."
good,"JCPenny always has great people to work for. Aside from great people to work with its not that great. The hours are long and you dont get paid well. Its a typical retail environment. If you go to school part-time I would recommend it. If you are going for career, I most certainly would not. Also, at my particular store had the worst scheduling ever."
good,Employees were very rude to customers. Very judgemental! They would talk negative about the customers. And that's really inaproproate. I couldn't stand it!
good,"A day at work was walking from conveyor to conveyor belt unloading or loading boxes into shipping containers. Most employees were friendly and management was decent, with two breaks and a lunch."
good,"Worked the register and recovered the department and helped any customer that needed assistance.Learned how to give good customer service.Enjoyed working with co- workers and my imediate supervisor.Working during the Christmas season was the hardest part of the job,interacting with the co-workers and customers was the enjoyable part."
good,"Retail is a difficult environment for associates with families. It is fast paced with ever changing hours! "
good,this place as okay for it being my first job. i leaned a lot from working there. but the one this i didn't like was favoritism . but over all i had a good experience..
good,An okay place to work you get paid minimum wage and are usually treated well by employers could be better with benefits and flexibility
good,Prepare for the client to arrive making sure all the equipment is on and you have the product you need.Their is always continue educational classes to keep you updated with your craft.one of the things that I love doing is teaching my co-workers what I have learn and also they share with me.Not having my pay go up and down with season I need steady pay check.my customer the love they showon me and I show them .My client may come in feeling one way and by the time he or she feeling much better and I have done my job.
good,Not  bad place to start fresh out of high school. Its a great place to gain experience in the real world. I would recommend for someone who is looking to gain experience
good,"was a pleasant experience, worked mostly evening, did sales and appointments. Was told there would be a pay raise but was paid trainee wages the entire time. Never seemed to complete training. Had a weird on call policy. Didn't have a good scheduling system either. My coworkers were all helpful and nice, but the hours and on call periods were conflicting with my full time student schedule."
good,"A typical day at work would involve working a assembly line for multiple hours on foot"
good,"all store are not the same, I don't like working at this store, poorly managed.it is good to be working. Hope this is enough information."
good,"My line of work is production"
good,"Friendly atmosphere--great co-workers and customers. Enjoyable interaction. Is a very disorganized working environment--constantly searching for items needed to provide customer service--i.e., bags, boxes, scissors, tape, pens, etc. Often, faced with outdated terminals not working or performing poorly. Poorly working heat/ac, elevators and escalators. Poor response to customer's requests and concerns. "
good,"A typical work day at JCPenney is often very slow and boring in the windows department, unless it is the weekend. Management often does not ""care"" for this department because it is much more difficult than other departments so it is usually hard for us associates to get the things we for sales and stock room purposes. Other than that, it is a great place to work and experience."
good,"-Most of the time, it's really really really slow"
good,"It was a nice place of business, i enjoyed working with my co-workers. My favorite part about the job was working with the customers."
good,"The finacial budgeting to JCP's payroll is confusing. They express how desperately they need new employees, yet every other week employees face hour cuts due to lack of funds in payroll budget."
good,"The management is very friendly, and the work is not strenuous or difficult. All the tasks asked are very simple and easy to learn. The hardest part about the job was not having enough inventory in stock most of our purchases had to be online or bought from another store.The most enjoyable part was having good co-workers and managers who would feed us food on special occasions and let us have an overall enjoyable experience at work."
good,"JCPenney's retail operations are basically controlled by store manager with company policies in effect.  Their regard for employees is average. The call center in Columbus, Ohio was managed very well with company policies strictly enforced. The retail operation was difficult for employees. Manager in charge was well informed and professional. Supervisors were often unfamiliar with department standards. The most difficult part of the job was the expectation that after a full days work on your feet for hours, employees were required to work late hours after the store closed in order to recover the store.  Co-workers were wonderful and were stressed with the demands of the job. If a recovery team came in 2 hours before close, everyone would be able to end the day at their scheduled hours. For example; schedule was limited to a 6 hour day requiring only a 15 minute break however you were required to stay at least 30 - 90 minutes beyond your schedule but were not given required breaks/lunches to compensate for the additional hours."
good,"The company lacked professionalism. No opportunity for raises. Small chance of advancement within the company. The discount was okay. The management were unorganized, I barely saw my team supervisor."
good,"I have worked here for almost two years, and I can honestly say that there is never a dull moment. It is never predictable, which is fine by me. I enjoy working retail, but it would be more enjoyable with better management. I suppose that's a problem anywhere, but my work environment would definitely be more enjoyable with better instruction/leadership."
good,Depending on the department which you work some of the work can be very hard and fast paced and some can be very easy and at a self pace. overall the company itself is a very decent place to work.
good,"JCP has gone through so many changes and it seems each person/division interprets that differently. This all rolls down to the stores. The message is not clear and everyone is confused. Each days consists of constantly moving merchandise and areas and then repeating the process over and over again when a different person comes in and wants it done differently. "
good,"Not a place I would want to go back to because of constant pushing you to sell, sell, sell the JC Penny card even after customer refuses 3 times."
good,"Managers would throw tantrums in front of customers, as well as would blame their own teams for why a customer was as unruly as they were, while not explaining what they could have done better. During morning meetings before store openings they would discuss basic trends in the company nation wide, but would leave out policy changes or new rules and the like, so each person on staff had a different set of rules in mind and only corrected when they in the middle of an altercation with a customer. This also lead to no two staff members had the same information. "
good,"Benefits aren't too good, but if you are looking for a career in retail, then JCP is the best place to start. If it weren't for the low hours and pay, I wouldn't leave to find another position. I love all of my coworkers and my store manager is very helpful!"
good,"It's ok if your one of there favorites. One fl mgr was always very rude and yelling,very unprofessional no the job for her!!!"
good,"I have great work associates, fun place to work , have a great relationship with customers. very busy place lots going on to improve customer relations."
good,"Work was no nonsense, total business, fast paced shipment receiving and floor stocking. We were timed on everything, from the length of our break to how long it took us to get done unboxing children's clothes."
good,I started out as a Cashier and quickly moved up to Customer Service and then finally to Office Assistant.I learned the details of retail and the dynamics of serving the public
good,"Good steady work with lots to do. Lots of backstabbing and poor wage increase. The place had potential, but needed new management."
good,This job was ok. Training was favored to a family friend of the manager. The lack of hours didn't help. Constant Gossiping. Didn't Like this job
good,I've learned how to organize and sort out the company's merchandise. I also learned how to assist customers in various aspects of the store.
good,"Although the manager and my supervisor were nice people and easy to get along with, they never answered my calls. They also demanded a lot from me right from the get-go and had me working in two different departments with very little help. The other employs that I had to work with were not so nice and made work less enjoyable."
good,Very customer service oriented. Great place to work to develop basic skills that can then later be molded to become an efficient worker.
good,"The people are great to work with, hours are flexible and its really laid back.  However its not a great place for advancement, mostly good if you just need money or are a teenager just wanting work experience."
good,It is decent pay for the labor. There are good incentives for more money like the pay for performance program they have. They have many celebrations through out the year in the area's of performance and safety.
good,"JC Penney is a goal setting environment building business clients on rewards and credit. I learned different ways to up sales to the customers and how to cross shop merchandise for that impulse buyer. Building relationships with co-workers and associates to have good communication and earned respect."
good,"Warehouse is great if you are seeking temporary employment, but advancement is very limited. Overall the people working on the floor are very welcoming and it's easy to feel welcomed there."
good,"I have worked for the company a total of 18 yrs. I love the people I work with. Very supportive, management a plus ! Hardest part, standing on my feet all day long. Most enjoyable, co-workers and clients . Look forward to my work days."
good,"A typical day at work at JC Penney was fast paced and productive. I learned how to work a computer system in retail and how to keep the store looking neat. Some managers were kind others were a little up tight but they're only doing their job. My coworkers were super sweet and welcoming. The hardest part of the job was figuring out exactly what I needed to do, because I received no training I relied on myself to figure out what to do exactly. The most enjoyable part of the job was the recognition and prizes associates would receive for doing so well."
good,I enjoy working for JCPenny. I have the flexibility to go to school and be home with my family. It is perfect job for a working mom going to school.
good,Fun meeting new customers everyday. Everyday different. Mostly happy work environment. Hard workers willing to pitch in and go the extra mile for everyone.
good,JCP was very flexible with their employees' work/life balance. Coworkers were fun and enjoyed our day to day activities.
good,"I learned to have a lot more patience with difficult customers, however, I did enjoy 99.99% of them. It was nice when they only wanted to you for your exceptional service.  It was hard to climb ladders and hang shelving.  I adored the women whom I worked with, and they taught me a lot about the business - especially during the holidays."
good,learned how not to manage people based upon supervisors.  extra work given without appreciation nor benefit to employee and company still expecting you to give more
good,"a typical day at Jcpenney's consists of unloading the truck. We remove skids filled with merchandise and take the hanging merch down as well. We break down the skids and deliver product to the sales floor. From this job I have learned all about organization , and paying attention to detail. We are on a time limit so time management plays a big role in my day to day duties. Customer service is key as well. Even though I am focused on getting the job accomplished, I also have to tend to customers, for they are first priority. Management Is very accommodating and easy to talk to. "
good,Overall its a good place to work for the majority of the associates working there.  There is a lot of uncertainty still as we continue to work towards the turnover
good,The managers do not communicate. They work you as a temp until your hours run out they do not give you the opportunity to become permanent
good,JCPenney is a nice place to work for a short time.  The company has changed a great deal in the time I have been there.  My co-workers are a big part of why I have remained there for so long.
good,"A typical day at JcPenney is constantly cleaning the sales floor, dealing with numerous customers with different personalities, and communicating with down to earth associates. JcPenney has taught me patience and that every person you come across is unique. It also taught me how to be respectful towards associates because of our everyday struggles at work. Struggles meaning constantly picking up after customers. The hardest part about our job is coming across a customer who interprets our ""attitude"" the wrong way and feels the need to be difficult towards us. The most enjoyable part is being with the best associates. We like to call each other a FAMILY."
good,"This just is a job for first time workers. A typical day consist of coming to work and making the best out of it, dealing with multiple attitudes. I did not learn very much, we learned how to sell credit cards to different people. The managers were only there when we called on them, they never helped unless a customer needed further assistance. My co-workers wanted more out of JcPenny's. We all were in the same boat. The hardest part about this job is coming to work every morning, expecting something new. The most enjoyable part of this job is receiving gifts for the jobs completed."
good,Depsite working with difficult customers everyday I enjoyed working with my co-workers and managers. Management was balanced out fairly okay could of been better. The hardest part of the job was trying to accept the little pay i received alongside all the hard work i produced.
good,: Load merchandise for stock in on appropriate carts : Ensured accuracy in pricing by checking item into unit shelf before stocking : Maintain sales displays and signage
good,I find my store has a very high turnover in management and staff. There is a huge lack of communication and training. The pay scale is inconsistent between employees. During my 5 years there was a pay freeze for a few years.  I thought with time they would bring my pay up to a reasonable amount compared to my peers.  I am still waiting for that to happen.  The company does not seem to have the money to keep the store staffed and in good repair.
good,"A typical day at work is organizing and pulling items from storage on to sales floor while assisting customers with sales and purchases then balancing and organizing area before leaving. The hardest part of the job is when short of employees, one person may be responsible for two sales floors that makes it double duty til the recovery comes back. A customer may be on one sales floor while you on the other and you have to switch back and forth to ensure that a customer is being help or serve with sales question or ready to purchase items.And you have to meet sales quota even if lots of customers do not come to your sales floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was the training experience. I learn how to follow directions and how to build my own organizational management."
good,"It's a shame the store closed down, because some wonderful people worked there.  It will always have a place in my heart as a place where I learned and grew tremendously"
good,"Its a nice place to work, you do get tough customers sometimes, but you get very nice genuine ones as well.The managers are all very nice."
good,"It was a great, short experience. I loved all the employees and management. I most enjoyed all of the family type environment."
good,"JCPenney has been a great place to work over the years. however, given the recent economy, JCPenney has strayed away from its associate oriented work environment and has focused solely on profit making. This has come at the expense of the associates within its 4 walls. Many associates have low job security and are expected to do a lot more while provided will much less."
good,"J.C. Penney is a nice clean place to work where you get to meet a lot of people.  The sales are great and the good thing about working there is the fact that you are the first one in line for the sale."
good,Learned a lot about retail and what it entails to be a good sales representative. Always providing good customer service. Helped with stocking and shipments.
good,"If you can handle retail you'll handle JC Penney. But, work environment is good. Pay is not the greatest but if you need a job and you're a patient person. It may be right for you."
good,"Spherion at JC Penney was a great way to gain experience, and I loved the management. The only thing I did not like was the treatment I got from the JC Penney associates before I was hired on. The job required a lot of moving around and jumping through hoops, but I did what was necessary to get hired."
good,Fun working environment but poor pay and no benefits. Many employees don't last more that couple of months. Inconsistency with prices of products. Lack of communication between supervisors.
good,"this is friendly work place, i've been working here two year, and i have received one rase. i love my salon manager, she is extremely nice."
good,"JcPenny was an overall positive experience for me. I was only there for 6 months due to the fact that I was just starting out in college and was having a hard time handling work and school. A typical day at work included opening up your department, handling transactions, dealing with customer service, handling inventory, and then closing the store which included cleaning, handing the till, and restocking the inventory. I learned how to handle transactions, deal with customers, and quicker techniques when returning change from JcPenny. The management and coworkers were generally positive to be around. Ages ranged all over, but there was also food in the break room! The hardest part of the job was definitely the rude customers and the non flexibility with schedule availability. Most customers in the area spoke Spanish so I had issues with this job in that aspect. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning and getting to know cool coworkers."
good,"I have a positive experience at the management and coworkers level."
good,"Assist with customer sales in the shoe department, maintain general house keeping of the shoe department, shoe stock room and assist with incoming shoe freight."
good,"I would go to the cash wrap to see what areas was covered to see where I needed to be for the shift. Then I would rehang the clothes, put the clothes away that customers did not want, and folded the clothes on the self's."
good,"Good place to work if you have another job and classes to attend."
good,"tedious, repetative, days went by fast, management is okay"
good,Not a great place for a career. They like to get rid of long term employees and replace them with cheaper workers.
good,"very upbeat and fun, very young and diverse group of workers."
good,"Fun working with children and families, poor upper management"
good,Helping customers with finding what they are looking for while shopping and also providing excellent customer service in the check out process along with it being speedy and neat. Folding the merchandise neatly to make the store look organized and easy for costumers to shop.
good,A typical day was completing cash transactions while also stocking shelves and greeting customers. I also transported purchases to customers cars. I learned how to pleasantly interact with customers and also learned how to handle money.  My co-workers were very nice and pleasant.
good,"working at Jcpenney I learned how to be fast on my feet, how to organize the store as well as keeping the store well stocked. A typical day at work consisted of me putting clothes away from fitting rooms and giving customers great customer service. The hardest part of my job was staying later then scheduled, and dealing with coworkers that didnt want to do their job. The most enjoyable part was getting to know the customers."
good,The best part of the job was working with both customers and associates alike.   I enjoyed the fast pace and the challenge that came with the job each day.
good,"I worked in the shoe department so a typical day would be re-stocking shoes as well as driving sales. Management would give me some direction and I would perform to the best of my ability. Co-workers made the job easier because I got along with them. "
good,"I had to do cleaning . "
good,A typical day at work would consider team work and making customers feel welcomed and  highly satisfied.
good,"Operating cash register, make sure things are back in place and answering phone calls all day is a typical work day at Sagetech."
good,"It was a really fun job, something new everyday. Always learning something new there and the company believes in educating their employees and will send them to classes and let them take classes for free at the store. Great company to work for it just all depends on your location and who's leading the salon."
good,"i did not get enough hours,approx 22 hours a week,very fast paced environment,i think they need to pay more per hour and hire more people because sometimes i had to do the job of 3 people at the same time."
good,"When I first started at JCP, I specialized in mens dress shirts, So i spent my typical day putting out new merchandise, helping and sizing customers, and updating the dress shirt area to the new monthly visual set. After 6 months I became Pricing and Signing Captain. I took on the entire team, directing daily duties based on signing hours and work load. Communicated with the team to make sure everything goes smoothly, as well as do my own signing in areas needed. The system at JCP is not the best. They neglect to give you the information you need as well as give you the wrong information when they supply it. No one was ever on the same page and communication was always a difficult thing. I was given alot of responsibility but not the wages to go with it. It is always a stressful day at work."
good,"l•	Managed and Operated Customer Service"
good,"During the week it is half quiet half busy. "
good,Management was pretty bad but there has been a total over haul since my time there.I believe there is a new owner.
good,great co-workers with positive attitudes. I learned a lot about sales and shoes. the hardest part of the job was the stocking involved when the other team wasn't available. the best part of the job was pizza Fridays during the holidays and random pot lucks.
good,it was only a seasonal job. Great when it comes to getting discounts fro employees
good,"I enjoyed working there, made great friends with co-workers new and old. I usually was pretty good with my hours vs availability. Had support from management when a customer issue arose. It was a like a good family at times. However, once they started changing things around, like the n_zi they brought in as a dept manager. Started cutting my hours, bringing in excessive new employees in what was already a slow moving dept, which accounted for the loss of over 30% of my hours. The DM for our dept wasn't any help either, nor could she be of any help regarding the training staff, which was NEVER held accountable for her mistakes. It was a bittersweet experience. So to those who want to be a part, think twice!"
good,"Co-workers at JCP were very helpful, as well as most management. The most enjoyable aspect of the job was helping customers throughout the day."
good,"Help set up new store in Overland Park, stayed for a year. Liked working with people, both customers and other sales associates"
good,A typical day for me is short and sometimes enjoyable...the customers are actually the best part of my job and what I actually look forward to the short time I am there for!
good,easy job just requires a little bit of patience dealing with customers
good,"Co-workers were great people to work with, I still miss them to this day. The management could have been better."
good,"fun fast paced enviroment, one on one interactions with customers, no downtime, cleaning, folding, stocking, transactions, customer service."
good,"I've never worked for a store that was stressful on a daily basis.  I definitely will miss my co-workers.  The manager was a micro manager, everything had to go her way and nothing was good enough.  She is the worst manager I've ever worked for.  I worked for the company for 28 years and I finally had enough and left with anxiety issues.  The store I worked in was in Chino, California.  I'm still w"
good,"I enjoyed working with the staff, very easy job to do. I loved helping customers."
good,"A typical day inside JCPenney provided many great customer service experiences. The co workers there are great to work with and are top notch. The most important thing I've learned in my time there is to work in a team environment, while also taking the initiative without being told. Stress management and always keeping a professional demeanor is also key. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interactions with customers/people form all walks of life. Overall JCPenney is a good place to work"
good,good place to work just slow had good Management but they left and all the people went with her
good,Very high expectations with little compensation or room to advance
good,"it's an alright job, if you're ok with working the food industry."
good,co-workers are good to work with. Can only work part time.most enjoyable part is interacting with the customers.
good,It was nice working on a team to get things done on the floor and in the warehouse. I learned a lot and met some great people.
good,"Work was okay, very easy but many rude customers. They worked well around my school schedule."
good,"As the title says, I enjoyed working for them as a company. There were many days in which I loved working and was excited to be there. I worked for two stores, and while the first store I worked for in California was fantastic and well managed, the store in Kentucky had poor leadership and staff morale was through the floor. In terms of Retail companies to work for however, they are one of the best that I've worked for."
good,Fashion forward company. Keeping up with the trends. Learning about fashion and how to create new ideas to high end fashion trends.
good,"Typical day at work included assisting customers with shopping needs as well as conducting transactions. I learned a lot about merchandising and display-setting. Lower management was very supportive and positive/helpful, but the general manager seemed very uninvolved. The best part of the job was that I got along great with all my co-workers, there was a very high standard in regards to respecting one another. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a neat an organized department during busy days."
good,"A typical day at JC Penney consisted of surveillance and security of the store. Other responsibilities consisted of the apprehension of shoplifters, protecting assets, high price merchandise inventory, writing reports, networking with police and mall security."
good,"A typical day at work is a bit stressful because the managers put so much work on the employees and associates never really get much appreciation from the mangers. It seems like for all that we do, it's never enough! Break time is way too short for all of the work we do! Most of management have very negative attitudes toward associates which makes working there less desirable and changes the mood of associates. My co-workers are a interesting group of people, but for the most part they all are very hard workers that generally care about making long-term relationships with customers and lasting impressions. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management attitudes especially when you need them. The most enjoyable part of the job is making a difference to the customers and seeing them smile and thank me for my hardwork."
good,Meeting and maintaining client relationships. Scheduling client appointments.  Satisfying customer with friendly customer service. Create client profile for each person. I would also promote retail sales daily as well as accepting payments.
good,"did scheduling, floor displays, goals and charts. sales. customer service"
good,"great place to work, but i need more hours. financal needs not being met."
good,The most enjoying part of my job is interacting with the customers.
good,"A typical day would be to check out customers, put out stock, help customers what they find, interact with customers one on one. I learned to be patient, to be sympathetic with what customers would need, if for a funeral, or something during hard times that the customer would be going through. Management was good, but we would go through management and store management a few times over the years I was there. I loved my last couple department managers and a few who weren't my department managers, because they could empathize with what I needed and help me out. I loved my co-workers that was a big part of why I didn't want to leave, it's hard to find good people you enjoy being around. The hardest part of the job was dealing with barely having hours after Christmas season for a couple months, and changes with management and store management every couple of years, because change is hard. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the customers that knew how to brighten up a day when you weren't in the best of moods, even though a customer couldn't tell because I always had a smile on my face, they would never know if I was having a bad day, and then making me laugh brightened it up."
good,"The responsibility of a sales support associate consist assisting customers on the selling floor, checking customers out at the register. Being involved with pricing and signing for the store as well as replenishment of the new merchandise that arrives to the store. In addition to the fore mentioned above, visual is an important part of the job as well, being able to set merchandise to the floor according to company planning, setting and dressing forms throughout the store. I have learned to have patience while working in retail as well as multitasking with time management. My co-workers are awesome, we all get along great and enjoy working together. The most difficult part about the job is the constant floor changes and communication process or the lack there of. The rewarding part of the job is helping people that may come in with a problem and seeing them leave with no worries."
good,"Working at Jcpenney was very fun. I got to work most of the departments and made a lot of good friends. I was working when the store was going through a lot of changes and learn a lot about retail, merchandising and pricing. Overall it was a good experience."
good,"Customers usually call in to make purchases or to check the status of an order. I have learned the ins and outs of a call center, basic knowledge. I have learned how to navigate through internal systems while assisting customers to the best of my abilities. My manager is usually there to assist me if I need help with a certain situation. Hardest part of the job is having customers verbally speak how they feel and not always being able to satisfy them or tell them what they want to hear. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers to shop for something they need because I love to shop and help others."
good,"Open and Close Registers, sell shoes, check customers out, help customers with products, co-workers were good except some, I liked doing displays and assisting customers."
good,It seemed as if you could be friends with whomever you like and talk and have fun with out getting into trouble.
good,"My day would consist of morning meetings before store open about our day to day progress. Then we would open our registrars, greet customers, and ring customers . Mean while I provide great customer service it was my duty to check all fitting rooms, answer phone calls, help manger with projects. Projects such as moving fixtures to monthly floor set up . Then my manger would train me everyday on how to lead/ manage my coworkers, also train me to read our daily sales goals and how to meet them. Then i would go out back on the floor and help customers till I am off."
good,The customers were always really polite. This company is really big and its great to be apart of such a major company. My team was really pleasant to work with.
good,Great place to work especially for someone looking for their first job.
good,It's ok for students or someone who want part time flexible hours.
good,"Jcpenney overall is a pretty good company. My management in my stores had issues, but just because my Jcpenney store wasn't ideal doesn't mean they are all that way. If you want a flexible job with school. Its a good job with a good discount. As every job goes, it all depends on the management."
good,"I initially was transferred from Sacramento,CA JcPenny's to the one here and was immediately shown a difference in pay and atmosphere. I lost 3.50 in pay and was moved from the Jeweler y department which I transferred from to Catalog which I had never done. It was a difficult experience. I give it a rating of three stars because JcPenny's in CA I loved and there was room for advancement there but I did not have that same experience here."
good,"A typical day is usually steady flow, however, holiday seasons are  very fast and busy. After store closing employees stay for recovery which is often grusome. Totally wiped out from the day and still going and being micromanaged. As  with every where, some co workers are good to work with and some are trying. I find interacting and helping the customer is the most enjoyable to me. Overall management is good."
good,You can tell that managers have favorites and they are not willing to help you out if you are in a bind
good,watch cameras for shoplifters and confront and if needed apprehend shoplifters. The hardest part of the job was trying to catch someone bigger than me. Best part was it was always different day to day.
good,"typical day at work, seeing you be productive while your managers are getting there make up done at the sephora. Ive learned to over see what the managers are doing and how to better my self. Management was the worst i had ever seen. My co-workers were always good people team effort. Hardest part of my job was to see managers not careing about the store. Most enjoyable part of the job was the customers"
good,"its a great atmosphere with employees,but some of the managers were abusing here authority."
good,"My day started greeting people, associates and/or customers. No matter the day a smile, real or fake, greeted you. I learned a lot of patience and how to smile through everything. Before I moved, in the store, management rocked! After I moved I didn't get the hours I was promised. My co-workers, throughout the store were fun, easy going and made work less like work. The hardest part of the job was the not knowing when or where I would be working the next day. The most enjoyable part of the job were the people, associates and customers."
good,Employees are friendly in which you do learn a lot in working at JCPenney.
good,"helping customers, cleaning fitting rooms, checking customers out,"
good,"Customer interaction was fantastic, management and employees we're almost elementary about customers frustrations and complaints, a lot of trash talking."
good,This is a good place to start working also really good people that work at this place.
good,I encounter a high rate customer come into the store completing about not receive there catolog order at the expected time. I was able to apology for the delay.and offer a percentage on there order. review task with management and co-worker to make changes. getting the pieces to fit. once all the pieces are found make it easy to put together.
good,The job was a great steeping stone. They are not very family/ problems issues to work out.
good,"I learned how to sign the merchandise, markdown clearance, how to ring a customer on the register and on an ipod. Management just "
good,"Managers are nice, and also the co-workers are very friendly."
good,"Coming into JCP with the changes I felt they were ahead of the curve and were really gonna change retail clothing. They spoke about customer service and advancements soon I found out not much was true. Our yearly raise consisted of eight cents for supervisors. Though being ""manager on duty"" as well as training within my first month I saw no chance for advancement. I enjoyed the experience and being able to supervise and learning how important communication from supervisors to associates is and look forward to using it more."
good,I've learned plenty in the past 5 months that I've worked here. The supervisors are overall good. I would say that there are some lazy workers but nothing that can't be fixed with replacement.
good,"I enjoyed helping customers and knowing that my opinion was valued. For me, this meant upholding the concept that the ""customer is always right."""
good,Go into work go to the area they assigned you in. I learned how to multi-task alot. Co-workers were really fun to be with most of them were really kind and nice. Hardest part is when you dont have enough associates working with you.
good,Initial Sales experience started at this job. Co-workers were a joy to work with.
good,this is a perfect job for a high school student!.nothing more .
good,"This was the best place to work as a teenager, as you get older you realize its time to find something new and can sometimes be hard to grow with the company"
good,I did outside sales and had appointments all over the Charleston area. Many people did not comprehend that custom decorating is more expensive then what you can get in the store so it was hard to get sales.
good,"I felt this was a good company to work for. I was only there for seasonal help, but it was worth the time. There was always something to be done or cleaned up. I was mostly restocking and cleaning the dressing rooms in the children's section of the store. My coworkers were really nice, and so were my managers."
good,"easy no thought required work. Always something to do. Limited hours, Last minute schedule changes"
good,"A day at work consists of greeting and helping customers, using the cash registers as well as the hand-held register, recovering areas and keeping them clean, taking care of fitting rooms, and working together with co-workers to successfully take care of customers. I learned to be friendlier, how to work well with others as well as by myself, to have patience, and how to provide great customer service. Management here are overall friendly, however I feel that they sometimes look more at the stuff they want you to be doing and not at other stuff you are doing quite well. My co-workers are friendly and eager to help one another with anything. The hardest part of the job is dealing with fussy customers, but with patience it becomes easy. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I can help a customer get exactly what they want and see how happy they are about it."
good,"I originally started with JCP out of high school and ended up putting in about 30 years total. I always worked in fine jewelry and loved my job because I became good friends with a lot of my co-workers and managers along with having a long relationship with quite a few customers. A typical day at work started by putting out the jewelry every day, pulling up sales, giving selling goals to my other co- workers, dealing with customer issues making sure jewelry and watch repairs were sent out,checking  in jewelry and putting out and many other things that were done each day.There really was not a hard part of the job just learning experiences. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting so many different people and selling them a piece of jewelry that represented an important occasion in there life that you were part of."
good,"Jcpenney has helped me gain great managment experience.  A typical day at work is balancing my to do list, the associates, and the customers all at once.  It has tought me a lot and now I m ready for a change and new challenge."
good,"A typical day would be arriving at work having a group huddle, then getting our assignments for the day.  Next we would go out and do our job having fun while working and then go home. I learned a few things but mainly how to organize better. Management was okay we had a new store manager every two years so we got to know them for a little while. There were no hard parts to the job and that just may be the most enjoyable part of the job also."
good,"The hours at JCPenney fluctuated too much and went from 40 hours during the holidays and went down to 7 hours when the sales were down, It was hard to support myself with this amount of income fluctuation and not enough pay. The management expected an open availability, so it is hard to work 2 jobs with their criterion. I have worked in retail for 10 years, and gained some management experience while working for the company, but the skills I learned at this company were the same retail skills I have learned from all my retail experience. I liked working with the merchandise, but mainly I would be stuck at a register all day long."
good,Good opportunity to make money on the weekends during school and the summer. Management was pretty good and allowed me to advance
good,I learned how to handle difficult situations and how to use a cash register. My co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part of my job was not having anything to do! The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to interact with the customers.
good,great place to start when strating in to work in general. retail is fun. 
good,"i thought the hours were good working here but it was such little pay for the amount of work that i was required to do. Had mutiple managers that didnt really know how to talk correctly to the associates. JC Penney didnt teach me how to understand planograms, sorting clothes correctly."
good,Retail store hours are long and seven days a week. Low pay rate. Good customer experience.
good,"I truly love my co-workers. Most employees are very kind and friendly and in many ways they can become like family. A typical day consists of working with customers in item selection, sales, online orders, credit applications and working on assigned projects, along with basic stocking and recovery of merchandise. The hardest part of the job is probably explaining why we are raising prices and the purpose behind our mobile registers. Having a caring department and store manager, as well as wonderful co-workers make an enjoyable working environment."
good,"A topical day would be organizing and cleaning racks, and cleaning out fitting rooms, as well as being a cashier. My Managers that I were head of my departments were great but there was one manager that just had a horrible attitude. My co-workers were helpful and great. There really wasn't anything hard about the job other than learning were everything goes. The customers were the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"The company is okay, just was had to joogle school and this job because they did not want to work with my schdule."
good,1st job. A fun place to work in the mall but not good enough pay.
good,"I loved my job until the new CEO came in, that's when everything changed and the customers were not happy. They took our sales commission away, which was like having another pay check and did not compensate for it."
good,JCP was a good foot in the door for customer service and small sales.
good,Co-workers were fun and supportive of one another. Great customer service. Management changed frequently.
good,"You are tasked with tending to the cash registers everyday, and when no customers are present, you are to tend to the sales floor and help any customers you may find."
good,"A typical day at work I folded clothes, ring up customers, cleaned, and counted down my register at the end of the day. I learned how to multi-task. The management team was okay. My co-workers were uplifting and great to be around. The hardest part of my job was keeping the baby clothes table neatly folded. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to see the new fashion first."
good,"I started to practice my english every single day with customers. My co-workers such a nice people who helping in the hard moments ,but I did by myself . Thank you JC PENNEY."
good,Loading boxes into 2 or 3 containers at a time while moving fast enough it doesn't stop production. Learned a little about RF and RFID . Certification on equipment. Hardest part of the job so far is it's too far.
good,Dealing with daily delivery issues on report anywhere from 200-600 orders. Hardest about job is dealing with the lack of communication by management including whats going on with the company & changes that are being made. Best part is my co-workers
good,"I love this job so much to learn and be busy all the time,interact with mane people from different ."
good,"I worked in the jewelry department, therefore a typical day would be not as busy, and I always used to look for something to do to keep my day going. It was only busy on holidays. I personally did not learn anything in this job other than dealing with jewelry items and know how to sell them. But working there is a responsibility in terms of dealing with diamonds. My co workers were friendly and I enjoyed helping new associates. I did not have no problem in any part of the job. I did not like how they do not give enough hours to their associates and they cut them when they want. The best part of job when I am always busy doing something."
good,"Very personable, willing to work around you and your life, management is great and understanding, co-workers become your friends. It is a great Part time job"
good,"• Responsible for managing and implementation of day to day functions in Supply Chain/A-Receiving department. Monitors and makes recommendations on performance measurements, processes and procedure changes to improve support and/or gain business efficiencies."
good,I enjoyed working for JCPenneys because the of the manager working with me and my schedule to let me be involved with my family. However it was stressful going to work not knowing if I was going to lose my job or not because of productivity we had to meet. With the economy we cant force anyone to come in and get haircuts.
good,"Having the wrong store or department manager could be a downfall and no matter how hard you work, sometime its just not enough or unappreciated. The treatment you get from managers really cause you to not want to show up for work the next day. When managers are changed, and they do not really know you and kon't really care to get to know you, you are mistaken to a no body. I worked there for 16 years and the very last 2 years there were the worst. Even though they hire for the holidays, you still cannot take a trip with your family during the holidays because you are always required to work during the most important holidays of the year which is Thanksgiving and Christmas."
good,"The company was a great place to work, my co-workers were wonderful and I loved working with my management team. I learned alot about myself while working here. I challenged myslef everyday and rose to every challenge."
good,"All of the classes i held and attended would have cost thousands of dollars, that was all part of my training, for that and that only i thank the company. as far as my staff they were awesome..as far as the rest of the store it was a usual circus, most of the other managers with the exception of very few,including myself, would bark orders,and treat their department like animals(really)and as far as the store manager goes, its no wonder she she isnt there anymore"
good,"I learned the ropes of the job by other team memebers, not my supervisor. I felt he wasnt qualified for the position and he did not train me properly."
good,"On the overnight crew at Manhattan Mall was an okay experience and I have had a lot of work to do everything night which was one of the good things I like about Jcpenney overnight. I learned how to use many different equipment. Management were like children, will most of them. The hardest part of this job was getting the co-workers and management to stay out of your personal life and pay more attention to what needs to be done to get the work done. The most enjoyable part of this job was when I had more than enough work to do, but end up completing my job each night."
good,This is a fun place to work. All employee get along with each other and management. This is a job that is not hard. The best part of the job is
good,"I had a large work area to maintain. also, I need to make sure the fitting rooms are clean and do the go backs and when needed i will help at the register."
good,"Start up meetings with my associates began my day. I received a great deal of knowledge in meeting budgets. Sometimes it was a struggle getting training for new process's so it was a must to learn on the fly and hands on. My peirs were very good as far as working as a team. The hardest part of this job became stressful with lay-offs, associates were not their usual cheerful selves but how could they be not knowing if they had a job when they arrived. So many cuts impacted the entire company literally."
good,"For my first real job it wasn't too harsh, they expected the basics for any customer service related position. You have to do a lot of cleaning if you working in clothing. Overall I would work here again if I had the opportunity."
good,"I really enjoyed the overall experience working at JCPenney. The company itself is a great place to work for and is active in its local community's. For example, there are or were while I was there, monthly drives to donate to the United Way. However, with recent company restructuring, job security became a paramount concern and eventually lead me to leave this company."
good,JC Penney is a great company to work for and I learned alot about being a great salesman however the management can be a little off with the hours that alot of associates recieve. The most enjoyable part is the relationship you can build with the associates and management.
good,Reviewing Blue Prints and Redlining Errors
good,"typical day would start with checking emails and updates for all visual standards, put up or change sale signs and graphics, insure floor plans were executed in a timely matter, re merchandise walls and displays in a timely matter, worked closely with department supervisors. I worked with a great staff of people and worked well as a team. Hardest part of the job was having to quit due to the restructure of the company, most enjoyable part doing something different every day."
good,fold cloths and casing out customers is a daily routine.there are no benefits and no union. You do to interact with a lot of people and the hours are flexible.
good,"Pennies is an older family -owned retailer that provided a great working atmosphere. With the new company initiatives and culture, the overall focus changed drastically. The management staff had great working relationships and was truly dedicated to the success of the store. However, if the changes don't simmer rather quickly and they don't internallypromote, they take the risk of many employees becoming disgruntled."
good,"This was the typical seasonal position. Fun learning environment though short term. Manager was very detailed and motivating. The co-workers were helpful, a team environment. Photography is a learned skill, I would have liked to spend more time acquiring the necessary skills. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing people smile for the camera."
good,I loved working for JC Penney. I left this job because there was no real advancement opportunities for me. Everyone I worked with was very nice and it was really hard for me to leave.
good,"When I first started working at JC Penney, it was a fun place to work. The people were friendly, including management. The management moved on, and new ones came. That was the start of the downfall. Now, JC Penney is going through more changes, corporation-wide, which have financially affected the loyal employees. They have basically forced people into early retirement, if they were old enough. Those who weren't, they ""eliminated"" their positions. They also have significantly cut the hours of the ones who are still there, which makes it very difficult to survive."
good,Shapiro's tree experts is a private owned tree removal company. They have been in buisness for 25 years and are well organized.
good,"A typical day at work was okay, but very dramatic."
good,"Overall, management was very nice. I was taught how to use the JCPenney registers, which were different than ones I have worked before. I learned how to offer the JCP credit card. I was also taught how to place, and receive online orders. The hardest part of the job was the constant refolding of the children's clothing. The very best part of the job was having a customer come back and ask for me by name. Knowing that I made even the tiniest good impression on a customer, is very satisfying!"
good,Everyone gets along and the customers are great. I answer the phones and sell products when I'm not styling hair. Our catalog department recently closed so we are a little busier assisting customers. The most enjoyable part of this job is making the customer feel better than they did before they came into the salon.
good,"Open or close check email and my compass. See whats on the my compass task to see if any priority tasks are there. Get those complete first. Everyday consist of visual task, graphics, pricing, training, delegating, working the sales floor answering MOD calls, giving customer service, etc. You learn time management, visual skills, customer service skills, communication skills, management skills, and much more. I enjoy working with people who are motivated and have a passion for what they are doing. The hardest part of the job is the time. It has a very high demand for time at work. So the work and life balance tend to be all work and no life. Accomplishing my duties and task. Being successful at each process and making it my own."
good,Its a challenging place to work since it lacks structure and organization. There is no communication and it becomes complicated to balance a personal and work life with the changes and constanly made without previous notification.
good,"I enjoyed working at JCPenney's it was a great company to work for. I would come in in the morning get my supplies, turn on my computer ,check the cartons I'm work on and start scan cartons first open and take merchandise out of cartons and check and compare to what's on the screen,then start scanning items,looking for any discrepancies,getting merchandise floor ready for stores. All my supervisors where great.Loved my co-workers, lifting some of the heavy cartons.The company picnics"
good,Great Training and good advancement opportunities if you are committed and willing to work hard.
good,I have learned a great deal on professionalism and how to communicate better.
good,JCP is a good company to work would have loved to stayed .
good,"My day began with sorting freight by store department. Next, the merchandise was taken to the proper department and stocked. I learned that retail is a very labor intensive industry. My coworkers and I made a great team."
good,A typical day would be working with numerous customers as a customer service representative handling any needs the customer may have.
good,very demanding job. must have great customer service skills.I enjoyed meeting new people daily.learn to have more patience.
good,"They are moving to an Apple mentality, where Steve Jobs had 100 people who he felt ""ran"" the company. So if you are one of those, you are going to be very happy and empowered and well compensated. However, in my opinion only, if you are not, you will become expendable on a moment's notice, as he is going to move like a start up, where things can be discarded immediately. For example, if you are working on a private brand, and a national brand with similar product comes calling to have a Shop, then all merchants, product development, sourcing, etc, become immediately expendable. Not saying that isn't a good business decision, just saying that it will make for uncertainty for most of the people in the company as far as job security. I enjoyed my time there in many ways, and I do not regret it, so please do not take this as a slam on the new company, it is just not where I would necessarily want to be unless I was brand new out of college. THEN, it could be an exciting place to be!"
good,"With a fast pace, big smile, and a friendly, warm, welcoming greet to each of my customers. I would start with my shock, seeing what was needed for the floor, and in the process giving service to the customers around me rather it be checking out, payments, returns, applying for a creditcard, or simply just needing an honest opinion. From time to time i would to the train someone how to work on the sales floor, folding, and interacting with customers. If the manager would go on vacation it was my job to get the schedule and paychecks ready. I've learned that the customers needs come first, that you are expected to give your best, and to have self-control in every situation. Out from my peers or for better words my co-workers my work spoke for itself. I have never had a problem with any of my managers nor supervisors in the past. If you take a look at my references you will see my managers listed. I work really fast, but organize, and very well put together. My parents raised me to respect those older and younger then myself; so for that, and the fact that i dont get into peoples business i never get into trouble nor situations with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was getting customers to apply for creditcards. The most enjoyable part of my job was watching the customers walk away with a smile on their face of satisfaction"
good,This job was busy and fast-paced! However it did require standing alot and could be tiring at times. Most of the managers were nice and the customers mainly ask for opinions on products and assistance with products. You're also given a JCP discount as an employee and the also give rewards to excellent sales associates.
good,"greeted guest, stocked clothing order clothing online for customers..sold credit cards..co workers were sweethearts..job wasnt hard loved working with guests"
good,"Customer service, multitasking, team work, fast peace environment"
good,Overall JCP is a good company to work for. A typical day at work is very fast paced and nonstop. There have been numerous of job cuts within the company. Management is forcing associates to work triple then what they are getting paid for. More work is expected with less pay. Raisies were withheld for three years straight we were told basically to be thankful to have a job. Management do not promoted based on performance 80 percent of the time. Promotions are based on politics and friendships the calibration process unfair.In the calibration process you are evaluated by managers that aren't your managers. This is basically a trap for associates to remain at the bottom of the chart. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers making sure all of their needs were met and totally satisfied within a timely manner.
good,"Come in with a smile on your face. Check out customers, help customers with any needs in finding something. I learned how to use a register, balance a register. Co-workers were fun and nice. Hardest part of the job is standing on feet for hours at a time. Most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with nice people."
good,Taking calls from customers was fun since you never knew what they would say. Not much contact with co workers since mostly talking to customers. Some customers are hard to please and sometims very rude.
good,Great company. Good family of people who are professional in most everything.
good,"A typical day is a fast-paced,heavy lifting,a lot of bending and twisting. You needed to keep the merch neat as well as stop to help the customers with a request. The staff was always enjoyable to be around and always willing to help the other.Every day was a learning experience. The hardest part I would have to say is keeping the time table on your side. The most enjoyable part is the satisfaction that the customer is now able to find what they need with out having to hunt."
good,The part of the job that I loved the most was adding value to the stores and the people that I come in to contact with. I loved seeing people succeed and put strategies and ideas in to practice.
good,I enjoy helping the customers find what they need or iordering online for them. My co-workers are all cheerful and happy to do their job. Management lacks in the training area. They will assign you to a position without the proper training.....you need to teach yourself by experimenting.
good,"its what ever, i work way to hard to get paid so little."
good,accounting and working closely with customers to ensure high levels of service ensuring satisfaction. A very capable and efficient team player with excellent interpersonal skills who takes on additional responsibilities to contribute to organizational success.
good,"LETGO. Staff reduction due to the economy. St. Louis Missouri, 2006-2010."
good,"Training was great, very detail oriented. Was very intuned with the need for a family first environmeent. Very flexible when it came down to family needs. Made sure every employee was well trained."
good,"Job was fun , learned a lot . The training was great . Had great time in the advance classes that the company sent me too.A lot of what i still use today."
good,they were friendly always had a goodtime doing there job. they were very helpful. always had fun on the job.
good,It was fairly good pay and benefits but not enough hours. I was only there a few months and they couldn't keep me and so I could not get unemployment benefits.
good,Jc penny’s main goal was to make the customers happy. To be greeted and to be treated with kindness and always ready to help. We attempted to ask them if they needed help before coming to us.
good,"I learned how to have more of a positive attitude when dealing with customers, always received help when I least expected it. Excellent management when situations arose."
good,It's a great place to work but you wont get alot of hours! You will be very busy most of the time they have alot of employees but most wont fo anything
good,"Hard to say because I am a stylist that "
good,"it is fun to work there fast paced, competitive pay, they don't have you working a set schedule, breaks are not set, six hours and less you only get one fifteen break 7 1/2 hrs one half hour and one fifteen, longer then you get two fifteen and half hour"
good,"Didn’t get trained well enough. Do everyday was hard, and i always had to ask for help.co workers had horrible attitudes. It was my first job and by far the worst work experience. Which is why I’m so cautious about where i work now."
good,"It wasn’t for me i didn’t like it , it was good pay but , i never got to do cash register i was just temporary but everybody else got to do it . i left like a slave ."
good,"Different level of information, management requires you to learn how to become an agent, the culture of office was family, enjoyable time was when we had classes of how to become and agent"
good,"Learned how to sell and approach customers, this was my first job and I liked it. I learned great skills, I enjoy going to work, I’m just looking for another skill"
good,"Good place for customer service skills, sales associate, stocking, and a lot of other things. Happy environment and nice co workers. Overall a really good place."
good,"The store manager is a tyrant and customers and staff find her to be very rude and short tempered. She is not friendly at all and often times come off as mean, impatient and too busy to help customers. I see why the store is empty all of the time!"
good,"A typical day at work was fixing tables, greeting customers and also helping costumers find what they are looking for in the store. I learned about many different brands in the store and also how to scan items on a cash register."
good,I would clock in and start working register. We were understaff so I usually worked alone. It was overwhelming at first but I got used to the work and it became easy for me in the end.
good,"Low paying job that forces you to open credit cards. And typical retail environment. Long lines, fast paced.    Be friendly and don’t be rude to the rude people -.-"
good,Everyone was nice and helpful. They made sure you were trained the correct way and efficiently.  Management was amazing and helped with schedules and making sure it was all good.
good,I think that the job was fun when I was there  I wish they had better work life balance but the overall job was good  we had good leadership and a good environment
good,The work hours were good. Decent staff room. awesome employee discounts. employers were nice and understanding. nothing to complain about. very satisfied with company
good,just like any other job it has its ups and downs. the only drawback is that they require you to get at least 2 jcp credit cards from people that don’t already have it per week.
good,"JCP was always very considerate about my school schedule while i was working there, they also compensated time and a half for most, if not all holidays."
good,"I have worked for JCP twice at the same location.  Rumors of store closings makes for low morale.  The stylists are fun. A nice work family.  Open 13 years, was better earlier.  23 stylists, too many. Clicky.  Stylists with some unethical behavior ie.  taking as many walk ins as possible.   Seems like a hair mill.  Monthly coupons freebies"
good,"My experience there was a little different "
good,"It's a nice place to work, nice coworkers, easy to learn job. If you do your job and do it well, you'll be fine. They have flexible schedules so you can set your desired times to work."
good,I loved working for Jcpenneys till I became permanent I messed up on counting the register and was accused of taking 2 dollars I was in shock by the fact my checks were like 250-300 I didn’t need to take vending machine type of money I understand I’m responsible for the money in the register but 2 dollars shouldn’t automatically make you think I took it especially coming off of Christmas time my check was 500.
good,"Fast pace, long hours, good pay, lots of different people here,  always on your feet, and always busy packing, the pay is twice a month, but they only start you at as a part time employee"
good,"It was a nice work place for me to explore and create a comfortable sales character and build professionalism. Great for youth and students, or flexible professionals."
good,"This was my first job, depending on what department you get put in you'll have a different experience. It's not hard per say, but can be taxing with angry customers and unrealistic expectations from management. Little to no pay raises, even if you are a long time/seasoned hard working employee. People who do half the work you do will likely be paid the same, if not more. Hours were good and flexible for college students, but run the risk of becoming a big fish in a little pond soon enough."
good,I would clock in at 7 AM and start up the registers for the day (count money in drawers/ clean up workspace). I would watch and maintain the floor for any miscellaneous items or customers who needed help. I would do returns as well as online returns and orders.
good,"It’s a good company to work for during the holidays. Supervisors not quite organized and they don’t go by your availability."
good,The staff was very welcoming and this was a fun place to wok for the holidays. I enjoyed helping customers with their purchases. The discounts helped me provide a good christmas for my family.
good,Management doesn't always care.  Some do others don't. However the company is great about helping charities and people in need. The job is what it is. It's a retail job. Be ready to push credit cards on people.
good,"It’s an okay job for people with not much of a financial responsibly. Schedule was ok but I did not like the mandatory closing shifts and the long holiday hours. At the time, my management team was awesome until everyone was laid off which then caused the store to flop. I believe this occurred company wide and most of my colleagues then left the company as well."
good,While the company was great to work for but it was 1 hr from my home to get which is why I leave. My job was to put the tags on the merchandise and to put it in order.
good,"This is not a bad job for people who like to sell. Cashier's have to meet a quota for selling a customer on a credit card. Cashier's are hounded by management to meet that quota or your hours get cut. As a cashier you also need to be able to navigate online JCPenney.com and oder things for customer's to get picked up at the store or to their house. But, selling credit card's is a must!"
good,My job entailed standing for long periods of time and cleaning up after people. The hardest part of the job is doing recovery and fitting rooms. At times it can be stressful working in the fitting room because at the JCPenny I was working there was only 1 person working their assigned fitting room. So the fitting rooms get filled with clothes pretty quickly and it can be hard to manage at times.
good,"Nothing was very difficult to get the hang of, and thus something seasonal here was not difficult here at all. This would be good for someone who enjoys simple, but possibly repetitive work."
good,The best part about this job was working independently. No one was over your shoulder watching everything you do. You are expected to remain focused and self-motivated.
good,"Associates in men's sportswear were not on commission at the time, although associates in some other departments were."
good,"This job was pretty run of the mill as far as department store jobs go. Nothing too different or special. I enjoyed working here."
good,I really love hot soup the job really did entail getting soup ready and hot at all Times i was so thrilled to get the soup out to the guest for all to enjoy
good,"I didn't have a problem here, I mean I probably would have stayed if I were hired for more than just seasonal work. But I have to be honest I was only here for three months, if that. I cant give a good or bad review"
good,"Problem: The manager only cared about the time allowed each call, so I was rarely able to give the customer individual attention. The products were great but the customer's happiness is often not the bottom line.  (Keeping the customer focused as one guides he/she through the purchasing process is important, but a company's demise will surely come if management disregards its promise to uphold corporate ethics.)  Professional integrity is critical, so shrewd sales tactics and improper guidelines regarding the sharing of products/services to those who are offering their trust, loyalty and hard-earned money is unconscionable. "
good,"Overall, the company is a good place to work, especially if you are looking for supplemental income. Advancement opportunities are few and far between."
good,"I used to work in the home department, for the most part. Things would get busy sometimes but for the most part it did not get the same traffic as the clothing departments. I would have my tasks to complete at the end of the night and everything would look nice yet I would have to go fold clothes in another department until I could leave, sometimes taking hours. During the holidays it was the worst because they could make you stay until 1 am to pick up the other departments. The pay wasn't worth it all. Overall, would not recommend unless you are out of options because they are always hiring and hire everyone."
good,"Fun place to work and opportunities for advancement. Great location, fair pay, great benefits, employee discount, flexible hours. Lots of different departments to experience, including warehouse."
good,"The JC Penny location that I worked out of was going through hiring a new store manager and the store was going through. I would work several different departments through out the store every shift, the dressing rooms were always a disaster because associates wouldn't have been in there in days and managers would say different things so shift instructions and goals would be confusing"
good,"would go to any jcpenneys to work they are a good company to work for i learned alot why "
good,I'm certain there are others who have had a great experience.  The stores are quickly becoming obsolete as millennials and others shop online for the products they carry
good,"If your on the floor your folding clothes or towels.  Buy padded shoes because standing on those floors hurt so bad.  The break room is nice overall experience there wasn't too bad or good         "
good,"It’s a pretty relaxed environment for the most part. For what I do, I can work at my own pace except when the days are busy. But I don’t get payed enough. And you have to be careful of what you say or do cause they’re fast to spread the word around."
good,"It's a good place to work. Management works hard to be fair as possible and promote talent. A typical day at work requires employees works a variety of network, systems, and operational problems. The culture is fast pace. The hardest part of the job is unpacking complex issues. Learning is unlimited, you just have to go after it."
good,"In my time working as a sales associate at JCPenny, there were lots of relationships between HR and associates, lots of drama, and just a lot of being immature."
good,They would decorate for the Holiday's and dressed up too. There would be a special coupons on Black Friday's that was limited and where placed into gift bags that were given to the customer's.
good,"A typical day of work at JcPenney is pretty simple, there's a lot of employees so there isn't really much to do if there isn't customers. Other than folding clothing, organizing by colors, sizes, and gender. The management team there is very flexible, understanding and hands on. The hardest part of the job would have to be marketing and trying to convince someone to spend money. The most enjoyable part was the location or the store and the discounts on clothes"
good,"Very competitive, they pay 13.25/hr for the role but given very little hrs. management was not very helpful when I brought them my problems. This department becomes very boring at times because not everybody buys furniture everyday, so you'll sit there for hours and get your hours cut because your not making any sells eventhough there's nobody to make a sell to."
good,JCPenney is overall an alright place to work. The best part i would say is getting to to meet and interact with different people. The not so fun part is recovering.
good,This job will provide you with a income. Will feel like a full-time job even when part-time. Must have lots patience to deal with multiple personalities when it comes to the customers. Good luck.
good,My experience of working as a cashier and customer support was awesome . I met a lot of people working at this company. I was all around employee at this store.
good,helping customers find what they need and accomplishing it is great feeling. Having customer service skills is a plus. Must have patience and be knowledgeable of store
good,"Very fast pace job, love working with people learning from others and getting the experience. I enjoy working there, they offer excellent discounts and rewards to employees."
good,The job is ok for a teen or something but not as an adult because it is only $9 an hour which is not really a lot considering your shifts are around 6 hours.
good,"The co-workers were fun to work with, and encouraged one another during shifts. Some of management was hostile towards marginalized employees, and made transphobic remarks to an employee on the clock. Most of management tried to maintain working relationships with the employees. The workplace was friendly, and upbeat most of the time."
good,Here in Concord the job is slow paced because of the type of clients and stylist that work at this location. Affordable prices and people still want a discount so no real money for the stylist to make.
good,J C Penney has been a great company to work for during the last 10 years. They respect my time availability and allow me the opportunity to grow and advance in the company if desired.
good,"Good job for people who likes face to face customer retail. It is not a hard job at all. issues are JCPenney is constantly changing things to improve efficiency, customer service.However, management at does not provide adequate time or does not set aside time to train. It can be very frustrating."
good,"there were many problem in the organization of the company, very disorganized, they dont recognized people that have degrees because they dont want to pay."
good,"Fairly easy but keeping the store straight is a major thing. Also, if a cashier they expect you to get customers to sign up for credit cards. That is a very big thing."
good,"JCPenney, from my experience was my favorite job although the lack of communication really showed. I never got to submit my availability nor even view when I was scheduled due to a manager never fixing my account."
good,"It is not a hard job at all. My issues are JCPenney is constantly changing things t0 improve efficiency, customer service, etc. However, management at least at my store does not provide adequate time or does not set aside time to train everyone on the new things we have to do. It can be very frustrating."
good,"fun people to work with "
good,Overall the guest that shop at jcpenny were kind and made the job worth while. I feel education is something that could improve for all team members. I feel the computer systems could also be upgraded as well for the connivence of the customer.
good,"Fun place to work but its not an easy job. You get to work as a team and interact with your co workers. However, you have a lot of responsibilities and it can be overwhelming. Cashiering, recovery, fittings rooms, credit card applications are the minimum responsibilities. We aren't paid enough and the raises if given are poor."
good,Definitely not somewhere you want to work forever. Great part time company but needs better pay and better work life balance. I wouldn't know though I only worked here for a year after high school.
good,"Fair and reasonable place to work. Work hours were reasonable until they decided to downsize the department and eliminate Major Appliances and Furniture, then hours were cut for one month before being laid-off."
good,A typical day work started around 6 or 7am. Once trucks unloaded a fast pace enviroment starts. Nothing really hard about the job though. Everyone helps out with each other.
good,"Not much to say but if you have open availability they will schedule you overnight shifts and then morning shifts back to back, it was a really good place to begin with retail."
good,The job in the salon was hectic but not overbearing. You definitely have to multitask. It was not a difficult job at all. The stylist would sometimes argue over the walk ins that came in.
good,I loved working at JCPenneys. But was very disappointed when my job was taken away. After 10 yrs I was told I would longer have a job. And before I left had to change all the prices on all the merchandise in the store. Working there was where I got my benefits. Was so sad to leave.
good,"I was schedule a 2pm to 9pm shift, and they would not physically let any employees leave until 2 am, until the store was clean to their standards. I was roughly 17 at the time and very much taken advantage of."
good,Working at Jcpenney was a nice work experience but i felt management was below subpar. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and the friendly environment.
good,management wasn't the nicest definitely need to work on better customer service and treat the staff better but over all was fun during the seasonal time was i was there since it was busy.
good,"Several supervisors did the least amount of work, except when top management was close by, the younger ones  (the girls)were  and still are very passive, inmature, not capable of handling customer issues or even correctly answering customer questions,  weak in authority, partied with employees and talked about other supervisors, calling them foul names and discussing personal information with subordinates, to create conflict and hide thier inability to lead, delegate and work effectively, efficiently on thier own and not on the backs of the mature, hardworking supervisors, unfortunately it just became very nonproductive when the young supervisors were put in positions they were not capable of fulfilling in a team atmosphere,  besides that ,the position was fulfilling and rewarding offered many challenges to grow and learn, pay should have been better but other benefits helped  out."
good,"I enjoy shopping here, would not work for JCPenny again. I was not a fan of the way they ran things and I felt over worked and under paid. But they have great sales!"
good,I really learned how to socialize and communicate with others from the job and the customer is always right. I like working with a group of people. Always worked hard.
good,"It was very slow at times, many employees didn't perfom their position and the management was not very organized.  Overall a boring place to work and very unorganized during the holidays."
good,"The job taught me a lot about retail and what to expect when working in an fast pace enviroment. The pay was ok, at the time being 16 it was more then enough for the time being."
good,"Starting off the job was fun, fast pace, enjoyed working, as it changed hands and new management came in, it made it hard to work there, took a lot from the associates and changed rules, took benefits from us, was not a fun place to work any longer"
good,JCPENNEY was an interesting place to work.  I love my co-workers they were like my family.  We all helped each other whatever the situation was so I liked going to work.  Now Management was a different story there were some managers that were like family and others that weren't.   And  the top managers were always  leaving.
good,"great place, a bit hot and the stats are high but decent pay and a friendly place to work. great coworkers and great bosses just horrible management.."
good,Unfair to the seasonal staff when they are working. Decent place to work if you are a normal employee. At this location management definitely chose favorites.
good,"JCPenney needs to work with schedules and management requirements. Where's the company would actually interview everybody that applied for the position then just interviewing the people they feel is qualified for the position it's just cuz on paper they seem qualified they may not actually be qualified for this position as where someone saying probably doesn't have the necessary paper qualifications "
good,"My department was Omni ( online and in-store returns), a typical day was  a balance of slow to busy. I was given opportunities to go to different departments within the store to advance my knowledge of the company and the systems used for the store. The management did very well with assisting the employees with costumers, and helping you with any problems you might have with the job. The most difficult part of the job was the putting away of the clothes, considering how large the store was you typical worked by yourself while being on duty in your current department. But the best part of the job was the friendliness of my fellow co-workers, most of them were willing to help me with any questions or task that i needed assistance with."
good,Unfortunately I did not enjoy my time there.  The job description wasn't what I was told during my interview.  There was a lot of turnover there as well as poor management. But when I was checking clients out and in I enjoyed visiting with them.
good,"Company is struggling. A lot of people from my department have left and gone on to more stabile positions/companies. "
good,Associates were to get as many credit application in order to receive an extra 2.00 dollar for every customer approved. which made it harder to receive extra earning for your work.
good,"It is a great place to work if you work in Panama City store. The team is fantastic! They will work with you and your availability, they will see your talent and treat you well. The Panama City Beach store is a whole other story.... There are supervisors that work set schedule, but they will not work with your second job schedule or school schedule. There is a total lack of communication. I watched so many people quit."
good,"Greet customers upon arrival"
good,"It was a great first job. Started as seasonal and was asked to stay as part-time. Friendly work environment, diverse employees and management. Slow-paced work days during off seasons."
good,"Great place to work at, fun place to work at, clean restrooms. Good customer service. Well organized work place.Provided great coupons. High quality merchandise.  With great prices/"
good,All team members were encouraged to help each other as needed and cross-trained to assist in areas other than where they were assigned.  Very seasonal business and pace varies widely.
good,It was good working there good experience learn things about customer service and satisfaction overall experience was good and a nice job just not enough hours.
good,"Great place to work, some co-workers were rude. Cleanliness was top priority next to customer service but no all employees were follow this and would instead play on devices instead of re organizing shelves and displays."
good,"It was a good experience but I would often come home with back pain and swollen feet. Sometimes the customers were extremely rude, and they put a lot of pressure on the workers in terms of getting people to apply for JC"
good,"I learned how to be patient and to be as helpful as I can to customers. I learned that if you have a good work ethic, you will get rewarded/recognized."
good,"With my time with this company, I have learned that it is a pass over job. This is not something I would desire to keep permanently. it's very difficult to move up even to a simple leadership position in the store."
good,"Loved working here, but management was not great. need more qualified management and supervisors. Flexibility in schedules was the best part about this job."
good,For my first job I believe that this was an ok job to have. It may get very hectic and overwhelming but overall you can learn new skills and become a better person along the way.
good,When you submit to have different hours they dont do it and there's nothing fun and exciting to do there except fold clothes over and over. You get moved all over the store and put into different departments.
good,"I thought this job was fairly easy and not boring, the only thing I didn't enjoy was having to carry more than my fair share of the work load. From management to other associates, it seemed like everyone was giving the majority of the work to a few people."
good,Overall my time at JCPenney was okay I had great coworkers but our management was not good at all. Our work environment was always hot and our AC did not work.
good,"Hours were long, unpredictable, and not well communicated. Little to no room for advancement.  Felt taken for granted, would not want to submit myself to that kind of environment in the future."
good,A typical day at work would be make sure floor is neat and learning new things about product use/mangement expectancy. The workplace culture as far as goes...is it's encourgeing team with employee of month opportunities. The hardest part of job was after store closing clean up in short period time frame as well as the enjoyable most part of job is complete assign tasks as asked.
good,I was young working there and for me it was just a job.  I do remember getting my breaks having fun interacting with the customers but that is about it.
good,"Was a fun place on first, got on seasonal, I was one of the best, they kept me and things went down from there to where I would only work one day one week and two or three the next, labor was always high apparently which forced me to get another job, worse part of the adult life."
good,"Working here was one of the worst mistakes of my young career path. The managers took their jobs to the next level of demanding personal favors such as making team members leave the store to get them lunch or other personal items. Managers would also openly judge and criticize employees in front of customers, calling employees “slow” and “stupid” while training and learning a new position at the store. Working here was a terrible experience for me."
good,I thought this job helped me learn and grow as a person. I learned very helpful skills and I can cope with stressful work situations better now. Working here can sometimes be boring.
good,"I enjoyed working at JCPenney while I looked for other jobs, but due to the low pay and inconsistent hours, I will not likely work for them again. The environment set by management was positive, but there were obvious skill gaps in the management team that made the day more stressful than it needed to be."
good,"Enjoy Majority of my co-workers, salon is slow to much waiting around for clients. Pricing can be a little hard to understand for the clients. The discounts are pretty awesome. Work environment depends on the day."
good,"Productive, educational workplace. Great for some one who is interested in perusing a career in Retail Management. Work place culture is always striving to please the consumer and to always meet the consumers needs."
good,"I enjoyed my time at JC Penney. I developed skills to prepare me for future jobs and life. The store I was located at has since been closed, but was a great company to work for."
good,"Typically you would arrive to work and do hair. Color, cut, perm whoever was on your book. The hardest part of the job was sometimes the unorganized ways of the store. I really enjoyed getting to do hair and learn about each client and help them however they needed helped."
good,The leadership keeps changing and we've lost all of our experienced people. The politics seem to be worse here than at other retailers. I have felt stuck in my current position which is why I'm looking to find something different that I'm more passionate about.
good,My day would start by setting sales goals for the day. I would then walk the sales floor to ensure we were ready and full for that days business. I would ensure that the staff was aware of all current sale ads that were running at that time.
good,"While this is a great company for an entry level employee, finding a real career in this dying industry is just not worth it. The constant turnover, inconsistent leadership, and company-over-client mentality makes this a tough job to invest in"
good,"It was a long time ago.  I enjoyed it, I did not make very much money, but it was close to home.   "
good,"Working Fine Jewelry was okay but really boring if we were slow. Working front registers was okay, too. But again, boring if we were slow. Working on the floor was always boring, and it was super repetitive. Training is really bad there. They barely teach you anything before they put you to work. Pay is low."
good,just like every other retail store. northing but engaged customer in signing up for credit card. helping customers find what they looking for and helping around the floor
good,My experience working at JCPenny was good and very busy. I worked the holiday season. I received a good discount. I did apply for work with the company before my seasonal help ended.
good,"Gosh, where do I begin, It was good at one point, I started off as a seasonal worker... I was fortunate to stay but after they let go of people the workload doubled. I promise you it is the worst thing. Management has made multiple associates quit, I think like 20 or more have left in my 4 months of working, Which I still do work there. It's a good job to start with but look for a better opportunity."
good,JCPenney was a great foot in the door job for the retail industry and a good job to have while in college or as a part time position. It was helpful for customer service experience.
good,"I did not get enough hours  They picked favorites over employees, they paid terribly, they were really rude to me alot of the time. "
good,Looking for something fresh and not as strenuous on my body.  Just want a change and a different atmosphere. Learn more and do more. Very likeable job just not what I thought.
good,Nice but had a lot of changes to the salon and it effect the regular customers and the atmosphere. All in all a nice salon to start at and to learn more about hair.
good,A typical day in the job was about attending customer. Show customer the characteristics and different appliances. I learned how to deal with different kind of people
good,The hours are plenty and you never have to worry about that. If anything you have to worry about when you will get free time. The customers can be frustrating but you meet lots of different people and some can be memorable in a good way. Management could be better and the hardest part of the job but there’s a few who make it better.
good,"JC Penney is an average place to work at best. There are some cool co workers there. However, the management is very lazy and relies on the workers for everything while they do nothing."
good,Working for this company was a quite an experience. It was really hard to get promoted. It was important that you made your sales goals. Too much turnover.
good,"this job was okay for a job, but managers did not agree with certain things that I was forced to do. I worked in the back with customers orders and was really encouraged to sell jcp credit cards. i've only sold a few. staff was excellent except for management. overall an okay experience."
good,if your cant work with little ones this is not the job for you. Working at lifetouch photography in JCP is very stressful yet rewarding. it was a good job while in college but not for the long run.
good,begin work at 4 am take inventory off truck set it up for other workers to break down. break down  inventory to be sent out to floor. put  inventory on floor.
good,"If you are looking for second job to just supplement your income, or if you just want a few hours to work, to pass the time, this job is for you. However, unless you are looking to go into management, making a decent money on this job alone will be difficult. There is not room for advancement and there are no benefits available unless you are full time, ie: management. Hours vary depending on business needs. Regular procedure for retail."
good,"works well with schedules, works around school if need be. room for improvement but overall a fun place to work. work environment was fun. loved my coworkers."
good,Good as a first job but you shouldn’t stay here. The company doesn’t care for its employees. So much is expected of you for the little time that you are given and you can never go over 40 hours if you even get to that
good,"help customers with catalog purchases"
good,"It's an entry level retail job, everything you need to know about it you can find during the application process and in reading their mission statement. "
good,The job isn't too bad. Its just the hours that wasn't cool I guess. Not much hours are given to everyone it seemed like only the well known workers got more hours.
good,"As a partime employee, my schedule was typically consistent with the weekends. The environment is very quick pace and almost everyone is occupied with a task."
good,Great Wk place but needed more hours. Although I was seasonal it still worked out but would have loved more hours. Boss was great and coworker were awesome.
good,My First Job So I Had No Idea What I Was Doing But It Turned Ok I Learned Alot From That Job And Communicating With People On A Daily Basis Helped ME with Alot Of things And They Were Always Busy
good,"Pretty good job. Time goes quickly. Customers are nice.  Other depts. pick up their stuff timely, co workers are nice, help each other out, fun to work with."
good,JC Penney was my first warehouse job and has taught me mostly of what i know now far as in the works of general labor. i will highly recommend this job.
good,"I didn't work here for very long but with the time that i did, it wasn't the best time.  They put me straight to work without really training me. It was more of a partial training."
good,It was an okay job especially doing day to day job doing fitting room to cashier..sometimes just putting clothes back on the rack from returned items rack.
good,"Was a great place to get allocated withal aspects of  the salon industry, from front desk, retail sales and client services. Also, learning how to work with team members with different personalities.."
good,"Quick paced if you don’t like being on your feet all day this isn’t the job for you. However the discounts were good, the hours are flexible and the people are pretty nice"
good,JC penney is a great place to work and learn a lot of customer service skills! Management is great and will help you through everything. You will develop a lot of skills for future jobs here.
good,"It was my first real job as a teenager last summer and I was excited to work there. For training, they had us watch a 1 1/2 video which didn’t really apply to our position and then gave us a packet showing us how to use the registers. They put he register on practice mode, but half the things in the packet didn’t work on practice mode. They kept another associate in the quad with me for the first few weeks then gave me an opening shift by myself around a month in, which ended up requiring another employee and the manager to help me because of how busy it got. I feel like they didn’t really prepare me for the job and just kind of threw me out there. Everyday I was asking someone how to do this or give me their numbers for that. If you don’t get enough credit card applications, they reduce your register time and put you on recovery, but you do get a bonus on your paycheck for every application you get. They even ask you to announce every time you get one on the intercom. I decided to not go back there and get a job at a different company that hopefully doesn’t throw me into the arms of the public without real training. (Seriously, a few hours watching videos and then you half a** train me on the job”?). The workers there were pretty nice though and my supervisor was great. (She was also the interviewer for the job)."
good,"I Loved Working at JCPenney it was my very first job. But they started hiring people who doesn’t want to do there job, people who just want to gossip all the time and talk"
good,"A quick paced but very stressful work environment towards the end of my employment there, I got to work in many different departments and gain experience."
good,"Learned slot working with this company, very big place had lots of different departments.  Had a high level of security. Had very good management. Hardest part was getting in and out of the gate everyday"
good,"the managers will tell us where we would be that day. we could be checking out customers or folding clothes, making the store look saleable. at times in different departments."
good,"I loved the people,  built great relationships; seems to be a heirachy involved in promoting and recognition. It's been a long while since I worked for the company,  hopefully improvements were made."
good,The teammates I had made the job fun. I was just seasonal part-time help so I was not there a lot. The downside was the requirement to push JCP credit cards.
good,"This was my first job ever, and although it wasn't bad I often found that my coworkers were unmotivated and somewhat lazy. I came to be friends with many of them, but there were many times everyone would have to make overtime just to clean up the store. There were definitely some issues with scheduling."
good,Jcpenny great company to work for just when season come hour are reduced to less than 12 a week. So I’m saying it an okay opportunity but be prepared for less hours after holidays.
good,"Usually shows favoritism, give others more hours. Management is okay. Not enough people on the floor to provide customer service which results people getting angry."
good,"good work place, recovery was relaxing. management can use a worked on. learned to fold clothes correctly and rearrange stations. typically just fold clothes and help customers find what they need."
good,"I don't know about other locations where JC Penny is, but where I was located, the managers didn't do much. A lot was expected from us grunt workers, but not much was expected from the managers. I loved my manager because she worked really hard, but eventually she felt the same way and moved on from the company."
good,This was a good job it was my first job when I was in high school every summer you get to travel an drop off people orders and sometime they ask you to put it up it was fun for me cause I was young and got to see a lot of Pennsylvania
good,"Alot of changes happening.  Schedule is not as good and family friendly as before. Not 100% sure about the new CEO"
good,"Responsible for providing exceptional customer service and creating a customer centric environment. This person will also be required to perform store operational tasks as needed. General Purpose: Customer Service, Basic selling skills, Front-end operations, Merchandising and retail operating standards."
good,I loved working at Jcpenney loved the people i worked with as well as all the customers. We always worked as a team. management always work with me being pregnant as well.
good,"I didn’t work there long but I liked it, benefits were offered and staff was appreciated. Hours were flexible and good. Relaxed work atmosphere, overall great job"
good,"Enjoyed the challenge of the job, working with customers, and seeing new merchandise. Discounts were nice and quality of products were great! I wish we still had one in our city."
good,"There is not much to say. In the retail world, you are a pawn. It is obviously not a job that is good for career status. \"
good,"worked in the fine jewelry and learned a lot about gems, watches and sales. Like my manager. The store has gone thru many changes. Like that you could relocate to other stores"
good,"This job requires alot of multitasking skills. From cleaning the fitting rooms, assissting customers, being on register, and recovery can be overwhelming. Depends on the night you might get out anywhere from from 9pm-12am."
good,I haven't worked there in 13 years and the company that I worked for ha s gone through numerous changes since my time there and my understanding is the company is having financial difficulties
good,"The management seemed to be very solid.  The people were good to work with, willing to help when they could. There was good structure and procedures for everything, which reduces confusion but also flexibility in getting things done."
good,MY day will begin in the cash room entering the information  of the profit the store made on daily sales .balancing  and gathering all the checks and money .getting it ready for pick up. fill the cash registers and work on sales audit .I have  learn  the operation of my office duties.I had a good manager very helpful when  I  had any question.work place was very diverse .the hardest part for me was trying to find were we short at the register .my most enjoying part was   when i would be able to help out on the floor and  work with the other employees.
good,"The customers were friendly and returned often for services. I enjoyed helping, but did not always have the right amount of staff. The job required a lot of multi tasking on the sales floor."
good,"Good place to work. Lots of caring people"
good,I worked for this company 20 years ago.  They have faded in a lot of ways since then.  I chose to leave for a full-time job with benefits to be able to expand my family.
good,working at jcpenney was good experience everyone was very welcoming and nice to me everyone helped eachother out in everything I love you working with the customer
good,There are some issues but it can be fun. Get to meet a lot of great people. There are times that it is slow but nice when it is does get busy. Defiantly help each other out on the floor and that makes for great teamwork
good,The job was busy and the HR and employees were really good and some of the managers were really sweet. The place was really nice and the customers were great.
good,Even as a part time job I would not recommend it. The people and managers that work here are wonderful and pretty understanding but the overall company and there policies are bad.
good,Customer service is huge. There is a lot of turn arounds but it is reasonable due to them being very young students. They love to have there place tidy and professional.
good,"Coworkers were great, as is the general company culture of the workplace. However documentation leaves much to be desired, as it is either sparse, out of date, or in some cases outright non-existent."
good,"During my time there I worked every department and worked very hard, often until 1am during the holidays and sometimes felt like I didn't get any kind of acknowledgment or even so much as a ""thank you"" or ""nice job"".  However I still worked there for many years because the store was nice, the customers were friendly (for the most part) and because I enjoyed my job."
good,Good place to work if you wanna work with people that don’t as much work as you do lazy employees that don’t do what they are supposed to do place was a mess
good,"I enjoyed my days at JC Penney, I loved helping and Assisting customers every day and interacting with them. I loved when I hit my sales goals. I started out in the Children's department and then moved onto mens and Shoes. I was offered a spot in selling mattress in the fall of last year. I enjoyed it very much and I was one of the top selling associates in that store for mattress sales. The work environment was always clean but sometimes the sales floor did get a little out of hand when things were being moved or during the holiday season but overall it was clean."
good,They won’t give you a promotion when it’s needed or a pay raise when you’ve worked so hard for them and when you come in whenever they need you when it has to do with referral and you get money for the sale sometimes they don’t give you the money for come up with a reason you don’t get it
good,You walk in greet coworkers and customers immediately. Walking around  the store making sure nothing is out of place is naturally what you would do if you aren't doing a task at hand. Customers always need help so make sure they can count on you. Conversations with coworkers and customers make the job better.
good,This is an average call center. High turn over rate.  I think most people came expecting to much because of the name.  I liked that it employee discount friends and family
good,It can be easy going or super stressful. Other coworkers don’t necessarily pull their own weight in their departments leaving other departments to fix it once customers are gone. There also isn’t enough closers for each department especially on the weekends
good,stressful job not enough help hard to do your job and help customers also . new ceo wanting to change everything  made the job harder  and caused the business to suffer.
good,This a good part time job while you're in school or have another full-time job. You can request flexible shifts but will have to work weekends and holidays. Employee discount is good for shopping.
good,As with all retail there is high turnover so it can be difficult to meet customers needs. A new store manager arrived in November after the store was without a manager for several months.  Maybe this will make a difference.
good,"Flexible job, was able to go to school while employed with the organization. Liked the work there, was a good stepping stone and gain experience. Staff was friendly."
good,Was a productive place for me to work at meet great co workers and overall our recovery team was excellent! Also fun work place to work at  also the place in general was enjoyable
good,"Brought in as Seasonal Employee. Training was minimal."
good,"Working conditions were normal at that time.  I believe the drapery department, where I worked,  has since closed.   Decorators were sent to California for training.  Once you received the training, you were on your own to deal with problem customers."
good,My time at JCPenney was very black and white. It had its good days and it had its bad days. The management was very fake but some. They talked behind your back a lot but never to your face. I was sick most of my time at JCPenney which made things very complicated.
good,"Working at JcPenny had its days, some days it got very hectic and we were short of staff most of the time. I had to stay after hours that I was not getting paid for. I had to stay behind and clean up each department while a selected few got to go home early even when we worked the same hours. The pay was not what I felt I deserved for the labor I was doing"
good,So once you check in you have about 10min to get to your station and then your working the floor making sure that your section is presentable with everything folded and easy accessible. Help any customers by checking them out or help by finding what they are looking for. you get two breaks if you work 8 hours one lunch and another 15min break.
good,I did work for jcpenney for almost 15 years.  I started as temporary employee and work my way up to make around 22.00 an hours.  The company likes to shuffle managers around and had high turn over which caused issues over time.
good,"I think that if you are a student needing a job to get you through and generate a little income or someone who needs employment experience, retail is the way to go."
good,"Normal day would be to begin with walking your areas to see if needed merchandising and merchandise to put out.  You would Coach and help with answering any customer issues throughout the day.  Also, develop planning strategies for upcoming events or visits from upper management.  Complete any opening and closing procedures within the store.  Give annual evaluations to associates within your area."
good,"A lot was always going on, too much drama between the employees. The manager gave me no hours really and let me go after one month of working my butt off. But that’s life right."
good,A typical day of work depends on what they need me to do that day. I do mostly everything at Jcpenney so I am always busy. I usually do find the online orders on the sales floor.
good,It was a summer job i felt like i can do better and get a better paying job but i was wrong because the next job i got paid the same but it was okay for the mean time
good,"A good place to work, and the managers are somewhat helpful but they lack workers' appreciation. They host fun events with free food. Some managers are too lazy to carry out their job and depend on the associates to do it for them."
good,Being at jcpenney is stressful sometimes its fast most of the time it's slow they cut everyone's hours down to part time I cannot continue to work like that there is times when they send us home early a lot and that hurts my household income
good,The coworkers treated younger employees poorly because of their age and ethnicities. When told to a manager they would shake it off and not trust that us younger employees were basically being bullied by the older ones.
good,"Working JC Penny is very tiring, exciting and most especially happy because of your discount. But they just give you few hours each week , so salary is not enough for you and your family."
good,This was a fun filled place to work but did feel like they lacked in Knowledge a bit. I also feel like they favored some girls more than others. aside from that I did like the work environment
good,"I was hired at JCPenney as a Temporary Operations Associate in their recovery team. I enjoyed the work, as I like tidying up and organizing. However, it was clear that the store wanted to get by on as little staff as possible. Fixing certain clothing displays could be a multi-day project."
good,"As the title states, you're working retail without commission. Most days are just clock in and out without a second thought. Management was super helpful with questions and concerns but not a lot of room for growth."
good,"my time working at jcpenny when short,but when I first started i was poorly trained and it was super under staffed but still not a bad place to work my favorite part was working in the shoe department and my least favorite part is when they would put me in any other department of the store"
good,When I started working I really loved my job. When management changed it wasn’t fun anymore. Majority of the employees I knew quit. I liked the discounts and the merchandise.
good,Everyone you work with is nice. you do have to deal with rude people time to time but you have a lot of workers that help your through it. You make friends.
good,"On job training. E learnings available for anything you would like to learn or need to learn, Likes to promote from within. A good job if you are looking to move up to a management position."
good,The people i worked with were nice but the management needed some work communicating with the employees! It Was a good plave to work just wasn't for me
good,"I was up in the men's section and 90%of the time I was the only one up there. I asked my co-workers if they were usually by themselves and they said no so I requested if I could start working with someone else to get the tasks done and they said no. Whenever there was a long line or a lot to do upstairs, I asked in the radio if I could have some assistance but they rarely came. I had some time off requests but they were rejected. For example, I had my graduation party set and I requested off weeks before and it was rejected multiple times, I was lucky I had two nice co-workers that were willing to take my shifts."
good,"This job was a stressful job for a wife and mother.  It would be best suited for someone that didn't have family, a single person.  The overnight hours were exhausting and the amount of word required in the short amount of time was unacceptable."
good,enjoyed the customers and co workers there. wish I had gotten more money and hours so I could have stayed longer working there. Great job!!! discount!
good,"wasn't very fast paced, only way to make a living is over time building up clientele. not great for people fresh out of school."
good,The workplace is a chill environment if everyone works together for the common goal. All of the managers were encouraging in regards to gaining credit and helping cashiers with doing so
good,Did not work there that long and can't remember very much about this position as it as been over 20 years ago since I worked there.  It was mostly a phone position.  Sitting at a desk and taking catalog orders.
good,Very nice and clean place to work. Managers are willing to help when in need. Your fellow employees are very nice and helpful when you’re struggling. The boss is very nice and caring.
good,I started off as a sales clerk in the womens department and then went both backroom stock and service desk.  I earned many pins for having customers open store credit card.
good,"JCPenney gives a multitude of opportunities for external hiring into entry positions, but advancement within the company is hard to come by unless you aggressively seek it out.  The company is very hierarchy-based and hours are not always flexible, very dependent on which area you work in.  I would say the biggest issue with JCPenney corporate culture is a lack of communication and a disparity between departments as far as pay and benefits go."
good,"the typical day at work okay , although boring at sometimes if you worked with people who didn't talk to you. Other than that if your fine working alone you should work there"
good,I was looking for a part time job while my children were in school and my husband (a Marine) was deployed. I left because I moved to Colorado.  I learned a lot; it was a great company.
good,Good job for people that like fast pased and busy jobs. a typical day at work would consist of waking up at 4 am and having a busy morning unloading trailers.
good,"-Daily : Prepping and Organizing freight"
good,most days were slow I work as a temporary part-time because I was a student and I was trying to focus on both and keep my job but then they interviewed us they didn't tell us it was a temporary if I knew I would work but I realized that when they stopped giving us hours. my position in this job was a cashier but I actually was stocker but than I learned how registers work and before they ended my job I learned the registers. the managers were okay with us but every time there has to be an issue somewhere. the job was easy nothing hard. the most enjoyable part was talking to co-workers.
good,"JCPenney was my first job, I was young and did not understand I was being taken advantage of. I was working in a huge department alone and expected to finish all of my projects. I am a very hard worker and I do not slack in my work. I love staying busy, but their was too much work for just one person to accomplish."
good,"Pay was really bad"
good,"Good place to work it was busy often fast paced and very creative"
good,That is all that I can really say about JC Penney.  It is a retail environment and was one of the first jobs that I had growing up.  It taught me a lot.
good,"It was the holiday season, so there was always something to do. However, sometimes, when it was slow, it felt like the tasks requested of us weren't completely necessary and were only assigned to keep us occupied. In addition, there were multiple occasions where I was kept past my given hours, sometimes even after I clocked out. It was good for a seasonal job, but I do not recommend working there full time."
good,"I worked morning hours before the store opened so I worked with a small staff, but they were very friendly and good to work with. My job was not hard at all, in a matter of fact, it was very relaxing."
good,"JCPenney was my first job, I just felt like it was a little unorganized. I felt no one was really on the same page and it just was not a good culture. I did benefit from the job however as I learned to take on responsibilities, work with people, and increase my social skills."
good,It's a ok seasonal job not sure what else to say but it's a decent work environment. Not the best but it's okay. If you work during the holidays it can be stressful.
good,"I worked for the company for several months before I relocated to a different state, while I was working it was common to be needed six days a week and work longer than scheduled. would not recommend if you are not willing to truly work."
good,"Love my position and the people I work with.  Good Benefits."
good,"My primary responsibility was working in the salon"
good,I worked here in high school till I graduated and it was an okay job. I stayed for my DCT program it required me to have a job. My pay for the whole 2 and half years I was here never changed. I was paid 8.05  an hour which is minimum wage.
good,A typical work day was very slow. if you didn't go out and search for clients then you didn't do any hair unless you had repeat customers. the manager was hardly ever there and when she was she stayed in her office. the hardest part of my job was making sure everything was going right and being managed properly.
good,"not a bad place to work.Temp job. the place is so large, that it takes 25 minutes to walk from you car to the time clock.  the work is mind numbingly repetitive"
good,"It was a job. Working there was fine, much room to improve management wise. Wish I would have been notified of the decrease of hours after the holiday season."
good,This company was great I made a lot money working there also the people I work for was great too nothing but great words for this company im happy I was part of it
good,"There were good days and there were bad days. The only consistency was what was expected from us- Greeting customers, man the register, and clean up after closing. One thing I did like about working here was that my customer services skills did improve drastically working here, as did my patience. The Management did change a few times in the 2 years working there but the 'Idea' always stayed the same. Coworkers were also hit or miss. There were some that did their part and had a good attitude about it but then there were coworkers that were the complete opposite. This is retail. I didn't hate it but I also didn't love it."
good,"at jcpenney you will find friendly people,great customer service and great experience shopping what you like, great deals,discounts, and quality.Management is great and very understanding,the hardest part of the job is dealing with bad customers trying to rob or get away with lies. the most enjoyable is making customers happy."
good,"JC Penney has some of the most talented associates in stores and corporate office.  #1 reason to work there.  Executive leadership has been all over the board, unfortunately until recent hire of new CEO it has been incredibly weak."
good,"Sales/customer service job "
good,"my job was seasonal job only on Christmas seasonal. so I don't like the job because I am not comfortable with people that I work with, and the stock job on the floor area are messing and we have to re stock back to make is look nice in the store."
good,I had a really fun time at this job. My biggest complaint was that the other employees were not very friendly. Some days I did not feel comfortable at my work station.
good,"JCPenney offers a great start to individuals seeking employment experiences in new work force settings who are especially flexible in scheduling, dependable, carries a great sales attitude and values customer needs."
good,Great company to work. The work hours were set. The work environment was very relaxed and great way to learn and improve your customer service skill. Management is very nice
good,Replenish the whole store every day and night with my new job and made new friends I really enjoyed my work. CASHIER. Clean. Close. I learned from my crew how to fold clothes.
good,I was the supervisor in fine jewelry and women accessories. I had the opportunity to meet with and serve all sort of people. I had a great team of individuals who worked for me.
good,it was difficult to move up in this company but eventually they will look at you as a potential benefit to themselves. be sure you know what you want.
good,JCPenney was a work environment that depended on the costumers values. Other than that the workers started to create problems within themselves making a lot of people uncomfortable.
good,Coming out of high school this isn't a bad place for a first job. However the pay and the hours are consistent with most retail jobs and management would much rather replace worker than keep them.
good,"seasonal employee"
good,Big company. Retail is more than standing at the cash register. The work is fast paced. You can be in one department in the morning and another in the afternoon. During sales promotions it's even faster.
good,"I liked working at Jcpenney's , the discount was awesome . I first started working at penney's 21 years. A lot of the same people still work there and they know who I am"
good,I ama great at customer service and i love to help people reach to be there higher self even if its through design or styling them enough for their own self esteem
good,The pay was minimal and hours were shuffled as to give nobody enough to qualify for full time benefits. the requirement and the push to sell credit card apps was the most atrocious part of the job. still feels slimy and underhanded.
good,"I was working from Jcpenney warehouse job, when I was student to support myself. this kind of job help you to survive not to create but everyone have a goal to move up. I know how to drive any type of forklift."
good,When I worked at JCPenney my job was to make sure that the store was always clean. The clothes are always folded and that I was very polite to all of the customers
good,"Its a good temp/seasonal job if you are just looking for some quick cash, but no real room for advancement and can't really live comfortably off their salary. Good starter workplace, good place to gain customer service experience."
good,"not a bad place to work, fun time, fair pay depending on what department you are in. Black friday is bad for any retail place, but still staff works as a team"
good,The place was alright people did get along but nobody really spoke to each other unless needed. The hardest part of the job was when I would just finish folding the clothes and costumers would just come and lean on them.
good,"Hour are to long, and they are unorganized. A lot of their machins are damaged, plus it takes to long to walk from you car to the time time clock. You don't know until after your lunch break if your going to work late."
good,"Great fun, wonderful people.  Would recommend for people looking for a job during college. Set store for sales, holidays and department settings.  Make the store comfortable for shoppers."
good,My bigest thing i learned was how to deal with corp. retailing. I enjoyed the team effort in running the store. I also made some nice friends there.But the hardest part was the long hours i had to work some weeks.
good,"Job entailed helping customers select ties and dress shirts in the men's department and ringing up sales on cash registers.  Was able to earn some commission at the time, but that may have changed now."
good,They could be more conscious of their workers surroundings  and better benefits for their employees. Acknowledge who is doing their job and who isn’t.
good,Jcpenney is a very nice store to work at but it's to slow of a paces for me.I have recently located and live to far away.I like to stay busy and this isn't job to do that.
good,"working for Jcpenney performed excellent customer service, a safe shopping environment for the customers, worked the cash register and worked along side my other team members."
good,It was stressful at the end of the shift when there were a lot of clothes to put back to stock from the fitting room.The company should set to customers a limit amount of clothes they can bring in the fitting room to try on or make one associate designated to control that particular area.
good,JC Penney was mostly moderate pace for me. I enjoyed assisting customers and keeping my work area sufficient. I was learning all of my training. I didn't mind the challenge of multitasking. We were all concern about the extreme theft activity that was going on in our store. The supervisor seemed to be a little over driven but sensitive.
good,"I was appreciate working at Jcpenney . such a good company very flexible for single parents, it works with your schedules, good retirement benfit. the only not appreciate they cut hours so much."
good,"the management team was professional at all they choose team leads,  supervisor,  who they want to have that position they treat like kids and don't care about there employees  the job was stressful and no one would help you if you need it"
good,"Assistant Manager, stock, reviving, send product, cashier, deposit , pack and more more dont have any more to said about Jcpenny.. you can contact teen"
good,"Working with staff, scheduling, training, observing, customer service."
good,I enjoyed working for jpenney because of my coworkers but I was not very satisfied by one manager of the management team. I did have to deal with difficult customers sometimes but it did not turn me away from liking a retail job.
good,This is good place to work.  I enjoyed what I did there and enjoyed dealing with the public on a day to day basis.  It was a good job for me at that time in my life.
good,"Unprofessional Management, Unreliable staff, Poor Hygiene.  Workers do not leave their relationships and at home situations at home.   Managers and Supervisors abuse their positions."
good,"I really liked working for Penneys.  The store was pretty. I liked the people that I worked with.  There was some competition due to working in a wage plus commission area, but on a whole, the job was fun."
good,"upper management didnt know how to run salon, salon runs different than the store, we have hands on clients. they made manage do what floor managers had to do."
good,"Daily management duties, review reports and follow up on report and team."
good,If I were to return to JCPenney I would definitely apply for thir cash room or catalog department. I di d learn a lot while I was employed there and wouldn't exchange the experience. They are a friendly and helpful place to work.
good,"enjoyed working sales here at JCPenney. Good enviironment, close commute to home. nice frienly staff members whom i worked with. didnt care for working the holiday seasons."
good,"it is an alright but not enough pay to keep up apartment or house, bills. Need to increase on pay and more hours. The part-time should increase hours and have full time. It is a great job but some of my medical- migranes are triggered with the florencance lighting."
good,"JCPenney was an Ok job it fairly suits a high school student's first job. The management team treat you well, but not great. I had an interesting time at JCPenney and it did taught me a lot about customer service and built my experience."
good,"Mind numbing. Location always empty, always playing the same music. Pushed credit card sales more than anything, and therefore if you don't get a lot of register time because senior employees pushed you out, it reflects on your performance. Short breaks. Decent starting pay."
good,I come in I work hard and I do whatever my boss asks me to do with a smile on my face even if I know I might not be able to finish all the tasks I’ve been given even though I will try my hardest to finish them.
good,"I started working at JCPenney as a Pricing associate. I learn a lot about changing prices and sale mark down. I use a scanner to locate items and change prices. "
good,Usually I would get my tasks done quickly and efficiently and have the rest of my shift to not really do anything. Even when there is no one around you still get in trouble if you are just standing there chatting.
good,"Nice discount, cleans, friendly. If you like to shop it job for you. A lot of stand and talk to customer and cleans cloths off floor or dress room. Christmas time busy."
good,"Not all managers are personable and happy in their jobs, and too much emphasis on credit card applications.  Otherwise a typical retail  sales position and working envirornment."
good,You learn a lot while working here. You learn how to work hard and how to treat others. Everyone pushes you to do more and to always be the best you can be.
good,A typical day at work as an asset protection associate is to watch the cameras and prevent shoplifting to occur. It could be difficult when the people do not cooperate. I learned how to read people just by looking at there options. It was very easy to notice which people were going to shoplift and which were not. Sometimes it was difficult when you had to work alone. Most enjoyable part was listening to the people's stories and knowing what got them to where they are.
good,"management was lacking"
good,"I started this job while I was still in high school and it was a great job for me at the time. They worked with the hours I needed them to and I enjoyed my coworkers as well as the customer service aspect. Ultimately, however, I am happy that I left whenever I did because of opinions I received from coworkers after I left saying most peoples' hours were being cut. This is a decent starter job."
good,"My typical day at work is usually boring. People don't come in the store unless it's a holiday or the weekend. Management is good. There is no culture whatsoever. Your coworkers can turn on you in an instant. You can do your job, but there will always be a rumor spread about you."
good,JCPenny was a good job to have right out of high school to get some independence.      You do work late and you are on your feet the entire day though.
good,I was on the pricing team as well as unloaded the truck. At times unreasonable time table to get a lot done in a small amount of time. I enjoyed the people I worked with. What I liked most was being behind the scenes and not having to deal with the customers.
good,Great team to work with and pretty good pay everyone was easy going and the manager worked with my busy schedule. I would recommend working at jc pennys.
good,customers are a big role in all of the sales Jc Penny makes. the co workers are also fun and very helpful with anything you need help with.  Jc penny gave me a chance in the workforce in working with customers and for that I'm greatly appreciative of.
good,Fast paced and focused team culture. The most enjoyable part of the job is the team events and how the company really strives to make the employees feel like a family and the giving back to the community.
good,JC Penney had a local manager that was not good for the store.  The regular help was not treated fairy and the customers suffered because of it.  The merchandise was not as good as in past years.
good,"I think that JCPenney's was a good job for a high school, and early college student. They were pretty good at getting the amount of hours you wanted and able to work with schedules. Also a lot of weekend hours for students that the full time staff didn't want to work."
good,"The job was in an warehouse where a lot of walking was required and that was a great benefit on getting my exercise. The job was great working on pulling orders for the customers from different areas of the warehouse,"
good,I was in the In Home Custom Decorating Dept. and did not have a desk on the floor. We provided a decorator to come to your home. Associates on the floor were very nice to work with when I was able to help them. My manager was not located in the store I was located in. The most enjoyable part was when a customer would call to say how happy and how much she loves her window treatments her decorator helped her chose for her home. These customers would be repeat customers. I worked for JCPenney's Custom Decorating for 20 yrs. and liked what I did and the people I worked with. My experience with management over the years was pretty much a very good experience.
good,JCPenney was an okay job for me .... the hours where to long for me and the pay wasn’t great.... management was awesome. We always had lunch inns .....
good,Come to work on time with integrity and u will work well. Speak well and work to the best of your ability and most of all dont get caught up with the drama nor any fights
good,"Working with JCP is stressful. You aren't given the option to work your available hours; you are just put on schedule. Work days are tough because management fails to communicate with associates unless there is an issue. If you ask for help you are met with an attitude. Additionally, management is unprofessional. There days are spent gossiping about employees or yelling out orders instead of helping. Finally, most associates are teenagers that don't want to work."
good,My day would start with sorting out the cash that's in the safe and making deposits. I look at the records to see if money is missing or a customer made a duplicate payment. track money in and out of the cashroom.
good,"I enjoyed my time at JCP. Nice people and fun experiences. It was very laid back and training was fairly easy. However, I did not get a lot of hours and they pay was less than satisfactory."
good,"Brought into the organization with a blank slate opportunity to develop an onsite recruiting team and eliminate the need for staffing firms. Although the technology/budget was limiting, in the fast pace world of recruiting you eliminate the hurdles and work with the tools at hand to become successful.  I loved the opportunity JCPenney gave me and the amazing Milwaukee leadership team I was able to partner with.  It is with a sad heart that we had to close the Milwaukee location and merge that into our Columbus and Lenexa groups.  I wish them the very best in the future!"
good,"It was always very slow in my department. During the holidays, the traffic picked up and it got busy. We always got little prizes for getting (ICAPS) which means when we got customers to sign up for a JCPenny credit card and saved them 20-25% off"
good,"if you don't mind helping people find the things they're looking for around the store and listen to their comments and complaints, and folding/hanging clothes this is the place for you!"
good,"The job is not hard, basic day is taking of customers and making sure that we respect their time. Making sure that all of our customers are happy when they leave the store."
good,"Unless it's the holidays, the work day can be pretty slow. I've learned how to operate the cash register, and how to help customers find what they need. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with the more rude people and not having any air in the building. I really enjoy my coworkers and the majority of my managers and supervisors."
good,"I use to love my job, but it seems like over the time attitudes held by the supervisors have gotten worse, its not just always to the associates, sometimes to the Customers. The hardest part about having the job is the dressing room it fills up quickly mainly because we don't have any numbers to give the customers, or a dressing room attendant to stay and watch the dressing room, while the other puts up the merchandise back onto the floor and aslo we cant stop people from stealing, people come and steal everyday and all we can do is watch them, call our lost prevention guy but he doesn't do anything or ever catches anyone.The most enjoyable part is helping people save money and putting smiles on their faces, seeing them grateful and happy makes the day and workplace better. I work in the children's department, but moved to the men's department, its nice."
good,I loved working at JCPenney my coworkes where really nice. Everyone cleaned after there selfs the displays where always clean it was never a dull moment
good,"The job within it's self isn't hard at all. They really strive for the best customer service and are always willing to do what they can to make everyone happy, employees included. I learned a lot, with on-the-spot  training as well as being moved around the store. It gave me the perfect opportunity to have experience with all work-areas of retail. The hardest part about the job would have to be reminding them that when they hired you for a full-time position and that they should schedule you as a full-time employee instead of part-time. But the most enjoyable part about working there is the other employees! the culture there is awesome and inviting."
good,"I worked in the photo department of JC Penny.  I enjoyed taking photos and dealing with the customers. Besides taking photos, I would schedule appointments, order photos, received photos in from printer.  Call customers to tell them their photos were in."
good,It’s been far too long since being employed by this company to give an appropriate and fair review. I only remember long days of standing for hours at a time.
good,"Train all contingent associates in each department. Head Inventory Team, Re-ticket Puerto Rico merchandise, load line on sorting machine, run all four positions of manual sorter, run virtual sorter, pull and audit inventory, detail checking and customer service."
good,I enjoyed working in retail and assisting customers with clothing choices. I worked with a wonderful group of individuals who made going to work enjoyable.
good,"Advanced pretty quickly while working there. It seemed as though everyone wanted me to do just about everything. Hardly get any recognition, but the worst is dealing with other people's attitudes, co-workers, management, and customers alike."
good,Work day was fairly busy but still good  its all sbout  people customers  diversity  easy company to come into i didnt feel like an outsider when i started there i enjoyed talking and  assisting the customers
good,"By and large, I do not look back on my time at JCP with fondness. The holidays were incredibly stressful, while the rest of the year was boring at best."
good,They give you opportunities and they do give you good enough hours but you will get very rude customers. They will bounce you from different departments so you can learn them.
good,sometimes good sometimes bad it all depends. Making sales is tuff when customers want prints and you want to give them the best quality the prices are outrages some people turn it down its too expensive for them.
good,"Temporary Christmas work, cashier/customer service.  Good  discounts.  Part time hours.  Pay is ok for  retail.  Can be a fun job.  Not much room for advancement"
good,J.C Penney was a company didn't meet any of my expectations of a company that knew what they were doing with their employees. My experience there was not a good one. I worked there for a year to support my family
good,"busy most times, learned how to deal with difficult people and about quality diamonds! Friendly team members working together was most enjoyable. Sales is not easy..long hours standing with not enough compensation...NOT PAYED ENOUGH"
good,It was a good place management wasn’t to great I liked the people working their just the managers weren’t to great and everything changed constintley I didn’t like that
good,You will find good and bad in companies procedures when you are trying to go with the flow of all the new trend especially when you are working retail.
good,"I was really enjoying working for the company in the commissioned shoe sales department. I was making decent money, had a costumer base and took care of one the ""store in stores."" They changed CEO, I went to no commission, still made good money, but they pushed the credit cards hard and I didn't really vibe with that. I valued actual moving of product."
good,mangement is good part time has no benifits people are nice. hours weekly is less then 30 weekly no over time but sometimes we would have overtime. there alwalys something to do
good,"I sold shoes and other footwear and accessories on a commissioned basis, part-time during evenings and weekends while I also worked as a substitute teacher and English tutor.  Because of these high-traffic hours I earned substantial commission.  I also learned sales and prospecting techniques on an ""on the job training"" basis.  The position was somewhat stressful as it was full service where salespeople found the shoes in the back stockroom for each customer and helped them individually, often having to work with numerous customers simultaneously when busy.  Part time hours did not allow for any benefits or paid vacation days.  Full-time employees made lower hourly commissions because of working during business hours when customer traffic was lower."
good,that was a great experience for me the staff was great i have a wonderful manager she understand us an always be there for us when we need her we were like family .
good,Hours varied per day.  Not enough help. Retail  is stressful. Some days better than others  Christmas season has long hours for three weeks and stores become disarrayed.
good,It was what I expected from a retail store. Co-workers were friendly enough and made working more enjoyable. Employee discount and first shot at deals is a plus.
good,i did not enjoy working here because i was too concerned i would not get enough hours. there is no room to move up in this company or have enough money to pay bills.
good,Hours are flexible and i mean SUPER flexible. Manger are cool but you have your typical stick in  the mud. Pay is low fir such a hectic work environment but then again it is a beginning work place so if you're looking for a job its a start.
good,This Job is for someone who does not want an outside life. Very long hours and always a lot of overtime. When I was working there I only had one day off a week for almost the entire time I worked there.
good,"Busy days, answer phone help customers, get there online orders from stock room area, keep area clean and restock."
good,This was my first job after becoming a licensed cosmetologist. It was a great two years education after school. I learned a great deal from all my piers and managers.
good,Sometimes you will get your full 40 hours there depending on the load that comes in that day. They sometimes use to let us off early if there no more trucks to unload.
good,"Working in retail is great as a second job because it doesn't pay for anyone as a first job.  However, you get to meet all sorts of people get experience in floor setting, markdowns, new merchandise, and sale items."
good,"A typical day at work is helping people look for frames. I have learned about insurance for glasses, how to make advertisements, and customer service. The management is fair. The hardest part of the job is trying to fix someone’s glasses that broken. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that the customer is happy."
good,"I loved JcPenny, it allowed me to develop communication skills.  I worked like I was on commission.  I wanted to make sure every costomer happy.  I even had the best Jewerly manager, she taugh me alot about diamonds."
good,I would not recommend anyone work there anyone work there. the management is terrible and unwilling to help. do you self a favor and do not bother to apply.
good,"JCPenney has been in business for 115 years, Founded on ""THE GOLDEN RULE"" (i.e., ""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you""), the company has struggled in recent years to balance it's ideals with stockholder realities in a new-order environment.  One of the last giants still standing."
good,"Definitely a more organized, mission driven place to work than Deluxe was.  More clearly set out as far as how to achieve the expected goals.  Being seasonal was hard, but it's all that was available at the time."
good,"With my experience at JC Penney I couldn't of have worked with a better group of people. Unfortunately the environment became stressful due to a under staffed team, tasks would take longer or sometimes customer service couldn't be performed at it's highest potential. A big issue was communication between management and associates; either somethings weren't communicated well or later than sooner. As of late the management have been more proactive on the floor."
good,"Working for JCPenny, I enjoyed the position, but the environment was difficult for me to work in. There was little training with an expectation of a high learning curve. The management didn't work well with providing employees with the information about how to succeed the way they wanted, and were very pushy and abrasive when it came to selling credit cards."
good,"Fast paced, high sales volume store. Gave me the autonomy to make merchandising decisions. Pay and hours typical for retail. Good job for a young energetic person."
good,"The manager their was a b , I was hired for the home department but instead I was all over the department I was new and had to open by myself and no one taught me how to open very disorganized"
good,"Good place to work. I have worked before for JC Penney's in the bed and bath department at Clackamas Town Center for about a year. After finishing college with a Degree, I came back."
good,"They taught me well and was very welcoming. I loved that every morning there was a team meeting. Whenever I got someone to sign up for a credit card, everyone would be excited for me."
good,"Working for this company is stressful to say the least. Retail is never a fun time but this company in particular is a rough. Work to life balance there is none to say the least. The managers get annoyed when you want a day off or a week of vacation and expect you to be on call 24/7 with your availability. If you don't mind being a robot and working all the time while being treated as a cog in a machine rather than a human, then you'll be fine."
good,"Despite the position being seasonal. Management stressed that if sales goals are met, and ICaps a made frequently then the position is made permanent. However this information is completely false. Management utilizes favoritism regardless of employment performance and or customer service"
good,"friendly people to work and interact with, unstructured work place culture and could use increased interaction and structure in there management structure"
good,A normal day would be going to the cash register and checking people out. We would be assigned go backs and at the end of the day we would count the register.
good,Jcpenny is a Good place to work. I enjoyed my time there but it is not a great place for career advancement. There a not many full time positions available there.
good,"Assessed customer needs and responded to questions"
good,i usually folded clothes on tables and shelves and fixed racks. I also cashiered and put back clothes from the fitting rooms.I offered the JCPenney card with every purchase also. I didn't enjoy rude customers
good,That position was easy but the pay is low compared to other call centers in the city. There was a lot of opportunity to grow and get promoted. Management was ok.
good,low quality materials and products. It was a good business class; got laid by everyone and then I quit. i was young when I worked there. Wouldn't do it again. But it was great working there and the people were great as well. It was overall a very fun place. You can get laid if you're good looking and have game. All of them are at your dis\posal i GUARANTEE YOU THIS :).
good,"Dealt with and helped customers, Cashiered and recovered the work floor. The hardest part of the job is not to lose patience with a mean customers and the most enjoyable part of the job is making a customer feel satisfied/ Opening a card up for them if they want it."
good,JCPenney is a great job for someone between school or a teen. they offer great discounts on their clothes and is a great clean friendly environment also entertaining.
good,"I learned a lot how to load unload making quick decisions when needed. The overall environment was fund especially the coworkers "
good,"Its was a good job a few years ago, however, the job did not pay enogh.  Very clean evironment. I reall dont have any thing to say negative.  The people there were not friendly. They all were great fun people."
good,"good to work for part time or retired discounts are great  love work for them they do reward you for your work, with pins and prizes love every department"
good,"I was a seasonal/temporary employee at JCPenney, but while there, I managed my work area by keeping it tidy and assisting customers. My hours and days were flexible."
good,there is a variety of associates whom are nice. the management needs some work in communicating. the hardest part of the job would be dealing with the customers that do not want to hear what you have to say. other than that it is pretty easy.
good,My job at JCPenney was okay. It could've been better though because the tasks were pretty predictable and stressful. The hours weren't up to my expectations and I consistently requested more hours.
good,"I worked at the portrait studio inside JCPenney during holiday season. It was super chaotic on weekends when we had two appointments every 15 minutes. Area was small at the location I worked at. Some of the customers were super nice and patient while others would yell and complain at us. If the place wasn't busy enough then manager would send some of us home so work hours were inconsistent. Overall, it was okay to work at the portrait studio."
good,at jc penny i caught on to retail very quickly i was one of the openers of the store meaning i worked there from the ground up. when i moved into the online sales department things became a little more rough but nothing i was unable to handle i worked as a team lead along with my co team lead and 6 employees in the department working with customers and my team
good,Depending on the department you work in the day can be busy without having an adequate amount of cashiers and dressing room attendants. My Coworkers were nice as well as hardworking. When you work here you get into a system of how to handle customers as well as the other aspects of the job. Knowing where clothes go might take a long time to master but once you understand your specific stores you will have no problems. The systems are slow and tend to crash a lot so be prepared for that.
good,"Managers have made a big effort to work together as to best assets of each for company regarding job duties and timing, plus to utilize each employee as to store hours and duties to perform in the time frame they have to store time."
good,"I loved working at JCPenney. The managers were amazing, and the majority of coworkers were too. Hardest part was the Z Racks, easiest was helping the customers."
good,I really would advise anyone over the age 24 to work at JCPenneys. The hours are very inconsistent. You don't get raises on a consistent basis. There's not a fair chance at advancement either. I see that as a job for young people or people trying to earn extra money.
good,"Not continuously busy, most of the time slow business. Aren't allowed many sick days, I had 3 and was penalized. There isn't much to do but stand there. If you try and find something to do like organize the clothes you risk making a customer wait because you have to leave the register."
good,"Did"
good,"Manageable job, very customer driven culture. Management was always helpful and the hardest part of the job was keeping up with tasks during holiday or busy seasons."
good,"1st job"
good,"Overall the people who work there are great. They do accommodate to your schedule. I learned all about the store about customers, floor plans, working the register, working as a team. The most enjoyable part of working here are the associates."
good,JCPenny's hired me for a particular position then informed me it was part of another are that I was very uncomfortable working in. 2 months went by and nothing changed.
good,About what you would expect from a retail job. Hours werent great and pay wasnt great. Just reviewing because this site says I have to and I cant bypass
good,"As my first job, this was a decent experience. A typical day consists of folding clothes, taking inventory, running the cash register, and working with people. Management was decent and easy to work for. The hardest part was dealing with unsavory customers, but this was rare. The easiest part was the physical attributes, like folding clothes and doing stock."
good,"This job had nothing wrong with it, my only problem is that retail was not a fit for me. To some people retail work is dream work, but to me it was a nightmare."
good,"You learn a lot working for this company, It is very easy to catch on to the responsibilities of your job and the other associate's are always willing to help you in your time need."
good,this was a ok position the work was good the workers were ok i enjoyed my time there this was a temporary position i would have liked to be full time employee.
good,"Depending on the time of the day and what day it was, the job was fast-paced and I barely had time to take a breather. The management wasn't the best and I wasn't really taught what to do which affected my quality of work in the first few days. It was very stressful when I had many customers waiting and I was not sure what to do. I enjoyed the slower-paced days and the overnight shift. All of my co-workers were very kind and helpful and they understood that I was learning. Mistakes were forgiven and all criticism was constructive which gave me a lot of opportunity to learn and grow. I learned a lot about customer service through this job and how to best provide quality service to the best of my abilities even when working under stressful situations."
good,"Very quick-paced work environment, especially during the holiday season. Most of my coworkers were friendly but their were a few unfavorable people. As long as you have a lot of patience you'll be fine working here."
good,It was a nice place to work while it lasted and the people there were mostly welcoming to me when I first started.  I would recommend it being a starter up place.
good,I started here when they were in the middle of their CEO change. I got to see the changes that were being made with in the company to appease the customers. I was able to see this company be successful and than slowly fall.
good,"I had to clean the dressing rooms, fix clothing area if need be. Helped customers find what they are looking for. Once customers where ready to leave I was one of the cashiers. One of the hardest part of the job was to get people to approve signing up for a JCPenny's credit card."
good,"havent worked in jc penney in years therefore i cannot rate the company at this time . my time with the company was great"
good,I was hired for Holiday help only I knew that going in. We were still in a downed economy and they did not have the sales that year that they had hoped for. All of us except two were laid off earlier than expected.
good,maintain a clean enviroment around cash register and clothing area. help customers find their size or if their entering the dressing room.  fold any out of placed items keeping shelves maintained to be organized.
good,"The customers vary from chill to literal demons. Supervisors vary this way as well. It's high school 2.0 sometimes, just don't get involved in any drama"
good,"Lower salary and cheaper brands, less powerful than Macy's. I moved on."
good,"Individuals would fold clothes, help customers with purchasing items or helping them find something they were looking for. Rearranged and made new displays. wiped down areas and clothes racks. dealt with money all day. Dealt money out of the cash box for other areas in the store when they were running low on change in their cash drawer. At night, would handle the cash box turn in to put in the safe until the next morning. Helped lock up the store at the end of the night to prevent burglary or theft."
good,hardest part of the job was getting new information around to employees and being ignored whenever there was a serious issue. it was enjoyable but not so sustainable for living
good,"Managers continually push for associates to open JCP Credit Cards, without acknowledging whether they have the opportunity to open any or not. The less you open, the less you are appreciated and the more you open, the more you're appreciated. Most co-workers are very friendly and welcoming. The store is either very busy or dead, so work load varies day to day."
good,its a nice fast paced place of business. in my days of working there I've obtained tremendous amount of great people skills and social skills. the employees are very helpful and eager to help.
good,JCPenney pays less than most call centers and many representatives with poor professional habits that cause a lot of work to be fixing what a previous representative did not do.
good,"I was seasonally hired, and those count doen to Christmas days were crazy. I enjoyed my fellow coworkers, especially the ones in my shared section. An anverage day would consist of managing the cashier, go backs, folding and fixing clothes constantly."
good,Jcpenny's is a great company and has wonderful people. But the manangement is absolutely horrible. as a customer you can be walking around the store looking for help for hours and will not be able to find the help you need.
good,i do not want to give a review right now. I just want to jmake sure that my indeed application goes through to the company that i am wishing to work with.
good,Have been with this company for 7 years. I learned great management skills. I was empowered to make store layout decisions. There was a diverse environment where you worked with different cultures. The hardest part of the job was the timing given. The most thing I enjoyed was the discounts.
good,"Pros"
good,it is a good part-time job. I work in the fitting room and it very fast paced having to run go back keep the fitting room clean and help out customers does get overwhelming. they are all very nice and friendly.
good,"The job itself is great, the management has changed way too much and so often. This is a case of too many trial and error types of management. The hours are all over the place for all part time employees. Sometimes working many hours, and other times almost nothing. Very unfair treatment, and they have the nerve to hire more when a lot are asking for more hours."
good,jcpennys was a good company to work for would recommend better communication between management and employees was hired as full time associate came into work one day as per my printed schedule and was told by department manager after my access code was not working to log in to start shift he guessed i was no longer an employee no notice no explanation access and all my employee records were deleted  '2011 before big reno merge'
good,"jcpenney is an ok place to work as long as youre not working while the store manager is working, managers expect you to do everything in short period of time while also helping customers"
good,"Getting down in the retail trenches isn't for the faint of heart. It's always tiring, frequently tedious, and occasionally frustrating. But those negatives are more than compensated for at a place like JC Penney by the fascinating and ever-changing challenges presented. And the co-workers in such a work environment are overwhelmingly good folks, supportive and kind."
good,There could be better options for associates to grow within the company. Salary was a bit low compared to competitors but there was a good life/work balance.
good,morning meetings to get the day started filled with exciting company focus. leading a team to meet daily goals was rewarding. expectations of management was inconsistent and lacked team building environment. truly enjoyed helping customers  made some really good friends and the associates just want to know that management cares and I TRIED TO BE THAT ROLE MODEL
good,"Standard retail work.  They try to keep most of their people part-time so if you need full time work, it's not a good option.  otherwise, for part-time retail, it's a good company to work for."
good,"Worked as a cashier for women's department. Hours were flexible. Typically I would ring customers up, maintain a clean workplace. Hardest part of job was dealing with upset customers. Most enjoyable part was meeting new customers."
good,The job was easy going. The people that I worked with were very helpful and friendly. I enjoyed being able to experience the work place at JCPenney the hours were also flexible and easy to work around my school schedule.
good,"I enjoyed learning new things about Customer Service. I had a reliable team in the shoe department that helped increase our sales, & I had the privilege to meet the CEO."
good,"You can be assigned as a Cashier or Fitting Room Specialist."
good,"i wold only recommend young h=kids still in high school to work there. if your only working to have some cash. but if you have bills to pay, not so much. the hours are not great, very limited because of store budgets."
good,The mangaer was okay there was a lot of favoritsm with the mangement to the employee. They sometimes can be rude .they change your schedule before you know it .
good,"Great place to work very flexible. great management. tons of growth. has at home work. tons of different departments, prizes, games, and co workers that care"
good,"In the mornings, you have the morning meeting with all the LOD's to go over daily goals for the day. Either for Online orders or getting someone a new JC Pennys card. woo hoo.... Daily recovery in each department to make it look good.  Customers come in and the day begins. Customer service is the lifeblood of the company."
good,"Although the future success of JC Penney is questionable, it was overall a good place to work.  The benefits and salary were competitive and the facility was great with on-site fitness, cafeteria and beautiful campus.   JCP encourages work-life balance and also offers many cultural opportunities and volunteer opportunities."
good,"As far as retail jobs go, JCPenney is far from the worst, but it certainly isn't something to travel for. Anytime I asked for a full-time position, one ""wasn't available"", and yet they would hire full time workers anyway."
good,Did not have everything coordinated. The managers were rude and expected everything to be perfect even though they did not tell you how things go or what they were expecting.
good,I do not wish to comment on this employer. This was not a career move. I worked in retail until I decided that I wanted to return to the healthcare field.
good,"Working at JCPenny gave me a lot of hope for the world. You learn a lot from working in retail but since JCPenny was such a big store, I really learned a lot and it was great."
good,"The company is OK, but is still laying off workers. It's not worth taking a chance until they settle down and get a sense of direction. That's all I have to say."
good,The management there was serious but very kind. They will work with you and answer any questions you have. You will actually enjoy working with them and their amazing employees.
good,"The work reflected its pay well, the only thing I could complain about is the the early morning hours. 4:30 am is not a time to be at work. Other than that my manger was nice."
good,While working for JC Penney Portraits I experienced other co-workers being treated more favorably than others. I was an alright company to work for. Not sure if I would go back or not.
good,This salon is a good starter salon for a new stylist trying to build their clientele. JCP is a company that is closing stores however and the salon doesn't seem to be as high of importance as the retail side.
good,"Coming into the workplace per usual, on a positive and ready to make an elevated change better than the previous day. jc Penney is on of those places where they dont provide you with  much hope of advancing to the next level. Employees are not appreciated. The work place is incapable of giving you the scheduled hours that are promised. Due to production going from maximum to minimum, which is hard to maintain an livelihood and responsibilities."
good,"Management was a little unstable and sometimes unreliable at times, but everyone worked well together when things needed to get done. Some days it was slow with not a lot to do while others were super busy."
good,It a fast pace environment but overall a good place to work. The associate don't get to many hours so you must be willing to talk to the mangers to see what can be done about it.
good,"Wasn't always the most pleasant place to work, some of the management were very unfair in treatment and talked down on some of the employees. The most enjoyable part of the job were the other employees."
good,"Depending on your job title at the company, you had many late nights. Every employee, when working late shift, was required to stay until the entire store was neat and put back in order for the next day. During Christmas. I would work until 2 or 3 a.m."
good,This job is no longer open. Had fun there. gave great hours. Made a decent amount of money. The hours where long. Enjoyed the people I worked with. Customers was nice.
good,good place just wanted a higher rate of pay andi definitly would have considered staying it was a good environment for what its worth geat people and great customer service experience.
good,Standard job for anyone looking for a career in retail. Broken computer systems hinder your job and little career growth allowed through budget problems.
good,Learn to be quick.  Every day is different. Multiple task given with a time table. enjoy interacting with customers. There are usually more than 1 person doing a task.
good,Good place to work for. Management were always willing to help and be friendly. The customers loved JCP because we'd always have coupons to save off of their purchase. I enjoyed the job because I am a people's person.
good,"JCPenney was a good job. Although it can become stressful, they are very flexible and understanding. Plus there are always available hours, and if you show good work ethic you will be one of the first that the managers call. The staff are very enjoyable and definitely make the work environment better."
good,"Poor Training, favoritism, they would congrats the whole crew for the work well done and a week later everyone got the news of getting laid off.  Some Departments worked by steps, the higher the step the more money you made, so JCP rearranged the working area to an uncomfortable position so everyone could lower their production and get a lower pay."
good,"Overall it was a pleasure working for Jcpenney and with alot of the managers there. Holidays seasons were busy and exciting because I really enjoyed helping the customers by giving them a good experience and attention to find what they came looking for. I didn't agree with thecway they paid their employees. When they hired in new employees they paidcthem more than their employees that have been loyal to them for years. I feel that is a sign of disrespect to the employees who give their all to keep the store looking good if it wasn't for those employees the store would be a hot mess all the time. The theory is, if you treat your employees goodcthey will give their all for your company."
good,"If you love helping customers, giving them everything that need and stay positive, then this is the job for you. JC Penny is an awesome work environment."
good,There's always something needing to be straightened and there's hourly checks on the changing areas so always something to keep you busy so you don't have to sit and watch a clock.
good,I did not work there long. only for during the Christmas holiday that particular year. Can't say much but remember the managers not being that friendly.
good,"Its your average call center job. People would call in and you would place orders for them. Show up, do your work kind of job. You don't interact much with co-workers or managers."
good,"The hardest part of the job i would say was dealing with angry client. Management was very nice but insufficient. The most enjoyable part of this job would be meeting new people everyday, and making their day better with the service i provide."
good,"Always working more than scheduled. Did offer good paid time off. Management was older, not much room to advance. Not enough people staffed to run the store well."
good,Certain locations are better than others. but i have had a bad experience with the management and two of these locations. They never listened to what i needed to get done.
good,"Very busy environment, with long hours, JC Penney.  Fun, and good people to supervise.  Nice discount for team members, and my boss was very fair. I learned a lot about merchandising while employed here."
good,not to sure what to say but it laid back fun out going place for all types of ages so take it open minded and it should work out fairly well so good luck
good,Retail experience and working with public are some of my favorite things.  Enjoyed working with my supervisor on store projects.  Worked in specific position that required more extensive training.
good,"The job was typical customer service work. Managing register, maintaining sales floor, cleaning and helping customers. The salary was low for the work expected."
good,"•	Duties include, greeting customers upon their arrival to the store, maintaining that our work environment is neat and effective enough for shoppers to shop. "
good,Working for jcpenney there was no room for growth unless you put in an excessive amount of years. The staff was lazy and aggressive. I tried my best to always put my best foot forward and help customers as best I could. When I relocated it was a better move because the hours and pay were so little.
good,"managment was not properly handled, pay was low, workers were rude, all they cared about was money and did not care about the costumers, it was hard working with people that did not care about there costumers."
good,It was a pleasant place to work.  Learned a lot about children’s clothing.  The most difficult part was keeping up with dressing rooms and the unfortunate actions
good,It wasnt a bad job as a kid. I learned a lot there and it helped me grow. If you are under 25 it is a fun place to work. You learn about life and how jobs are..
good,J C Penney Alliance Warehouse was a perfect opportunity for me to see how a large scale operation works on the ground level.  The team building and interpersonal relationship knowledge that I gained with them will not be soon forgotten.
good,"While working at JCPennys, i learned that you have to be able to keep up with the change and the pace of not only the customer but the company as well"
good,"help customers with purchases.. straighten out clothing racks ,, help supervisor with markdowns and auditing of merchandise.. closing and counting out cash register."
good,"Lack on good management"
good,"Very fast paced environment, all receiving new loads of work daily. Have a quota to meet daily. A lot of bending over picking up boxes weighing up to 50lbs."
good,Strong emphasis on customer satisfaction is promoted and expected. The store is open all holidays so you are expected to work or be available to work all holidays. I'ts a good job for students or someone looking for a part time job.
good,"wasnt bad, people where great, salaon was allways stocked with hair items that where needed. customers where great however the hourse where not fun to work when you have a family."
good,"The typical day is great. A  very nice environment great people to work with. I learn a lot ring the register of return, catalog etc."
good,"i enjoyed working here, there was always work, and the people i worked with were helpful and very informed and they knew what they were doing. very educational"
good,"I didn't mind working at JCP, but it was most likely influenced by having a friend from high school working along side me. The work itself can get extraordinarily stressful, but not enough to make you pull your hair out."
good,"If you are a stylist with a book, this would be a great place to work for benefits and a great discount within the store for an employee discount. The people and education classes are great."
good,You don’t want anything from the gas to do that way do I get a shower I just don’t have money I can do anything I don’t have to go get back home it yet I’ll get back yesterday I got
good,Good for working part time to earn extra money.  Hours for part time are mostly nights and weekend which is expected with retail jobs.  No issues really with working there.
good,Great for a first job and for the extra holiday money. YOu can start work at the age of 16 I think. Also great if you are a college student or still live with mom and dad lol.
good,Department stores are horroble everyone is loud and there's always kids urinating somewhere on the floor. Everyone is rude and the management let's everyone mess up the store.
good,its a perfect working environment for students. its not a place to build a career on. its a good job to learn how to be a good customer service representative/
good,overall had a great customer service working at jcpenney salary is very low so I would recommend it as entry level or temporary employee discounts was also nice
good,"It was a decent job. I just wanted a better paying career. I didn't enjoy working during the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. They were also changing the type of clothing offered, and it didn't appeal to the majority of the community."
good,"I was hired to work in the shoes area. I loved that. it was like a family. when we worked at the old store it was great we never got bothered to help the other areas, which to me made since they don't help us we don't help them. but when we moved stores management from other dept. wanted ppl on shoes to go and fold the clothes and got made when we did it wrong and was ok with the clothes ppl coming to shoes and ""helping"" aka mess help our area for us to fix let."
good,"I was first hired on as seasonal and worked hard to be hired on full-time. During seasonal, it was great. They hired a great amount of employees to cover the massive store we worked in. The high rush of customers kept the day exciting and engaging."
good,"I enjoy working at JC Penney the work environment is competitive."
good,"This was a job where you had your good days and bad days. Many of the people were great to work with; but, at times some people undermined your work. and gave greater opportunities to people who did not desrve it."
good,"I did not get a lot of hours they gave me 3 days out of the whole month of January. The managers where so rude and so where my coworkers, they had no manners and where rude to customers."
good,"This is a great first part time job, learned a lot and was able to get my first real taste of working in a fast passed environment. It helped me to understand what hard work is and how to move up in an industry that is at times fast passed and also slow passed."
good,"Front line support to both external and internal customers;                           resolved escalated calls resulting from billing discrepancies and order disputes. Executed key                         problem solving skills and financial recourse to resolve customer concerns while protecting the                           company’s bottom line; additionally, I placed orders telephonically. In this role, I provided                           reliable​ ​information​ ​to​ ​customers​ ​while​ ​upselling​ ​products​ ​to​ ​increase​ ​customer​ ​revenue. The Center closed years ago and due to this, there is no longer an option to review the Company over all."
good,"They didn't give many hours, I worked a total of maybe 4 days.. However, it was an easy job where all you did was fold clothes and the discounts were pretty good."
good,"Fast Paste work environment, and worked over time during holidays. The hardest part of working their was working on the register by myself while people where on lunch breaks and the lines where long."
good,"It was very unorganized in my department, days were badly scheduled and there was no constant schedule it would change very quickly and just about every week was different."
good,Too many retail places are closing.  Retail is just not a secure future anymore.  I liked everyone I worked with including the management.  I got along well with everyone.
good,If penny’s is a great company to work for. I work during the week and weekends s the pay is great . I believe that jc penny’s really care about their employees
good,"Busy, fast paced, best part of the job was the discounts.  Hardest part of the job was getting multiple boxes of shoes from upstairs.  Received salary plus commission, which was nice.  The harder you work the more you made."
good,"Working at JCPenny is fun for me. Mangers and supervisors are fair and fun working with them. However, it is a temporary until I find a job with my degree that I got from my country and evaluated here."
good,"Minimum training*unloading truck with shipment "
good,Only way to make money at JCP is to be in management. Perfect for a part time job otherwise. I was paid well for my role at JCP for 7 years. Team members grew into friendships.
good,It was a very nice company to work for just not the best store. the company really showed they cared about their employees with lunches and snacks. the company also rewarded you when you got someone to open a jcp credit card
good,It was a great place to work in a very small town.  Not much to choice where to work. I did enjoy working there and the discount was good. Management was nice.
good,"Working at a very fast paced, non stop going, and interacting with customers. Always busy and sometimes managers are very rude. Overall not a bad place to have for a first job."
good,"not too bad of a place to work for first retail experience "
good,It's hard it's very fast past depending on what department and your skills depends on how u do it's like a video game where all the levels set on hard lol you and about 10 of your other associates plus 4 managers all have to recover (pick up) the entire story too to bottom till it's done sometimes we'd start at like 9 or 10 and wouldn't end 12
good,"I really kept to myself when i was on the working line. And when it was break all of us would go outside and bs so all in all it was chill."
good,"Rarely seen the GM. One of the managers were really rude but everyone else was wonderful, it's like a small community. At times you can feel overworked when you're the only person working in your department which happens."
good,Holidays were the worst. Managers did not have a sense of clue on how to schedule. You may easily get off work at 2AM and be back in the building at 8am to open.
good,The job can be very stressful. You are expected to complete multiple tasks that do not account for preparation or assisting customers. During slower times it is easier but during rushes you are still expected to do all of the assigned tasks plus whatever was left behind.
good,"The job was nice most customers were awesome, I never really dealt with corporate but the way they managed that place was a little bit of a mess. Some people worked harder than others is the best I can say."
good,was a great place to work.loved my hours and my pay.it was always a busy place that kept me doing something at all times.i had all types of learning experiences and expanded my customer service skills along with my sales.
good,"Constant bickering amongst employees, too young to deal with no work ethic, no idea of what a real job is, Daily social media pitfalls, need approval from others to see any accomplishment with their jobs, forever supervising each person, even less self motivated persons."
good,"do not expect much from this company unless you've been loyal to them for literally years. like people sign their life to jcpenney, and that's cool if you have the tolerance to put up with the customers your whole life. they pay you horribly. the job is boring and slow, management doesn't care."
good,"Had to work early and stay late. I had to fold and reorganize clothes. Had to work the cash register if needed. Management was friendly and able to help, The hardest part of the job was looking for clothes in the stock room. The most enjoyable part was working with a team."
good,tagging clothing and putting them on hangers to go to the stores . also working with computer to make the tags for the clothing. very interesting job  to do.
good,"i would clock in if i was working before we opened i would be restocking and cleaning, making sure everything was where is should be for the busy work day ahead of us."
good,work as a stockroom associate seasonal numerical placing sneakers shoe's & was fun but no room to grow only advancement is sales but was a great place
good,I worked part time for a little over 5 years.  I enjoyed the people I worked with and the people I met while working.  The customers were great but the upper management at the time was not so great
good,"Warehouse go in early morning receive shipment for the day. Pull up orders on computer and verify price, count, check sub and lot numbers. Ticket and send to store. Merchandise Assistant in store, set up display of clothing, help customers, run registers"
good,"Working in a high volume call center environment"
good,"Assisting customers with there shopping experience, cashiering and stocking inventory would be a typical day for this position. This company also has a great management staff and the culture there was great. The hardest parts of this job was the pay rate and not having a set schedule."
good,"I'm in the Enterprise Fullfillment portion of JCPenney,which is pulling .Com orders for customers. I've learned that customer service is very enjoyable,management could be a little better at appreciating the employees.The culture is very divirse which is a great thing in my opinion. The hardest part of my job is not feeling a part of at times,the most enjoyablempart is the relationship that I've gained with my co workers."
good,not enough hours or people at the store. people there are cool.    store a mess. to much stuff on sell floor not a enough room to move around. computer always breaking down
good,Very productive workplace.  The management at JC Penney works well with individual schedules.  They are very accommodating with school schedules and work well with students.  Fun place to work
good,"I enjoyed working the holidays and the managers were there with us.  yes the hours were long, but enjoyable.  the customers  enjoyed the friendly faces"
good,"poor management"
good,"A typical day at work is chill, laid back and slow most of the time. I've learned how to better deal with unsatisfied customers & how to make them leave happy customers. I would say that the hardest part of the job is not having good benefits. I love going to work interacting with my customers so it balances out."
good,management was not well trained/ personnel turnover was high; very demanding for little pay; management did not keep employees advised of daily activities that directly affected their job
good,"Good place to work . Co-workers were team players."
good,"Met incoming customers and provided immediate assistance.Retrieved alternate items and sizes on request.Listened to customer needs and preferences to provide accurate advice.Completed purchases with cash, credit and debit payment methods.Worked flexible schedule to accommodate changing customer levels."
good,The company is great to work for but there is no room for growth. I have only been here for ten years and I am already caped out. Sad to leave but excited to start a new career.
good,"Jcpenney  is a good part time place for kids still in high school that do not have bills to pay. I work in enterprise and the most i could make in that career would be $10.60 per hour. The pay is okay, not terrible, its the hours that kill you. Everyone is part time unless  you are liked they give you 40. I have to share my area with 4 people and we have to share 100 hours so their is no full time. its a good place to work temporary but it does not earn you a living ."
good,"It’s an easy laid back job, but can become stressful and overwhelming when coworkers call in. Being short handed is frustrating when having to pick up the slack. Other than that, it is a good little part time job to have. They are very flexible with hours and they’ll work with your schedule if you are in school or if you are working a second job."
good,"decent place to work part time, a lot of favoritism went around the store and people got away with it. wouldn't recommend this job for anybody to work at"
good,"J C Penney is a company that is continually restructuring itself. It made a transition to an online model but failed, because of inertia, to continue to innovate at the rate that was needed."
good,"I was doing an unpaid internship, so I cant give you to much information. I enjoyed my co workers and management. I have no information about pay, benefits, or anything of that nature"
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers that frequented JCPenney, the prices were affordable and quality which made the customers and employees happy. We got a great discount and things were easy to find."
good,"I worked in the Shoe department and it was fun it was my very first job and I enjoyed every minute, had to stop working because my family and relocated to another state."
good,"I enjoyed working here, and learned how to interact with different people in different scenarios. I was a sales associate so I had many different encounters with various people in numerous situations and learned how to deal with people."
good,"I loved the job it was a sessional temp job for Christmas I was part of what they called the support Team. I  unstocked clothes and put them away. I helped any department that needed it. i was a cashier, put price stickers on clothes that needed them i organized the clothes. I did a little bit of everything. The hardest part of the job was for me was that being around clothes wasn't something i liked after a while because it was my daily rue teen during work and after work. what i loved about the job is how fast moving it was"
good,"laid off needed a new job, this one came along without much had to take was offered, there was a lack of consistency wen it came to scheduling and the late hours invoiced"
good,"I have not worked there in decades and cannot provide any relevant information regarding current culture, management, mission statement, pros or cons, etc"
good,"woke up early not an early bird, improved my people skills, management was outstanding. All cultures are welcomed there, hardest part is when we were out of the item the guest wanted, getting to work with my teammates was the most amazing felling ever"
good,"My co-workers were always very helpful and kind when I needed help with something."
good,I worked here for several years out of high school. It is a great job to start off with but I would not recommend staying there if you have other career options to pursue.
good,I really enjoyed my time at Jcpenney.  They treated me very good for quit awhile.  Unfortunately with the troubles the company has and still is going through they no longer provide hours or guarantee employment. I'm very disappointed in their lack of support for their best employees and their handling of the company.
good,"I enjoyed the store i worked for. Management was ok...i worked part time while in college and the pay was not that great, but like i said i enjoyed the store i worked for."
good,Fast paced atmosphere. I loved helping the customers find their special outfits for special occasions. Long hours over the holidays and @ night. Love the clothes.
good,JCPenny is one of those companies that looks good on a resume but the turn over is so great that everyone in the DFW area has either worked at JC Penny or knows some one who has.
good,Ok job to have. I didn’t have any issues. I was just there temporarily. Good benefits good schedule people were great to work with. Could have better management
good,"Good way to meet people.  Good way to learn about talking customers unto applying for a JCPenney Credit Card."
good,"Very fast paced customers were great to work with . Had fun training for new stuff . Pay was ok not offered benefits, would of liked more hours and to work full time"
good,"At times it was a fast paced work day. I enjoyed working there learned about sales, management was great and friendly the hardest part of the job was when the store announced that they were closing their doors"
good,Very exciting and fun place to work for. Had returning customers that made the job fun. I would enjoy making online orders for customers. The hardest part of the job was leaving the job. I made very close connections with the staff and Customers.
good,If you don't care about pay then it is a great place to start your cosmetology career. They offer free classes to advance your knowledge in cutting and coloring.
good,"As a seasonal employee is didn't get much of the experience that this review is asking for. It was fun, the manager was awful but that's the way it is in most retail.."
good,Co-workers help one another and work as a team. There are several friendly and helpful managers with employees best interest at heart. Flexible work hours would be good for students or those with multiple jobs.
good,"People are great , working conditions, salary etc are acceptable. Company is in financial difficulties and that can be felt throughout the operation. Hope the company survives but it is in a very tough position"
good,"You have to always be alert and prepared for anything. Do not always  rely on someone to help. You must always be independetnt and open minded. Most of all, save all your energy for the weekend and big sales events. It is very important you give your full attention to customers, long as you complete your task in timely manner."
good,"Multi-tasking, fast pace, 90% customer interaction, not a lot of career advancement opportunities, low hours, little to none over time, even during the holiday hours are fixed so no one works much over time. Hours are cut before holiday and during holidays everyone is given long shifts. Basically only really making up for lost money from weeks before. But can be a fun place to work with constant changes."
good,I worked for JC Penney catalog a long time ago and the center is now closed. I enjoyed the company discount and every year they would close the store would only be open for employees and we received a 35% discount off anything in the store.
good,"The inconsistency from the top really hampered the companies ability to grow and improve in the market. Some strategies with price and shopping could've been reviewed and improved, but were instead continued to proceed at the current rate."
good,A place to help you develop your customer service . It can be fast phased due to rush hours and seasonal inputs. Follow on your training and they also provide extra training upon corporate changes.
good,"Worked there throughout high school and college.  Had good managers and co-workers.  However, the company changed a lot in the last couple of years as they continue to hire unqualified supervisors and managers."
good,"JCPenny was awesome. I enjoyed the guests, my peers, and my manager. I wish I could have spent more time here but I was offered another position with more benefits and additional pay."
good,"didn't care for the way managers address the employees"
good,"This company is ok for a temporary job or something just to get out of the house. It wouldn't be anything long term. Management is very poor. They don't make sure you get your brakes and lunches. And some talk to you any kind of way. I have been at two different stores and the management was poor. How the store was ran is poor. The most hours you can get is about 25 hours a week. If they don't like you, you will only get 8 hrs a week. It suppose to be according to when you got there but it's not. If they don't like you they don't give you hours. The employees you don't do anything get the most hours."
good,I cant tell you much about this job it was over 20 years ago.I made sure the store was ready for opening everyday. I really cant tell you much about it
good,I started working for jc penney for seasonal hire back in 1999. The company was awesome at that tiime. it has changed a lot. employees attire is unacceptable
good,JCPenney is a great place to work if you are looking for a part time job that will work around your schedule.  It is a great place to work if you love working with people. It is also a  great job  for collage students who are trying to get more money.
good,Days at J.C. Penny were long and stressful. Working in a fast-paced environment is fun but it starts to build up when dealing with trouble customers and managers. This was my first job ever so i admit it was tough making the adjustment at first but it became easier by day.
good,"retail was the start of my working career. Jc penney was the third retail company i worked for. although i didnt like working retail necessarily, the company found ways to make it more desireable which helped."
good,working at jcpenny was my first job when I got out of cosmos school. its a good way to find clients however it can be hard some days. either way its a good learning experience.
good,This job was part-time after having a new baby. The hours worked great for my husband & I because we couldn't afford a babysitter. Once my son turned 3 years old. I found a full-time job.
good,"My hours were slowly decreasing until there was 0 hours. When I contacted management I never got to speak to the manager, they just keep referring me to the wrong person. Working there wasn't bad though just hate the way management handled my situation."
good,Okay the can do a little better but they are okay to work for like your fist job. It's little to no room to I've up unless they really like you but majority no
good,"The managers and supervisors put a lot of pressure and expect a lot from very little employees available, usually about three employees in one shift. Some managers don't even greet you back or look art you. The training at this store is very bad as well, they mostly tell you what to do instead of explaining. I learned more from my coworkers than the people who were supposed to train me."
good,"This was a great part time job, especially during the holidays.  But it wasn't enough to support a family on. The catalog department in this area no longer exists."
good,"This was the first retail job I had when I was 16 years old, it was great as a first time job.  I was part of the first employees at this new store.  I liked setting up displays and working on inventory."
good,"I worked for Penny's as a Drapery and furniture associate for a little over a year. my position was salary plus commission. so I cant give an honest review on pay. since my motivation determined my salary. but my impression was that the hourly associates where under paid for what they did. My Personal Manager was great and overall most of the managers where good. like any place you will have one or two you don't care for. "
good,"It's a good job to start your experience in retail . I worked I. The mens department and from there i opened my eyes and what I want so that's why I left but to understand how to work with people and to be put under pressure , for that this is great expierence ."
good,"Working as loss prevention, means you get to work in every day attire and catch individuals who come into steal, make stops and work with law enforcement agencies."
good,"This was a seasonal job, in which the call center went out of business, due to the internet was taking over, and people don't order from catalogs as often..and it was a long time ago."
good,"Relaxed environment where most everyone gets along. Management is decent, but they have their ""favorites"".  Overall, it's a nice place to work, especially if you are in hs or college. They work with your schedule very well."
good,"Really great management, got to watch and learn while i was still in school as a receptionist  ,great teamplayers ,Got on the floor and became a styliat there love the crew and new clients i get to work on ."
good,I loved doing visual merchandising for JCPenny. Good company to work for. Also loved the job being in Tampa. Benefit package was also very good. The pay could've been better
good,"Greet clients, provide excellent service. Call future appointments and confirm. Rebook clients. Ask for referals and call them to book appointments. make sure salon is cleaned"
good,"worked in retail, worked full time. Had great hours and great coworkers. pay was not good but it still was an amazing work environment. job did not help pay bills"
good,"Replenishing fine and fashion jewelry,  inventory management, preparing fashion jewelry department each month for new set with fixtures and displays. Most enjoyable part of this job was working with the public."
good,"If you spend money on clothing, then working at JCP will give you a huge discount. Good beginning job. Very easy to work your way up to raises and promotions."
good,"JCP was a great place to work in the beginning, afterwards we got new management and it became a really stressful, uptight place to work. I left as soon as I was offered a better opportunity."
good,"It was a great job.  People were very nice, but the company in itself isn't doing too great so I would be afraid to start a career here that the mall will close"
good,A typical day at work would start off slow so you really have to clean during the slow hours. Sometimes when it would be to busy you would have to stay at the task at hand to make sure the consumers have a positive shopping experience. I learned how to fold a dress shirt. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with some of the regular customers.
good,"A typical day at work was price checking and organizing as well as helping customers. I always had something to do, dressing up everyday for work was also fun! I didn't have an exact uniform and I could wear what I pleased as long as it followed company guidelines."
good,"The job was easy and the hours were easy to handle. i wish i was able to get more hours than were possible. I love their employee discount, honestly what i miss most!"
good,"good people, good support system, hard schedule if you have kids, holidays can be challenging, working with the public can be daunting at times but ok for the most part"
good,"This company is a surviver. It continues to find a way to remain . The atmosphere is tough as it looks for ways to cut cost."
good,"JCP only cares for you to sell there ""jcp CARD"" nothing more... thats all they care about. they put alot of stress on workers if they dont sell those every week. fine jewelry salesman is very competitiv. managers dont care if you sale is lost to another employee, so if you lose your money selling an item that was returned, (you spend 5 hrs with a customer )to another employee, they shrug their shoulders, as long as the item is sold. you lose your commission (your money). other then that. the culture of the workers was very cool, everybody was friendly and awesome to be with. which is what i saw on the other floor. i was based in commission which had alot of very sneaky workers and people who will steal you sales. at least my manager didnt care what went on. as long as the item was sold and his department got the money."
good,"The hours are inconsistent, I learned good customer service but the mangers I feel dont really care. The best part of my job is the discounts and my co workers"
good,Team wasn't really that great. Good customer service. constantly greeting and being cashier. Nothing to tough. I enjoyed the great customer service we gave our customers.
good,its a pretty cool salon with a great bunch of people. I cant stand that they have absolutely no windows. it feels like you are in a little basement doing hair.
good,"Cleaning, folding, and selliing... Typical sales associate job"
good,"Enjoyed the people ,  I did not ask or recieve benifits except vacations . Learning was a plus attended classes occasionally . Overall stylist were nice . Hardest part was long time standing . Enjoyable was working with other stylist and helping each other as needed."
good,"I only worked about 3 days a week because I had another job, but my time at JCP was nice. Some of the seasoned workers were rude, but for the most part the staff was super nice and helpful. Maintenance was a big thing, so you're always busy. Transactions were smooth but keeping up with the different sales was tricky. Credit card payments were easy to handle, but taking checks was a lengthy process."
good,"Good first job for anyone, fast paced environment. Hours are alright most times you were required weekends, pay was fair and employees were fun and easy going."
good,"Working in JCPenney at the Trumbull mall  used to be great however, the new supervisor doesn't know how to do her job so its hard for others to do theirs. Hours began to be very unstable after the holidays which is regular but they never picked up the pace over the summer as its suppose to."
good,I was working at JCPenney while finishing my social work degree. I was able to work part time and around my school schedule which was a positive. When I was finishing school I only worked on Saturdays.
good,I like the team spirit they have with being a sales associate . I liked the busy seasons because they do give you hours.Slow seasons you will need to have another job.
good,"Working with retail is just like any retail job. A typical day at work is assisting customers on and off the floor, providing them with a great customer service experience. I learned to have more patience with the customers. The management was ok, could have been a little more organized. I loved my coworkers they really made the day go by faster. The hardest part about working at JcPenney's is working alone, it gets very boring and sometimes you have a lot of things to clean and organize by yourself. The most enjoyable part was my coworkers and the bonds we have created."
good,"at JC Penney, I was in charge of the Jewelry and the Shoes departments. took care of breaks,lunches and walked the floor to assist customers and sales associates."
good,"This review only is about JCPenney distribution centers., not stores. With that in mind, JCP offers flexible work schedules and provides a safe work environment. Management is always ready to listen to associates and work with them to find smarter ways of getting the job done."
good,I was a sales representative where I focus on customer service. Advised  customers by providing information on products and help customer make selections by building customer confidence; offering suggestions and opinions.
good,"This is your quintessential retail job. Folding, helping and checking out customers. Except for the manager's everyone is a part time, it was rare for me to make over 30 hours a week"
good,Typical day at jcpenney you come in have a brief team meeting and do morning or afternoon stretches depending on your shift. Afterward you go to your assigned location. Work usually comes in about 15 minutes. The work is pretty easy as long as you work diligently and pace yourself.
good,it is an okay place to work if you really need a job . work schedule is tough and can be changed with short notice. work atmosphere is okay but pay scale is really low as compared to the work load.
good,"Busy on holidays, slow on some other days(fluctuate) like many retail stores. I enjoyed having to help customers  and helping them find quality products especially sephora makeup. Overall poor leadership and biased environment . Employees should climb up the ladder in the company based on hard-work and not favoritism."
good,"I learned how to work a register, use a mobile warrior, use the Websom and omni channel programs. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a customer leave with a smile on their face because they were highly satisfied with the customer service. The hardest  part of the job is that one frustrated customer that you just can't please."
good,customer service goes far. inbound calls and outbound calls. placing orders for customers. answering questions. giving opinion about online deals. the hardest part was dealing with ruled customers. the enjoyable part is making people happy with what they purchased
good,The people are great but there was no real organization in things. Support staff did most of the merchandising and pricing. Compensation did not match the work.
good,My duties included but were not limited to assisting customers with decisions and purchases.. Making styling suggestion and Ringing up purchases once decisions were ultimately made . A very customer friendly environment
good,there were alot of people who wanted to teach and were great mentors in the store . i really enjoyed the good hours i was working and the staff was great
good,"I really enjoyed the mature women I worked with in the warehouse."
good,"I hated working retail.  It was very stressful.  I did like most of the people I worked with and I did my job well.  For some people, retail is a good fit.  It isn't for me."
good,"If you do not ask enough customers to sign up for a jcp card, after awhile your hours will get dropped and eventually they will threaten to let you go."
good,"Assisting the public for hair care and beauty needs."
good,This is a good after school job. Its very hard to move forward with your career here. Not very many positions become available as most of the management stay in their positions for a long time.
good,"Unfortunately, loss prevention is becoming a dying industry.  Despite shrink being at an all time high, Sears has just recently cut AP hours, and JCPenney isn't far behind.   Saks looks for more of a security type person then a true LP pro."
good,"long work hours, most of my day was on a register ringing sales, scheduled lunch, fast paced, I learned how to give great customer service under stressful situations."
good,Office personal was very nasty had stanking attitudes u worked long hrs sometimes they would take our scheduled holidays away from us alot of the managers had they favorite
good,"JCPenney is a great retail store to work for. They pay their employees fairly and are very good with schedules. My only complaint is that when I worked for them I was in highschool, and it was during the holiday season so on school nights I was there until two in the morning."
good,"The environment was ok to work in but the management sometimes were non-dependable. The one thing good that I did like about working with this company, it helped me improve my customer service skills and helping others."
good,"needs work on management"
good,Not enough hours during the weeks. Paycheck was not enough to even pay for a bill. Management was not always on the same page on things. Organization of store was great though!
good,"I enjoyed working and helping associates reach their full no potential, but was side tracked by a vicious GM who was only there for herself. The store I worked at went through six managers in seven years and im sure it will continue"
good,start at 5 am and ends at 12 pm . it wasnt bad but it wasnt really good. for me personally that was. all the coworkers were fun and nice and everything was chill
good,It was a seasonal job and so I didn't have a whole lot of responsibilities except to run the registers. The customers were nice enough and the job wasn't difficult at all. My coworkers made my time enjoyable there.
good,Retail is what you make of it. My time here was fun and enjoyable.  Able to meet many people and form friendships.  Retail life can interfere with plans for holidays and vacations though
good,one of my first security jobs it was ok. got to drive around a lot and sit in front of building and watch them. only down side is the sitting around waiting for something to happen
good,i enjoyed working there they just never gave me any hours. The work load wasnt to much and the pay wasnt bad. i started at 9.25. i really enjoyed the people more than the job its self.
good,"It was a good company and good people,  they do try to make it a fun place.  listen and try to respond.  I really enjoyed my time there.  The company I hope is turning around"
good,Good place to work for new upcoming stylist great training. Management is encouraging and supportive. The store and salon Have great customer service.
good,"workplace is great. Never a dull moment"
good,This job was very fast paced. This job teaches you how to work with people. The hardest part of my job for me would be being onmy feet for the long hours.
good,"Days are fast paced and challenging, especially during Peak Season. Work/life balance certainly suffers during this time. Culture is kind of family like, your associates and managers help you get through the difficult months. Best part is getting to work with some high skilled and hard working people who know how to make each other laugh when things get stressful."
good,I really did like the my first manager he really knew what he was doing always wanting to lend a helping hand. I really loved being the the window expert selling ready made and custom blinds
good,"I got hired before the holiday peak. The store was always a mess no matter how much work we did because the supervisors were stressed out. This made the associates really stressed and many did not care to apply themselves. When customers wanted to use discounts, the systems wouldn't work properly. Inventory was not kept up and merchandise didn't ring with updated prices. Sale signs were also missing or incorrect. Also, they felt the need to have unnecessary meetings about duties that managers should have been  on top of. Managers did not help as much as they were expected to when it became busy. Since leaving, I still shop there, and the store seems the same: unhappy associates and managers. Although, there were a few really upbeat and efficient workers there."
good,I have been with the company for over five years.  I left the company to receive more experience.  Decided to go back to Jcpenney due to the growth within the company.  I was promoted within 6 months of returning.
good,Retail is a tough business for anyone these days. There is a constant scare of the internet taking over. Management acts as if nothing is wrong though.
good,Its been a long time since I worked here but what I remember was great.  The most I liked about this job was my co workers. They were like a family to me.  You had to have each others back and work together o achieve your goals at this company.
good,Great place to work and to shop with discounts.  They were always fair and made sure there was work to go around for everyone.  The people were very friendly.  the environment was comfortable and they always made sure employees were taken care of
good,They are not a family oriented business. During the holidays you will be lucky to get an 8 hour break to go home and sleep. While on the job if you are a cashier you will constantly be told to get credit applications. Thats all you are there for!
good,What I enjoy most about working for JC Penney Salon was the fact that I had several opportunities to empower other women to love themselves. Working in the beauty industry and sharing so may hours with your regular clients you become a source and voice for them.
good,"The staff and customers are very friendly and open to conversation. The clothes are very nice and the prices are low as well, which is a plus. The pay is not the best."
good,the job was very challenging with auditing registers. balancing days receipts with reports made you feel like an investigator. when the company started down sizing they expected people to cover lunches and breaks in any area of sales floor which was ok but needed to have some training on sales floor which was not provided.
good,"The workplace of Jcpennys and Sephora were great as far as getting to know the different personalities of the costumers. After working in the juniors department, I decided to transfer to the Sephora department due to me wanting to expand my experience in the makeup field. Unfortunately the management in Sephora wasn't professional at all."
good,NA I want to remain positive about JCP . I loved my position there but there was history with my new GM .My old GM and I had awesome rapport and the new one and i had negative histiory at our previous job
good,The management was pretty good. The work day was average and nice. the pay was ok around the time I was working there. The people I worked with was great to work with. The lunch break was good and long. I would go back and work there again.
good,As a JCPennys associate I worked in different locations if they need help in areas. We sometimes also change up the price of merchandise that they would need us to correct
good,"Started out in customer service, then moved to the pricing team with very long hours, and moved up to the office supervisor.  Controlled the cash room, reconciled the registers, preparing the daily deposits, audited all records at the store level, submitted daily/weekly payroll for store employees, helped the store managers in any capacity needed.  I really enjoyed my job but the pay was very low for how much I did.  Unfortunately, with the many changes in CEO's my job was eliminated and combined with our hiring manager job."
good,"This was my first job as a teenager at 16 years old and I worked probably 40 hours a week.  It was very tiring and management didn't really care about the workers, more just about selling things and getting people to sign up for credit cards"
good,"I worked here shortly after graduating high school. This was an entry level job, with very few requirements. For the work I did, the pay was fair, and management was courteous."
good,"Not a bad place of work, management isnt bad, the most of enjoyable part of the job is the being able to interact with customers day to day. The discounts are another plus."
good,I greeted and assisted customers with finding items. I help make orders and assist customers with picking up a order. I loved working in the home department.
good,"Responsible for sales in the men’s department contributing to the stores daily goal.  Provide excellent customer service by greeting and thanking each person that enters and leaves the store. Help customers locate desired products, answer questions and even assist with their buying decisions. Excellent customer service and good quality products ensures recurring business and referrals. Cash handling, register and till experience, including offering and processing company credit card applications and discussing benefits and terms of the card. Resolves customer complaints in a satisfactory manner. Assists with store recovery and go back items. Workplace culture is relax attire & customer driven."
good,"Providing customer service for customers "
good,I loved my coworkers and the environment between us was the best at this job. Everyone was friends. It was great. They also offer cool rewards like $5 off coupons for getting your name mentioned on a survey. It'snot bad for a minimum wage job.
good,"The management sucks, but I got to meet some nice people. I got to see what a supervisor job is. I got to know men women and kids clothing size and material."
good,its a fun place to work. I have lerned my first experience of being a cashier in jc penny and its so easy thanx to the managers. the hardest job at the work is staying until 1 am or 2 am depending on the clean up.
good,"A typical day at work would include a morning meeting with the day's managers after having checked in. In this meeting we talk about our day's and ultimate week's goals, our past day's and week's performance both good and bad, evaluating what we can do better. Then, we all go to our assigned departments and open up the registers and tidy the place up before store hours start and customers come in. Normally on busy days we would be working nonstop between organizing the fitting rooms, the clothes around the store, greeting customers, running the cash register, and making sure every customer that needs help gets help. Therefore the work culture is very interactive and fast paced. It requires a lot of energy to be able to perform task and be organized but in an efficient manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is having customers find things that they are happy to buy through our sales associate's help."
good,"great place to work until johnson became CEO.  Cut our logistics chain and staffing big time.  tied our hands taking care of customers."
good,"I learned how to be even more patient than I already am. I didn't really care for my boss, she was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping put people's outfits together and watching the smile on their face because of my work,"
good,Good place if you are young with no kids or older and your kids are grown. Be ready to work just about every weekend. Hard if you have a family. Not very family orientated.
good,"Its a okay company if you are in management. "
good,"The presque isle atmosphere is better to work in if you're looking to work for the company. Very organized, very well managed, great staff. The portland store will hopefully grow to become that with time and effort."
good,I gained so very much needed experience working here. They were downsizing so I was let go and I fine with it because I gained work experience and have used it to for other jobs I have had.
good,"The company is a good company,   the availability is limited with associates and I will love to see more,  So that we can give good customer service ."
good,"JCPenny can be hectic at times just because of the sheer volume of items they carry and the amount of people that shop there, but with the right staff and associates can be a very cool job that will give you great retail experience."
good,JcPenney was a great first job for me. I loved it but the management was absolutely terrible. You easily got in trouble for things and the security there is watching your every move.
good,It was okay it paid the bills. I hated pushing for credit cards. Some of the staff was rude and very high schoolish. I wouldn't work there again. that is it.
good,"Great place to work with great management. A typical day at work included straightening clothes, cleaning out dressing rooms, and greeting customers. Very friendly work environment. Loved all the people i worked with."
good,I was a seasonal employee so I did not work at JcPenny long. I did enjoy my time there. Since it was a big store there was always something to do. They are very flexible.
good,"Not a terrible place to work, great co-workers. Can be decent paying enough if you get in the right area & make your production steps.  Management & communication leaves a lot to be desired.  With JCPs decline, the job is looking less & less secure for long term full time employment."
good,If you are just starting your first job experience this is a good place to start. It has been awhile for me since I have been there but it was usually busy. They did not give me a raise though in a few years.
good,I have worked with JcPennys a couple of times and enjoyed it. except the second time I found it to be a bit more stressfull than the first time I worked there. They kept telling me that if I made a mistake on differant things like the kiosque it would be a reason to terminate me. They also had quite aot of problems with thier time clock.  I don't know if they ever remedied the issue. but many of us were in agreement that they needed to invest in a new one.They had a list of people who needed to see hr personel and it must of had over a hundred names on the list. I know I would clock out for lunch break and in again and it wouldn't even recognise that you had. Any way it was ongoing and wasn't sure if it was some kind of joke they were trying to pull on the employees. Also I suppose it could be me but I am really not loving the way they hire people in large groups.  It feels very impersonal like I'm just another number or face in the crowd.
good,I enjoyed working at JCPenney as a customer specialist. The typical work day for me was going around and straightening up merchandise. Management was very energetic and hardworking. The hardest part of the job were the holidays and the most enjoyable part was the staff.
good,Nice work place. Excellent  peer relationship.  My coworkers taught me how to work on a register. Managers weres very apprehensive and fair. The hardest part of the job was to juggling between customers in rush hours
good,"I liked the company and the people I worked for, it was just the money that was not enough to help support my family.  I needed more money since my husband had lost his job."
good,In this job I learned how to process merchandise. I also learned how to run a whole department.  It was fast paced and I learned quickly how to do it.
good,The job is easy. The people you work for or work with may not be on the same intellectual wave as you. Most of the time you feel as though you are smarter than the people you work for.
good,"This is a good job if you just need to put  money on the table or a job to have while you work up to your carrer. If you're willing to put in the time and work hard, moving up in the company and making a career out of it is and option"
good,"Learned how to better help customers, work cash register, was a very enjoyable job. there was no discrimination at this job, and the managers were very supportive and understanding."
good,"It is a great place to work and gain new experience for anyone starting there career. It helps you learn skills, like customer service and sales. It is also a great place to grow and expand learning experiences and skills."
good,It is a calm place to work at. Not a lot of drama at all and you work at your own pace. Being with the company or any company is something everyone would have to adjust to. Management could be better.
good,was god an people were good l not much work or customers ten they started letting  people go then closed store . sorry to  see it go maybe there will be a better ones some  day
good,reggae party will be his folding clothes counting money usually customer talking to a lot of people . My management was OK could've been a lot better days this hard holding wasn't good for meO
good,Some of my coworkers just did not know how to stay in their pay grade and it was a little irritating. Sometimes the scheduling would show favoritism and that bothered me.
good,"The Salon is Hidden, alot of People don't know that it exists, Need more Advertising, Awesome Stylist work there Black, White, Hispanic, Aisan, European,... & They are Awesome, with Relaxers, Color & Hilights, Hair cuts..., help us Get more Advertising to help us make our Daily quota if not we will be Demoted,  or Fired."
good,"Great associate discount on product along with coupons.  none no comment. I really don't have anything else to say other than great for part time, but no hours beyond pt hours."
good,When working for said workplace I found everyday tasks mundane and uneventful. Overall the workplace tried to take care of the associates but really didn't have the correct structure.
good,"SLC Rec-Post Office:  Entering data for unreadable bar codes.  When I worked there, no flexibility in home work balance."
good,"Worked in retail for over 20yrs and worked as a loss prevention officer for 13 yrs, I've worked for jcpenny, Burlington, Target and Sears I've worked as stock associate, sales associate, department manager, superviser, team leader, team trainer, assistant manager and a loss prevention officer."
good,"Fast paced especially on the holidays. Friendly environment, coworkers are nice. Managers are nice as well. Customers are harsh sometimes. Gotta work fast and be fast sometimes and not get overwhelmed with what your doing."
good,My experience there was not enjoyable and nonprodutive. There was a small amoung of a learning curve that I can identify with. Stocking in the back room and repeat restocking on the floor.
good,I worked here for 14 years and I have seen many people come and go. The company has changed so much over the years. I have gained most of my experience from this company.
good,"Helping custoemrs find items or find gifts for others"
good,I would be on a register all day. If it wasn't busy I would walk on the sales floor and put clothes away. Straightening up what looked out of place. It's easier to stay on top of cleaning so it won't be that much to at the end of your shift. The managers there were very helpful
good,"I was cashier/Sales Associates- I was in charge of cashiering and assisting as a Sales Associates on the sales floor. They decreased my work hours, as a result I was not able to stay."
good,"Duties included general janitorial duties, stocking the janitors closet and assisting customers.  Mopping, sweeping, vacuuming floors and taking out trash."
good,"A typical day at work usually involved stocking, solicitation of credit cards, selling company products, and keeping a clean and presentable work station. I can't say I learned any real life skills aside from getting to practice communication skills with a variety of customers. I loved the management though, the bosses were great and tried to work with you and your schedule as much as possible. The workplace culture wasn't great, but I can appreciate the diversity of the employees that we had. The hardest part of the job was definitely the solicitation of credit cards. While there were many people who either did not want them or already had them, it was still a requirement to sell at least two per day. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to interact with so many different people. You learn a lot about them and their cultures and can extend your own knowledge about the world around you."
good,"Not a bad job but better if you're looking for something part time or seasonal. Pay is ok, but they do expect a lot for a little. Some of the management team can be hard to talk to."
good,This company has been a pleasure to work for. The company is very diverse and its also open to schedules upon the workers availability. I really enjoy the products that they offer consumers.
good,Real busy place to be. A lot of work needs to be done through out the day . Real stressful place to work at . Always work to do and some one always on your back .
good,"JC Penney is and was a great retail store,. The prices are great!!. The Management was fair. I enjoyed working there. I hope the business will succeed."
good,"Loved a few of the managers though others picked favorites and made it hard to work with them. Some of the managers out their wrk on regular associates while they walked around and barked orders and dd nothing, then waited to the end of the night to try and get things done. Other than the lazy associates that have been there fro years and some of the lay managers its a fun place to work of you're assigned under the right manager that actually cares about their job."
good,"- Very good company, respectable towards their employers. Would recommend the job to any student looking for a summer job and want to take up their time."
good,"While it may start early in the morning, it is nice to get started on what to do, sorting clothes and accessories. However, it is a little upsetting to see a few people act impatient when we communicate on which clothes belong to which rack. That doesn't mean the job is overall bad, just need to get accompanied with the ""appropriate"" crowd, especially during the busiest holiday on the calendar."
good,"I was able to use all of my design skills and learned sales.  Responsible for all of the displays including building fixtures, store front windows, signage, advertising and budgeting."
good,"I learned a lot of different things working for them, this is a good job for a high school student, i had a lot of opportunities for advancment and learned different roles."
good,There's a season where it's busy and really slow that i had to work 12 hrs per week but on the other hand my co-workers are fun to work with and specially helping customers to find their needs makes me enjoy this job
good,"Standard retail job. Easy to do, early hours. Little pay but you get breaks throughout the day. Management was patchy at the best and I wasn't really sure who my boss was."
good,This was my first job i really enjoyed the people i got to work with and the customers were always great. A good place to get some good work experience under your belt.
good,This job gave me a good foot hold on how to manage/run a section. It helped me hone my skills with interacting with customers and providing great customer service. The management was okay but seemed more concerned with goals then the actual employee. The hardest part of the job was Black Friday and its aftermath. The most enjoyable part was helping customers find what they needed which turned into great feedback to my managers regarding my performance.
good,"It's retail. There's not much to say. It was very easy to change departments when I wanted. The breaks were good. Work days could be very long. Management was fine, not great. The best part was helping people who went through dramatic events, get brand new items."
good,i like how the company kept a continueing education schedule where we were able to get new techniques. the teachers were well knoledgeable in the area
good,fun place to work. employees nice. Hours gets cut too much. They keep hiring new people and giving them hours instead of the employees already there. when they do that your benefits get cut.
good,"I worked at the JC Penney located in Chambersburg, Mall.  This was a nice store however JC Penney closed many of their stores and Chambersburg was one of the stores closed."
good,I learned a lot I served as Lead for 200 temp associates in the pricing section for 5 years. Also handled all inventory and order filling sections exp
good,It's a lot of wrok but it makes the day go by faster. The manager are very helpful and nice. The associated care about customer and treat them very good
good,"Making sure the clothes are sized, and folded correctly. When working at regester you will take customers payments while meeting the credit card requirement."
good,Great environment to work at. Must have patience to work there as you deal with a lot of different personalities. Great discounts. Good quality clothes at a good price.
good,"no great or negative things to say"
good,Worked in the South County area of St. Louis right after graduating from high school.  Learned a lot about retail there.  Back in the 80's so unsure how it would be to work for them now.
good,"I like working there because its easy work but , the hours are very bad. My schedule right now is just 2 days with 4 hour shift. It's like this year round, holidays you get really good hours buts that's it."
good,"Good company to work for that allows employees to grow.  Great benefits, well organized and reaponds quickly when there's issues.  A dislike is how they allow employees to come to work dressed unprofessional exalpme; Headscarfs, Pajamas, short  or too tight clothing."
good,Descent gig. As long as you handled your business you were fine. Meet a lot of people which is probably the most enjoyable thing about the job. Working on holidays is probably the hardest thing about the job.
good,Friendly people got along with everyone sometimes think they should give more time to do the job but overall enjoy work here. Supervisor was super Jasmine the greatest
good,"I enjoyed working there, even though it was seasonal. I really enjoyed my interaction with customers and making sure they have a pleasant experience and want to come back again. The other employees were nice and helpful."
good,"It was my first job. at first it was nice because I never worked, but when you get more responsibilities financially, it's not enough. the pay is pretty bad."
good,I'm grateful for this first job but I didn't enjoy it at all. Didn't like the environment much. People were nice but I had a better time at my seasonal job at macys than here. It's more strict here I'd say.
good,Didnt work here long so not sure what to say. My expiriance was short. During my time there it was pleasant and i was treated well. Holidays r busy as is all retail
good,"Depending on the department you're in that day; visual aide, start at 7 a.m. hang graphic display signs on doors, windows, change mannequin clothing, hang similar clothing on racks surrounding mannequin. Assemble shoes on display tables attaching price stickers on bottom of shoes. Replinisher/stocker go to stockroom unpack boxes, load carts scan products place in designated places according to scanner readings, return to stockroom clean area. I learned to work a cash register as I never had a cash register job, the functions of a hand held scanner, to be somewhat of an interior designer. Training others to adorn the store. The work place was typical good days bad days but overall everyone got along and worked well together. The hardest part of the job traveling in the snow in the winter, enjoyable employee discounts."
good,"A typical day at work was coming in greeting customers, helping them find what they needed and folding clothes. Everything was about the customers and that was great. I mostly had 6 hour shifts and folded clothes much of the time which was relaxing but when coming in the next day and seeing them destroyed once again was quite stressful."
good,"It was generally fun to work at JC Penney.  The staff made the work day go quickly.  They had game and prizes, especially for the weekend staff, making it enjoyable."
good,"JCPenney is a great company and a good job to work to gain customer service experience. Working in the call center teaches you about time management, building relationships with your co-workers as well as the customers who call in, and building your communication skills. JCPenney requires you to be computer literate  and able to multitask. The hardest part is working a non-flexible schedule, which takes time away from your life outside of work. Often, you can be scheduled more than the set hours you approved to work. The second hardest part of the job, is being yelled at by angry customers who are demanding things JCPenney don't approve of or as an associate don't have the ability to do those things that are demanded. Overall, JCPenney Customer Care Call Center is a decent work place."
good,i really didnt work there for a longtime. However for the time i was there it was an ok experience got to learn a little about retail and met some cool people
good,"Jcpenney is a good place to work for, all the associates are cordial amongst each other. As well as the mangers and the supervisors, its great environment to work in."
good,Typical day was going into the back using the forklift to get the clothes that needed to be put on the shelves for the day.  I also would setup displays and assist customers with finding what they were looking for.
good,A typical day starts with revamping the stockroom to accommodate new inventory.  Restock the sales floor with new and current  merchandise. Working with customers to give them a special shopping experience.  Trained new associates of stockroom and sales floor procedures.
good,Good place to work and start your career. Good induction training and facilities and great support to build your career and educational skills while on employment
good,Peaceful days for the most part. Most customers aren't rude. Employees are helpful. Dress code is the best thing about this company. Also the sales and discounts at times.
good,I was a floater and worked all shifts in all departments.  Never a dull moment and when someone was sick or needed a day off I could cover for them.  Great shopping discount also.
good,"It's a good place to work,However they do not give employees much hours. When I was hired they had told me I woud get full time hours.I was lied too. The management team was good."
good,I worked in the shoe department. Everyday was different where as i would help an array of customers whether it is in shoes or mens department. When lost prevention was unavailable i would also provide male support. The hardest part of my job was trying to convince customers to get a JC penney Credit card.
good,JCPENNY is a good environment for workers that are actually getting taught all of the  steps to due something  instead of being told that  I had done something wrong without even knowing that it was wrong.
good,"Focus on the guest,  always checking our guest service score. Our training and development to improve our skills, so we could improve our guest experience and keep her coming back to us. This attitude  improve of retention."
good,The average day I would sell shoes help coustumers greet people. I learned how to mingle with people better and I learned more about shoes and how to make sells.
good,I don't remember to much about this job. I loved helping people and the management team and the other employees were great.
good,"Walked around and made sure coworkers were attending to customers and providing sufficient attention in organizing the store. Answered the phone, directed customers, advised customers to their personal prefferences."
good,i enjoyed working here but you kind of had to ask for everything and no one really taught me how to do stuff in the Jewelry department and when i would ask them for help they would look at me like i was a bother to them.
good,"A typical day at work would include cleaning fitting rooms, being a cashier, working with customers, and folding clothes. "
good,"management was awful, slow walk in traffic, bad pay, plus side store discount was good, my co-workers were amazing, thats all i have to say about this"
good,You can expect lots of folding clothes. You will either stock or work register every single day. You must smile and act happy at all times. Your uniform (Suit/tie or dress) must be purchased at the store.
good,"Arrive at work at 6am to work on unloading the truck, stocking the floor and organizing the shelves. With teamwork we can finish the truck in a day or so."
good,"Decent work atmosphere, pretty good work/life balance but zero career advancement. Average compensation package and a bonus program. Great fit if career advancement is not a priority."
good,"Sometimes things get confusing like scheduling. Sometimes they will schedule you days that you're off vice versa. So a lot of conflict with scheduling. Besides that, it is a pretty decent job."
good,Answer the calls that are in que to the best of your knowledge. Direct customers to the right department. Invite new customers into the reward program.
good,"My day starts off with checking all my e-mails. When do done I start on what I need to post for my associates for the day as well for the evening associates. I then go out on the floor to make everything is open ready for our customers. Once my store is open to customers, I then greet my customers and welcome then into my store. I always making sure my associates are reaching out to every customer whom may enter in to JCPenney. "
good,"I barely remember this as a summer job in high school in my senior year, I had fun here too and met many people that I do not talk with to this day so yes"
good,"made sure that all signs for the current sale was placed on the appropriate products. made new signs if none was sent from the corporate office, then made sure signs were made & placed on the item."
good,"Overall, If you plan on long-term, JCPenney isn't the right store. But for part-time work, it's a perfect match. Can be flexible with the hours, best time to work is during busy holidays. Making customers feel wanted and helped is a major perk of the job. It's satisfying to be able to help them with their needs."
good,very productive workplace. management still needs improvement. Stock room manager was very very mean to employees new hires. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with that.
good,I was seasonal help for this location. It was a good job with decent hours but the overall is that it is best for someone who is in high school. Manages well with hours.
good,"A typical day of work consists of making sure the store is up to standards and assisting customers."
good,This is a good company to work for! But they do not pay enough for me to live and take care of myself! It's a relaxing environment which is what I like most!
good,In Style Salon inside JCPenney is my first salon job as a licensed stylist and I learned alot working here through hands-on experience and interaction with clients.
good,I worked at JC Penney over 15 years ago while I was in high school. I worked in the Misses department. It was a fun job for a high school student; I made a lot of friends.  Closing was difficult because it was a late night while being in school.
good,"Resourceful Customer Service Representative who consistently meets and exceeds productivity goals. Maintains a high-level of professionalism, patience and effciency to minimize customer disaffection and increase customer loyalty."
good,I worked here during the holiday season as a seasonal sales associate. This was my first job and it was very chaotic. Working here was very stressful but it gave me a taste of what to expect when working retail.
good,"Customer service and communication skills"
good,"You help customers with order, and problems while trying to up sale them. Other employees are easy to get along with. You get a break every two hours."
good,"The location wasn't the best and the mall which the store was connected too, was loosing business.They had periodic training classes for their stylist but should have been done by level of stylist."
good,"Overall decent company, great staff to work along with. Pay raise sucks, workload is sometimes a lot in and manger gives little time to do it."
good,"It's fun at times when it's busy, but when its not really busy they don't have enough people to help around the store. so getting things done with a few people is hard."
good,"The expectations are difficult to meet, and standards are held very high. Great team to work for, but absolutely not enough pay for the amount of work required."
good,a typical day at work. what I learned. management. workplace culture. the hardest part of the job. the most enjoyable part the job
good,"Good place to learn, but compensation and rewards are minimal.  Store manager is easy to work with.  Enjoyable coworkers and staff."
good,Initially a very strong and sure company to work for and enjoyable to work with.  Great to work with company leadership during challenging transition.  Hope they continue to progress.
good,"The job as a whole is rather boring and lacks challenge. Fellow coworkers are easy to get along with, but management can be somewhat lack luster. This would make a good in between job."
good,"Great place to make friends, but the pressure is always on to accrue more Credit Applications. Holiday season is extremely busy and JCPenney changed seasonal work hours for profit reasons only."
good,"Friendly co-workers, some managers nice, others difficult."
good,"its an ok place to start off when you are to new the work industry, not good to depend on for stability. Company does have ok benefits but the cost is a little bit pricy"
good,Not a terrible place if you need good retail experience. Lacks the possibility for advancement or pay raise. Management typically cares about the employees needs and makes the company goal very clear.
good,"everyone was so hard to talk too they werent as friendly, managers would do there job but never seemed happy when i had a question concerning a customer."
good,Great place to work. Typical day included answering client emails and calls. keeping all clients up to date on new product. Had wonderful co-workers. the entire office got along very well
good,"For a first job it was a great for a high school student at the time, ok pay pretty flexible schedule with schooling. managers were great as so were co workers."
good,Open up the computers and register. get the props organized and the room ready. turn the camera on and make sure the memorie cards were ready and erased from the session before. once the customers came in we got the room ready for them to get their pictures taken. then after the photos were taken we would fix them up by centering them and deleting the bad ones. show the guests the pictures and enhance them. show them the different things we can  do to them. Sow them the packages and them check them out at the register. Let them know when the pictures will be ready to be picked up and make them their next appointment. we would clean the room by dusting off the counters and computers. and organize the frames and make sure they were always stocked.
good,"Part-time, seasonal employee. (From Summer through Christmas.)"
good,This was the beginning of my merchandising career.  It was a fun and exciting career path.  The environment was always upbeat and positive.  Everyone worked off each others enthusiasm.  Lots of communication and advise passed around.  Trying to help everyone out and stay positive.
good,retail work is the same everywhere you go pretty much but their discount was awesome. I didn't like HAVING to open x amount of credit cards a month from customers. but if that is something you like doing then there is an extra benefit to doing so. Dont have much to say about this job.
good,It was a good place to work. The people were nice and fun. Just wish it paid more. I would recommend the job to maybe high school or college kids.
good,Very flexible hours and managers. At will employment. They move the employees around a lot. Lots of opportunities to fill in for no-show employees and make overtime.
good,"JC Penney is great because you can be yourself there. The hours are generally flexible and the staff has always been nice, and feel like a family. The pay was not as competitive as I would have liked."
good,"It's a frustrating job for sure. Hours are flakey. And favoritism is shown. Also, enough people aren't scheduled to complete all that is needed to complete."
good,"JC Penney was a fun work experience, the employee and supervisors were great. One of the biggest perk was that your employee discount works on Sephora as well, but only the ones located inside JCP though."
good,"Good atmosphere to work in, kind helpful managers and opportunities for advancement if you work hard. I enjoyed working with the public."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of helping a long line of customers and when there was not a line, we would put things back on the floor, such as returns or fitting room items."
good,Always keep a positive attitude and smile at every customer. Being friendly and willing to help everyone are key skills to have if you want to work in retail. Jcpenney's management is nice and understanding and always available to answer any questions you may have.
good,Builded my customer service experience & Deal with cash & credit card transactions. Putting out stock & cleanliness of the sales floor
good,"For seasonal jobs, it was good for the time being. I have only worked here during holiday seasons. The breaks are reasonable and the shifts were good. The holiday is just busy and can become overwhelming for employees, so everyone is typically stressed."
good,"In 2007-2010 the company struggled.  I did many different jobs, wore many hats, and loved them all.  Financially it was not enough to support my family."
good,"I shopped for customers online via phone. Responded to any concerns customers may have had via e-mail as well. My co-workers were a lot of fun and always in the spirit to help customers, as well as each other! I love getting difficult customers that either spoke a different language or were visually impaired and I was still able to assist them thoroughly."
good,If you like labor and you are hardworking you would definitely love husqvarna. They pay you for the work that you do. Its a nice safe environment! I don't miss it though.
good,"Until you get to upper management, compensation is relatively low. I had fun working at JCP but was not progressing as quickly as I wanted. All and all...not a bad place."
good,Management was all over the place. They also didn't care about their employees too much. It paid the bills. Could be fun with who your other co-w
good,I really don't know much about this company because it was only seasonal. There was challenging work. I learned how to build up my speed and accuracy.
good,"JCP was a nice place to work. Really never had any problems with any coworkers or customers. They definitely care about their employees. Although, I find it upsetting that even though I tried to get transferred, even came in for an interview at the McAllen, Tx location, and they wouldn't hire me. Had been working with Penney's for almost a year and the Penney's in Texas still wouldn't hire me. Arrived right in time for seasonal too... Kind of bogus. But overall, good company."
good,"The job itself is not very difficult. You should always have something to do. Like all retail jobs the hardest part is the customers. You need to be outgoing and respectful. Customers that are upset can ruin your day, you just need to keep a positive and respectful attitude and know you can always call for help."
good,"JCPenney is a good company to work for. Through my time working with JCPenney I have learned great skills regarding management, customer service and analyzing reports. hey promote their associates to provide great customer service."
good,"I worked 5 days out of the week at JCP CC. I answered the phone all day and help customers place orders, track orders, cancel orders, etc. I learned the system pretty well with the help of my trainers. The hardest part was satisfying rude customers and the most enjoyable part was the pay."
good,I enjoyed working in the store but the company seems to be leaning more towards only having part-time employees.  They changed their employee policies frequently so you had no sense of security.
good,"Its okay if you don't plan on staying there long."
good,Working at JCP really helped me expand my customer service experience and gave me my first real look at meeting sales goals which was very helpful. A future with the company would have been great if only there were more hours to go around and a little more advancement opportunities.
good,"Great group of people to work with. Helped customers find there products, made appointmentsome over the phone and in store, cleaned, and cashed customers out."
good,"We work more than we get paid for "
good,We were always kept busy taking photos and making people happy then you had to make a gallery for the customers and show it to them.  You kept a smile on your face and made others happy!
good,"This JCpenneys is very popular in the winter time. I only worked int he photography studio, people come into it in truckloads but the experience was great. Lots of family moments"
good,"Once at work I would have many tasks. I was on customer service, stock room, gift box .station, and clean up at closing time."
good,"Typical day to put things away."
good,JcPenney is a good company if you are looking for extra hours during rough patches. They aren't to good at giving raises and expect you to go above and beyond without considering family life sometimes.
good,"Engaged employees"
good,"Most of the job consists of helping customers out, folding, and helping out wherever needed. If you work for the Catalog dept you do all that plus deal with online order, check in packages, or search for an item for an order. You learn to grow thick skin and notice fraud and generate great people skills. The management seems to change a lot so it can range from good to bad depending on who's running the place. The co-workers you get are usually great people who can laugh and crack jokes with and can actually become lifelong friends. The hardest part of the job is probably dealing with rude customers or fraudulent customers."
good,Co-workers are cooperative and contribute to the team effort to get work done. The hardest part of the job is getting merchandise put back into order after a busy day.
good,"If you are an extrovert, this would be the right job for you. Positions are implemented based on who knows who, regardless of skill or tenure."
good,"Fun work place but lacked effective and responsible management. I worked here for 5 years and I learned a lot of customer service, merchandising, time managment."
good,"I would help customers with merchandise, check them out at a register, process returns, keep the department neat and clean. I worked well with my co-workers and management.  The hardest part of the job was to help disgruntled customers."
good,"Seasonal part time job during my Sophomore year of college, it was very busy but pleasant experience. I enjoyed the experience because I was able gain work experience as well as meet new people."
good,Overall JCP is a easy job. Typical work day consist of placing orders or assisting customers with other issues. Very smooth environment and co workers are laid back. Worse part of job is not having assigned seats.
good,"its a great company overall, but its minimum wage as a customer service rep. there are multiple departments to work in. goal incentives. fast paced during the holidays and weekends, can be slow with inclement weather."
good,"A company that values its customers above all else, I was really able to satisfy any customer problem with minimal assistance at an almost perfect rate, plus the other co-workers at that location (for the most part) were exemplary. However, management was lax to say the least, and the compensation was barely worth the effort of the job. Both the lazy and motivated were equally paid, yet most of the work fell on the shoulders of employees who were actually there to work. In addition, although there was some room for growth within the company, it only came after many years with the company, and you don't go far."
good,Given I worked at JC Penney during Christmastime it was crazy busy all the time. I didn't like that I had to miss Christmas dinners with my family to work at a part time job that I had in high school.
good,"Help out customers, stock shelves , light cleaning. The enjoyable part was being able to help people find what they needed."
good,"Overall I would say working for JCPenney opened doors for growth. The experience taught me a lot, especially handling problems on my own. I'm a people person and being able to talk to people in different states made everyday fun. The company has perks but the revolving door was too disturbing. It seemed as if the company is not for their employees, there is no fight to keep anyone. I appreciate my time there and I'm grateful for the opportunity."
good,"The best thing about my experience in retail was driving sales by giving outstanding customer service. A typical day at work was reorganizing sales floor as company demanded in order for customer to have a great shopping experience. I learned leadership skills, and the rule to customer service which is ""treat others the way you want to be treated."""
good,"JcPenny was my first real job so  I was learning a lot of stuff. Working there could be fun some days and then just be annoying other days, but that's just part of life. My co-works were really nice some of them were kinda lazy and never really wanted to work knowing we were on a time schedule so I would stay longer than I was suppose to. There was just a lot work that needed to be done that just wasn't going to happen. No progress was never being made."
good,"My work day began at 4:30 am preparing to unload the truck. we then prepped the floor for processing and replenishing merchandise. When the truck load was low, we worked with pricing team."
good,"You're always doing something whether it's helping a customer, at the cash register or folding/organizing clothes. Management wasn't very nice or understanding when it came to emergency issues."
good,"As an employee you stock the store, you sell the products, you help the store reach monthly goals. The other coworkers are cool. The management sucks, typical department store. But i learned a lot, especially how to deal with the public."
good,"I was hired in and worked there for 3yrs. When they started putting all the hire up managers in other stores things went down hill. you were lucky to get 1 or 2 days on the schedule at all, and everyone wanted the title of Store Manager and became unpleasant to work there anymore'"
good,"JCPenney was a nice job because I was able to work with people that were very kind and friendly, help give customers the shopping experience I would want to receive, and at times when there are fewer customers I had something to do in the down time such as organizing or restocking."
good,The job id good and they haave good type of people that work there the managment there is okay not to good. the hardest thing about the job is getting your body right for the work.
good,Work was easy going sometimes hectic of course when busy but you do not get paid enough. Your schedule is all over the place so its hard to find another job outside of that. Co workers were cool. I didn't like the constant standing.
good,Working at JcPenney's was a great experience. You give people advice on clothing and maybe even pick out an outfit for them. Coworker we're friendly.
good,"I enjoyed my time at JC Penney and I may reapply with them. I would like something other than retail because the hours are not regular and you can't count on the income."
good,"A typical day would usually consist of ringing people out, cleaning fitting rooms, straightening up clothes tables/racks. I learned to associate with people and get along even if I wasn't the biggest fan of them. The management was great, other than they would put me on the schedule a day before (it was always supposed to be scheduled 2 weeks ahead) and they wouldn't call me or anything until the day of. The most enjoyable part was definitely just getting to meet new people and work together as a team with my co-workers."
good,"The managers were very professional, The staff overall were very, very positive and supportive! Was hired as temp help for the holiday season but they only were able to keep a couple of us out of the approximately 30 people? I was punctual, dependable, worked hard but was disappointed I didn't make it as a 'finalist"" (yeah, I felt it was a contest). Their interview was fun, silly yet effective at discovering people's personality types and ability to handle stressful situations & problem solving skills which is very important for any job/career at hand."
good,"Three years of ringing people out, fixing problems that other people cause by not doing their jobs and an endless cascade of clothing to fold. It's hard work and usually thankless because there is just about no one is held accountable for their actions, so doing the job of 2+ people is common especially if you work evenings or closing shift.  No one is really valued and if you can't do the job of two or more do not expect any praise or to be valued."
good,"A typical work day is a moderate pace and very productive."
good,This was my job as a teenager and I had fun working with my coworkers and even my management.  My typical day would be helping customers and put out merchandise
good,"Management was horrible, they would talk bad about you, and then pretend to be your friend in the same hour. The girls never did what they were supposed to, and if you were favored by management you got away with everything. The store manager was rude, and mean."
good,"EXTREMELY nice coworkers, badly understaffed stores. Management expects to pay the coworkers as little as possible, even if it means lights out fifteen minutes after closing hours due to budget restraints. Then let's not forget about opening those credit cards."
good,a typical day at work is filled with chaos because they can't staff enough people to accommodate to work load. Our managers are very kind and nice. The hardest part of my job is being over worked.
good,I did this while I was in school and on a break from my season of soccer. It worked in I learned how to probably fold cloths correctly and customer service
good,Working in the salon was different than the store. It had a very busy weekend when selling products. I enjoyed the discounts off hair products.
good,"i really didn't like the management they were racist, the supervisors don't treat all the people the same they have preferences with the  people that worked for the company for many years"
good,"good job, low pay and not a lot of room for advancement. good experience for supply chain career. No mid level management. hardest thing is 3rd shift operations."
good,great company to work for I just don't get enough hours and need a job with more hours I would stay working at this company if they would give me hours
good,"Work shifting. I learned a lot about all kinds of Jewelries. I met a lot of co-workers that became my friends. This company is about the sales, if you don't make sales your not helping the company. So you have to have a good skills of customer service to have customers."
good,"What I learned most working at JCPenney is how to and effectively engage with every single customer that I encounter so that they would have a pleasant experience shopping in the store. The hardest part of the job is realizing that it is impossible to always please every single person since there are a variety of personalities and differences amongst individuals, but the most enjoyable part of the job is the pleasure of helping as many people as possible and making sure that I helped made their shopping experience such a pleasurable one that I would gain repeat customers."
good,"For the most part, you really only have to deal with customers at the register and in the fitting room, because the store is easily laid out for them to find what they're looking for. Management is understanding, and they're able to work with you if you go to school. You have to be able to do lifting, squatting, bending over, and slight aerobic activity (pushing carts). Other than that, the co-workers are super nice, and everyone tries to help everyone,"
good,This job is good if you want to earn some extra cash while employed full time or attending school full time. It has a great employee discount and good dental insurance.
good,"People is nice, lately have been huge layoffs. All the operations have been taken to external agencies. Short term contracts."
good,"This was a fun and effective work place. The environment was friendly, and the company was great with providing food to the employees during holiday peak hours."
good,The job was very straightforward I was a customer service rep over the phone. It only got stressful when customers would call in with a attitude.
good,"For working at JC Penney for only 3 months, the store i was located had many flaws. One manager had tendency to disappear, and another was never at the store, workers talked badly of one another and everyone pushed work onto the newer members. Overall it was noticeable who truly cared and who was just there because. Hopefully working at a different location will be beneficial."
good,"If you've worked in a retail store before, this is no different. Crazy Black Friday's, open/closer lifestyle, customer service skills required"
good,"A typical day of work consisted of working the cash register when things got really busy and working on the floor in my department and talking to people. I learned more about computer systems, dealing with money, and how to talk to people."
good,"its a okay work place, teaches you how to work with customers everyday and teaches you good customer service, long days , different task to complete everyday,"
good,Typical factory distribution center. Easygoing company to work for. Give breaks appropriately. High staff turnover.
good,"Work day is labor intensive from start to finish."
good,"Although great benefits and work life balance, this company is in survival mode and cutting all costs at stores and distribution system.  Poor treatment and job security leads to good employees exiting and lackluster associates staying."
good,"it really depends on the day, co workers are okay but they get annoyed for some reason when you balance out the cash register early. they really push for charge card."
good,"Only downside is the lack of potential to move up and the base pay on such positions. Otherwise, it's really the job for anyone looking to start a career in retail and learn everything there is to learn about it."
good,Management is average. My co-workers are all friendly and very helpful to one another. I love what I do but am not able to build a clientele at this location.
good,Good people but always on edge. Learning to stay guarded when we should be learning how to run a better organization.   If we practice candor. Giving feedback and learning from each other I  think we can be a winning organization.
good,Great place to work. I love it! Like helping customers. Also like the employee discount and coupons along with rewards. Co-workers are great
good,"I worked in the women's department, front registers, and fine jewelry.I enjoyed interacting with customers and assisting them with their purchases."
good,the management team is great help with letting me work around my school schedule. patient and hard working environment
good,Average day consisted of setting merchandise on the floor until the store opened and we would switch to receiving and sorting the truck in the stockroom. My team and the diversity of the job were my favorite aspects.
good,I don't believe that I worked here long enough to write a productive review. I diden't work a lot of hours and it was during their holiday season. they pushed you to sell credit cards
good,I started there as a loss prevention officer and it wasn't what I thought it would be so I got moved to a new position. I enjoyed everyone that I work with and liked the atmosphere.
good,"Great job for someone looking for part-time work. Flexible scheduling and 5-6 hour shifts, relaxed and team-oriented work environment."
good,JCPenney has great Benefits. The new CEO is working hard to turn the company around and I can see the difference of what he envisions.
good,"A typical day included helping customers, setting the sales floor and training associates. Associates are to ask customers to open credit cards for store."
good,"I enjoyed having connection with the guest as they shopped, helping them decide on which items to purchase and just having fun"
good,"Good job, just have to work late nights, work holidays and barely ever get the chance to have the day off. When you do get the day off they make you feel guilty about it."
good,"Being around other coworkers you get along with makes it a great environment to be in, especially when dealing with no-so nice customers."
good,A typical day at work for me was organizing clothes and helping customers find the things that they needed. I learned a lot about time management due to having this job at such a young age and having to balance it with school. The management was helpful and patient with me while I was learning to get used to the environment and the co-workers created an enjoyable workplace. The hardest part of my job was balancing it with school due to working long hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people out.
good,Here you got to look at the up coming clothing line before it hits the floor. If you love shopping this would be the place for you. It comes with discounts and you get to be around clothes all day and of course get to meet new people.
good,"My tenure at JCPenney was one defined by change.  During a period of turmoil in the company under the leadership of CEO Ron Johnson, my management experience there was put to the test with regard to adaptation.  The influx of experimentation and new procedures developed me as a leader in very interesting and unique ways."
good,"The job was okay for the most part, it was a lot of work for little pay. I loved my boss and my coworker's, everyone was friendly and really supportive."
good,I enjoyed my coworkers. They were very nice and easy going. I also enjoyed our management team as well. The discount on merchandise is awesome!
good,"Good company for a temporary internship, design isn't the most creative but still fun to work at JCP on a day to day basis. I wasn't the most involved but still enjoyed my time there."
good,J.C Penney warehouse is a productive workplace with good management and culture. Warehouse is ran smoothly with good structure although hours vary.
good,"Work is good, there are a lot of clients to go around.  There is a lot of color business which I love.  I have learned how to work for a corporation.  Management is ok.  I work with a great team. They are all good stylist.  The hardest part of my job are the hours.  "
good,"Management picks favorites, there are no benefits and they make your schedule with less hours purposely so that they don't have to provide you with any."
good,"Very flexible, and organized"
good,The hours are not the best seeing as you will not make full time unless you are a manager and even still that is not guaranteed.  It is a descent job for short term or extra cash not for a living though.
good,Great job with really good people.Company went through a transition and nearly went broke.lot of people lost there jobs and sales went south.I still believe J C Penny to be a good company and hopefully will make a strong comeback.
good,"In a typical day I would stock merchandise, help customers with their requests and maintained a clean establishment. I don't remember anything I found difficult about the job, it was pretty straightforward. Helping customers was he highlight for me in this job."
good,This was my first job as a licensed cosmetologist.  I met a few great people while working there.  The salon itself needed a makeover.
good,"the most enjoyable part of working for this company is getting to meet and work with great people every day."
good,Great place to work if single and just entering the workplace. Benefits are not available unless you work 30 plus hours. Employees work hard for pay. Must be flexible to work weekends.
good,I worked there for thr winter season. they hired me for one department then put me in another one. barely trained me on the layout I was over worked. They expected unrealistic work from one person.
good,Company did not value the commitment employees had to their jobs or the time they worked for the company. Local jobs where outsourced to India.
good,Good people to work with that practically become family. I think it needs to be managed a little  bit better and the company needs to take their employees into more consideration.
good,jcp is a great place to work and to also learn new things. getting to meet new people and help them with what they need. I like working for this company
good,I was working in the shoe department basically my job was helping clients to get the best and comfortable shoes at the best price.  It was fine working in team.
good,Decent pay for work that is given. Lots of overtime during the holidays. Most work is repetitious and easy to learn. Good incentives like pay for performance.
good,"The associate discount is a major perk. Staff are fun, upbeat, and a pleasure to be around. Floor design is awesome and dress clothes are the greatest."
good,"Hectic job but productive"
good,"nice store to work for, great employee discount, low pay, low hours."
good,good place to work during high school but not a long term job there is not much room for advancement and the hours are extremely variable.
good,"As a Shoe Clerk I help clients select shoes that will make"
good,"Its great when it's busy. There was always an issue that we were located back in the furthest corner, so most days I'd walk the floor with my business cards and do some scouting."
good,"Great workplace, however once MCI tried to buy Sprint the atmosphere changed, older workers wouldnt share work and became paranoid about losing their jobs."
good,"I truly enjoyed my training that I received. The associates were always pleasant, The customers are great. Good management."
good,"A soon as I arrived to work, I would clock in, head to the stock room and receive the truck which had merchandise in it. The next step was to fold all the cloths neatly and place them in a cart in which we would take the cloths to the floor and replenish. It was crucial to have the clothing by size color and in the correct brand location, also pricing was very important. Management was good, somtimes lacked experience but for the most part it was good. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with time when replenishing and the most enjoyable was when I got to work out of my usaul routine."
good,Its a good job just want experience and expand more. The co workers are very friendly and the management is very good. The discount there are very good.
good,It was a hard place to meet commission goals. Although the environment was happy and enjoyable.  My pay was so minimum for the work preformed.
good,"Long days and weekends. Holiday hours were a bit much. Retail management isn't for everyone but its for you, you'll enjoy it."
good,"Difficult hours, long days, pay wasn't great. If you aren't built for the retail environment, then I don't recommend this job for you."
good,"I love the fact that the job is very fast paced. The work always keeps me busy and it helps the shift fly by. Also, the management team really helps out by making sure we're comfortable with all the work given."
good,i worked there for half a year and after a while production became busier and busier. it was also a temp service so the work is never permanent.
good,"Its Okay. The work isn't that hard, but you don't get much hours. Also, often times they are understaffed. The managers try their best to work with you."
good,"Great company to work for in sales position, stock or shipping and receiving to advance into management positions. Helping customers find the product they are looking for along with keeping the store clean."
good,"Over all working at Jc Pennys it was a fun environment to work , everyone were very nice and positive, everything revolved around teamwork which was splendid."
good,"Working in the retail environment is a new experience for me.  It can be fast paced at times and can be a very physically challenging job."
good,Just a typical job. Management can be a little annoying sometimes. Some days you work busy days in a department all by yourself which can be annoying and stressful.
good,There are a lot of managers/supervisor per store. At times you can be told to do different things by different supervisor/managers.
good,"A day was good.  Management was not very cooperative.  Co workers were very friendly.  The hardest part was trying to please the manager.  The manager would become irritated if she knew that an employee was interested in moving to another department.  The manager was not sensitive to the needs of the employee. My enjoyment was knowing that I was able to help an employee when they needed to discuss things whether it related to their time or something personal.  It made me feel that they could come to me in confidence, knowing that what was discussed with me was not revealed to others on the job."
good,"I liked having direct contact with the customers.  I also liked the fact that breaks were scheduled.  Working in the children department also "
good,"It was good job and everyone was very friendly. I enojoyed working there and love shopping there , because they are on sales constantly. I love working at the Jewelry department because I love selling products to customers as they walk by. There really isn't any hard positions or anything like that. Its a good job to start off at to work for."
good,The store takes pride in their customers.  Always willing to make the customer happy and put customer first.  Admire JCP for always putting customer first and foremost.
good,I have to come in 30 minutes earlier to put out jewlry and count my diamonds. How to interact with customers and learn their likes and dislikes of jewelry. Management was ok needed help in some areas. Trying to run your department and others. Satisfying customers is the most enjoyable part of the job and making people smile
good,If you like to work with the public and help customers this is the place for you. It was a pleasure to help people with a variety of different needs.
good,i learned that everything has done be done carefully and rapidly cause the store consists of so many customers and they all need yor help.
good,Worked there a short time but I worked with good people. The company encouraged a positive work environment and hard workers.
good,I really love to interact with people on a daily basic it makes the day go by very easy and good. JCPenney is a very clean store easy to find what you look the pay is not up to it should be and hours are very little.
good,"people are usually happy shopping although not always "
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. "
good,"Great place to start your hair stylist career but I do not recommend it for long term. They offer commission on top of base pay which sounds nice, but the commission is a sliding scale meaning you have a certain number to hit each week. If you fail to hit this number you do not recieve your commission even if you were close to hitting it. Lets say you do hit commission, the percentage you recieve is so minimal that it barely makes a difference in your paycheck. The manager is also wishy washy, she will say one thing and do another. To me a manager leads by example, she seemed to have a hard time with this. I loved my team and that the salon provided everything i needed to get my feet wet as a stylist. Offer benefits as well."
good,"This job was alright to me i like to be apart of an active , nice atmosphere and alive job. But this job a little far from that."
good,"I took photos of families and their children. The hardest part of my job was crying babies, but that was just part of taking pictures of young children.  Most enjoyable was when parents like the pictures I took of their children."
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop, being team player,"
good,"Working with the customer's adds to the fun. One one one conversations help the customer and the associate find what the customer wants."
good,This was not a very exciting job.  There was not much chance for advancement.  Management could have communicated more. There could have been more variety and responsiblities with this job.
good,"Working for JCP is great. I love being able to help customers, whether it looking up a item or to help them with a problem. I like all the different people I get to meet."
good,"I began working for this company after receiving my GA cosmetology license and worked up until I moved to Augusta, after my wedding. J. C. Penney is not a bad company to work for and I would recommend it to all stylists just starting out."
good,Constant organizing of the shoe department made the day challenging but exciting. Also helping various customers made it a great one-on-one interacting experience. A lot great people and stories made the job exciting. The hardest part was dealing with difficult customers. Although they we tough this did not keep me from holding up high positivity and respect.
good,"It was an exciting time to work at JCP. Great benefits and opportunities. Great creative people were challenged to produce new and different ways of doing things. They were not always adapted but the challenge was there."
good,"Jcpenney I learned a lot , I learned to challenge myself, and I can become great if I put my mind to it. I was number 1 in selling JCP Credit Card, the challenge was exciting ."
good,This is a nice job if you're in high school or in college. Not given as many hours and the bosses pick favorites. Also you have to try and get so many people to apply for a JCP credit card and most people get annoyed when you ask them
good,"it was a big store, so it is a lot to maintain clean, but most of my coworkers were a lot of fun. Most of the managers were understanding and helpful."
good,Working on assignments while assisting customers can be hectic at times. Employer treats employees with respect and any issues and concerns are resolved promptly. Customer service is top priority.
good,"JcPenny was my first job, I got hired at 16. I was super stoked for the job and it was fun at first but for others it wasn't as fun. JcPenny requires that you have at least 3 credit applications a month. Customers start to get annoyed of you asking them to apply for a credit card but you gotta do it or they pull you aside for a talk. YOur hours also get cut. The more credit aps you get the more hours you get."
good,"No major complaints, it's a paycheck. After January inventory your done. You stand on your feet your whole shift. They give you a lot of hours."
good,"didn't work here for very long but I did learn lots of customer service skills from them, the only problem I had was they started to schedule me only one day a week"
good,"Okay workplace, good managers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the discount we got. All of the workers got along and we always had a good time."
good,"A fast paced retail store, with wonderful staff and management. It is possible for quick advancement, but little incentive to do so. Staff turn-around makes it difficult for senior staff, because there are constantly new hires that need training."
good,I have worked for J.C. Penney for almost four years and they have gone through many changes through those four years. It is a company that is working hard to satisfy customers everyday. Great to work for when you are looking for a part time job.
good,"Managers pick favorites, and let them get away with things that you would get in trouble for. Performance reviews are only once a year, and you are never really told how you could improve while you are there. This sets you up for getting an unfair review just because you never knew how things were supposed to be done."
good,"JCPenneys was a first job for me. There are worse places to start out, like waiting tables or working the drive-thru at a Taco Bell. Just like any other first job it wasn't the greatest. It was just like high school outside of high school. There were cliques in each department and the managers always had a favorite. They would schedule people during times their schedule clearly stated they could not work, and then keep employees 30 minutes after their scheduled off time so that they couldn't take that extra break or lunch. JCPenneys was a great experience giving me money handling and customer skills, as well as gave me the smallest bit of multi-line phone experience."
good,"JC Penney was a good temporary position where I enjoyed helping customers and maintaining visually stimulating product displays."
good,the typical day consisted of me clocking in and then interacting with customers showing them the ins and outs of our furniture pieces  eventually persuading the customer to buy. if no one was buying then id go help out at other departments to stay busy
good,Great management and coworkers to built relationships with. A decent atarting job but not a something you can consider a career.
good,"it was ok i didnt really care for the management there, but i just did my job and went home. the pay is ok for the time i was working there."
good,Great place to work while you are in school. Really fun people to work with. Not many places to eat in the mall. Bring your lunch.
good,"I really liked working for this company, however, I wish they offered more than just a seasonal position other than that it was pretty good"
good,"Productive environment. Good working conditions. Employees had high turnover rate, there was never a chance to get to know most of them."
good,Holidays and mass coupon deals can be difficult to deal with customers at times. Overall most management staff was helpful and nice. Employee discounts was great.
good,"very demanding, high pace which i love, however no benefits, poorly organized, hard to get promoted in spite of hard work and effort"
good,"Fun Fast Paced Great Customers "
good,"While mu employment here, it was a great experience of hard working. It felt as if it was a typical lifting workout, but at my own pace."
good,"Provide Clients with Personable, Knowledgeable and Efficient service"
good,Work wise it was a great place. I learned how to work in a warehouse atmosphere. I would say the hardest thing was dealing with management. the most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere.
good,"Enjoyed working with the people.  There is never enough time to get your tasks done when there is yet another project. Lately staff is so  lite making it nearly impossible to feel like you accomplished anything. I used to love working for this company, but I don't feel the love anymore. It's time to go."
good,great place to work while you're young and looking for something to pass the time. A lot of young people and friendly staff. Good discounts too!
good,Enjoyed the experience and being able to learn the skills that I did. Very friendly environment. I was able to work closely with others and learn the value of team work. I also enjoyed being able to assist people and meet their needs accurately daily. Very fulfilling job.
good,"Coming in checking emails "
good,"Opened and closed department store, cash handling, customer services, prepare merchandise to be put on the floor for sale, assist customers with needs"
good,"This was my first job. I learned a lot about dealing with customers and how best to help them, how to handle money and work a register, and how to multi-task. However, this job can be very stressful if you work alone, which happens very often. At the beginning of the day, we are required to check for put backs in the stock room as well as begin maintaining the fitting room. A sales associate is not only in charge of maintaining an overwhelming amount of fitting room put backs but also keeping the floor clean and organized, checking out customers if there is a register in the department, or answering back up calls even if you are the only person in the department. The store works as a team but it doesn't mean you're not going to have a ton of responsibilities. The worst part are days when it's super busy and a manager gives you a project to do that can take hours. At the end of the night, closers are often required to return put backs to floor (which can be horrible in the tornado of clothes that is the fitting room some days) and also recovering the massive amount of folded clothes on tables and racks. You may as well get used to working alone. On a lighter note, we did have occasional days where we are allowed to wear jeans, get free meals, and are able to use our discount along with any coupons and rewards. If you work in a JCP with a Sephora, your discount does apply there. I also loved my coworkers, some becoming some of my best friends. The managers can be cool but can also be as petty as a bunch of teenagers."
good,"JCPenney was a very busy Department Store.  There was always much to be done at JCPenneys.  A days work consisted of working at the register ringing up customers for their purchases, hanging stock on the floors, completing charges."
good,Easy to keep up with fitting rooms because they were all together. stalk room is separated by department so its easy to merchandise the store.
good,"If you like working with the public then this is a fun place to be.  If not, then I would suggest not applying there.  The pay isn't all that great either."
good,the company wasn't bad it just didnt work for me.They promise to move you up but you get nowhere and nobody wants to help you move up unless you guys have a great relationship.They dont work with your schedule nor put you on a set schedule.They schedule whatever time they want.
good,This job was good and fast paced but there was A LOT of drama with the managers. One would tell you one thing then a different manager would tell you another. They would also call you in on your days off often which I cannot stand..
good,"Everything you would expect from a retail store. Some good days, some bad days. Some good managers, some bad managers. Some good co-workers, some bad co-workers. Having to clean the dressing room you can see some pretty crazy things. Overall it was a good experience."
good,"•	Provide excellent customer service."
good,"LINGERIE DEPARTMENT SUPERVISOR"
good,working for a large company like JC Penny's was a good learning experience and how much JC penny's cared about there employees was a heart warming experience that i enjoyed working for and knowing my position was helping others and there needs i was proud of working for the company.
good,The fine jewelry department is a little chaotic at times. I don't agree with the way management schedules the shifts. I end up by myself some days when the department is busy. The discount isn't bad though.
good,Good part time job for students. Nice casual environment. Nice place to work for the perks and discount. Had good team moral and training was excellent.
good,I enjoyed working at JCPenney because I had the opportunity to interact with so many different people. I was also able to meet new individuals along the way.
good,"I learned how to close cash registers, how to work in a fast paced environment, and how to treat customers properly. I also learned what it was like to work with coworkers with different ethnicities and various age groups."
good,My day at jcpenny was 95% customer service and 5% folding and organizing clothes. the management and coworkers were fun and nice people.
good,JCPenney is a company that has a very professional and positive work environment. My co-workers are my family away from home and management has a personal relationship with everyone. The hardest part of my job is that I do not have more time to build a more personal relationship with some of my customers. Since I have been employed at JCPenney I have learned to be more time efficient and I have also learned to deescalate situations outside of what is required of me at work.
good,The job was alright but  knowing that it was only gonna last a short time kind of was depressing. Truthfully it was boring and my co-works was not happy at all
good,Learned a few important things about the retail business. This job taught me the skills of merchandising. A job well worth the time and energy spent to get better interacting with guests.
good,I had a good time while I was there.  Duties were straightforward and my coworkers were kind and helpful.  My superiors did a good job of telling my about my strengths and what I could improve on.
good,typical day at work busy friendly co-workers. I really feel that is an easy job the hard part for me I should say recovery at night. I feel I wont make it to clean the whole entire store but at the end I succeed
good,"-A typical day at work was satisfying the customers"
good,"Was asked to be hired on permanently, but when I had to have emergency surgery and needed to leave before Christmas they were no longer willing to offer full-time."
good,Enjoyed the people I work with.  Benefits and Pay not good. No annual raises and always overly encouraged to sell products.
good,"I was the first greeting when clients came into the salon. Scheduling appointments and keeping each stylist organized and up to date when clients canceled or running late. Making sure the overall flow of the day was not disrupted by road blocks. I learned to be fast and efficient as well as not taking peoples frustrations personal. Management and higher management attempted to hear concerns but I felt they were not as important as listening to their plans for the evenings and weekends. The hardest part of my job was to listen and organize up to 15 stylists a day all while keeping the front desk flowing and uninterrupted. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting some very unique co-workers and working with the public on a personal level"
good,"The Job as all retail job are . Theres nothing special about this Job."
good,Replenish shelves of stock from the backroom. Sort through product and separate between departments. Management would help with whatever was needed. All of the co-workers were always more than willing to help out. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees and customers always having an interesting story to tell.
good,"A typical day i would go out to my cart and make sure eveything was in order, then i would have to count all the toys and make sure the person before me wasn't short. Then i would have to go to the back and unload boxes and take everything out count those toys and tell my boss. Then whatever toy i needed on my cart i would take it there but all of the things i was loading and unloading i had to keep track of the numbers."
good,"productive, energetic and fun workplace. Retail store and a whole lot more. Family, friends, fun, sales, discounts, coupons."
good,The job is fine but the management is very rude and strict. It is normally very slow during the week. Co-workers are great there.
good,"Customer service throughout the whole day. Also I have duty for keeping store neat and clean. Sometime, I do a side duty such as putting computer cash register together or replace none working cash register scanner. What I learned is that how to deal on a stressful situation with customer. Also, I learned how to use a few equipment such IO scanner, cash register, baler and a few hand tools such as screw driver, wire stripper. Management is very friendly and motivation. All co workers are very nice and friendly also very diverse. The hardest part of the job is when the store get very busy and not enough employees. Sometime, you have to work extend past 2 3 hours without getting your break or lunch. The most enjoyable part of the job is that  being around friendly co workers really bring your spirit up and make you feel comfortable working with them just like a family."
good,"A typical day included Making sure the signs are accuratye for the current sale before the store opens, presetting the signs for the next sale, markdowns and customer service."
good,"a while back i wrote a review that never made in on indeed, what ever happened to freedom of speech? anyways, the job was ok, worked mainly mornings, the job was simple, the co workers were ok. Management lacked communication."
good,"Working with this company has been a great experience, a typical goal at JCPenney is to help satisfy our customers and make them want to have a wonderful shopping experience at JCPenney. At work you work with your fellow associates and try to help the customers find what they are looking for and then ring them up at the register. When the store is closed we all come together and help recover the store so it can look perfect for the customers to shop at. I learned to be more patient with people and got better with my communication skills as I learned to engage with the customers more. Management at JCPenney is tough but they taught me how to be a better associate and it made me a better associate today. Managers also trained and taught me that its important to get along with your associates and to make it a team goal to please all the customers and to make JCPenney a wonderful shopping experience to the customers. The hardest part of the job is when I have to work in catalog which is basically online orders and having to deal with that area can get confusing and frustrating because the computers can get slow and sometimes you have to handle that area by yourself. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I make people smile and I make their day because I helped them get a good deal and I helped them get what they wanted."
good,Friendly pro staff and welcoming environment. Most of everyone was approachable when questions arose. Recommended for someone who is in need of a job while in school to get some hours.
good,"Ringing customers up at the register, providing knowledge in merchandise available, keeping the clothes out on floor organized, and fitting room clean."
good,Worked the longest here then any other company.  Pay wasn't the greatest and often management was up to handle simple problems.  It was a job so I can't really complain.  Plus management and people were real.  It was definitely a social environment despite huge work loads.
good,"A typical day at work was assisting customers with finding and pricing items on the floor and via catalog, I learn a lot about how "
good,"First time working in sales.  Assigned to the men’s wear department, assisting customers, stocking, inventory, store maintenance as needed.  I don't see myself ever doing this work again. However it was a great experience."
good,My favorite part of this job was interacting with customers and helping them with whatever they needed.The hours were sometimes difficult but over all i had a good experience
good,unloaded trucks and worked with forklift.  Co workers were respectful.  Everything was done in a prompt manner.  Sometimes communication was key but that came down to management.
good,"I worked in the home department for 5 years. I worked in the cash wrap ringing up sales, assisting customers finding their items, and restocking shelves when necessary. I assisted in setting up a new floor plan. If items were not found in our stores, I would look to locate item at another JCPenney store that could be sent to our store for customers."
good,"Great Job, not the industry I was interested in. Was able to gather Experience in customer service as well as many other aspects in the cosmetology industry."
good,"it was a great opportunity being that i got the job straight out of cosmetology school. i learned a lot in my time there. i was a struggle being in a retail store, we were expected to know what was going on in the general store but were not always filled in on most things. our salon leader was really great. She was everything a good leader should be but still approachable. the begging of the weeks are usually very slow and the weekends were the most busy which i really enjoyed the faster paced environment."
good,Co-workers are willing to help out when ever we needed them.  Hardest part of the job was trying to your work done while being short staffed.
good,"Assisted customers in selecting merchandise and completing sales transactions."
good,This company did have a nice work environment everyone was very friendly and hands on i would have given it a higher rating if my hours weren't steadily being cut. The hardest part of this job was climbing the high latter maybe because i don't like being up to high without much support. They have a great employee discount.
good,"great place to the people are great the managers will work with you"
good,"Every day I either opened or closed the store. I learned how to do set changes on a monthly basis. My co-workers were supportive and dependable. The hardest part of my job was having to work every holiday except Christmas. Also, my vacation time was denied a lot and I lost it in January. I enjoyed my workers. They strived to accomplish any task given to them."
good,Co-workers are friendly. Multi- Task. Stay Busy. Clean Up Messes. Run Cash Registers. Clean Up Messes. Help Customers find What they need.
good,"I worked here for a short period of time. It was something that was completely out of my element, which is why I did not mind working a seasonal position."
good,"The manager at in those years were well and had great coworkers, now the company is real bad because of poor performance and bad management."
good,"In sales some days go slow, some days go good, bad , fast. They always begins with and end with a smile. The most pleasant experience was always knowing that when the customer left they had left with what they wanted or as close to it as possible to it, or would be able to come back at their schedule to get what asked for."
good,A typical day at Jcpenny was pretty good everyday I went in for work. I enjoyed working with the people and the supervisors. I was able to learn how to improve my customer service and learned how to style. The hardest part of the job would have to be I had to stay over to close during school week.
good,"Sales associate include greeting customers."
good,"Started morning counting diamonds and by pulling them out of safe.  Kept a log daily of items sold.  Helped Customer's with Jewelry Sales.  Watch battery replacement, link removal.  Cleaned stones and gold for customers."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job is the employee discount.  Christmas time is BUSY.  Still shop there even though I don't work there anymore.
good,"great seasonal job if you need some extra cash, very team orientated. Very sales orientated they wanted us to convince people to sign a credit card with jcpenney. and they would give us two dollars extra on our pay checks."
good,My job at JCP as a sales associate was to make sure every customer that entered our store was given good customer service.
good,"JCPenney does have the best coworkers. They are all friendly.They like to find every little reason not to get you a raise. Managers/leaders have favorites. Every 3 years the store will switch or transfer managers around, and you just have to hope and cross your fingers that your store gets a good manager."
good,"The work there is work, and employees are nice to be around. The days will bleed into each other in time. If you are a perfectionist your work will be ruined by stock personal as they have to move quick and without a care."
good,boring an was not like I expected ! the co-works were ok just were a little to old and always kept attitudes and they were big on getting stole from
good,i had 3 types of jobs general cleaner cleaning 3 floors of the hotel and transporting customers form different parts of the city and stocking the kitchen food.
good,"learned to communicate better with other"
good,"A typical day would be helping with customers, helping with returns, and also handling with clothes- such as folding, re sizing, and returning. I learned a lot working at JCPenny's, I learned how to fix jewelry, how to work as a team, and learn how to be more open with people. Working with the co-workers here was amazing, I honestly looked up to each and every co-worker, they were like family and it was sad to see them go since JCPenny was closing then. The hardest part of my job would probably have to be working overtime, at times I would have to work overtime and it was difficult because I am still in school and I would be home around 11 at times. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be gaining great customer service, and also keeping up with the latest fashion."
good,"It might be one of the most simple jobs you can have. The pay range is very low. Like 9.80 a hr low. But you do just track orders and help place catalog orders. They have a real strict attendance policy, dont get in a five car pile up because you will get dinged for it. Whether you die or not."
good,"Log into computer/phones, take calls from customers re: technical support, orders, complaints and whatever else is requested of me for the day.   I learned that you can satisfy 99% of the customers.  The other 1% cannot be appeased (sometimes just need to vent) and not to let it ruin your day.  Do the best job possible for everyone involved.  My co-workers and I got along great.  I am always there to lend a helping hand and they were too!  The hardest part of the job was being on the phones 8 - 10 hours a day.  The easiest part of the job was being on the phone 8 - 10 hours a day.  My supervisor is great.  Very easy to work with."
good,"fold cloths and provide great customer service"
good,"While I did learn a lot during my time there, management made the days drag. I did gain many good friends, the ""competitive pay"" was an attempt at pitting us against one another."
good,jc penney is a great place to work at if you like to deal with retail. As we know retail isn't the best job to have during the holidays. Although the discount comes in handy
good,"But Only If It Was Under Different Management. They Didnt Train Well, I Am An Individual Who Needs To Be Fully Trained In Order To Understand. Having New People Train The Newer People Is Not The Way To Go."
good,The late nights and work culture caused me to look somewhere else for employment. The store manager at the time I left was unreliable.
good,"I love working in the warehouse setting"
good,Helping customer is the first thing at this job.  I stock department and keep everything organized. Co-workers are all friendly to work with.
good,"When swiping in for your shift, be prepared for a very tedious day. The calls are non stop. The breaks are too short and the managers are not very family oriented."
good,"pay the minimum, require you to do supervisor work without receiving fair payment, they do not give a fair raise for all you do,"
good,"My co-workers were friendly and it was a good work environment. The managers did not care much about associates below them, we would often stay hours past our end of shift time."
good,"A typical day at work was pretty fine, as far as dealing with the customers, im some what a peoples person so i know how to deal with people in different situations and make their shopping easy for them, Here at this job i learned how to actually deal with all ages of people, having a idea of what best fits a person as far a clothing, furniture things like this. The managers here to me could have been a bit more professional and dealt with their co-workers more from my point of view.my co-workers was really nice and im glad to say that after all these years i am still good friends with some of them.the hardest part of the job would be during major holidays it gets a little overwhelming but it ends out good just having to deal with the rush at times.the most enjoyable part was actually being there helping people on the floor, i actually liked this job"
good,"Typical day was good depends on deadline and getting merchandise to the floor. Providing customer service was fun and enjoy helping customers find merchandise or sending them to correct employee that could asst. Management in stock was great until supervisor left for another job. Hardest part no team work at times, controlling people and lazy worker. Going home was enjoyable part of the job."
good,"A typical day of work for me is, clocking in doing my job, meet and greet customers, give off advise and ideas. my co-workers are enjoyable to be around they keep my day going I enjoy working with them. The management team there is okay but could use improvement in their work ethic. I come to work because I look forward to seeing my customers and I know they look forward to seeing me as well. I go over and beyond for my customers I get to know them on a friendship bases, that way there comfortable with talking to me and it's easier to assist them with their needs and wants."
good,Everyday was different. But everyday focused on driving sales and profit. I was responsible for all activity on the sales floor. I was in charge of all department supervisors and the employees in each department which was the equivalent of 160 employees. A typical day would involve reviewing sales by department and identifying areas of concern and executing a plan to improve sales and drive profit. Each day I would continuously walk the floor and observe the sales floor and effectively coach in the moment for associates who need direction.
good,this company helped me move forward in my career. they work on helping the employee improve on their goals. the company pushes you to do better.
good,Working at Denny's allowed me the opportunity to learn how to be flexible and be able to think on my feet. It taught me how to deal with many different types of customers in many different situations.
good,"Typically stick to a routine, of assigned task on a day to day basis. Learn how to provide excellent customer service by delivering what the customer needs expeditiously. Usually worked most days out of the week, and took extra shifts on weekends."
good,I did shipping and receiving. I was head of the floor display crew. We maintained the setups of merchandise throughout the store. I was also pulled on the floor to run the cash register when needed.
good,I only worked at Jcpenny for a short time. I was part-time. It was a nice place to work if you like to be in sales. There is always something new that JcPenny is doing.
good,I worked quickly and diligently too do the tasks assigned to me. I learned how to manage a clothing floor too company standards. Management was very understanding and fair.
good,"JCP is an extremely fast paced, competitive large corporate work environment focused on returning to growth and loyalty to the customer."
good,"I do not have much to say to be honest. Not a bad place just not for me.The people there where mostly nice, I just could not put my heart into it so I decided to leave."
good,A typical day may include pricing and signing merchandise as well as giving superior customer service. The management team is positive and supportive of their staff.  The hardest part of the job is completing tasks in a short period of time.
good,My experience was fine due to part-time hours and working at the Home Store was great coz who doesn't like home goods? My experience with management was great.  Great group of co-workers and great management team.
good,I loved the awesome people  and I had a few that I always enjoyed.  It is a typical retail job with good and bad.  I had the best supervisor there and we have remained friends after I left.
good,"This job allowed me to get a second income while saving to move. The company was kind and courteous to its employees, but because the company is having some financial struggles trying to keep its department stores afloat after the fiasco in 2012, there's really no chance for advancement."
good,great place to work love the environment and people. would highly recommend.  helpful employees and management is great
good,"overall it's a pretty good experience"
good,I value what I learned at JCPenny.  My tasks weren't always 100% clear but that just meant I had to learn to take the initiative and find out what needed to get done and get it done.
good,JCPenney I learned how to be more organized. I worked on the floor and the back stock room in both jobs made me a lot more organized to do my job faster. I also had to help customers find what they were looking for and help them understand their bills. I also had to ring up people and at the end of the night close out the drawers.
good,"This job was for seasonal work, but it was my first job that I had. It was a simply retail job and I did all that I could, and learn about the retail life and what it entailed."
good,i will love to work for them justs need more money but was a good job i was the bests fast job u can ask for.My co worker was the best too.
good,"Unless it's the holidays, a typical day is slow.  However, you learn lots of patience.  It can be like a family atmosphere so it's great to take advantage of that.  Hard parts of the job are just dealing with the slowness or the unreasonable ICAP goals which entitle you to be a partner in ruining a customer's credit.  However, that decision is always up to the customers.  Co-workers constantly call out as well for various reasons."
good,"Customers have no limit on articles of clothing allowed in dressing room, leads to theft and a mess left for the employees. "
good,I have never dealt with customers in this way before so it was an eye opener for me to see the extremes of attitudes and mindsets that can come from the satisfaction or dissatisfaction that comes from a customer.
good,"Basic retail job, required standing for long hours and exceptional customer service experience.  Great introductory job for high school or college students looking to make some money."
good,I check people out and make sure they found everything they are looking for. And if they need help looking for an item I always help them find it so they are satisified. I learned that just by working at the cash register for the first time it has helped me a lot. And I am better with money. I love working with the people I do. They are a lot of fun and they keep the day interesting. The hardest part of the job is when you are the only person on the floor it is hard to get to the dressing rooms and put clothes away when you have a line. The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers. I love making their day.
good,"you could work at different parts of the warehouse shipping, tunnel ,receiving wherever they might need you for that day"
good,I was taught that the people in sales face to face is vastly different from sales over the phone.  I can appreciate the people who have to assist and sale to the public on a daily basis.  My hats off to all in this line of work.
good,"Being rounded People,Cashering,OK Management, Some were nice, Not Hard, Being with People"
good,"it is a nice enviornment, people are really respectful. goods and bad days but hard work always pays"
good,It was fun but now management is backstabbing if they don't like you and it trickles down to the coworkers. But if you go and get credit apps up the wahoo then you should be fine.
good,"Typically a work day at JC Penney envolved customer service and lots of organization. "
good,I got to meet some great people and make them feel better about themselves. I cut and styled hair and answered phones and made appointments.
good,"Work hours were good, Associates were for the most part good and honest, management was good."
good,"Working for jcpenny taught me how to multi-task.  I didnt only work in customer service i was also promoted to store receiver where i learned everything from merchandising to logistics.  Not only was it a challenge to receive the merchandise as well have it all out to be sorted, i feel like i gained better organization skills."
good,mostly just scheduled appointments for people to go to local h7r block locations to get their taxes done. As far as the company very strict on attendance.
good,"I worked at JCP a short amount of time, but the time there was a positive one. Retail is solely focused on customer service and relaying opinions on items prior to customer purchases. The managers were easy to approach and very mindful of employee needs and concerns. The hardest part of the job in the Lingerie department was trying to keep a large area organized [so it could be easy for customers to find items] during rush hours. The most enjoyable part was comfortable interactions with co-workers and customers who cared about your opinion on purchases."
good,The management in this company was horrible. The job itself was not so bad.
good,not flexible work hours. too many requirements to keep the job. they get rid of their best workers if they dont get enough credit apps.
good,This was my first job that I have stayed in almost 3 years in this store I did enjoy the job.
good,"Varied schedule, employee discount at the time. Worked part time during high school."
good,"I sold shoes and accessories. I also tagged and arranged merchandise."
good,"work assembly line, put one item on the line and take other item off. Heavy lifting along with a lot of bending. 8 hours shift. There wasn't any other task they want you to work strictly on your belt and go at a steady pace while coming up with a routine to make a better flow"
good,"I thought it was ok for a first job."
good,"I learned how to color coordinate clothes , fold clothes and learned great customer service skills"
good,I worked as a Visual Specialist and found my constant duties enjoyable. Keeping things up to date and new look can be exciting and fun.
good,"Its a fast pace working environment, but the managers and co workers are really what make it great, it feels good to know when you helped a costumer"
good,I would have to say that it is a decent work environment. The training was easy. The best part of working there was seeing new customers everyday.
good,"Basic day includes restocking shelves / racks, good and bad conversations with customers and regular cleaning/ folding of merchandise."
good,Working at jcepnney was a good experience.co-workers were really friendly
good,Salesman; Great job to meet new people. Assisted with finding items for customers.
good,"Though I am a seasonal employee, I really enjoy the job and the people. Everyone is very friendly."
good,"I would spend much of my time preforming tasks to ensure the best customer service, in addition to providing a clean and organized atmosphere as well as a timely check out.  I learned to make sure a customer is pleased and if there is an issue to calmly explain and work through the issue."
good,A welcoming and quiet place to work and share great customer service.
good,Daily quota needs to be met. Work flow changes daily. Job duties change daily.
good,"co-workers are pleasant and easy to work with, hardest part of job is lack of work hrs."
good,"It was okay. It was a great place to meet new people, good friends. My last two supervisors were great."
good,Have worked over years what a remember typical retail environment nice people overall nice job
good,coworkers were ok. there was a lot of favoritism in the work place
good,"I really enjoyed working in retail merchandising, i am always willing to help a customer with their shopping needs. i like selling and over seeing individual departments. styling and marketing the merchandise was very exciting. i worked well with my store manager."
good,"•	Responsible for opening credit applications"
good,"JC Penney is the typical retailer, along side Macy's And Dillard's."
good,tyipical day would be stocking and putting up fixtures. i also threw out things
good,Havent worked at this company for years so I cant really give a good or bad review.
good,"Fast Paced, Fun environment"
good,"Contributre in all areas, from the back of the store to the front of the store. learned a lot about how the store operates, from receiving and preparing products, customer service, and merchandising by seasons and styles. co-workers have great upbeat personalities."
good,"it was a fun college job, but i had to quit it because i wanted to focus more on college."
good,I loved to come into J C Penny. It was like when i was a younger girl my mom worked there some some of the people had already knew who i was. So it was like home with family.
good,poor management didn't get jobs done that needed to be. employees cared more about breaks and leaving than they did doing a good job and helping customers. financially company is just about bankrupt. serious changes would need made for the company to stay in business much longer
good,This is a typical retail job that is ok to work at. I just want to post my resume what is all this for?
good,"Great place to work room for growth and pay, needed to have hours more on the same line as my children so I had to find something that would match there school hours"
good,"I found it to be a good work environment most of the time. Frustrating though in the sense that some of us worked really hard while others slacked and we all were affected by those that didn't work as hard since we were a team. To me it seemed as though those of us who did work hard were not given the recognition in contrast to those who didnt. The management needed to communicate better and organize the work load better and shift resources and the more productive workers to areas that needed more attention than others. The hardest part of the job was watching people slacking at their jobs and not complaining about it. While the most enjoyable part was when we all worked as a team to get our goals for the day accomplished. I learned how difficult it is to keep a department store stocked and organized, appearing neat and clean."
good,"A typical day at work was, ringing people out, treating them with good care and having a good time."
good,"Typical day included ringing out customers at the register, sorting and folding clothes, and cleaning fitting rooms"
good,"Good Company, have been there for almost a year, there are always postings for new opportunities."
good,this job was different from any other job that i ever had management was different but i guess ok the co-worker there was great to work with there was no hard part about this job.
good,Setting the store for current weekly advertised ads.  I learned to work with new computer software.  The management had your back.  The hardest part was putting up the new sales before the door opened.  Taking care of the customers.
good,"Selling fine jewelry exp. ( diamonds, gold, and sliver).  Getting credit applications quota, along with care plans that went with selling any jewelry.  Got along great with my co-workers, and management."
good,"I was hired for a part time position with the promise of full time hours within 90 days. After 6 months of leading the department, my manager was still giving me excuses and giving other people the same promises I had previously received. Finally instead of getting more hours, a new ceo from Apple came and cut our departments hours even more. So in the end they wanted me to work 5-10 hours a week and give them the same results that I had been giving in 30+ hours a week."
good,no room to move up-great hours-learned to work with different personalities. This is the Department where I learned to be a Leader.
good,"My co-workers made me feel safe secure and they were very helpful, and team players. I would love to work for them again."
good,"Typical day at work consisted of constantly doing dishes, bussing tables and making sure the restaurant was clean.  I learned people are messy but service with a smile can change the perspective of many."
good,A great place to advance in your skills as a hairstylist. My co-workers are great and I love the fact that no one is above helping one another.
good,Corporate has gone from associate driven to metric driven.  Not much left in terms of loyalty.
good,"Fun people, good managers and co workers. Not a lot of hours though."

good,Growth with in the company.  Most of the stores I worked in were nice !
good,"A typical day at work consisted of giving great customer service, making sure all the shelves and racks were neat and fronted, as well as making sure the dressing rooms were cleaned. Immediate management here was good however the guy that was over everyone was not the best. I did enjoy working with my co-workers and being able to interact with our customers."
good,There is always plenty to do at JC Penney it is never a boring day. I have learned a lot about my self. The people are really cool to work with. I think the easiest thing is working with customers and the hardest thing can be working with customers.
good,"helping customers, great management when there is a problem"

good,"fast working environment, always something new to do. by working for this company i am now able to manage time better than i use to before working for this company"
good,"At JcPennys I assisted customers with their needs majority of the day. I also maintained the upkeep of the store and assisted customers at the cash wrap during check out. Management was very much involved at pennys. They kept associates up to date and on task. My co-workers were a different range of ages but we all got along and helped each other out. The hardest part of the job was being young, still in school, and working strenuous hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was being young and making decent money for my age"
good,There are a lot of ups and downs but things are in progress. Customer service is cool. Management is getting better. I love working with my colleagues. Hardest part of the job is staying on top of data entry.
good,I enjoyed working with the people. They were very understanding with my pregnancy.
good,"It's ok at my job. Been there far too long. "
good,"A typical day at work includes breaking down shipments of new merchandise to replenishing the store  while providing great customer service. I've learned how to handle different moving equipment, build and take down fixtures, and how to distinguish different merchandise throughout the store. Management is easy to get along and they really help you as far as teaching you the in's and out's of the store and the goals they are trying to reach. The co-workers are the backbone of the store we really push each other to be accountable for serving all customer needs and keeping the store as clean as possible. The hardest part of my job is actually putting out the new merchandise, as sometimes the shipments can be overwhelming/ The most enjoyable part of my job is associating with my co-workers and customers."
good,"Although JCPenney is a large department store, the department in which I worked, the shoe department, kind of stood alone from the rest of the store.  In the shoe department, we were a family within a family.  We created an entity that remained strong and conquered every task placed upon us such as exceeding sales expectations and shattering customer satisfaction standards.  I, took on a lot of the responsibility for completing the tedious tasks of upkeeping the shoe department in order to ensure smooth operations from day to day."
good,"◾Knowledge of retail marketing, including current fashions and FMCG trends."
good,Hours kept getting cut and some days there was no work for any of the support specialist so employees were sent home early.
good,"Helping customers with day to day needs. "
good,Great place to work if you want to work in the retail field. This company only give you a small amount of PTO time. Healthcare is not very good
good,I tend to clean out fitting rooms mostly and make sure that the clothes are put away. I work at the registrar sometimes and with customers needs. Closing is the hardest part of the job. Hours are very inconsistent.
good,"I enjoyed learning many different tasks here and being able to take responsibility and charge. I was trained by Supervisors to perform Visual, Replenishment, and Pricing Duties. I was able to feel comfort in the fact that I was a ""go-to"" person on many issues or concerns others may have; however, there was no room for advancement or pay increases."
good,On a daily basis I apprehend shoplifters and mitigate company losses.
good,"Working with this company, one will gain a valuable skills and improvement in talents already possessed. No two days are ever the same and there is always something to learn."
good,"Load and unload trucks, pick orders,clean the work place,put the   up"

good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.  I enjoy meeting new people and trying my best to help them in any way I can.
good,jcpenney was my fist job and it did help me learn basic job duties. the people were nice and you have a chance to earn a commission.
good,my years on this job was pretty good. it was close by to my residence so I didn't have far to drive and my co-workers were like a family as I spent the biggest part of the day at work. I learned how to handle a number of situations and life in general since I started there when Iwas 16. The hardest part was leaving after 39 years and the funnest was learning something new everyday.
good,"Interacting with customers , making sure you helped them get a great shoe. Co-workers were awesome."
good,"A typical day at work fluctuates! Greeting customers, asking if they need any assistance. Making sure aisles, shelves, racks, clothes, products are neat, and properly put in correct place. Recovery for fitting room, customer service return, and cashier was my daily duties."
good,"Very fun, fast paced.  Its great when you have a great team working with you, who don't complain a lot, but actually come to work.  Great discounts, great place to work, shop, and save"
good,"I would restock clothes and different items from each section wherever I was needed in."
good,"would alternate what our team did one  unload ,one would scan, the other would stack the parts. Had a lot of management learned how use a scanner, forklift cardboard compactor. The people I worked with was hard working easy get along with. Supervisor was Lisa Nelson was easy going as long as u did production."
good,"first job"
good,No benefits. A good job to start off. Great discounts at this job.
good,Its is a very busy place almost everyday. I've learned to help others in anyway possible not just to send them to someone else i take it upon myself to make sure i help every customer 100%. everyone in my work place are very friendly and helpful. the hardest part of my job for me would be not able able to help a customer in what they need. the most enjoyable part of my job is seeing every customer i help leave with a smile.
good,"After the change in the CEO, things just got weird with the company."
good,"I worked for 19 1/2 years at Penneys....all in Furniture sales. I also performed organization for the department including floor sets, schedules, and information flow.  I worked with Parade of homes,  Festival of Trees, Designer showcase homes and Derek Jeter events."
good,the place was nice to work. I really like the people i enjoyed working with. but hours are always an issue. but other than that really fun place to work.
good,At the time they were switching ideas of ways to change the whole look. Unfortunately the management could not settle on a direction so we were constantly being told three different directions to go.
good,"They scheduled few hours per week, One would have to get a second job to maintain financial security. But great job for students or teens."
good,The only thing that I didn't care for was that there no windows and the year was hard for all business so things got really tight. The management were caring and very supportive and the benefits were great.
good,does require a lot of standing and patience and overtime hours can be difficult especially when your coming out in the middle of the night
good,"JC Penney was my first job. I was kind or lost and confused but I manage to pull through each day. Everyday was basically the same thing over and over again until I was hired for other positions. my first register experience was good. I had one problem with a customer (she was old) it was very difficult understanding her needs, but I didn't stop trying to help her, I then called my supervisor and she was satisfied. The most enjoyable part of the job is Christmas time."
good,"I don't really have much to say, my experience there was during the Ron Johnson make over.... which made Jcp the only place I rather not be. It was very chaotic. I feel it would've been a better experience if the make over hadn't been there."
good,Just went in and jumped right into my work I do my work first and joke off the clock I never play while I'm at work.
good,"displayed, shoes, worked in womens, management not good,keeping up dressing rooms, cashier, some attitudes are not good at all."
good,Good for pocket money there isn't much to say but that.  Honesty beside discount for working there its not fun and holidays are hard.
good,"Around Christmas time, I was working the Catalog department. One customer was looking for a specific necklace that we didn't have in stock. I called all the other JCPenney stores in a 200 mile radius and finally found one necklace for this man and had it shipped directly to his house. He was so thankful, he retuned the following week and gave me a thank you card! I was blown away!"
good,Allowed time to interact with a lot of customers. Enjoyed the discount given to employees for shopping.
good,"Overall, working for J C Penney's has been a positive experience "
good,"The management are wonderful to work for, the atmosphere is very pleasant."
good,it was a great job always had something to do and if there was no product to go through always found something else to do..managment was great very understanding and always made you feel good. and there was always different jobs to be done
good,Almost at times to stressful making the job not worth the time.
good,"I enjoyed the job, but didn't sign up to be a Receptionist. I am a hairstylist and that is wat I signed up for. The job was a little difficult but, I am good with talking to people and have a pleasant attitude."
good,"Fun atmosphere, Management is awesome. Loved working for the company."
good,a lot of counting off loading and re-loading some loads can be come overwhelming....
good,"Typical day is scheduling appointments, customer service, billing, filing, and cleaning."
good,"While working at JCP I gained a lot of valuable experience.I gained experience at being a leader, how to execute signing process, how to  do visual presentations. I was also a key holder with opening and closing responsibilities."
good,"A typical day at work usually starts with recovering different sections of the department. Making sure the hangers are properly hung, no misplaced items in the wrong sections, the dressing rooms are clean and cleared of extra clothes. If it really gets down to it, we usually organize the products by size. This usually occurs when there are no customers to be checked out. I learned to be fight my patience with this job. It's really easy, but you just fight time with this one. My co-worker were all quite friendly though. The hardest part is staying busy during the shift, specially on a slow day. The most enjoyable part would be how the leads would always make sure that we felt happy and always were in a good mood. They wanted us to enjoy working there, as if it isn't really work."
good,I was able to refine my customer service skills.  I like the flexibility of the schedule.  I also like so much interactions with customers.
good,"my day consisted of office work, I loved my co workers and meet different type of people"
good,"run cash register"
good,great place to work. sad to see gone. treated employees wonderfully
good,"It has been far to long to be of any value.  I don't think they even have commission sales anymore.  When I worked there, they did have ""protected"" sales.  If a person asked for you, even if you were not there, you get the sale.  I didn't make the rule. I just worked there.  They closed the departments I worked in, so I don't think I would work there now.  But that is because they don't have electronics anymore."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job knowing that you help a  happy customer leave the store what something they wanted.
good,its an ok company to work for but not a lot of advancement opportunities
good,"Empresa Estadounidense  con normas y reglas firmes "
good,"I was a hair stylist.  I cut, colored and styled clients hair."
good,Making sure all custoners were satisified. I earned how to meet amd greet newpeople on an everyday basis.
good,This job never had any substance to the job and customers were always lacking.  The managers at the time did not care about their employees or the benefits of the company.
good,"I have been accustomed to working in fast-paced environment with the ability to think quickly and successfully handle difficult clients."
good,JCPenney is dedicated to its employees and their career growth and success.
good,Worked with amazing people who were friends not just co-workers.
good,"While I worked at JCPenneys, the day was fairly productive. I received proper register and floor training so I wasn't completely confused when it was time to get out there on my own. During my time there the most tasking part about the job was making tickets for apparel, since the machines were different parts of the store, and last  minute reshop. The hours were good for me as a part time employee and I had good co-workers to assist me, overall. However, I do believe the company went under new management and made several changes."
good,Good working environment. Great coworkers/friendly staff. Rarely seen managers. Culturally diverse customers. Easy job - little benefits.
good,"Responsibilities"
good,For many years I counted money in the cashroom and did the sales audit.  I had to check on any discrepancies with loss prevention and get results. I was backup for personnel so when she went on vacation it was my responsibility. I also did accounts payable when it was done at the store. Working in retail is all about making the customer happy so customer service is very important. When you had a customer with a problem it was very beneficial when you could get any issues straightened out.
good,"This is a good job to have when you are first getting into the working field of sales. This job teaches the importance of thinking on your feet, team work and the importance of communication and with enough hard work and dedication there is always room to advance"
good,"The job was alright, but the management wasn't as good as other stores I've been to."
good,"Coordinated activity with buying team to ensure proper and efficient merchandise shipment. 	Monitored the flow of shipments through various company vehicles, completed reports, and managed open to buy and retail dollars.	Produced master purchasing orders to meet buyer’s campaigns plans."
good,"Lost their focus and may have done themselves in? Old school company trying to be something they are not and never will be. As a Store Manager they ask a lot of you. Pretty good about time off and benefits, pay is lacking some, not terrible but still lacking the spend to get top talent. One of the reasons I left! District level managers are still from the good ole boy club, hangers on from the old guard that need to go and now! Pressure comes from the top down to meet sales and profit numbers, yet they themselves put you in situations that do not allow you to be successful! Markdowns are astronomical, you could make sales and profit numbers until your markdowns hit and you lost everything. NO bonus and  a ding on your annual review that had NOTHING to do with you! Just really struggling after some really stupid moves and allowing poor top level management to ruin them."
good,"worked with my school hours and i loved that about them, very cool managers"
good,I rang up all customers and would help them apply for store credit.
good,It was a good place. Did all the things associated with a large DC
good,Started working there while in college - good. New upper management seems to be driving the company into the ground... happy I got out when I did.
good,"My job was to clean and re-stock the floor. I learned the right way to fold jeans, shirt and etc."
good,"My location is pleasant"
good,Just a typical job nothing really special about it. Co workers were friendly.
good,it was okay but the managers need to be more open to their associates
good,"It was a lot of cattiness and drama, but I stayed out of it. You have to be very level headed to work there."
good,"Assist customer in the shoe department. Helped managers  "
good,"jcpenny is constantly getting new looks and shipments in, they are constantly hiring new employes"
good,"This was a typical retail experience. This is the job where I learned to communicate with a diverse group of people. The hardest part of this job was working nights and weekends as well as holidays. "
good,I worked here just because I needed the money. I cannot say I put forth my best effort here but that was only because I was young and immature. I know I could have done better.
good,"Mostly all days were different"
good,"•	Cleaned and maintained supplies, tools, equipment, and storage areas in order to ensure compliance with safety regulations. "
good,"A typical day at work involved helping customers by going to get shoes out of the storage room, helping them find shoes on the floor and also ringing out their purchases. If you worked a full 8 hr day you would receive a hour lunch, half a day would be a 30 minute lunch. The JC Penney I was hired at had horrible management. I personally knew how to do more than my department manager. My department (shoes) was always a mess and a frustration because of the poor management. I am thankful for this type of management because I learned how to step up as a leader and ran my department doing the requirements needed. I enjoyed every co-worker in my department. We all got along very well and it made going to work every day much more enjoyable."
good,"Jcp, was ok to work for, It's hard to have a life with the hours. we had great management and some bad management the bad ones were really bad and made hard to want to come to work. I learned a lot. This was a few years ago and with management coming and going it's not going to be the same sometimes it will be good and some times not so good. you have to be able to work with the changes that go on in a big company"
good,"good hours"
good,It was an enjoyable place to work until all of corporate changes and lack of sales. Hours would fluctuate and management were unreliable. The hardest part of the job was dealing with lack of training for new hires. The most enjoyable part of the job was making lasting friendships.
good,Great co workers but they don't let you use you skills to the fullest
good,"A typical day at JCPenny is fun and you stay active assisting customers. "
good,"Very traditional company. Trying to bring in more progressive thinkers, but the culture in some functions are not as easy to adapt as others."
good,"For a time, working for JCPENNEY was an exciting and rewarding experience. As a staple of the American retail environment, the opportunity to grow and advance was desirable. A typical period at work would center around projecting/building sales, developing staff, creating a stimulating shopping environment and, above all, delivering excellent customer service. I was trained to excel at these requirements with the companies through training regiment. The most rewarding aspect of this job has not only been the acquisition of these skills, but the ability to pass them along to my coworkers.  "
good,This is a perfect part time job and/or 2nd job.  The discount was amazing and the schedule was flexible
good,"Manager: responsible for training, mentoring, leading, planning, controlling budgets, associate performance and development; discipline"
good,Needed better workers and knew how to do their jobs. Some managers were good.
good,"We usually maintain the store in proper conditions for the customers.   "
good,I really loved this job. I got to help people shop on the phone. I was very sad when they closed the call center.
good,"In the overall time I was there, I learned it is up to me the worker to ask specific questions concerning the workplace"
good,Great job. Fun when you are young. It's was a good first job. I would work it again but I would have to be in charge.
good,I love my co-workers! We all come together like a family and enjoy what we do. Management has its up and downs but my co-workers are great.

good,"-I would come in, check the line for customers, check the fitting rooms to make sure there was no merchandise in there, then recover everything."
good,most enjoyable was working at the flower nursery and great co-workers
good,When I worked at JC Penny I was in High School so it was good because the hours were flexible and it was a good job for someone who needs a flexible schedule and I don't work there anymore but the co-workers were nice and easy to work with and I learned how to be responsible at this job since it was my first job.
good,"-Engage and lead the team of Service Specialists."
good,"unload the trucks , bring clothes to sales floor , stock racks , go home"
good,the warehouse was too big for management to handle and all of the people so communication was very bad.
good,"My typical day at work is working the fitting room and making sure everything is clean. When the line gets long at the cash registers I have to go up front and help ring up customers. I get along very well with my co-workers and together, we get a lot of things done quickly. The hardest part of the job would be having to constantly clean out the fitting rooms and making sure the floor looks good. The most enjoyable part is when my co-workers and I get everything done."
good,"A typical day includes a fast paced enviroment , and an ability to adapt to varrious different jobs as needed!"

good,"Learned to develop sales and markdown strategy to support promotional and exit strategies at item level"
good,"It's retail, what do you expect.  You don't work retail to get rich.  You work retail to get through school.  No social life, low pay with long hours.  It is what it is."
good,It was a fun job.  I had good co-workers.  The hardest part was standing all day.  The best part was working with the customers.
good,It is an okay place to work but the employee discount and employees are great. The management is really great too!!!!

good,wow what a place to work..nothing like it..such a place..never worked in a place like this since this place and this place ws like no other
good,"My day could be unloading the truck and preparing merchandise to be sold.  It could also be helping customer and other associates on the floor.  Days that I open the store I see that the cash is ready for the beginning of the store businesses day."
good,"would recommend to work there, just seems there is always more things to do, but on the bright side, day goes by fast"
good,"I worked sales, visual, and inventory. I trained other sales associates to assist customers with credit cards , placing orders, and sales. I worked with the managers to set the sales and seasonal merchandise. As well as contacting the local school districts about their uniforms and dress code. I ordered from Levis' denim wear and No Fear clothing companies."
good,I did not like the managment at the job. Bad communication and unfair obligations
good,"This is a fun but tough job. They pay you according how fast you load the trailer which I feel they should just make this  a flat pay rate. I say this because if trailer have a different load size and it may take others longer to load a trailer than some. And when it's hot it's hotter, and when it's cold it's colder in the trailers"
good,I only worked for JCPenney for about four months because I was seasonal and I enjoyed the time I was there. I stayed on the cash register most of the time. The hardest part of my job was when customers argued with me about coupon usage. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers.
good,"A bit of disappointment, when I started  there  years ago...it was a growing company offering good benefits and pay. But over the years, bad management caused  the company to go on a downhill slide, costing a lot of people their jobs and to the remaining employees huge cut to benefits and less hours available for current workers,"

good,retail is a very interesting place to work and meet new and exciting people.
good,This was my first job in 2 year time off for unemployment so I was grateful for it. It was just a seasonal job but it was fun at times. I worked in the jewelry department and sold care plans with the jewelry. Then I was moved to the children's department where I worked as a cashier. My jewelry manager was ok but the other manager was very nice. I learned how to work in customer service and how to sell care plans. The hardest part was selling the care plans because people may not want it. The most enjoyable part was when I went to the children's department and saw all of the babies and kids coming in.
good,"While it's a great salon, having some experience is helpful."
good,i loved working here. it was fun it  was easy and it was enjoyable! if i could do it all over again i most definitely would
good,"when a job was given to me i thought i would be able to do my job without hassle but, i was always being watched like i was 2 years old, management made it seem like i didn't know what i was doing and didn't let me try. they would tell me to do one thing and then they will tell me to do something else and get mad that i didn't finish the first task. they tell you to stop what your doing and help customers but get mad at that as well. so i wonder what am i suppose to do if doing what i was told a problem."
good,"Greeting customer when they arrive and assisting them in finding items they are in search for weather that be in the store, online, or in another JcPenney location. Stocking shelves, ordering supplies, customer services, cash handling,"
good,The environment was decent but the hours were grueling. Almost every other night we wouldn't get out of there until after 1am fixing the store back up. Not too bad but I was a high school student at the time.
good,"Very easy job, fold clothes, empty out the fitting rooms and handle the cash register. Must approach customers at a constant base. can become a bit tedious because supervisors demand that you help customers even when they decline your assistants. On a week day there is barley anything to do, on weekends and holidays expect to work long hours and stay over-time. In general unless its christmas or back to school you will be making very view hours, as little as 20 per week or even less."

good,"I started as holiday PT help, and stayed for almost 2 yrs.  Maybe all retail is this way, but I loved that you never knew what you would walk into.  Helping people find the exact right thing was a joy!  Folding clothes and cleaning up after messy customers was not always a joy, but I liked the change of seasons, and the change of merchandise.   The best part of the job is if you get a good manager.  I loved that when I wanted to take a vacation, I could with enough warning.  I was never denied one."
good,"A typical day at work in Fine Jewelry at JC Penney, Inc. during the Christmas season consisted of showing the public the many different types of fine jewelry and watches that we sold on a salary + commission basis as well as sell jewelry care plans and store credit applications.  I learned that I did not enjoy the competitiveness of the job.  My manager did not offer advice in order for me to succeed in this environment.  My co-workers who were regular staff,  resented seasonal help as they saw us as a threat to their sales and commission.  They did not enjoy the additional competition.  The hardest part of the job was competing for customers with them.  The most enjoyable part was serving the public as well as meeting other seasonal help so that we could give each other feedback and encouragement."
good,"I ensure customers visiting the counter receive a quality service. I do this by making sure the counter is presentable, keeping the shelves properly stocked and being well informed as a salesperson.

good,Nothing to scream about. Pretty regular for a retail job but they are very accommodating!
good,i loved it here but this was seasonal. workers was cool and it was about sell sell sell
good,it was realy fast paced and I enjoyed the workout room and hated the we did not have enough workers at times and that it was realy hoy unloading those realy big trucks
good,i liked working there   for the discounts and for the flexible hrs
good,"Overall jcpenney's is a great work envrionment. You meet new people every day and the customers are always #1. There really wasnt anything hard about the job. Comming in, doing your job, and remainding positive plays a major role in customer service."
good,"I appreciate the opportunity that was offered to at this company by my hiring manager.  However, the company went through many changes while I was there and my job got removed."
good,I enjoyed meeting different people and selling beach oriented products. I became very good at selling.

good,My job at JCP required extensive surveillance via camera. Floor rounds for suspicious activities with customers.  Writing Reports regarding incidents. Some days were busy than others.  I've learned to be sharp and vigilante of my surroundings. I worked well with my co workers.  We backed each other when there were difficult situations handling a suspect. We were team players.  The hardest part of my job was when we caught someone who resisted. The most enjoyable was when I apprehended a suspect.
good,"I worked in the lingerie department for the last five years,  I felt a home in the department and would arrive a look over the department, fill in product and organize, and straighten up. I would walk the floor and greet customers and attend to their needs.  In the lingerie department customers have very personal needs, so I was friendly in a manner that builds trust. I learned a lot about retail during my time at JCPenneys,  I learned the POS system, and how to multi-task.  My co-workers I enjoyed very much as retail people are generally very pleasant humans. Their have been a lot of changes at Penneys  the last couple of years, many people have come and gone so it was challenging at times.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the gratefulness of the customers I served, as I received a great deal of satisfaction from making it a happy experience to shop at Penneys."
good,Easy going workplace. Not enough customers if you are a stylist without clientele.
good,A typical work day was spent monitoring the Social Media pages and reaching out to customers who need assistance. I learned what it takes to resolve customer problems in a timely manner and how to multitask. I worked on multiple projects to improve processes and procedures within the company. The hardest part of the job was staying positive while being hit with negativity from customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was when customers showed appreciation after their problem was resolved to their satisfaction.
good,worked well with my schedule and enjoyed the other employees
good,You meet some amazing people but not enough pay for how much work is needed because it is understaffed. 
good,"A day of work at J. C. Penney's is generally a positive experience. Though, the staff is short, I am able to meet the responsibilities included in my position. I have learned a very good sense of time and people management, by motivating and coaching my team, to do twice as much work in a timely manner. My co-coworkers are very knowledgeable about the company, and there is always success when brainstorming for solutions. Unity and respect are the main factors that exist in the relationship among co-workers. The hardest part of my job is completing tasks, and meeting goals and requirements with half the staff needed. However, the most enjoyable part about the job is working with the customers and meeting their needs, as well as working with other team members to accomplish goals and tasks."
good,Great place to work until you wanted time off. Loved the discouts though.
good,"To whom it may concern,  each day was a learning experience. I enjoyed my job it gave me a chance to grow, my co-workers were grate,., we always work as a team we had each others back management was fine there where no hard parts of my job.

I dont like the concept of working on commission because I would rather get the customer what they wanted and everyday was a competition between employees to get to customers. The hardest part about the job was probably serving people who had bad hygiene as a shoe specialist we were to service the customer to the fullest regardless of the stinch.

If you don't do something the way they want it they will give you attitude. You have to be on top of every little detail even when you have a whole department to yourself or they will make you feel bad. this job would be fine if you got paid more then minimum wage to be a slave.

Management was cooperative and worked with my schedule for school. The co-workers I had while working here are still some of my good friends today, after 15 years. The hardest part of my job was learning the right way to speak to customers by doing it the wrong way first and being reprimanded. The most enjoyable part of the job was the free time I was allowed to do homework for school. "
good,"Overall, JCPenney is a good place to work, but during the past year there have been a lot of changes and not all of them good.  JCPenney has a long up-hill battle to fight in the near future to gain back the loyal customers that the previous CEO ignored.  "

The rest of our time was dedicated to ""setting"" the store as directed per our ""Monthly Set Guide,"" as well as answering customer complaint calls and other miscellaneous work."
good,"Penney's has a great management training program. It is hard work and long hours but pays appropriately. There are many exciting changes planned for the future that could bring the sales around and create an entirely new shopping experience. A great challenge for someone willing to relocate and work hard to rebuild the company,"
good,"Very professional place to work, and it was defiantly a different experience. Some people try and get you do do things when they do not want to. The managers need more communication between each other and whats going on. I wouldn't mind helping out in other departments"

good,"As a Loss Prevention Officer I was in charge of protecting company assets. This entailed theft, fire safety, injuries, and building inventory. I started out loading trucks then moved to Shipping supervisor and finally Loss Prevention. I learned how to really communicate with people and how to work towards a common goal. My co-workers were the best part about working for Jcpenney. We were more like a family than co-workers. The hardest part of the job was it could get a little stale at times. I would try to create ways to keep things fresh. The most enjoyable part was the sense of accomplishment. You had to take total ownwership of the building, as well as, the people inside of it."

We will recover the store and the things that I have learned are communicating better, and working with a team. Got along with co- workers very well never had any drama or bad days at work.

good,loved working with clothes and the employees were awesome.
good,"LOVED my job until the new changes. My co-workers and associates were great and the environment as well.

good,I loved working there management does need some help tho the store manager will go behind everyone's back but its not a bad place to work

good,Pay was below average but I did get a chance to hone my management skills and train employees to better their sales skills
good,"The only issues I had with working here were the inability to advance within the company and some of the management.Initially, I was unable to advance because I went to school and the required hours for an advancement would interfere.

good,"It starts out boring, but by Mid-day it starts to pick up. I learned that some customers can be very arrogant...Some management are alright. The co-worker can be good to work with, but some of them are hard to deal with. When some customers see that you just fixed up the table and they will come right over there and mess them up and look at you, as if to say, Clean it up again, thats your job!!

On the negative side, you get way more hours than you wanted, schedule is out less than a week in advance sometimes, breaks are shortened, they make you stay past your scheduled shift often, and in MY particular location, there is a supervisor with no social etiquette which makes you wonder how he/she even got this position in the first place and why you should even follow their lead."

good,J.C. Penny was a great company with excellent benefits it was too much hard work more of a laid back and everyone work together to get the job done tyoe of job.
good,Nothing special. Typical retail job. Nice as a part-time job.
good,"Enjoy the work and the members of my team, however am not enjoying the new culture...too few people to do the work, too many late hours, and zero job security"
good,Everyone has a function in regards to the job and everyone brings something to the table when there are deadlines to get things done in a timely manner.
good,i wasnt there long enugh to do much but a very fun place to work
good,"As part of my typical day at work, I provided outstanding customer service, performed merchandise recovery, opened credit accounts, and processed all cash register transactions. It was enjoyable to be at."
good,"This was a top choice in my customer service background in terms of experience with a multitude of diverse situations, however, the employees seemed to share an unbalanced sense of work ethic and proffesionalism."
good,"Unload merchandise trucks, sort merchandise, stock merchandise on sales floor, back stock."
good,I am very thankful for the opportunity of working for JCP. I was able to grow from a sales position until I graduated from school and they promoted me to where my training was used. Their jewelry was very challenging most hollow and silver. I learned many new skills from my time here. It's a shame there were layoffs that affected so much of the company and myself.
good,"JCPenney Co. is a outstanding company for young, college grads that would like to develop their managerial skills. The most enjoyable part of the job is immediately seeing the results from the ideas and strategies that you implement. The hardest part of the job is dealing with part-time associates that could care less about the success of the company; however that is the challenge that managers have in developing an engaged team."
good,"A typical day at work is sometimes good and sometimes bad. I learned how to provide the best customer service. The new workers are only hired to pick up the slack of the people that have been there longer. Managemant is understanding of time off for family, but are very unorganized and don't know how to agree or work together on things. Some of the co-workers are unprofessional in looks and character. They don't get along that great. The hardest part of the job is getting big projects done because the long time associates don't help you. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers."
good,it a place to keep money in your pocket not a place to make a career you will ware your body all the way down
good,Hardest part of the job would be the management and their unwillingness to work with an associate. Hard to get around and co-workers created un-happy work space.
good,"I enjoyed learning how to work the merchandise on the pallets like detrashing, sorting, shelving & stocking. The stockroom set up was organized differently than I have been accustomed to so it was frustating sometimes as remembering where all the stockrooms were !"
good,Old management was bad along with the company policy. Do not know how it is now
good,Retail is the greatest place for part time work. I allows for a work/life balance. The hardest part of the job is not knowing if you have one from month to month with the economy. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the associates and customers.
good,I really didn't enjoy going to work. The management alwas had something negative to say and didn't even do our job.
good,working at jcpenny was fun and a fast moving pace especially around christmas time .
good,"Signing, scheduling, forcasting sales."
good,It is a good company to work for but in the store level it is measurable district by district. Levels of advancement have not been seen to a great extent in the last few years yet there has been constant changes.
good,Overall they seem to genuinally care about customer service and go beyond was the industry expects.
good,"working in retail takes a special person, and that sure was not me. JCPenney is a good company to work for, if you like the whole retail thing"
good,Jcpenney is a good place for anyone to work.. They have several departments to work in and good hours.
good,Pleasant place to work. Employees had to work holidays (they were alternating and could usually be worked out between departments and employees in the various departments). Family like atmosphere on holidays. Every employee and supervisor are team players. Worked with the employees if needed certain hours/days off.
good,Allow you to interact with the public and gave you satisfaction to assist people
good,"good sales, I help the people all the time, I work the cahier too."
good,"This company does not supply you with enough hours, money or recognition. The department i worked in was full of lazy employees that got away with everything, not coming into work, skipping out early, taking lunch when not scheduled. etc."
good,"Team environment, close working relationships, advancement possibilities, a chance to learn retail"
good,Jcpenny is all about the customer happy and make sure employees put them first at all times. They are always improving the company to make all their customers happy.
good,"I worked this job while in high school. It was convenient because they worked around school and extra-curricular activities, but paid minimum wage and required little creativity and thinking."
good,"Management changes, depending on the current Management depends on the overall working expericence. Good/Bad"
good,I felt that managerment did not give their staff the props for a job well done
good,"The store I worked for had some of the nicest employees that I have ever worked with. Everyone was very friendly and I felt that there was a lot of camaraderie among the associates. They are very good about rewarding your achievements with praise, treats, food, or certificates. However, I chose to leave because of the poor pay, shaky management, difficulty of advancement and finanacial constraints."
good,Buena compañía. Hay salarios más competitivos en el campo laboral
good,"Working at Jc Penney is a normal job that has its ups and downs. Sometimes is fun and sometimes is very irritating to even be there. It’s not a very cultural place, only a little diverse."
good,"A typical day at work would be to clock in and then head to the registers. Once at the registers, you also monitor the floor. If there are no customers around or headed toward the register then it is your job to go and help reorganize the floor to make it more presentable. If you work closing, you have to stay until the managers believe that everything looks as nice as possible for opening shift, so sometimes you don't leave until 10. Management is okay, there's not enough managers so they all scramble to help all of us. It is also a big deal to sell JC Credit Cards to customers. It is managements' policy that we ask three times and after the third time, if the customer still says no then we take that as an answer. I would usually not get placed on registers because I never made a credit card sale because once I asked and they said no I wouldn't ask again, out of respect. Due to that, managers were usually upset with me, which made it the hardest and most un-enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Job is easy, managers are nice, coworkers are nice. However, pay isn't that great and customers are very snooty. You are required to sell credit cards to people and you get in trouble if you don't sell them."
good,"The manager team is great, however the customers are the hardest part of the job. You do need to have a friendly demeanor when providing customer service"
good,"Being my first job as a student in community college it was a good place to start. Just an average, minimum wage job that works on your customer service. The staff was pretty friendly and the location was convenient, but the store was a mess. The cashiers do all the work in each section of the store including dressing rooms and helping customers on the floor. It was a little overwhelming, but still manageable and keeps you on your toes."
good,Fast paced at times down times there are always thing to do.  Have to be self motivated. Enjoying people interaction is a must at times it can be difficult.
good,"You get opportunity to learn new tools and again it is subjective to your immediate manager. You'll get the initial support from management. However, if the management changes, they'll bring their people to work place. No matter what level of work you do, you get no support. Just follow your manager and leave."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the benefits and flexibility they offer. I have learned a great deal about dealing with the public and fulfilling the customers needs. Every day is different and always able to learn something new.
good,"For my position in the company, the typical day at my work varies each day. Two times a week we unload and process the truck. That means the unpacking of the merchandise we received for the week. On the other days, we are responsible for price changes and the placement of the merchandise on the floor. What I learned from the company is everyone plays a key component for everything to run like a well-oiled machine. From management to the sales associates, to the people behind the scenes. When each succeeds we all succeed. Overall the management treats everyone right but has changed too many times in a short span. To describe the workplace culture I'd say diversity at its best. People from different backgrounds bringing their own qualities to the job. The hardest part of the job is not being able to get everything you need to get done in a short time we are given. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the respect given for each employee"
good,It’s always busy and I learned how to talk to other and control my self my management team was ok it’s was all diverse controls self and communicate I get to meet new people ever day
good,"Not enough hours, job did not last as long as I would have liked.  It was a good work experience the other associates were very nice to work with.  Good learning experience."
good,"I worked in the Fine Jewelry Department. You work on commission, so the more you sale, the more your pay will be. You get paid time and half for working holidays, and I know some people who started working at the same time I did and they bumped up to manager within a few months. Downside is that you work just about every holiday, so you get no time for family, and the customer's at this particular location were pretty rude. There was also a high turn over rate. There were about six people who quiet within the year I was there, and three of them were managers. If a company has that many quieting, then you know they need to improve on job conditions."
good,"Trouble shooting conveyor, tracking, replacing belts, checking sensor alignments, forklift operation, snow removal, replacing gearboxes, end rollers modifying conveyors"
good,"Assigned tasks are simple and coworkers are nice. The managers seemed a little two-faced, not sure what's going on there. Job security just isn't there. The only way to keep your job is to get customers to apply for the JCP *CREDIT* card, which is difficult to do (since it is a Hard Inquiry that will lower your credit score)."
good,"A nice place to work, the hardest part was standing on your feet and not having comfortable shoes on and having to do recovery at the end of the night. The atmosphere and coworkers were pleasant to work with and didn't mind guiding the new comers like myself."
good,"A typical day at work would be managing the floor, making sure all items are in the correct areas. Helping out customers with purchases and returns. Not only did I help with purchases, but also finding items in stores at different locations."
good,I loved everyone I worked with but things did get quite crazy at times in the store and it’s hard to do the work of three people when you are just one person.
good,Some of the managers were pleasant to work with while others weren’t. Co-Workers were great and make you feel welcomed. Overall not a bad job to work at.
good,"Company has strong reputation and history, but having difficulty reinventing itself.  Great opportunity to work hard and have fun with great employee discounts."
good,How to work the dot com desk. How a jcp credit card program works and the benefits of having it. How to find items in the back for online in store pickup
good,"Was a okay first job, i meet plenty of new people and learned how to handled different situations. The holiday hours are too crazy & also the recovery time was long most nights."
good,"If you’re looking for a simple job, a people person, and minimum wage apply here. I would categorize it as an after school job and maybe a little more. nothing special"
good,"My experience at JCPenney was not the best. It was my shortest lasting job. No room for growth, no organization, lots of unnecessary drama, & unfair schedules."
good,"Long story short, the manager basically told me im not a good employee. They told me i wasnt a good fit. I greeted customers and tried getting Icaps and findmores but i wasnt too successful. In womens most of the customers had credit cards. Aside from that I asked every single customer unless they were paying with their jcpenney card.  Some coworkers and supervisors talked abt me behind my back. I oaid attention and saw how many employees greeted each and every customer"
good,"JC Penney's can be considered to be one of the ""better"" retail jobs that one can be employed by. The experience that you have at any JC Penney's is almost completely dependent on management. When management communicates with each other and can create plans for associates to follow, then things are wonderful. But when management does not communicate with each other, it can be very chaotic for other associates."
good,"The managers were pretty nice but as a whole between all associates and managers, it wasn't as connected as it could've been. Also communication and scheduling needs work. Some associates would have to work the register and recover their department by themselves. This caused problems being able to get everything done before closing. Better communication is also needed, they have morning meetings before opening and people who don't have opening shifts sometimes miss important info and never get told later."
good,This company does not give good training to much responsibility with out good training do not give things required for job no assistance with jobi did not like working for company but managers did a good job
good,It’s a fun enjoyable work place you can get close to customers. Sales and commission help with that the management tends to help out when they are needed
good,"JCPenney is a great company to work for if seeking benefits. They offer a great 401k plan, medical, dental, and vision coverage. There is also a great employee discount that can be combined with other coupons."
good,"The management at my location could hardle answer questions, for example if I was asking about holiday pay for a specific holiday my management would almost never know. Our store hasn’t been remodeled since 1973 when it was built and it isn’t the safest or cleanest environment. Our freight elevator permit experience over a year ago and a lot of this is out of our management teams hand so I would say the company itself is more profit driven than customer and associate driven."
good,"- Good place to work when you're in high school or college. I got hired here at 17. My availability was pretty open but was only schedule about 16 hrs a week, my check ranged from $200-300 but never exceeded that except during the holidays. "
good,"Work typically begins with unloading merchandise at the shipping dock, and then I begin to sort and transport those items that should be placed on the floor in store. We then check to see what needs to be restocked and we also look for defective merchandise. This continues through the day until the work day ends. The hardest part of the job involves carrying signs and tables and chairs. The most enjoyable part consists of helping customers."
good,Jcp offers a great employee discount on most items in the store. Most of the managers are fun and upbeat. Pay is somewhat a drawback and basically there are no benefits for employees unless you work over 35 hours. Most sales folks work from 20 to 30 hours .
good,"It's a very active job, I had great co-workers. Honestly, I was lucky, I had heard lots of horror stories of past managers and other workers. What makes our breakers this specific job title are those you work with in your department and management. Because the pay is not something you can really settle with."
good,"As for the work experience, it went great, met a few good people, learned to communicate a lot more and how to work the registers. A typical day at work would either be slow or fast like any other job and there really wasn't a hard part of the job, for the enjoyable part, I think having some pretty good and funny conversations with costumers were the best. I just think the hiring/training process is the part where it was just all over the place. At first I was originally applying to Sephora inside Jcpenney because I'm obsessed with makeup and thought it would've been an ok experience and a good start for a first job which is another story. But when I arrived for my second day of training I was sat down and told to go on this program thing and watch a bunch of videos that were listed on the page.... thing is... the videos that were listed were about Jcpenney and only 3 were somewhat about sephora. I was a little confused since there was another girl who was also applying to Sephora but was given a sheet of paper with specific videos to watch. I then found out that it was her third day so I thought well im only on my second day maybe i'll get the paper the next day. N o p e. On my third day I was put on the floor for sephora but ended up getting assigned to do 'recovery' for Jcpenney for just that day which I didn't mind because I was very confused and not prepared at all and recovery was simple.  After working like 2 days a week I decided to switch to Jcpenney, thankfully my experience with that was much better, and luckily there was a nice lady there who decided to let me watch"
good,"My favorite part of the job was working with my fellow associates. They treated me like family. The minimal hours and pay became too much to manage my expenses, so now I am searching for a new job. I enjoyed getting to know the customers. The more they showed up to JCPenney, I would slowly begin to reognize them. The hardest part of the job was pushing credit every single day. I felt like my customers looked at me like I was a robot because of how I asked every single person in line to sign up for a JCPenney credit card. With that being said, once you are able to initially connect with the customer, asking for credit is much easier to do. I learned a lot about discipline at this job. As an associate, you listen to the customer. If they get upset, you hear them out and then call over a manager for help. No matter how unruly or ridiculous the situation seems, always stay calm and just listen and try to solve the problem as smoothly and quickly as possible."
good,"Appliance customer care seems be a failure."
good,"Overall it was a decent experience. As long as you do your job and work at a good pace you will be fine. Management, however, was poor with their scheduling. Scheduling and working the register is the main reason most people leave because of the heavy demand to sell cards."
good,"Good retail work space for younger adults. However not a ""forever"" place of employment. Very understanding when it comes to working shifts  and hours needed."
good,It is a fine company to work for. I really wouldn't recommend it though because of all the issues with the higher ups in the company only look at how many credit card applications the employees get when deciding on who to give hours to.
good,J. C. Penney’s is a very fast paced business when dealing with customer’s needs and satisfaction. There are lots of incentives to have fun with everyday plans such as dressing up for particular holidays. Making each day of one week something different to wear during the Christmas holidays. There are rewards for a job well done. There are holiday meals served for Thanksgiving and Christmas.
good,It's a place to work if you like helping others. Fast pace service and great work. Kind of work you have to be able to have help others . I would love to see you then
good,During special holidays (especially working for the Christmas holiday season) they provide lunches and/or dinners for the employees working those times. I do enjoy working with the stylists (they are a GREAT bunch of young women) and I have a fantastic boss!!  I do love the interaction that I have with our clients.
good,"As a Part-Time is a great Job with excellent co-workers, really greatful and helpful people among the way. No doubt that this job is a good one to start off since it challenges you to become competitive and more focused person."
good,I loved working at JcPenny. The managers were very nice and easy going when dealing with new workers. The workplace was a very calm and collective scene.
good,Part time hire on. Flexible schedule and nice manages but no room to be hired on for full time. I actually like working there but the lack of hours is going to end up being a deal breaker.
good,I didn’t hate it but i don’t miss it. It’s low pay and they really push on getting people to sign up for their card so it’d get annoying. They are very strict with breaks and lunches especially on holidays
good,A typical day at work would consist of going into fitting rooms and folding clothes that are unfolded on the tables before open and while where are open. Management is a little poor and unorganized lately.
good,I was with JCP SSC for over 17 years if i could have transferred into a department that would been better on my body and did not have strobe lights I may still be there there.  For some reason it was really hard for me to transfer.  They always said if your good at your job they wont let you go.
good,"The work place is good depending who is yoir supervisor. Some encourage you while other expect you to finish your job. They dont recognize your work most of the time. Its stressful sometimes to see alot of clothes and see people can be so dirty, not cleaning after themselves."
good,Good  job  beside its  closing   leaving many  without a  job  .  I  wish not  to o share  any more on this   company.  However  Im  thankful  for the  experience .
good,This is not the best place to work. The manger in my opinion are very unprofessional. The hiring manger was very rude. The employees there are nice. Well some of them. It’s always busy so there is something to do
good,"Job is boring at times, not enough hours and job schedules change too much. They've called me a couple times just to tell me I don't have to work and I actually want to work so their hours are not good, plus they make you stay after without overtime."
good,"While I loved the atmosphere and the teamwork, I was hired for seasonal photographer, and was kept almost strictly on retail which damaged the point of why I applied in the first place. I learned nothing about photography, and since it was closer to the holiday season, I wasn't able to see the kindness and happiness the job had to offer because everyone was stressed, and it was so crowded it only added to the unwelcome ""no one is here for me to make sure I know what I'm doing"" new-hire feeling."
good,"I felt as if I were being deliberately kept in a certain area in the store, while other people who were always calling in or showing up late would get supervisor positions. I was quietly kicked out of the pricing team, because they wanted an ""all female team..."""
good,Until new management came things were great. They treated us like slaves and didn’t want to pay us right. Nor did they put people in positions that belonged in them. Too many favorites
good,Jcp is a good job for students or people looking for part time work. Schedule is very flexible and the pay is minimum. Not a place to try and advance unless you obtain a bachelors degree you won’t get far.
good,Liked the people I worked with at two different locations. There does not seem to be much room for advnacment. The yearly assessments felt too cookie cutter and too focused on credit applications (despite not working a register). I would’ve liked more personal criticism to help me grow. Hours for part-time were very random. One week I could work almost 30 hours then the next under 10 hours. This made it hard to rely on the income for anything.
good,"The only thing that made me switch job to Dillard's was the hours.  JC Penney did not offer full time job.  The benefit was not as good as Dillard's, but the environment was good."
good,Satisfying place to work. They could offer more benefits for part timers. The workload could be less for the amount of people taking on the task.  More help needed sometimes.
good,"A typical day would depend on whether I had a opening shift, mid-day shift, or closing shift. For an opening shift I would clear off anything that was left on the cash wrap and prepare the opening of the till for the day. Mid-day and closing shifts is a lot of tidying of the store and putting items back where they belong. There were many times where my co workers didn't want to do their part to keep our store in shape. Most of the people I worked with were friend people. Most of my supervisors and managers were helpful and encouraging, but was not able to provide guidance to excel at becoming leadership."
good,"There was no typical day at work. I learned every position by fire         ( which means no or very little training), for procedures were forever changing. What I learned was that I was good at redefining my position whatever it was. I was able to take each new position and turned it into a well-run operation that other stores and management came to me for questions. The management was forever changing that was the hardest part for they were willing to relive past mistakes without asking if it had been done before and what was the result."
good,I haven't worked retail since I was in high school and that was many years ago. Nothing has changed in regards to the associate still having to pick up after customers and some team members who work and those that don't.
good,"Working here was pretty stressful and demanding if you are not a morning person and choose to do stocking with this company. The truck shipments would get pretty difficult during the holiday seasons and those trucks can get pretty hot pretty quickly, but overall the pay did feel fair for the amount of work I was putting in."
good,"Working with different computerized systems is very interesting simply because you can do adjustments, place orders & open up multiple screens to see customer's financial information & assist them with anything that if they can't do we can assist."
good,"Overall the company is not bad, Just the management needs a lot of communication and needs to be on task. Due to issues from time to time, managers doesn't help much when their employees are going through difficult."
good,"The workload is typically doable during the day with very little stress."
good,"I was hired for the Christmas season, I worked as a cashier, sales associate. They had great employee discounts, and was a well run store that I worked in."
good,"Jcpenny was great to work if you don't need alot of money. This is not a job were you are able to keep up with rent, bills, etc.. They give you very few hours. The only time you might get alot is for big events like black friday."
good,The work environment is OK. Policies are strict depending on your supervisor. The Milwaukee plant is closing permanently nut they have set in place a lot of things to accommodate us who will be affected by the closure.
good,"I was a sales associate.  Mainly I worked in the women's department, either in fashion jewelry or in the fitting room. Working with people as always been something I enjoyed.  So working in the fitting room was great.  The hardest part of the job was standing on my feet for long periods of time, because I used a cane and a chair in the fitting room would have been welcoming."
good,"working at jcpenny was okay, the workers were cool, the managers were okay they just were kind of strict and made work a harder than it should of been at times, but all in all it was okay"
good,JCPenney is great for flexible hours and working in a fast paced environment with some great co-workers. The work can be difficult if not enough co-workers are scheduled on a shift but giving great customer service is very rewarding.
good,"I was in charge of running the men's department by myself for the most part. Sometimes, they would move me to the kid's department. I had to fold clothes, clean dressing rooms, organize racks on the floor, and work the cash register."
good,"Busy sales enviroment.  Good training and nice employees. Wanted to"
good,"The GM is very unpredictable she will tell you one thing and than turn around and forget what she said, or act like she don't remember what she told you or denies it."
good,Would say bewear of hours being cut working thanksgiving mamangers taking their time to get change for your till also having to stay over the scheduled time that you are to be off
good,The place is a very fun work environment most of the time but you dont get holidays off a lot they are open on thanksgiving and christmas eve. Co workers were great and there was all the time some kind of work party going on in the break room (we were well fed) but just doesnt pay enough to support a family.
good,"Company was ok, I was supposed to be full time but every week my hours would get cut more and more, there was a disconnect with other retail employees for some reason."
good,"Learned a great deal about fine jewelry.   Didn't like how the schedule always changed.  Never worked the same hours.  Hours could and did change up to a few days before.  Couldn't plan a life."
good,"In my opinion a typical day at work is interesting because I need to interact with people everyday. I learn costumer service skill, how can understand and do everything good for a costumer. The most enjoyable part of the job is have a good time and conversation with a costumer."
good,i dont remember working here it was a long time. i cant say much. i guess it was a good play to work it was temporary thing. retail will be retail. the people i worked with was nice
good,"Many different roles are played as an associate here, a lot of rotating in store to different departments, job is fast paced but is easy and enjoyable."
good,Great place to work. Formed great relationships with management and also learned a lot about customer service. They take care of their employees who work hard.
good,"My number one priority was to the customer and meeting their needs, working with the new products that came in. doing the new displays and learning from my manager."
good,It's a great place to work for a lot  of chances for advancement great culture great management reasonable hours great benefits friendly atmosphere and you can learn new jobs
good,"Great place to work, if you like no structure and being mislead on what your role is and advancement opportunities. Management are all over the place and that's coming from the corporate level. Incompetent company that will soon be out of business."
good,Was a good place to work but did alot of things that didnt pay enough. Flexible schedule considering my kids were heavily in sports and had no one to pick them up from practices and/or leagues.
good,I was as a cashier. I would like talk and help people and have a conversation with them. I am a social person and happy in my life.
good,JCPenney is a great place to work but can get very hectic around the holidays. It is a huge store and there i always something that needs to be done within the store. I can say that on most days the management can be bad. I was not giving enough hours either.
good,It was okay to work for them it was just so far away from my home. Get in clock in and discounts on clothes was great but you have to make sure you have reliable transportation.
good,I loved my job and few of the supervisors i worked with made a great team. I enjoyed coordinating the floor moves and working with people. I was busy all the time. I had a continuous list everyday. I liked teaching people how to do things. The only thing i did not like was poor communications with the management. They were not on the same page and did not communicate what they expected from you. I have a strong work ethics and at times it was hard to work with people who didn't have the same drive. But i liked the dynamics i had with the supervisors- we worked well together even when we disagreed.
good,"It wasn't a bad job, pretty decent if you're looking for a side hustle or something to fit your life schedule. I did not get that many hours but it was something that kept money in my pockets."
good,You spend most of your time getting yelled at by customers and there are often times when your department is understaffed. The quality of the job really depends on who you work with.
good,The company has recently gone through changes that have made the store feel chaotic.  All hourly employees and supervisors have totally different job duties.  The moral is low among employees.  Employees that have been their for years want to quit.
good,It a good work environment I liked my managers. Thy should pay the temps more cause thy have to live also. But they did have a cafeteria that was nice.
good,"When I first graduated high school working as a sales associate at JCPenney was my first job. It's a great place to start because the people who work there are great and they work really well with your schedule. "
good,it was a nice place to work but im not sure why i have to write a review on this job. I Didn't mind the work i minded the lack of set hours and communication.
good,"Atypical day at JCP would be morning meeting to go over yesterday's goals and whats expected for the current day. I learned how to be accountable, determine and teamwork. The management was good at times. Some encouraged the team to do well and to continue to display great customer service. The culture was good in my opinion due to the different ethnics background that worked there. The hardest part of the job would be holidays, specifically Christmas because the rush of customers. The enjoyable part is the celebration days we have such as pot lucks."
good,"I worked at JCPenney for 9 months. Great first job, they really work with you and your schedule. Associates are very friendly, established great bonds with our customers. Disorganized, the work you put into it was not worth the pay."
good,It was a wonderful company to work for in the beginning.  When New management took over after my being there for 8 yrs it wasn't.  Many things happened and I no longer work there.
good,store managment not supportive of asset protection efforts. only interested in day to day store functions. difficult to complete job tasks with support
good,"Early start and early leave.  Not very difficult job, but not very flexible with hours. Fellow employees were great to work with.  Management was nice and accommodating."
good,In my case was my first job and I have the opportunity of development during 9 years. I started as a part time associate and I was promoted to few positions in the company.
good,"I enjoyed being able to create memories that will last a lifetime for families.  With this job, you must posses patience, creativity and understanding.  This job was challenging at times but wouldn't trade the experience for the world."
good,"I leaned time management, as well how to measure segment height, point of sale operation.  I also learned how to scheduled patient appointments as well as customer satsifaction."
good,They dont pay well at all but if you’re just looking for a few hours through out the week then this is perfect. Would recommened to people who attend school.
good,"They teach you what you need to know, and they trust you to do your job. They very much want you to get pepole to sign-up for the JcPenny Credit Card, almost more so than actually providing customer service."
good,"Excellent benefits, but high turnover. Great headquarters facility. Normal organizational friction associated with large staff changes, adoption of different corporate cultures from new hires, and team formation."
good,"I do have a great time working at jcpenny with all of the other employees, however I don’t really get that many hours therefore don’t really get payed."
good,"My typical day at work would consist of picking and packing online orders that customers had bought online. By picking, I mean taking one of the fabric shopping bags and looking throughout the store for the item the customer is ordering. Then I would take the orders back and put them one by one into boxes to later be packed. I also have to take care of the front register, which consists of giving customers their orders from the stock room and delivering it out,or returning their items and handling the payment method. What I've learned since I started working for JCPenney are: opening and closing registers, transferring calls, how to use a walkie-talkie (it was kind of obvious), and how to work for something. Things around the workplace were always relaxed we didn't really have employees so high-strung that they wanted to rip their hair out, but sometimes it go quite busy. The management were always kind and wiling to help out even if they always looked busy, they would talk to you and make friends with you and ask how you were doing.The hardest part of the job just so happened to be one of the required things to do. Picking was especially hard on me because I have Scoliosis and they don't exactly make braces for your upper back. It was made worse when the pain went to my hips and down my legs, but I would continue because my job wasn't done. On the other hand, the most enjoyable part of my job was the fact that when I am packing people's orders, I don't have to talk to anybody. Overall JCPenney is a good company to work for, you get a GREAT discount."
good,"Very good people and very fun to work with, the management was also nice.  There was a lot of different activities for the employees, great place to know people and to get better at customer services."
good,"A typical day at work for me was very smooth, I learned how to manage customer service, managers were great . Hardest part of my job was getting mean customers and having to clear out the waiting line as soon as possible."
good,"The people and staff that come through/work here are wonderful. The product is also a nice quality, but the atmosphere can be stressful sue to staffing problems. As well as overstocking the floor within the smaller braches."
good,JCPenney made it possible for me to work and complete 18-21 hr semesters. They have great flexibility for schedule from 4:30 a.m.-9:30 p.m. without the slave driving 24 system.
good,"very interactive, productive. Able to cross train. I enjoy my job, but it is very stressful during the holidays. Customers can be a bit rude. Lack of management."
good,Unless you are in a management position then this is just a high school job. I did not learn much. Management was not seen but heard and felt. Hardest part of the job was recovering a busy area. The most enjoyable part was the discount.
good,"Is a fun place to work for few hours a day, good supplement second job with employee discount. Night shift always get the end of the stick. When business is slow you won't get to work your full scheduled hours."
good,"At the time that I was working at JCPenney's, I was also working at the Knott County Water and Sewer District. As a source of extra income, the job served its purpose. The best part of the job was the workers and environment. CEO issues at the time caused the company to do layoff's."
good,Great company for those with patience and will take the initiative to learn the fast paced retail industry. Great work culture and great home office benefits and office location.
good,"there ok to work for if you need a flexible work schedule, depending on management and management changes every so often. from the time ive started and finished Ive had 3 different managers"
good,typical day varies as far as the past. i thought management was okay. the hardest part of the job was not knowing what your hours were going to look like. the most enjoyable part of the job was being able to dress comfortably.
good,Was an enjoyable job had lots to do staff was amazing costumers were my favorite part of the day always something to do and helpful teammembers to assit at any time
good,"JCPenney is a great company but the associate is the one that carries the brunt of the workload. Never enough time to get everything done, but it still needs to get done."
good,This place use to be good when I first started working here.  This was my first job in high school.  All the managers that I had worked really well with my schedule.  Holiday hours absolutely suck!
good,The hours were okay until I got them cut. Weekdays were smooth to work. During the weekends and holidays it gets super busy and hectic. Schedule was not flexible as they claim it would be.
good,"This was my first job ever, taught  me everything I needed to know about responsibly. It was a great experience, I spent 5  years working with them, very grateful"
good,"I worked in JC Penny Potraits in Annapolis and Glendale Mall and most days were slow. However, when the energy did pick up, it was very lively. I mostly took pictures of children and newborns or large families. It was summer time and most people take their pictures during the holidays, so the days were really long with very few customers."
good,"The work was during the Winter Holidays, and summer, for 2 years, during the school year. It was both a successful,learning, and enjoyable experience."
good,"Catalog Department is a nice job to work at. The tasks are easy and once you get a hold of things, it becomes a non stressful job. The only thing that should be improved is the management."
good,"I like what I do, I love the customers. It is overall a good job. Sometimes the managers was not their to help you. I was doing manager responsibilities and was not getting paid for it. I feel I was treated unfair. I hate to leave because I had the best co-workers. I am just tired of the way I am treated."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is, when you get to know your coworkers, your customers, you work as a team with your coworkers, and get to know each other more then just coworkers."
good,"It is a little slow getting started in the salon.There are tools in place to do good at JCPenney salon, but you have to work at building a clientele. They do run ads to get people through the door.you get an hourly base pay with the chance to make more via commission."
good,"Good work environment. Needs more thorough training for management. Not confident in corporate leadership, seems as they don't have a direction in place for the future. Seems to be going in all different directions."
good,JCPenney is a great company but the pay is horrible. I was promoted after six months with the company but never received my raise or promised PTO for months after performing the new job.
good,The thing I liked about this job was that I was constantly changing what my duties. Some days I would organize shelves. Some days I would clean out the dressing room and re-zone. Some days I would measure for suits.  It was nice to change it up.
good,"With low budgets workers are spread thin and managers expect three times the work out of each person no matter what, but luckily most times other coworkers will help you when they can."
good,"Easy going. Heavy lifting. At a pace in which you want to work. friendly environment. learned to use a pallet jack"
good,"My first job and I was 16, I worked very early mornings. They kind of switched me around departments so I didn’t really get to learn the store very well. Clean and nice environment, sweet employees."
good,The job atmosphere was good. Being in furniture sales allowed me to meet with various types of people to get to know what type of furniture they were truly interested in purchasing.
good,I was sale support so not to many customers but I did like the facts that I walked around a lot the people was nice there but some people took there job too serious
good,I worked there collectively for 14 yrs. Great environment to work in especially for teens looking for their first job or single mothers who need flexible hours.  I would still be employed there but the store I worked in closed.
good,You always had something to do. Very competitive. Always able to learn new things.  Management was always willing to help employees out when they were in need
good,Payroll cuts required me to do the work formerly handled by 3-4 people. Hours were not promised and therefore my benefits were in peril. It would not be a bad place to work for a second job as most of the employees are very friendly.
good,I consider my experience was okay working there. The mangers was nice and understanding to help. My coworkers were outgoing. The hardest part was closing because cleaning up was a task on it's own. The environment was definitely relaxed  but we got the job done effectively and I like that the most.
good,"Typical day at work would be doing go-backs meaning putting clothing back that was left in fitting rooms or clothes misplaced in certain departments. The busiest times are solely holidays only. This means days such as Fathers Day, Mothers Day, Black Friday, Back to School and certain times in December. Other than those days, the store is completely slow. Very slow, hours get cut roughly. During holidays is when you get the most hours. Even the most hard-working associates go unnoticed at times. I believe the co-workers and managers were the best part of working here. I wouldn't blame the managers for what goes wrong in the store but more the bigger guys that handle the corporation."
good,"A typical day at work for a cashier is clocking in and then going to the front, and some days there is a long line that you have to keep working through, and some days it's so dead that you have to find things to do. The management wants you to get credit card applications more than anything else, so make sure you ask and keep asking everyone you ever ring up so that they know all the benefits of the card and get those ICAPs! You might have the nicest customers in the world who are sweet and understanding, or you might have someone who doesn't understand that some coupons and sales don't go exactly as they thought and will make you get a manager for something small. It all depends on how you handle it, though. If you are helpful and work well with them, and understand what you are doing, you are fine. Make sure you have red shirts and dress pants/skirts/dresses/blouses/shirts for work-you'll always be expected to dress professionally except on weekends where you are allowed to wear a solid red t-shirt and jeans. No sneakers/tennis shoes allowed unless you have a doctor's note. Dress shoes only-not necessarily heels, just nice shoes. Usually there is not a consistent 9-5 M-F schedule-they'll schedule you on your available days as they need, so you could come in at 9:45 a.m. on one day and 5:00 p.m. the next day you work. Ask off for any days you need off in advance. Be ready to stand in one spot for a few hours at a time-you may move from one end of the register counter to the other, and you do bag purchases and put things in return areas, but other than that, unless you're on"
good,The store I worked in was very nice. The co-workers were friendly.The employees benefits were average.Management was accommodating with work schedule.  This store was closed due to low sales.
good,"I got along great with my coworkers and managers, but everyone was always overwhelmed due to not having enough people on the floor.  Whenever we would get new employees they would stop showing up after a couple weeks."
good,Company has excellent core values. But some of the managers do not fully apply them. There are many good opportunities within the company. But the climate is changing.
good,"under paid its experienced employees and paid more to younger people just joining the company at college age, also when asked to be compensated for my experience was told that the company wouldnt allow managment to give me more then the 20 somethings."
good,Working at JCPenney is a fun side job not a place to be if you are looking for a lifelong career. Working at JCPenney you can work on perfecting customer service skills.
good,"A typical day at JCPenney was different throughout seasons and different events that would be going on. During the Christmas season, a typical day at work would be fast and I would constantly have something to do, but during off season a typical day would be slow and boring and it would be hard to keep myself occupied."
good,"JC Penney is a stable, dependable company.  A typical day on the sales floor for a sales associate consists of cashiering tasks, stocking and organizing merchandise, recovery and fitting room maintenance, and always giving excellent customer service.  A typical work day for a Manager/Supervisor is divided into maintaining your designated area of responsibility, helping the entire store with customer service needs, and back office duties."
good,"I enjoyed my time here and the skills I developed in my time there. Unfortunately, the pay isn't very competitive and advancement is slow. Also, the politics make it hard to get promoted."
good,It is a close nit group but you will be always feeling like there is so much to do and never enough time to do it.  Being part time is hard do to always having a shortage in hours.
good,"I worked for JCPenney portraits, so really this is Lifetouch management and not JCPenney. The manager was alright, pretty stereotypical as managers go. A little scary, sometimes nice, often helpful, certainly moody. The district manager was a nightmare, however. The worst part of the job was when she came to visit. I also didn't like the up-and-down amount of work hours. Some weeks I worked nearly every day, some weeks I'd work four hours the entire week."
good,"Daily task with floor presentation, assortment of merchandise, purchasing procedures."
good,This place had an active sports center where you can play ping pong or use a treadmill. Had a nice ping pong match most of the time when I wasn't working.
good,work all the time sometimes 10 hours on your feet not stop. i personally did not like the job. it just wasn't for me at all. the hours changed with a day notice
good,Really easy and laid back. Hardest part is finding something to do once there are no customers and everything is straightened. It's a lot of standing around.
good,"Honest opinion about JCPenney. The company needs organization and managers that treat their employees with respect. I enjoyed meeting new people. I worked for three managers total during my employment with JCPenney. Only one of them cared about people and the other two would disrespect the team, but nothing was ever done about it by the District Manager. Both of them had numerous complaints and both still have their jobs."
good,The Management team will put a lot of pressure on you about making customers to apply for credit cards. And also about making sells. You work more than you get paid.
good,"Whether reviewing sales, analyzing and acting on business trends or creating Excel spreadsheets to assist my team(s), my days were busy.  I also enjoyed training both interns and management trainees for the past several years"
good,"good local management. not as good at national level."
good,"great job for experience"
good,"Working as a sales associate was not too bad. The workload was relatively easy. Maintaining a department could be annoying at times with the amount of clothes thrown around, but its not too bad. You do have to deal with people a lot, so if that is not for you, then you should look for somewhere else. The hours were alright, I wish I had gotten more. Management overall was not too bad as long as you were doing your job. The nice part is that the sales discount is nice and the workload is relatively easy. The negative is that there is not a lot of room to grow and raises are few. Overall its a great first job, but if you are looking for something more advanced, then you should look elsewhere."
good,"This service center is now closed and was a great experience, This was a production driven center, we took catalog phone orders and resolved customer problems."
good,JC Penney for me was a stressful place to work at as there was a little too much work needed to be done. But they give many hours and the pay is not bad
good,"its a good first job not too demanding, and you get to interact with many people. not really stressful except for during the holiday season. overall had a great first job experience."
good,"Overall it was an ok place to work. Hard to get hours. It was like feast or famine, one week you'd get 5 days the next 1 or none. It became competitive in the fact that you were supposed to get so many people to sign up for a credit card and so everyone was trying to get to the register to ask the customer first and so that became stressful."
good,"Productive workplace, always something to do to stay busy. Organized system and the other emloyees are always looking to help. Management on the other hand is a little corrupt."
good,"First day on the job we were thrown into work that was not demonstrated or taught to us, just expected of us to know how to do such things. Quite unprofessional."
good,Not very fun. I didn't like going to work. Supervisors where somewhat mean. They expected thing to be done without them telling you what they wanted to be done. It is not the best place to work.
good,"JC Penney was a great place to work for the benefits and flexible hours, however especially after some stores started shutting down and employees were transferred from store to store, it got a little hectic. I found that there were some people who truly loved working there (and some had been there for 20+ years) and others seemed like they just wanted an easy paycheck. There were a lot of issues with under-staffing which frustrated both employees and customers, and several of the younger employees didn't seem to have much of a work ethic (many would shop around, stand around and talk, or be on their phones while there were lines behind the counter). Management didn't really do anything after numerous complaints from multiple individuals. The great side of the job was, though, that there are great employee benefits and you meet some of the nicest and most interesting people. It's hard work, but it is rewarding when you get to help and get to know your customers."
good,"Covered two districts and five states. Hired as LP District Manager  also assumed District Operations Manager position. Learned the retail business through a different perspective. Workplace culture strived to be fast, fun and accomplish corporate goals at the same time."
good,"Helping customers place online orders while offering other products that may compliment their selection,also helping customers with any trouble they ate having with credit card, and also taking customers payment."
good,"This is just a job, it is fun and usually interactive and management tries their best to keep moral high. There are not a lot of advancement opportunities. A lot of college students work here due to them being flexible with your schedule."
good,"On your feet, high energy, it goes by fast. The worse thing is they only hired per temp agency so there was no real job security or benefits. In addition they would move you around the facility so sometime you aren't as stationary or you go to a new department and work on different items than you were previously."
good,My first commission/base pay job. Great experience. Never saw myself as a sales person before. It was a chance for me to discover things I didn't think I had. Day to day was getting customers in buying a piece of jewelry that would represent them. Convincing customers of that purchase. Dealing with objections. Making it possible for customers to buy even on credit. (Opening JCP Credit Cards)  We also changed batteries and customized watch wrist bands. Monthly goals of sales was a bit of a hassle. Especially when you had the folks with more experience. Great co workers always helping you. It was a bit of a competition. Especially in Glendale with a big Armenian population. The language was a bit of a barrier and also the culture. Armenians would lean more towards their folks (who spoke the language).
good,"I really enjoyed working here. I was a temp during the Black Friday-Christmas season. The other employees were nice and we had some fun. One of the downsides was how much they cared about pushing their credit cards. Yes I know it is a big part of their business but they told us during training to push the card until the customer left. I had customers get very upset with me when I tried to push the card after they said no over 3 times. I was not brought back after the season because I did not sell enough of the cards to meet requirements. I was quite sad because I loved this job and worked very hard, Black Friday I worked the women's department alone for 4 hours and that is no an easy task. My managers spoke highly of me and I even had a few return customers. But because I didn't sell a credit card a day I was not hired back."
good,"I loved working here. I do believe that some wanted the best for their employees. Sometimes i believe there were to high of expectations towards employees. I often had to work by myself and was expected to do the amount of three people and in retail, that is a lot. All aside, this is a great company to work for."
good,"This company has a very generous discount for associates. I enjoy working  with the public and fellow associates. A typical day, we are busy but very understaffed.  They have three different  dress codes."
good,I got my schedule each week if I request a day off you sometimes would not get it or they just forgot and you had to remind them. I usually got the hours I didn't like which was usually 1PM to 9PM they would give the good hours on the weekend to their full time regulars. If you had a day off you can almost bet they would call you to come in.
good,I worked at JcPenney twice over a span of almost 2 years. I took a few months off to go home for the summer while I was in College. Getting a job in a college town almost guarantees that you will be given very few hours but there was usually the opportunity to stay longer if you were needed. The management was friendly and helpful for the most part. It has been a long time since I have worked there and I am sure the atmosphere has changed because of all the changes in the company over the past few years.
good,it was an ok job..it helped me maintain my household and it taught me how to pick certain items for certain stores. this job gave me the skill set I need just incase I run into another picker job
good,"A typical day at work involves opening up the registers. I would open the door for clients before store hours. I book appointments and clean the salon during the day. Then, I would call to confirm the stylist appointments. I was responsible for learning the new system."
good,This was your average retail job. Very dull and repetitive. The management was very fun and easy to tak to. Nothing really stands out about working here.
good,"The job involves leading sign changes, merchandising, and inventory maintenance. Workplace culture is lax and the hardest part of the job is getting people to take their job seriously. Management ranges from those who take serious ownership to those who don't. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing your efforts have a positive impact on the customer when they find what they are looking for."
good,"A typical day at work, would begin with a morning meeting, telling the staff what our goals were for the day.I enjoyed working with the employees, what I didn't like was how we were always pressured to have someone get a credit card."
good,"This was an OK entry job. Unfortunately, there was little room for advancement. I left this job for a better paying  position. I would recommend this for someone fresh out of high school."
good,"Company is still struggling to recover from a previous CEO. They are in expense cutting mode and closing stores. Maybe a good place to work in some of the bigger stores, but they will most likely continue to close stores for the next few years"
good,"Overall, I think JcPenney is a great company to work for. However, if you don't mind giving up a lot of your personal time (weekends, holidays, nights) then go for it."
good,"My typical day at work was taking care of the customers. "
good,"The supervisors and managements are friendly.  It is fun and wonderful place for employment.  Everyone gets along and help each other out.  JCPenney has been doing better than any other stores.  I am unsure of the job security because I believe one day they will close.  The schedule is odd, there are days when I cannot work because of a full time job.  It seems like they wanna work you until you're dead.  Potlucks, people bring bakeries, and snacks.  Free lunch and dinners when you work on holidays.  The only issue is if you feel sick and need to go home, they will not approve it."
good,"I had fun and it did keep me busy. I like jobs that keep me moving and keep me busy. I didn't like that my pants got messed up, I'd get rips in my pants and the dust wouldn't come out when I washed them."
good,"Company just laid off a large portion of their LP staff company wide January 2017. Fourth quarter earnings projections where not as high as had been hoped, but JCP did make a profit this year first time since 2012."
good,"The break room is every nice, management is not that bad depending on the day. Work is a lot from inventory to folding clothes every time"
good,"Great people to work with, but there needs to be a lot more workers. Too much work for so little employees. Also crazy hours, and is not a flexible work schedule."
good,"constant changes make doing this job more difficult.  Its an interesting environment with changes and adjustments frequently.  Aids Store Management to communicate current shrinkage and safety topics.  Observes customer’s and contractor’s (CCTV/floor) activities to detect theft, fraud or suspicious activity, collects investigative intelligence related to ORC activity and fraud, takes direction from AP management to monitor team member activity as needed, reports infractions of company policy to AP and/or store management."
good,"Opening store, handling am meeting, assigning areas , getting registers open, and ensuring coverage is meet through out the day. Closing, store core, register balances, cleaning crew sign out, closeout daily sales."
good,"JC Penney is a very typical retail environment. There wasn't a lot that was spectacular about the job, but it wasn't extremely difficult, either. It was a very average job, it paid minimum wage, and the people I worked with were all pretty nice. It's a good place to work."
good,"I worked at JCPenneys as my first job, which it was perfect for. I worked in the children's department, which consisted of a lot of angry parents. I liked my job I just didn't like pushing credit cards on people."
good,"JCPenney was not my favorite place to work. Aside from a select few coworkers being able to work with, management sucked and the people that had worked there much longer were not pleasant to be around and the pay sucked. I would not go back there again."
good,"I did loss prevention for this company. I got laid off recently due to the company ""making changes"" that they see fit. The employees are really nice and most of them do their jobs. Management wise, some are great and some need to be grow a backbone and write their associates as needed."
good,"It's a good place to work, but it really don't pay very good! I started making $7:35 an hour and after 9 years I was only making $9:00!"
good,"Not much room for growth. Management seems to constantly change. Almost everyone has a great attitude and easy to get along with. Lately has been plagued with lay-offs, which really hurts morale."
good,"Most of my time is spent interacting with people--coworkers and customers. These interactions are prompted primarily on the basis of merchandise distribution. Working in men's clothing, I feel like a kind of fashion liaison--assisting others in negotiating the various dress and adornment options our store has to offer. Working at JC Penny has also improved my awareness of fashion culture and sales in general, in that I have a greater exposure to the vast array of fashion vs. affordability stances, and a better knowledge of what people want and what it is worth to them."
good,"Great to gain customer service and retail experience, also to know more about clothing brand. Management is great to make your schedule flexible and accessible."
good,"Overall it's an ok place to work.  One of the primary issues with that company is that it seems like they refuse to hire more people we're always under staff, it's been like that since I started working there. Just like any other retail we have slow periods, and it's usually towards the end of the year and the beginning of the next, it becomes impossible to get 40 hrs a week during this time."
good,I enjoy working here the only thing is that they are strict on hours and the pay rate isn't the best. you have to wait about 6+ months to get a raise.
good,"Management at the JcPenney in Hutchinson, KS was excellent. However, the employees seemed very down on their luck at all times, and therefore didn't want to work. The hardest part of the job is dealing with a rush of people, but if one has able to keep their head on, then they should be golden. Overall, the job was good job, but think some changes could be made to the moral of the place."
good,All i will say is that management was trash they had no communication skills and everybody felt like they were in control when the actual store manager is not around. Best part is the employees are fun to get to know especially in a big store and all the people you meet working there if your a people person apply there is always a variety of ethnic backgrounds to learn from while helping them shop.
good,"Very fast paced and based off production. A great company to grow and also retire from. A typical work day is clocking in going to the designated area, getting rpf scanners and totes. Login in and then start picking the appropriate product."
good,Its was a seasonal job but it was ok while it lasted. Didn't expect much from my first job. But i gain a little knowledge that i have used in recent experiences.
good,"A typical day at work is greeting customer."
good,"On a typical day at work, my goal was always to sell the most JCP cards, the management was unorganized but for the most part it was improving, and all of my co-workers were very social and open minded."
good,It was very fast paced. I was told that that there would be 2 -3 week training I only received 1 week training then was put on the floor to do 65 tickets per hour. We started out doing about 35 - 40 tickets an hour on the first week. But overall it pays great and the people are nice it just wasn't for me. I prefer to work in the pack department.
good,"good job, nice people. nice coaches, very helpful, wish the job was a bit more flexible with hours. but over all this job is a  good place to work for."
good,"JCPenney is a casual environment, work is steady. coaches are great. learned all the basics of customer service , how to place an order. Track orders. Payments, change credit cards information."
good,"Good place to work temporarily. Good managers, lots of training, great place to work. They allowed more hours when needed. Always decently staffed/hardly ever shorthanded. Great discounts."
good,"Sometimes when your shift ends at 9:00pm, they make you stay later. Employees are sometimes unprofessional and gossip about each other around customers. However, the management is nice."
good,"The pay is not the best and neither is the benefits. Good Entry job. If you like working with customers it is great, although the pay is never that good."
good,Checking in with the LOD and preforming required daily tasks. Friendly work environment and they work around schedules.
good,"JCPenney has been a great company and affords lots of opportunity for growth.  Though there are challenges with the turnaround, I am confident JCPenney will get there.  The company is fast paced but there is respect for work life balance."
good,"Good company to work for.  Lots of opportunities to learn.  Big company with many areas of opportunity.  Benefits were good, work life balance was average."
good,Has taught me how to work in a fast paced environment just would like a set schedule with more hours. Fun job overall with awesome coworkers. You also get to build relationships with the customers
good,Working at JCP was a good experience. the managers are awesome and like to provide rewards for good work. Sometimes it can get realy busy but that can be exciting.
good,"learned a great deal about product development, import and export, transportation and negotiations.  I was exciting to bring new product to the public and watch the success of many things and unfortunate when things failed to produce what was expected."
good,Make sure to have a clean and organized store environment whenever possible. Duties given are given times to finish.  The work load is higher than the amount of hours given to sale and operations associates. Very nice people working for the company.
good,"Always had fun with my coworkers but upper management could use some work. No benefits for employees and little room for advancement,"
good,"I have witnessed Department supervisors use profanity to customers and to other employees. There is a lot of ""he say, she say"" accusations that take place in each department."
good,This company has an okay working environment. Working hard did help me become good in my position i was assigned but was always taken advantage of.
good,I enjoy working in the store I do but it is too small to offer everything.  The advancement opportunities could be a little greater.
good,"My day consists of setting AD's for a current promotions"
good,"Its an ok job if you're still in school, because they work really well with your hours. However, it is just a retail job and does not pay much."
good,"It was a great place to work, and a really great experience, but overall the management could have been better organized."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was the interaction with customers and being able to help people on a daily basis. Co-workers were easy to get along with. Management was decent. Learned that I am a better salesperson than I thought. The hardest part of the job was getting people to get a jcp credit card, though I normally met and sometimes exceeded goal."
good,Seasonal retail is very difficult.  Hours are hard to get adjusted to as some days you work 4 and the next day can be 10.  I spent too many years in the clerical field with set hours and retail was entirely different.
good,The store is a great store overall the only problem is some of the managers. Some of their attitudes are ridiculous honestly. Some are actually worse than the customers. Oh yeah and they push credit apps. Like really PUSH them. They give you a certain amount a week and if you don't reach it for so long then you'll get fired. What they need to learn is you can't force people to sign up for a JCP credit card. If they don't want it then they don't want it. Simple. Your job shouldn't be based on if someone else is going to sign up for a credit card.
good,I definately enjoyed working for JCPenney. The customers were always friendly. The staff were also very kind and considerate.
good,ok environment shabby management lack of proper communication benefits are great decent pay hours are modified at times
good,"I worked at JCPenney for seventeen years in the Custom Decorating department. It was a combination of customer service, a lot of data entry (10-Key and Alpha Numeric), scheduling, and maintaining the decorator schedule, administrative duties, some billing, working with outside vendors, ordering supplies, and maintaining the studio appearance, samples, and price books. The discount was decent, and for a long time I only had to work one weekend a month. Then it was all but one weekend off a month the last few years I was there. I also covered other studio's, trained new coordinators, covered staging sites as needed, and then they closed my studio. This job is basically obsolete now since the decorators' book all their own appointments, enter orders themselves, and handle all the customer calls and complaints. It's a lot less of a personal experience in my opinion, but I guess you have to keep up with the times."
good,JC Penney is one of the oldest retail stores in the world. It helped me to understand how the business world operates. It also helped me learn the importance of change. We should be willing to change with the times in order for our business to grow.
good,"This salon is a typical corporate salon.  Education is tailored for JC Penneys seasonal trend looks. Pleasant, clean environment that promotes teamwork. All co-workers get along well."
good,"Jcpenny helped customers find what they need in apparel and home goods. The store is successful in customer service, making customers happy and coming again to shop."
good,"Management staff, changes all the time.  A strictly part-time staff.  Can be removed from the schedule in slow months, for weeks at a time."
good,"My typical day is getting the merchandise off the truck and putting it on the sales floor to be sold. I learned to make it fun, and be serious when you need to be. Management is not all it's cracked up to be. They will fuss at you about getting things done, when some times it's impossible, but they wont help you get it done. I love my co-workers. They are all great! There isn't anything hard about the job if you know what you are doing. I think the most enjoyable part of the job is my co-workers in my department. We are like a family."
good,"This was an okay retail job. Management was enthusiastic each shift and always eager to hire new employees. However, management was poor when it came down to maintaining schedules and scheduling employees for times when they were available. Nonetheless, this job had a family friendly atmosphere and a very customer service oriented staff. I would recommend this job for high-school students or possibly someone who is looking to pick up a second job."
good,"Fun job, people were great to work with, fast paced work force, decent benefits, poor pay scale, & I never got a full 40 hour week."
good,"Meeting new people every day was exciting for me, Management was very supportive. The downside would be working on your feet most of the time."
good,"In working for a corporation, I learned a lot about teamwork and applying all sorts of skills to be an enthusiastic team leader. Though I did not wish to stay with JCP, I have appreciated where the job has taken me as I now plan on educating or managing for a corporate salon."
good,"I've develop a very close relationship working my co-workers. There's nothing like team work. My co-workers and I  have a very good rapport when it comes to our customers. You have to love what you do in order for it to be fun for yourself, co-workers, and customers."
good,"My typical day at work is working in the women's department. This includes checking customers out at the cash register, working one of the fitting rooms, or zoning. In the fitting rooms we put clothing back on the racks and assist customers with any needs they have. When we zone we straighten clothing on the sales floor and assist customers with their needs. "
good,"Very fast paced, processes always changing, incorporating retail process to .com/on-line process.  Friendly co-workers but lack of leadership in some areas."
good,"I loved my job and I loved to do hair. I enjoyed serving people while I did a lot of receptionist tasks and I realized that there wasn't much upward mobility. They had an absence of management, which enabled fellow employees to slack at their job and get away with dishonest actions. So I am looking for a job that they would appreciate an honest, hard worker."
good,"I would stack shoes boxes in the back room, and I would make sure everything was clean and organized so that the sales associates could find the right shoe and shoe sizes for the customer."
good,JCpenneys is a good place to work if you're not looking for a full time career to pay bills.  There are lots of great people who work there.
good,"They were a great company to work for, but when you transfer from one store to another and they throw you into a full position as a stocking team member and you were on the floor at the old store working the shoe department it makes it very strenuous. They didn't give me time to learn what I was doing and only had me following someone for one day. The store i was working at in Montana was not even 1/3 the size of the Antioch one. Then when the person who is suppose to open the doors for employees at work doesn't show and they mark you absent even though you were there sitting out front for two hours waiting for the store to be open so you could do your job is ridiculous. I loved my Montana store, but we were one of the small town stores they closed nation wide."
good,"Detail check all shipment for custom window orders, problem solve, and receive in epic system to then set up appointment for installation of product in a timely matter. Team work with coworkers throughout our work flow process makes us profitable. High values of our team in ending result of customer satisfaction is such a great part of my job. There is not much movement in advancement of position which I would consider to be the hardest part of the job. Enjoyable spending holidays with family, we do not work major holidays."
good,"Working here gave me new insights on fasion, but also taught me that retail is a tough job. I enjoyed interacting with customers and talking about why they were getting an outfit or the compliments they got from something they got from our store."
good,"Im not enjoying it right now but others experience could be better."
good,The worst part of the job is refunds and exchanges when customers don't have a receipt and they made a purchase using a coupon.
good,It was an okay place. I enjoyed it because I had some friends that happen to work there. The store didn't really give me the perception of retail I was looking for.
good,"Ultimately your experience with JCPenney will fall down to the location that you work at. My current store has amazing management who i feel genuinely take an interest in their employees and are for the most part supportive and helpful. Even when things can get busy, and we are short staffed most people will do their best to take time and help customers and associates."
good,"They did not pay very much and hours weren't very consistent. But I like organization, cleaning and detail.But Management was just okay. Nothing amazing. That is all."
good,"JCP was a fun place to work. I was always busy it made the day go by fast. The down side is pay, low hours and turn over. Management is awesome always doing things to keep moral up. Good job for teenagers or college students needing gas money."
good,When I first started I loved it. My manager was very nice and treated me like family. But she got promoted then that's when all h*** broke lose... The store manager treats LP like outsiders and about two other LODs act like they are my boss. Now that we have a new manager I'm only getting 18 hours a week starting at 35 at $9.63. How do they expect me to live off that. Besides that my job is okay.
good,"I move items from the truck, and sort in the stockroom.  The merchandise is then placed in it's proper place and presentation on the sales floor.  It is a very physical job.  I really like the management; although, once they give you your schedule, pretty much every day, they ask you to stay later than you are assigned to."
good,"JCpenny is a nice clothing store, some associates very childish. Management is great. Store manager keeps business in shape."
good,"I love the visual and customer service part of my job. A typical day for me is helping with floor sets, advertising manners or promotions. I also help in the men's department with customer service.  It is a fun job, my co-workers are great we all work together as a team. Management are always available when we need them, they give us hourly updates on the stores goals and our individual goals. It has been nice to be able to learn from management that have been in the business longer than me, I have also been able to share my knowledge."
good,"great experience as a company, the calls i felt should have been more simple and to let the reps do alot more, the supervisors should have been more helpful"
good,"My experience has been a good one overall. However, I've been with the company on and off for over 6 years and haven't had a pay increase. Even with gaining experience through this company and meeting their quotas, I don't feel like I'm earning a fair amount for how long I've been with them. "
good,"Like any retail job, most of the day consists of helping customers. Weather that be taking credit card payments, resolving complaints, or just ensuring an overall great customer experience.  "
good,I enjoy working for jcpenney salon I feel as though they are moving in the right direction I am looking forward to being appart of this companys growth....
good,"Knowing that Im coming to a team that I have a work bond with .. Im comfortable doing my job , a job that challenged me to do better and better every morning i came in .. Getting my job done correctly . Receiving the check that i worked hard for . Thats what I enjoyed ."
good,"A typical work day is slow, but steady. In between helping customers, my job is to find areas in my department that needs straightening, refolding, or cleaning. I've learned how to deal with customers with bad attitudes, which is the hardest part of my job. Management is pretty good as far as dealing wiht customers and keeping up on the appearance of the store. The most enjoyable part of my job is when they have contest of who can open the most credit cards or who can get the most customer surveys filled out within the store."
good,"When I was first hired, the store management team was very professional and great at motivating the staff.  They were flexible with my work schedule and I could always do my job well.  Change in the store's leadership was not good.  I was offered another job opportunity and gave my two weeks notice.  That job was not suitable, so I reapplied to JCP.  The store manager never called me, but hired others.  During my time with JCP, I had received wonderful customer reviews and recognition.  Visiting the store now, it seems that long time faithful employees have left and the feel of the store is  extremely gloomy."
good,"Friendly customer services, hard co-workers, management was not 100% well. Non-benefits."
good,"JC PENNEY SALON,"
good,the work is very simple once you catch your routine and i really like the fast past and constancy of the  work another plus to the job is the 3 days off and the 10 hour shifts
good,Company was very proactive with continual training and advancement opportunities.  Recent events have forced the company to re-assess itself.
good,Learn how to sort with p.O.S system and put in the right dept. It was just not a lot of hours.
good,"Productive working environment, great customers and supervisors"
good,I've learned that every team member has a key role in meeting the company goals
good,"My day would start with a quick meeting with my store manager."
good,Great Place to work with. The staff is great everyone gets along. Management is good and friendly to work with. Hours and pay are the worst thing.
good,I love the workplace and my co workers. I just wished the pay and the hours were more.
good,"I didn't work with soft retail! Started in pricing moved my way up but i needed more excitement than clothing, management was very cliquy."
good,"you were always rushing to get things done"
good,"A typical day at my job can be very stressful if you are a person that like a clean organized environment to work. I did not get proper training for my job I have had to learn the job as I go. My co-workers are not to bad people to work with."
good,"Customer service, credit applications, online orders help meet customers individual needs."
good,"The project includes sending the file of available overstock and discontinued items to the third-party from jcp, accepting order information from JC’s into our warehouse systems, continue to send invoice data to Salt Lake and reporting capabilities."
good,easy and manageable place to work at. great on being flexible on your schedule.
good,"Was a fairly relaxed place. You can wear what you want within reason, and they offer a great discount to associates. Most of the year, business is steady, but it is only overwhelming at certain seasons. It's retail."
good,Very structured big box retailer with very limited creativity options.
good,Worked a short time because of relocation. Very supportive and kind co workers and management.
good,everyone is helpful and the time flies by so fast you are so busy you would have to be very good at organizing and have to have a fast pace
good,Everyone there is a hard worker and very open to inviting you in and helping you when you start. They make you feel like you are a part of their crew and it's a very friendly environment.
good,"the pay is ok- not the best, but it's retail.... not many opportunities for advancement."
good,"its great job the people I work with are great, the hours just are really sucky. I barely get hours when the time is slow."
good,"Cashier "
good,If you're a friendly person that loves face to face interaction with customers and knows how to operate a cash register during peak seasons then look no further.
good,Sales and customer service first experience. It was great start to learn how to interact with customers.
good,"I worked in the back of the store where we receive shipments for the store and we would open up huge boxes of merchandise and disperse them throughout the store based on departments. I learned a lot about hard work and labor, I was one of the few males on the job so we always had to do the heavy lifting and there was a lot of it. Moving huge fixtures, tables, doors, dressers, using ladders. It was a lot of down and dirty work. Co-workers were the best part and working within a team is always fun. Management however can be very harsh and not understanding, it was by far the worst part of the job. Overall though the job had its pros and cons and there are worse jobs out there."
good,a typical day at work included checking people out and getting the store in order.
good,"There was never a typical day at the Jc Penny Salon. Your days would consistently change thanks to the different services that were waiting to be performed. Many things were taught to me through out my employment with Jc Penny's but I believe one of the major learning experiences was the cash handling and register experiences. This allowed me to expand my knowledge on how to better service my clientele. "
good,Learned how to work well with others under pressure most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers while working with coworkers  hardest part of the job saying good bye after a great days work.
good,"A typical day at work was spent going out trying to get people to come in the salon, cleaning, folding towels, making coffee, and socializing with co-workers and their clients. "
good,Other than the holiday season it can become slow and boring place to work. A lot of downtime is usually common around there and the employees are not so bad.
good,loading and unloading container trucks with merchandise and putting them on the correct conveyer belt.
good,"dealing with a lot of customers, i learned a lot about customer service, i loved the people who i worked with, the hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers, and the enjoyable part was connecting with the customers."
good,"Deliver an excellent customer service experience including selling, suggesting additional related merchandise, maintaining merchandise stocks, and store appearance. developing both new and existing customer relationships.."
good,"For the most part, the crew members worked together with the managers to make sure we got the job done in an orderly and timely fashion. A big downfall of working there is if we saw someone stealing, we could not stop them. We would have to go to a manager, and by that time, they would already be out the store. I saw it happen over and over again."
good,I enjoy working at J.C Penney I work in the kids department there are a lot of nice people that I work around they are fun and outgoing.The management is ok but it can get better the hardest part of my job is at night making sure everything is folded to the managers perfection and sizes the clothes also the rack cleaning.the most enjoyable part of my job is working with the customers and making them happy.
good,"It was a good environment although, didn't like the co-workers there. They slacked off to much causing me to pick up their work. Either than that I would recommend working at a JC Penney where people work together."
good,"Love the people and job itself, but no advancement and poor management"
good,"I would normally walk into work, put my stuff away and clock in. when i clock in the work started. i would walk to the floor and start recovering my area and checking fitting rooms. management would always be checking up on the floor and would ask how my day was. I learned how to perform top costumer service, meet sales goals, and also muliti-task. my coworkers were great people and i had fun working with them. the hardest part of my job was when we were understaffed with many things to do. the most enjoyable was when we all worked together as a team and got things done!"
good,I enjoyed working with all the floor assoicates and assisting the customers in purchasing and ordering items from online and seeing them come in to pick up purchases.
good,Easy job but no job security. You can lose your job at any time.
good,Greet customers upon arrival.  Assist any who need help finding out information on product they ask about.  Process credit applications.  Work with corporate clients to process large orders.  Process payments for customers through POS.  My co-workers were very helpful.  Holidays were the hardest part of the job.
good,"Excellent for a newbie to cosmetology because they offer classes and nothing too difficult to handle. Management was good but the pay and benefits aren't great for all the work that you do and you don't get commision for retail sales so I made more money working in booth rental salons, but if your're someone not looking to pay booth rent and you can handle the commission rate they offer then it's a great place to start..they supply everything all you need are your tools."
good,"great store to work for"
good,"I enjoyed working here. I began at age of 16 having 0 skills and now I can say that I learned a lot and have so much customer service experience. I started as a Sales Associate and moved up to a Merchandise Execution Specialist within a year working there. I dealt more with merchandise being placed out on the floor. I did some inventory, made sure the prices matched the signs, ticketed merchandise to a lower price and I also stayed overnight to assist managers planning the store changes each month. I did so many other tasks within the 3 1/2 years I worked at Jcpenney. I enjoyed how I kept up in such a fast paced environment also earning an Associate of the Month plaque. I was glad my hard work and dedication really paid off! I recently had to leave my job as a Merchandise Execution Specialist because I was due for birth on October. I am now ready to go back to work and expand my skills working as a Medical Assistant and/or a medical receptionist in a Medical Office Setting."
good,It was an learning experience and seeing people from different walks of life.
good,helped customers and ran a register. I learned something new on a daily basis. The management was the greatest there.My co-workers were very nice.The hardest part of my job was really nothing that I can remember. The most enjoyable part was helping people.
good,"I would start my day off at JC Penney Salon by coming in, opening the registers, checking messages, and checking in the clients. I was in charge of answering the phones all day, rescheduling clients, checking out clients, selling retail, and responsible for getting change for the registers. I learned how to act professional towards clients and employees. I wish that my manager at the time would care more about her salon team. She would make her own schedule, she wouldn't take disciplinary actions for her employees, and she didn't seem to care. The hardest part about my job was trying to please everybody, and make sure that every customer was happy. I feel like I did a great job at it though."
good,"Open to hearing and trying great thought out ideas, be on time all the time, many shifts to fit your lifestyle"
good,Folding clothes is all you do from open to close. The managers are very childish and unprofessional. Overall it is a good job for someone who dosent like to be watched all day
good,"I'm a support specialist so I come into work at 5:45am (shift is at 6, but can come in 15 mins early) we begin to open the truck and sort it into sections. We have a break at 8:30 and then go back to work. Once the truck is  opened we begin putting out the merchandise. If something can't go out, we leave it in the back until the end so we can backstock. Sometimes we are given other tasks instead of doing the truck. Like straightening the floor, filling things in, or helping managers in different departments rearrange their area. We get off at 1:30."
good,A typical day at work was good. You work with a lot of different types of personalities. The hardest part of the job was not having a reliable amount of hires and having people hired on making more than I was after 3 years of working there. After transferring to another state I was told I had a job to transfer to and then got laid off.
good,"• A typical day at work is fast paced and entertaining, with a lot of recovery, communication, and store knowledge."
good,Sell shoes. Co-workers were great. Management played favorites. Customer service is rewarding and fun. No hard part. Giving great customer service.
good,"starts out with going over what needs to be done, how much time we had to do the project, walking the floor and seeing what needs to be fixed, change before the store opened for the customers safety. I have learned how to ask for help, if needed and to work side by side with employs and offer help where needed. Management was great, Working side by side and teaching each other new and old ways of the store changes. Team work of most coworkers, was not always so great, but at times  they could be of great help. The hardest part was getting tired from busting your tail before the store opened. I liked doing all of the Visual work, I learned so many new things and enjoyed building the displays for the new merchandise. The freedom of being out on the floor, not just fixing and building the helping of customers that was good, and that they was happy when they left the store. How a customer would compliment on the work I had done."
good,"My typical day is greeting customers, offering promotion when they enter the store; ringing sales on cash register, addressing customers needs and concerns."
good,"I had to clean, and put everything in order. it was fun because I met a lot of people and also I learned how to be more patient and organized"
good,"I am grateful for the experience and oppertunity that JCPenny has given me. Its a great place to work. The supervisors, are wonderful, and the co-workers are cool. The most enjoyable part of the position is when I am with a customer and helping him or her shop. I love to coordinate the clothes, or help decorate their house. Its even better with I can help them save money by offering ta 20% discount for opening a JCP charge account. "
good,JcPenney corporate had us move sets so often that most of the time we didn't know where anything was. you get money for each credit application you do.
good,"The management and selling strategies have been challenging for the past 2 years. I feel JCP is moving ahead in the right direction. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers find what they are looking for and using my skills to make a wise buying decision. We have a wonderful staff to work with. The hardest part of my job is the lack of available staff to assist customers, when needed. Our benefits are great and hope they continue."
good,It was a good job. I was responsible for making sure the sales floor was fully stocked with merchandise.I would occasionally work the cash register if we became busy.
good,Fun work environment until company was under new management.  Fairly treated.
good,taught me how to drive a forklift. I learned how to put on ink-tags and change price tags.
good,definitely a challenging work enviroment that favors women employee's. In my specific job for the company i started noticing a immediately negative response to the job duties i was required to perform from the female staffers. 
good,A typical work day for me at J.C. Penny was like getting up every morning dreading to go to work. I learned a great deal of marketing technics and also receiving. My management team was a hard team they didn't slack up on you in any department. My co-workers made my day at work a little brighter when we worked on group assignments and conversed during lunch. The hardest part of my job was getting all my duties done before one of my bosses asked was I finished. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I promoted and was acknowledged for all my hard work
good,"Assist customers with shopping needs. Assist customers with locating products and services. Handled all monetary transactions via cash, check, credit/debit cards"
good,The best part about working here is all the friends you are going to make. There is always someone that is ready to help you in any way.
good,JC Penny by far still remains a strong and lucrative company in my book. They have a strong flavor of always satisfying the customers and making sure productive work assignments are being performed. My only skate about my departure was that in order to maintain a stable work environment you must first have employees. With only one person stocking and receiving the entire warehouse under such low paying rates makes performing the task efficiently unbearable. 
good,"Working at JCP is cool if you enjoy retail or if you coming out of college to gain experience and the pay/benefits are good. Recently as we know, JCP does not have a strong direction and job security is very rocky. The work life balance is what you make it."
good,can't recall much about my time there. but it was a pretty laid back work place
good,"I enjoyed working there, but the pay was really low. It was a good place to be for people just starting the work force."
good,one day while working on the sales floor i was called to the cash register to asist. and that was the first day i learned to completly operate a cash register.i enjoyed working hands on with the customers. my co workers were amazed at how fast i picked up on the register. the hardest part of the day was cleaning up the store after standing in one place for so long.
good,"They really work with your schedule, especially if you're full time at school. 15 minute breaks and lunch breaks. Job responsibilities consisted primarily of cashiering, using jcp.com services, helping customers on the floor, and making sure fitting rooms were cleared out and clothes were put away. A lot of little contests and prizes for getting credit applications. Quite a few pleasant managers."
good,While working at JCPenny's I learned how to deal with different type people also learned about different cultures.
good,"Your hours given each week should be based on your skills, knowledge, and committeement to the company, not base on if you have a good relationship with management. Penneys has the opportunity to really do well and outsell any other store nationwide, buy if they could only realize that they should be the leader and not alway try and copy off other stores but put their own ideals in place and let others store fellow them. They have been around for over 100 years and by now they should have the knowledge needed to exceed down pack."
good,Since J.C Penny Company has had a new C.E.O alot of things have negatively changed
good,Great company but with all the current changes its hard to say whether it will get better or get worse. I find myself stuck on a rollercoaster some days are good and some days are bad.
good,I built lasting relationships with the people I have worked with.
good,"I like working at JC PENNEY, I noticed that they have very poor inventory and supplies, mostly everything has to be ordered online at jcp.com or it may be at other locations for the customers satisfaction."
good,"A typical day at work for me is training and coaching my team on the aspects of health, safety and environmental opportunities that may arise in their responsible work sites and countermeasures to eliminate or minimize incidents and/or accidents. I have a competent and supportive management team that allows me to lead my team and trust me to do the right thing. The hardest part of my job is receiving a call with information regarding a hurt team member from one of my facilities. I want to make to sure that all team members go home the same way they arrived to work; in one piece. The most enjoyable part of my job is watching my team learn and grow, trusting their training and experience to see them through a task."
good,"My day consists of assisting customers find merchandise, and putting merchandise back on floor, shop ready."
good,i loved working here because not only because the managers were great but also we would earn extra money on our pay checks for opening up company cards.
good,"After a 35 year career, having seen many changes, and taking a voluntary retirement, all I can say is there were times I absolutely loved my job, the company and really enjoyed going to work everyday. There were times, just the opposite, I worked for a bully, hated every aspect of the job, etc. In the end, I enjoyed working at Penneys, and really hated leaving. Even though I took a Voluntary Early Retirement, VERP, I didn't want to. I saw the writing on the wall, and knew my job was to be eliminated, and it was."
good,Most enjoyable part of the job was the diversity in working with numerous depts and staff. This job gave me a clear understanding of many areas of expertise outside my own dept.
good,The job was challenging and exciting. I enjoyed all the people that worked there and also who shopped there. I was challenged on a daily basis and enjoyed challenging others.
good,"Slow day at work sometimes,co-workers are alright could be better but im there to work not have fun need to get money."
good,My time at penneys was full of ups and downs depending on the mood of the management if they were happy we were happy. If they were mad or upset they used us for there grief. Lots of activities throughout the year and relatively easy.
good,Walking around fixing sales racks helping customers with questions or picking out clothes folding clothes sometimes long hrs
good,"Through my job I have gained valuable work experience and work ethics. Throughout a typical day as a team effort we breakdown shipments and manage merchandise. We restock merchandise on the sales floor and manage backstock inventories. I have learned to work well under pressure and meet deadlines while maintaining integrity and accuracy. My co-workers my not have the same work ethics and integrity as myself and although this may be apparent in thier work in the end i can only speak for myself. My immediate supervisor is great, but upper managment lacks accountablity, communication, and transparency with employees. I enjoy the early shifts and friendly working enviroment. The hardest part about this job is dealing with the interferences caused by other associates that make completing your tasks that much more difficult."
good,great company to start a career. strong training program for new grads.
good,"A typical day would be go in and make sure the store was visual up to standards. And to make sure all the sale properties were up for the day.I learned how to build fixtures, read planograms , how to unload trucks and how to stock merchandise . I also learned how to supervise the workers i had working for me and to set us up a plan of what we were gonna work on each day when we came in . My coworkers were very outgoing and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was setting the Christmas set each year. Most enjoyable part is of the job is seeing that the store looks great when you have done all your display work."
good,Putting away the close will be the most annoying part of this job. But it's great experience in retail.
good,"I learned a lot about working in the the work force. I learned how to deal with Managers, CO workers, and customers. I learned how to run the cash register, organize the stock room, and stock the shelves."
good,My co-workers at Jcpenny are very cheerful. They always lend a helping hand. If you need help with a product or question they are always there next to me or anyone who needs it.
good,"I learned better customer service skills, coming in to a fast paced environment. My team of co-workers were great to work with and they made the hardest part of the day which is closing fun."
good,"Working at Jcpenney's is very enjoyable, love the people I work with, and great benefits."
good,"I work different shift hours as well as days. Depending on the day we can be pretty busy with customers or it can be a slow day. I have learned a great deal of people and communication skills. Our management team is constantly changing, our co- workers are great, friendly, hardworking people. The hardest part of the job is trying to advance in the company and the most enjoyable part is being able to help our customers and know they were satisfied with our service."
good,I enjoyed working with the people i worked with many of us became friends. Some of us even became best friends. I unloaded the trucks and helped in other departments as needed. My supervisor was understanding i could go to her about anything.
good,"Friendly co-workers, fast pace work. I learned to price clothing"
good,"The typical day at the home office campus usually started with a morning beverage taken to your cozy, gray-patterned wall cubicle. Work was never dull and always kept me busy and ready for more. There were all kinds of professional work habits due to the diverse culture and a huge variety of managment styles. The hardest part of the job was the 'unknown' and the 'drop everything and do this' special project. Most enjoyable was the campus, the amenities, seeing the kids around the daycare center and the many wonderful co-workers over the years."
good,JCPennys is a good place to work in with th people and with the customers comeing and going the custoners are good peole to talk to and try to help them find what they need even for a cleaner.
good,"Excellent environment, very organized, every associates knows each other, and we feel like a big family."
good,"In order to remake itself and be more competitive in today's dynamic retail environment, JCPenney is currently bringing in new management that is totally changing the work environment. The company is very hard to rate, because things are moving so quickly. Only time will tell if the changes sustain this hundred-year-old company."
good,"After 5 years of employment and multiple tries at advancement I have not gotten anywhere. The management is good and the company is beginning a period of change which could account for recent layoffs and cut hours but I need more l, I need a career not a job and all this company has provided is a job."
good,"Very fast paced, the management isn't really flexible when it comes to schedules or helping you with tasks you don't understand. You have to be able to work at a fast pace , able to meet the quota if not you will be written up & also you will be expected to work in a very hot climate. The pay is okay,but if your going through a temp agency 3.45 of each pay check goes to the temp agency but if your going through jcpenny warehouse hiring system you'll be paid correctly."
good,Working for JcPenney outlet at jamestown was one of the least enjoyable jobs. The management is what made it such a displeasure to me. I feel that the supervisors abused there authority by not doing any work but pointing and talking. I wouldn't work there again because i felt my position was abused and my rate of pay was horrible for my description.
good,I've been working at jcpenney for over 2 years now and when i first started i loved my job. Although it is still a nice place to work at a lot has changed.
good,Be nice to the customers make your goals and the job is pretty easy from there. Store hours are not bad but you do have to work all holidays expect Christmas Day.
good,"The corporate office was immaculate.  The offering of gyms, restaurants, Starbucks, etc. made coming to work enjoyable.  Was able to interact directly with all departments."
good,"I really love working at the location in Tyler. The managers are flexible and treat me and my coworkers better than I've been treated at other places, and they're very flexible with hours. The starting pay is at 8.50 so it's not the worst but it's not something you can live off of."
good,"I was only there for the holiday season, but it was a steady pace, I was always doing something to keep me busy, and whenever we weren’t busy, I always made sure I had something to do!"
good,at Jcpenney was really good and it was a really friendly and they can always there to help and its a calm and slow place but it gets busy on the weeked but its good
good,"Great experience it was amazing. Helping people out and their family and watching families come in and out with smiles and happiness, the workers were great, they did need more help with management but I know it can get a bit crazy"
good,enjoyed the customers and the different things each day was. never the repetitive jobs. hardest part of the job was trying to make credit goal for each month
good,I enjoyed working there. Loved what I do helping out customers and my team. If it wasnt for the team my job will be harder. It was fast paced job always busy . They have opportunities but we all do.
good,The benefits were great but not enough staff and not enough hours i barely could pay rent and other important things. But overall it really want that bad its just better pay woukd of been better
good,"The manager loves Christmas and started playing the Christmas playlist on November 1st.  So, unless you're not a fan of Christmas music, it is a fun place to work, even with a Christmas spirit week with different themed days to wear ugly sweaters and even a pajama day."
good,"Overall, it is a nice place to get a start or return to work after a long absence from working outside the home.  The environment is friendly with some competition thrown in. The associates vie for credit applications because they get paid a bonus for them as well as a chance to win gifts/prizes."
good,Come in on time when scheduled. Get told by manager in what to do exactly for the day. Sometimes out of the day I get pulled out of my task  and get told to do some other task but most of the time I'm doing one simple task that takes me the whole day and sometimes doesn't get finished until the next day just because of how much stuff there is that needs to be done and how long my shift is. All and all it's not bad besides poor management at times but I come in prepared and do my work correctly and efficiently.
good,Retail and the hours are tough in general. If you like flexible schedules and not looking for Mon-Fri day shift type of job then its a good place to work. They do try to keep you on more of a set schedule.
good,Jcpenny is a good job opportunity for a teenager !! The pay is good and the employees are very nice :) the days went by at a good pace . The customers were very respectful towards me:)
good,Cashier  good place to work for good management very nice work environment nice and friendly co-workers learned more customer service skills. The one thing I had a problem with was I was seasonal and they said I should be able to be hired full time but then was let go through a email even though they emailed time while working that day
good,I really enjoyed working here. It was very smooth and easy paced. Was an excellent job. Management could’ve been better but it was overall a very good experience for me!
good,"very fun place to work it was a little unorganized and people in management should have taken responsiblity for some things but they didnt, but it was an alright experience."
good,It was a fun and nice little job to work for at the time .very nice people and friendly .mg ware realey nice and fair at times over all it was a ok part time job lots of nice customer i had a good time.
good,JCPenney was ok for a seasonal job they push u a lot of they know you won’t be there and they will ask for everything and how everything just a competitive environment
good,JCPenny had a very nice family environment but was very typically a retail experience. I experienced growth and advancement but was not met warmly when I wanted to move one.
good,"customers complain, because of their own inability to fully read signs, and after arguing with you for several minutes will ask for a manager who will come and give said customer whatever they want to keep their business. "
good,"fast paced, everyone works as a team. management has open door policy. I have learned to merchandise and how to sign the store. hardest part about the job there really isn't one. enjoyable part of the job the people I work with"
good,"Jcpenney is an amazing retail company itself. Everyday, we are tasked to meet a credit goal, so that itself was a good challenge to help me grow. The work culture is very friendly and inviting, although my new store that I was transferred to was a lot more competitive than my prior store. Overall, I really enjoyed working for the company and im grateful to have had this experience."
good,It was always something new. I loved all the training and new ideas from staff and management. Very fast place work and fun people to work with that because like family.
good,No adequate training. no help in apprehension. Did not give me the adequate tools needed to do a efficient job did not fix equipment in a timely manner. The  managers were good assistanted  as much as possible. Employees were good to work with.
good,"The catalog department handles all returns, both online and in store items. I learned people skills from this job and computer skills. The most enjoyable part of the job are the coworkers."
good,"The culture at JCPenney is great. Unfortunately, the pay as a sales associate is low. They constantly reward their employees  when sales are great. You also meet some great people and great management."
good,"Easy to work with"
good,"The company work hard to make sure you are not alone or that you have all the help within the company with family,  scholarship , on the job training."
good,"A typical day would start of with stretches, an update on the workload, and any injuries that might have occurred the day before. "
good,"Boring workday , dry management, dried out job, busy days on the weekends, less co-workers, more customers during the afternoon, store usually has less co workers by weekend"
good,"At first, I loved working for the company. Over time, it was clear there was no solid direction. I was there for four years and we had three CEO changes."
good,My typical day at work Would be Clock in go to the meeting after the meeting we return to our registers greet customers make great sales  help others with their mission..
good,It’s usually busy on certain days of the week everyone always gonna be busy doing a task we would always have to walk between departments to return clothes or other items. We help with customers to look for things and help check out if needed. We put clothes back that people leave in the fitting room and we recover around everywhere to fold to fixing hangers or putting up clothes that fallen on the floor. But sometimes the managers would move us around a lot but they sometimes give you attitude towards the employees. They blame us for something that wasn’t our fault and we don’t always have a long enough break before they want us to go back.
good,This job started out good then it was all about ICAPS.!! ICAPS! Every hour every day.... blah blah Whatever happened to just great customer service and not hounding customers. This the only company that I have work for that don’t approve of certain vacation times and no holidays off . As if people don’t have responsibility’s outside of work. At this job you are under paid for the 100 things that you do. Sorry but only teenagers would survive here.
good,I loved working for the JC Penney Company. I worked in two stores. The management at the Savannah went from bad to worse. It needs to take a look at this store.
good,"I have worked as a stylist at JCPenny for five years. In that time there have been 5 different store General Managers and 2 Salon Managers. The Salon has had a HUGE turnover with between 20-30 stylists coming and going. I has hired on as a part time stylist right out of school and worked my way up to a Master Stylist. JCPenny has a fantastic continuing education program for hairstylists. Also, as a master stylist I can set my service prices and my own hours. While some managers are swallowed up by the corporate garbage there are plenty managers who understand reality and respect your need for a work/life balance. As an associate you can get up to a 25% discount on store merchandise."
good,"Jcpenney was an average job, however, they were always short staffed and required a lot from one person. There would be times were I was flooded with hours and there would be times were I would have little hours, no in between."
good,"They had ""blackout"" days where no one could request the day off. They scheduled me on one of those days when it was outside of my availability. They said if I didn't show up it would count against me. But it was mostly a slow-paced job, though it did get hectic sometimes."
good,"I worked here and I loved management and co workers, only issue I had was the amount of overbearing clothes and work to be done, due to not forcing the mission, they cut my hours a lot to hire seasonals and even then didn’t have enough of a budget to hire as many seasonal associates as they hired, even after seasonal budget wasn’t enough and hours are still short, longest day I’ve had was 7 hours most are 5 or 4 hour shifts and I’d be working for 2-4 days out of the 7 days of the week, and the pay was $10.50 but my only issue is other associates were being paid up to $12 at entry. And others were the $10.50, I got a 13 cent raise when I stayed as a regular from seasonal. Which was great, at the time, I wouldn’t recommend this job."
good,"My time working at JcPenney was fine, but it could have been a lot better if the management was fair and didn't pick favorites. They excluded several employees in the circle of favorites and treated them in a very rude way."
good,"I liked working there, great discount, I just couldn't maintain full-time position when going to school. The hours are flexible. The associates are friendly, management can be a little demanding at times."
good,"Replace and organize merchandise."
good,I enjoyed working at JCPenney. It was a great work environment with friendly people. Scheduling was the only issue. Many times i had to ask for more hours but they always worked with me to get me more hours. Overall would recommend it. It can be fun when you and your team work together and interact with each other as well as customers.
good,"Have a meeting which I personally find them to be boring, then to work scan cartons build to pallets. And help out in other areas that needs help. No overtime, except when black Friday's comes around"
good,While working with the company I was given opportunity for career advancement as well as experience in group work. Both staff and management work closely to continue to improve working environment and store improvements.
good,good environment the people made it fun and they made it feel like family always had contest and celebrated any win the company had it was a nice neviroment very mass retail
good,"Organizing clothes and stocking clothes is mandatory, have to pay attention and check out customers every day. Have to be at work very constantly, not very many sick days and finding replacements are mandatory."
good,At the time when I started they Lacked employees so it was hard to get any coaching or training done with a manger or anyone for that matter. But I did like working for their company.
good,"really good sales every week, most of the employees i worked with were kind and there was a sense a balance the only things i didn't enjoy was the request for certain items to complete me job were not taken care of, multiple requests were made and my job just became more difficult, also being the only employee in my actual role due to lack of money and hours resulted in high stress and always having to rush and still never being 100% especially dealing with multiple health problems the job broke me even though i absolutely loved it."
good,"Further skills in customer service, cashier, cash handling and cash register. The customers were nice and not much of a hassle. The team was nice and welcoming"
good,"My typical day at work included, calling customer daily, scheduling appointments, ordering productions, tracking orders, contracting vendors and much more."
good,I was only there for 15 hrs a week. Did not get much help from management when you could find them. No help for employees when they needed it. Management wasn't very strong.
good,The work is challenging in both good and bad ways. Most of the people are great to work with.  There are great leaders in management and some that are not the best leaders of people.
good,"I work at JCP p/t. I have 2 children & it is really close to my home."
good,"The job itself was easy and helped me a lot with my people skills. They helped me develop customer service skills and taught me how to up sell. However, some people on the management team were difficult and started a lot of issues among the team."
good,I had this job as ahighschool senior. it was ok for that time. I made $7.50/hour. the fitting room was always a mess. I barely got called to the registers. I was expected to persuade the customers to get jcpenney credit cards.
good,The time I've been working at this company has helped me grown as a person. There is not one day that I don't learn anything new. The hardest part of my job is that I tend there is not enough time to do everything the same day.
good,Working at JCPenney Wheaton Mall was my first retail job. It was honestly an amazing experience and I recommend young people who are looking for experience to consider applying. It didn't even feel like work the majority of the time; I was surrounded by people my age (I was 18 at the time) and understanding adults who took the time to train and develop the skills within me. Words cannot describe how awesome my experience was. The environment is friendly and management has your back!
good,There is always work to be done here. It is a steady paced and encouraging place to work. unfortunately in the market we are in all retail chains have concerns about longevity
good,Working at jcpenney was good. It helped me gain my skills in customer service. The only reason I left was because of management. Everything changed. The management to me got a little bit more rude. overall the manager I had before the one I do have now was the best manager I'll ever have. He was very considerate to everyone any actually cared about us and treated us like family.
good,"I worked in the men's department, customer service, cash register, keeping the department clean at all time, helped customer find items on the floor or other store by searching on the computer."
good,It was a fun but kinda rough job at first but got better as I learned along the way. Seasonal gets packed and the clothes you just folded become unfolded.
good,"I would come into work, have meetings, prepare what I needed for the day. Sometimes there was more to do then there is time. The company expects so much with little to no help at all and giving each store little hour for associates."
good,It was a a very good job but I wanted better opportunities but the management and the people working there are very nice and work well around your schedule
good,"At the time i worked here i was still in high school, it was a cool first job. The staff was very helpful and took me under their wings. The management was also very understanding and helpful. This is a fast paced store especially during the holidays."
good,I could say that my team was very diverse and also willing to help one another. If someone ever needed help we all helped one another.  Definitely had a good team to work with.
good,the job was enjoyable for the most part except for the unrealistic expectations that they wanted for putting all the clothes in stack on the shelves because the store was very small.
good,"Its a great place to work but Im not sure about longterm."
good,"Staff was great made some good friends working at JCPenny."
good,It was ok. The only stressful part was during holidays.The clean up was horrible because they didn't want to put on too many employees. They didn't pay that well. If you're in school this is the perfect job for you!
good,The job overall was a good one. It was pretty tough but it was alright. Co-workers were nice and helped you out. You have to communicate a lot........
good,"Good company, however like many retailers it is just about the money. Wouldn't consider them a family friendly store, have to work early hours on thanksgiving (they say it is volunteer, in reality it is work or you don't have a job because no one volunteers to work those days.) In the 6 years I worked there they restructured the company 6 times. So maybe someday they will get it right."
good,"Management is not helpful when needed, no hours or paid vacation for partime associates. Good first job or student job................................"
good,JCP is a great company to grow up in retail in. Lots of room to advance.  I moved up really fast due to my experience as a manager. I would strongly recommend them for a part time job or for someone looking to gain retail experience to advance their career.
good,Great company and benefits too bad they are closing the logistics center because it was a great commute. Management was fair. Hardest part of the job was walking the long parking lot to the entrance.
good,"Good place to work used to be. then evything is changed. Nice environment of people. If you good with what you do, you will get good benefits and promotions."
good,"I worked at this company for several years, being hired several times. Originally I was hired for seasonal positions. Every time I was hired I did want to stay to keep employment. As a high school student this was a great job opportunity. As a full-time college student and single parent this was not so easy. I did make some advancement but it took a VERY long time. I was also working from the very bottom of the ladder so that might explain why. Pay at hiring seemed ok for a starting wage, but raises were not what I had hoped for at all. I believe every time we had opportunity for raises I received highest remarks during my reviews and earned 10 cents per hour as my raise. The rate of minimum wage increased more than the pay during the period of five years I worked there. The other problem was hours. If you have full time availability your probably ok. If there are hours you cant work because of school or family, don't look for much as far a weekly hours go. I had to leave this position because I was going to college and when my availability changed my work hours were cut to just a few a week. I was willing to work and wanted to work at least 20 hours a week, but they reduced my hours because of my availability and it made it near impossible to even pay for gas to get to school some weeks. Because they wouldn't work with my schedule, I had to leave. If they would have been more flexible I would have probably stayed longer."
good,They had great teamwork and excellent managing.  Mostly just remodeled the place throughout the month. The most enjoyable part about the job was the break room.
good,Since I have left JCPenney many changes have been implemented and I cannot give an accurate evaluation of the current work culture. When I was there I loved the interaction with all the employees and made many lasting friendships.
good,most of the supervisors were helpful. they tried to teach us how to do the job right . in the beginning job can be over wellming.coustomers are hard to please when you are learning your way around
good,"Enjoyed my time at JC Penney, That was a very long time ago. it was my second job and I loved it. I worked 6:00pm to closing. and week ends. i ran the office. balancing tilts at the end of the night for deposits the next day."
good,The company treats their imployees well but it is hard to keep a position and the hours are all over the place and you might find jumping from one deparment to another
good,I love this job it with the best job ever I ever had but I had to stop because I had issue problems with having daycare with my children at night time.
good,"I enjoyed my time at JCPenney. The only stressful part of working at JCP was the pressure to get credit applications. Even with company payroll cuts, it was still a fun place to work."
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working at this location. I had a great work family and really enjoyed being a supervisor. As a full-time associate my benefits were  great. I left this company because of the hours. Working retail is tough when you have a child at home and want to be there for them on the weekends and holidays. When working in a small town it is hard to advance unless willing to relocate to the larger cities.
good,Safety Meeting 
good,Great place to work in a retail environment.  I learned to work with others and provide supreme customer service.  The management team was always mentoring new employees to provide customer service too all who entered the store.
good,"Basically a Fast Paced job with a small group of co-workers"
good,Management was the only thing I did not like about JCPenney. Nothing was ever good enough. They take advantage of you. And you are not appreciated at all. The discount was really good though.
good,"I enjoyed my time at JC Penney's, co workers were nice and we all seemed to get along. The manager, was very accommodating to family matters, and was a pleasant man to work for. I would open the store in the morning by myself, and get my work done without any supervision and in a timely fashion. It was a lot easier getting the merchandise onto the selling floor, without distractions."
good,It was an okay store just not a very busy Store and could be very boring at times you would have to look for things to do customers could be very rude but you just have to learn to deal with that and go on
good,Too many hairdressers without clientele to compete with for walkins which were far and few. The commission/productivity scale was hard to figure out  and makes it hard to make money.
good,For the most part a great place to work. Our manager feeds us well on many occasions and treats us with respect. It is sometimes hard to fit breaks in due to a lack of employees to cover budget.
good,"When I worked for J.C.Penney I was a stylist in their salon. It was a fun job, however the pay was minimum wage. Our manager at the time also allowed customers to get their money back so much that it became well known in the community and customers would do it on a regular basis to all of us."
good,Its fun but after a while it really starts to feel like high school. The managers are too friendly and its hard to take then serious. Pay is good and hours were nice
good,"The work was relatively easy to do, the hardest thing was keeping up with the boxes you packed up and had to add up at the end of the day. The people where slightly nosy but not hard to work with. Over all a good place to work for"
good,This was my first job after staying home with my kids for 5 years. I wanted to get back into the work field. But with something easy going. I thought this company since i shopped here a lot would be great. So I gave them a try. And so far so good.
good,"This company was a great place to work. the past 10 years was full of changes. learning a new computer system. going paperless. The workplace was a great learning place. learned the new Oracle system excel, Microsoft etc thru all that we had great fun. great managers along with great team leads. Lots of activities. United Way, the road home,"
good,"Very busy ,  with computer work , review floor plans and hand out task. Learning how to work with all kinds of people, but it all is worth it . The hardest part is to make everyone happy when they all have different views. The most enjoyable is seeing your work come together."
good,"I've worked at JCPENNEY for a little over a year at this point. Being retail it is generally tedious, little-no weekends off, and dreadful hours during the Holiday season. That said, most of the managers were kind and the co-workers were fun to be around. Again, I generally recommend this job for people only looking to do part-time work. Most of the time if you are no ringing out customers, you are recovering the sales floor, although this may vary from department, so if that sounds like your kind of gig, I'd say go for it."
good,The lack of communication between teams creates added (unnecessary) work.  There are managers in position that will pull signs placed by the pricing team without communicating why.  The signs are misplaced and lost creating extra work for an already busy pricing team.
good,I like the job an the people I just felt sometimes they ask things to be done that wasn't mention during hiring interview such as pick up things while they were standing next to
good,"The management team, with the exception of the store manager, was mediocre. The Store Manager was always there for you and would always pitch in when and where needed. The management team directly under him, however, did not entirely care to help where needed; they would always have the supervisors do their job."
good,"This job was an excellent way to get into the retail industry. Not only was it flexible, but due to it being a large department store, you became knowledgable about all areas of retail."
good,Working at jcpenney is slow-paced and provided me with a fun working experience. It gave me a lot of experience in customer sales and customer service.
good,I loved working at JCPennies because it was not super stressful and the people I worked with were great. I would not have left if the company had not decided to close down our store.
good,Love working here. I was employed while the company still offered a pension. This keeps me there. They are flexible with my schedule and offer a good discount.
good,It's ok. I'd say for more for like a younger person it work's best. They are very good if you need family time or need to leave town for emergencies etc.
good,Good benefits customers were happy for the coupons. Greet friendly and innovative made sure the employees was comfort and if had any question will be known
good,It's a good starting job.  I would mainly say it was a temporary thing. Over time it starting changing and and it just didn't feel the same working there. But overall not a bad place.
good,it was my very first experience to work and i learned a lot about customer service and retail job. we had a wonderful team work and so friendly. the management was so supportive.
good,I was able to help my elderly customers shop. Help design the floor with new merchandise. Work multiple departments. Work with people I can relate to on different levels. I was able to learn about different cultures. It was a good experience but I had to move on to what I really wanted to do. Medicine!
good,"I've worked for JC Penney Co. off and on for over twelve years, at two separate locations."
good,"This location had a hot head for a manager. However, that never stopped me from coming into work early to set up and start a positive day. Lots of room for growth."
good,"Working with JCPENNEY have teach me a lots of values. Respect the people you work with is a plus caring and understading to make a work environment more pleasing , make sure costumer are complete satisfied."
good,"JC Penney was a great first job to have, right before going off to college. My co-workers were friendly and helpful when needed. Most days we're busy, which was a good thing for me. The managers, for the most part, were helpful. I did see issues with discrimination from some of the higher level employees, when theft became an ongoing problem within the store. That experience is what led me to quit."
good,"Jcpenney was extremely competitive. The management was alright, not the best. Did not give good attention to associates, or seem to care. Breaks were short, and store was always very slow."
good,"I had a Plant Manager that was a total Pain. She told me she didn't like me because I was friends with a former Supervisor she disliked. Besides that, the pay was ok, but the year increases barely meant an increase."
good,"great discount."
good,"Supervise and schedule decorators and installers for home visits to sell custom drapery and flooring and installation. Data entry of all orders. Maintain hardware inventory."
good,"As long as you do your job, you'll keep your job. Management really pushes icaps and customer service. The job is very doable. The workplace is very diverse and many employees are easy to work with."
good,I love working with people. This has been one of my favorite jobs I've had. Everyone gets along great. It's been the least stressful job I've ever had. The pay isn't the best. Overall its a easy place to work for.
good,"Fun place to work, but they did not pay well.  You never got the hours you would be told you would.  I would have to trade shifts constantly to see my children.  The people were ever changing, but almost always pleasant to work with."
good,I personally love my job at Jcpenney. But it could be a challenge somedays. I enjoy working when the store is busy because you don't have to find anything to do because there is already alot to do.
good,The best part of the job was interacting with the customers. Restocking and reorganizing the stock rooms was also pretty fun for me. The people that worked there were pretty cool and very diverse.
good,I had a good time working for jcp. I just had a very hard time keeping up with the company policy for production. If the production rates were lower I probably could've made it.
good,This was my first job as a licensed stylist. Very great place to start fresh and build. Management at the time was not very good. Barely any goal setting and encouragement. Would love to work as the manager at this salon.
good,"i enjoyed working at jcpenney the supervisors are very friendly but makes sure u get the work done. They done hover over u while u work , they trust u to get the job done and even helps at time. my only problem was they pay below new york's minimum wage"
good,"It can be stressful, but it was a nice environment, the people were nice, including the supervisors.  They gave out bonuses to encourage us. The hardest part of the job was making the sales."
good,"For this job, I worked for six days as an employee for the week of Thanksgiving and Black Friday. I do not suggest starting off working during the holiday rush, but all together, it was a great company to work for and management was cheery and eager to help."
good,"A typical day involved receiving and processing shipments. I learned how to receive and process shipments. The hardest part of the job was occasional heavy lifting, most enjoyable was the people I met while working there."
good,"I worked in the Window's Department within the Home section. I worked on commission, so my base pay was a lot lower than other employees. In some months, it was easy to sell a lot of blinds and curtains, but in other months I made little to no commission. This made it very hard to pay my bills. I could have switched departments, but management tried guilt-tripping me into staying in the Window department because they didn't have anyone else to work it. It was a very boring job when you were busy, but they still expected you to find something to do. Sometimes that meant organizing the same shelf ten times. Several of my coworkers were awesome, but the actual manager wasn't very understanding with my school schedule."
good,I had the experience to work for jcpenny warehouse and my time there was very productive and a learning experience all around. management were very fair and honest.
good,"It was a fun learning experience. It was hard on the weekends, people are really messing, leaving clothes on the floor and leaving the fitting room a mess but I like cleaning and organizing so it wasn't too bad. I did enjoy working with my co-workers made my days faster."
good,"Working at JcPenney was a great first job experience for me. I got to learn a lot of new things and definitely was able to work on my customer service skills. Days working at JcPenney were usually the same, sometimes it would get crowded and at times it was just a relaxed calm day at work. It was great meeting some customers and even having some customers remembering who I was. Working here also taught me some more on problem solving with customer satisfaction. For example, if a customer wasn't pleased with something that was ordered online or was having trouble with finding a specific item in the store I was able to help them. Working here was just a good first experience to have."
good,I love the people who work at this store.  I've been here for 6 months and I have never worked with such a great group of people.  The management are very nice as well.
good,I loved the people that I worked with as a team. Some people were there to work and others were there to collect a paycheck and nothing more. I was part of a recovery team and just helped keep the store looking nice and organized. Hardest part was having to stay after hours during the holidays and back to school days. Enjoyable part was the people I worked with in my team.
good,Worked very early hours. Receiving merchandise and organizing everything before the store opened. Sometimes I worked over time and helped out customers whenever needed.
good,"Workplace culture where they have employees come from different countries."
good,"Overall pretty good workplace, definitely a lot of opportunity and room to grow. The benefits offered are really great and helpful, but the morale and overall feel between co-workers can get negative. Most of the time it is pretty good"
good,"There's a lot of changes happening in the company. It is a good working environment. Always busy, always on your toes. Pay is not that great for being a big store."
good,I learned how to run the registers. I learned how to do diamond inventory nightly. I learned how to change watch batteries. It was a fun place to work.
good,"If you're part of the store management, your work life > family life especially when there's upcoming corporate visits."
good,Love working here. Coworkers are very friendly. Everyone look out for one another. Hours are flexible. However there is little to non advancement at the store.
good,"This was my first retail job. After school I would go to work. I learned a lot about the retail business and how to provide outstanding customer service. Management was organized and helpful. The workplace was professional and I did not find myself talking to a lot of co-workers. Most of the workers were older and it was difficult to make conversation with them. I really enjoyed the customer service aspect of the job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with uneasy customers. Overall, it was a great first job."
good,"I enjoyed almost every aspect of this job, I only really had one issue with one manager. I feel some of the management team needs to help their employees out, and a couple of the managers need to learn to word things a bit nicer and friendlier towards customers. Hardest part of the job was getting everything JUST right for one manager, the others understood, not everything would be absolutely perfect all of the time. Most enjoyable part of my work environment is the other employees, I love working with pretty well every single one of them. I learned not everyone is cut out for customer service, I particularly am, I love helping my customers and making sure they leave smiling and come back to see me another time."
good,Jcpenney's was my first job and i learned a lot from them. My manager was nice enough to work with my schedule because I was a college student. It had its pro's and cons.
good,"Jcp has very little room for anyone to grow in the company. There are less than 15 full time employees and 90 percent are managers. If you're not a manager, you don't get full time. Other than that, I've had a great experience working with my team. The company has unrealistic ideas of how things run in the store and they want you to balance a huge workload meant for more than one person. If corporate got out of their offices and worked a week in a store, maybe they'd understand the changes need to be done for us to be at the top of the retailer list. I used to love Jcpenney when I first got hired. While I still fully support the success of the company, it's the people that make me stay. Without a great team, stores collapse and associates are miserable which then passes onto the customers."
good,"Good work for start, but need more organization and need good benefits for partime employers. Security is good also they have a good environment and sale."
good,"I worked during the holiday season so everyday was very busy and you always had something to do. Coworkers are friendly and overall nice environment from the team, excluding managers and supervisors."
good,"Easy job, but always keeping busy with many things to accomplish. With keeping up with cash register and customer needs . Co-workers work well together ."
good,"In this role a typical day consisted of a very unpredictable experience day to day. On some days the center is very slow, while others there is not enough coverage. Most centers operate with as little as 1-5 employees staffed, so you will really get to know your co-workers. Overall this was a very unique experience and you learn a trade that will last a lifetime."
good,"JC Penney (Arcadia) is a highly competitive environment. It kind of takes away from the fun of doing what I love, simply loving and caring about people and the products they love. I made  it clear to the staff that I was unavailable on Sundays(church work) and because I do not have a car, I would need to be scheduled at a time appropriate  for me to be able to leave the mall at 9 pm so I could catch the bus at 9:20 pm at the mall or else I would have to walk far in the dark by myself to get to a different bus stop, but they scheduled me during those times anyway which was extremely inconvenient for me and them. "
good,"-enjoyed greeting customers and providing help in any way that I can"
good,"I have no problems working there, except for the fact that the management comes off as unprofessional. They are never at their desk and never answer their phone. They are always HEAVILY understaffed and half of the associates never seemed to show up at work. Not to mention that no matter whether you are still training or not, they WILL make you work overtime whether its flexible with your schedule or not. And they HEAVILY underpay."
good,"Catered to clients needs as far as hair went. Learned to work and socialize at the same time. Had great relationships with my co-workers, they were very helpful and caring. Cosmetology is full of many new creative ways of achieving certain looks, colors, patterns, etc.The hardest part would be to keep up but when you enjoy what your doing, it can be the most enjoyable along with building relationships and meeting new people. Management was horrible."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of folding cloths, making sure items were off of the floor and put where they needed to be, and assisting customers if they had any questions or concerns. I learned how to be more customer oriented. I loved the people that I worked with. everyone was so nice and friendly. the hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the store with little number of employees. the most enjoyable part was seeing what you accomplished during a hard day at work"
good,"Learned how to complete credit card applications. Set up displays, completed transactions. Worked with a team completing inventory. Maintained the children's floor. Making sure displays and tables are clean and neat."
good,"A typical most days starts at 7am and ends at 6pm."
good,"At JCP, it was very interesting. I loved working with people, and helping them with their desired needs. The hardest part of my job would have to be not having something a customer wanted. But, I did enjoy working with such diverse associates."
good,"It got me through the bills and life. co workers were nice. Management contradicted each other a lot. No room to move up in the company in this position,"
good,"Provided great customer service in a retail setting, maintained and stocked merchandise, handled cash, accepted payments, and worked as a team to provide excellent customer service. Assessed customers needs and provided assistance and information on products."
good,"this company registers are very slow and there are not enough associates working on a floor. the store is not clean, there are mice running around the place in plain sight."
good,"I worked there from holiday season 2013 to August 2015. My typical work day consisted of handling money, providing customer service, making sales, taking online orders, folding/cleaning up fitting rooms, moving fixtures, organizing stock room, working in the men's store, men's shoes, women's shoes, cleaning up the floor and closing/opening procedures. What I learned is that retail can be fun but also can be a nightmare if only a few people pull their weight in the store. Management was great when I began at Jc Penney's but before I left the company, it began to slip and the manager stopped caring about the men's side of the store. Frequent call outs, no managers or leads insight and some days I would not get my 15 minute breaks or even lunches till the end of my shift. Hardest part of my job was probably on black friday, working the crowd and rush of people. I enjoyed my time at Jc Penney's despite it falling apart at the end, for which I wish good luck to a company who only cares about credit card applications over a entire store slipping."
good,it is a good place for a first time worker or some one looking for a part time job. It has fixable hours to work with parents who need to drop off or pick up kid from school.
good,As soon as you get there all you do all day is clean and ring up customers . I learned how to clean and how to fold shirts of all types.Management was very nice and very understanding.The hardest part of the job was folding all day making sure all the departments were clean. The most enjoyable was how the company did appreciate you with buffets and little gift they gave.
good,"A typical day at work is based on customer service, craft and sales, there is a lot of standing and moving around but in the end customers come first, so that defines your day."
good,A place with good working environment that helped in further enhancing my skill set with global exposure to the HR practises.
good,"The salary at JCP is basic. Most employees start of at 8-9 per hour. However, the company will also compensate you based on your experience. I enjoyed working with my managers and peers. It was a great working environment. Friendly managers and employees. The only issue i found was the company only offered part time positions which meant no health benefits and not enough hours given."
good,"I loved the job but had no days they barely call you into work so very little money."
good,Preparing merchandise for sales floor. And placing it in the correct place and way on the sales floor. Alot of teamwork involved which I enjoyed! I enjoyed arranging merchandise on the floor to make it more shoppable. Hardest part of the job was not having enough hours to have the department look it's full potential!
good,"my typical work day at JC penney was to come in and make sure fitting rooms were clean, ask any qestions customers had and cashier"
good,Many different customers and tourists which gives the opportunity to learn customer service and how to deal with different personalities and backgrounds.
good,"A typical day at work for me now consists on having to open the cash register and count the money, make sure we have enough money for the day if not go to the bank. I always like to be at work twenty minutes before my shift starts so i can make copies, clean my station or anything that has to do with my job. After that i have to have a smile in my day and start taking my clients back. Sometimes i wish i was a manager because i feel like i can be a pretty good manager and take care of my co-workers and my clients more than what i see it happen. The hardest part of my job would be, be on my feet all day, and sometimes without taking time to have a snack i work and a fast face environment and i love it, just the standing part take a big toll on me other than that i am perfectly fine i never have a bad day. The most enjoyable part of my job is that i get to talk to different types of people get to know them and help them look presentable for their job or just in general. I like the fact that with just seeing me and helping them they will say '' do what ever you want i trust you''."
good,I learned a lot about people while working for JcPenney.  Jcpenney has a long tradition of customer service and it really shows in the dedication and focus of management and the employees.
good,"I just replenished and organized stock. I learned how to operate a scanner so that was cool. The management was friendly and patient with their employees, can be stern if needed to. My co-workers were very easy to get along with and helped show me the ropes. The hardest part was showing up super early to unload the truck of merchandise. The fun part was helping set up displays."
good,"A typical day at work would become very busy. I'm the only associate scheduled at the moment because other associate is taking a lunch. I have customers that need to check out as well as customers whom are waiting for someone to help them with finding the merchandise. Instead of panicking, I take a deep breathe and prioritize. I will check out the customer whom was waiting, then I will help the customer so the work load will run more smoothly while acknowledging customers and insuring them that I will be with as soon as I can. If it becomes to much, I will call a supervisor to help. I don't want any customer upset."
good,"Meetings to review on what is on the agenda, for example: discounts, changes for credit cards, new merchandise and brands names that are going to be discontinued in the store. Customer's always comes first and inform the customers in the proper way."
good,"Working at Jcpenney was a good first job. The work was easy to get a hang of and my co-workers were all fun to work with. The mangers seemed to be understanding of my busy schedule and would willingly help me adjust it. Overall it was a good work environment and a simple, but often times challenging, job."
good,"Benefits not good because company was not profitable"
good,from time to time the management in the store would questionable. the associates generally banded together to make sure tasks were completed.
good,"I absolutely loved my co-workers. Everyone was so friendly and I made lifelong friends while working here. Management was also amazing. There was one manager that there was no pleasing and she constantly berated people, but the rest of the managers were great and very helpful. A typical day at work was basically ringing up customers, helping customers with questions when not ringing up, and finishing a project that your manager asked you to do. The hardest part of the job was when there was no help on with you and you were cornered by many customers or when you have a line. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you had co-workers on with you and work was equally distributed. I loved my co-workers."
good,"Morning's at Penny's are slow and steady. The people are (usually) kind and independent. By the afternoon the pace has picked up and the store has come alive. I have picked up a few lessons in the store such as haggling and prices not matching what they are displayed, leading to a back in forth conversation about whats wrong and whats right. The Penny's staff is a team of wonderful people who helps bring a sense of belonging in the store. Most days management has their has full coordinating the store for big events and sales. The hardest part of the job is most likely one of the more simple things and that is staying busy. The store itself is filled with possibilities and the most enjoyable part of it is the people you meet."
good,"Manage production and accuracy,,Order supplies,Managed hours, "
good,"Working at this company was a good experience to stay busy and assist customers."
good,"build orders , load and unload trailers. good place to work but not much as job security"
good,"I learned to properly use a RF Scanner to consolidate orders.  As the last line of defense we made sure all merchandise was accurate, secure, and being delivered to its proper shipping door.  The company as a whole isn't doing that well."
good,Went in counted register. Helped customers find the perfect shoe by measuring each guest. Retrieve the shoe and if the customer liked it rang them up.
good,Good Place to have first job. I learned lot. I was there very part time but I have no complaints.
good,"The management was great. I've improved on my customer service working at JCPenney. My days were very regualr, I worked in the Home department and I would check customers items out and/or returned their items."
good,"Great place to work. Fun, fast paced work environment. The culture is not as inclusive, however before i left they began making employees feel like we were part of a team."
good,The wage is honestly the hardest part about the job at it is a minimum wage job if they payed more I wouldn't mind it much.
good,"During this time of employment, the Management and associates were fun to work with. A great feeling of accomplishment  for a job well done. Potential to advance."
good,"JcPenney is a great first job especially fro students, they are very flexible with your schedule and are willing to work around your needs and request. A typical day at work would be maintaining the floor, customer service, and ringing up products. I have learned a lot from this company and have been grateful to be apart of their team, this job has given me a confidence boost and have made me a much more social person. Management is good although sometimes its hard to get any help from them unfortunately. There honestly is not any hard parts f this job, everything is easy and very basic. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people you work with and the awesome customers that you help regularly. Co workers are drama free and are very friendly."
good,"It's a good setting. People come in. Sometimes you have some people with issues but if you handle it well, it could go smoothly or sometimes you just have to brush it off. Co workers are usually good. Men's department is always fun and productive. petty drama can be found anywhere you go but just keep focused and you'll be just fine. Supervisors, well, have on and off days. For stock, sometimes you may feel you're not appreciated as much as you should. Especially when you work your job and do the same as the Sales specialists. But that's life. If you get a good enough position, you can do a fraction of the work for a multiple of the pay. So yeah, look out for that. It's honestly an okay place to work. Always something new to learn, new people to meet, new things to do. It can be an enjoyable work experience."
good,A typical day was getting to work early and setting up shoe displays for sales opportunities. I learned how to organize shoes by color and brand. It was usually only one person working in my department during the day. The hardest part of the job was a lot of standing and not enough breaks. The hardest part of the job was climbing ladders to store shoes with their boxes.
good,the typical day was very busy with many customers. i learned how toorganize tables and be more organized with my clothes
good,"The managers were very nice and I liked the way they did things there just the way the displays were set up, the process of taking care of customers, everything. I would go back if the opportunity were to arise."
good,"Great co-workers, fun but also productive."
good,JCPenney is a great retail organization to work for.  The company is very passionate about its customers and that shows with the decision making.  I find it an enjoyable place to work.
good,"JC Penney is a good company for younger people to earn their money.  Management stays around for a long time, so there is little to no room for advancement.  Working there for a number of years, I can only remember perhaps four or five people finding a promotion due to little room for additional talent."
good,I guess the hardest part when people expected was trying to read peoples mind and to understand micro managers.
good,"This has been a great company to start my career with.  They are always willing to move and promote hard working leaders and are dedicated to your success.  If you work for JCP don't expect to have any work life balance.  While hard work is appreciated it is also expected and necessary. It is common to work on average a 60 hour work week due to the lack of management currently employed in this corporation. It has been ok for me, but not a place if you have young children or plan to have children."
good,"On a typical day you would go in and check the department you were in, fold/hang clothing, assist customers, work the cash register, and maintain general cleanliness."
good,A typical day at JC Penny was easy going and busy. I enjoyed all co workers and management.
good,"I would work where the store needed me that day ranging from working the sales floor to unloading the merchandise truck to setting up the visual layout of the store to even pricing and signing."
good,"•	Supervised Sales Operations in Accordance with Store Policies and Procedures"
good,"A typical day consist of: Customer Service, communicated with customers to resolve problematic situations. Handled escalated calls."
good,"Management is screwed up every one is confused and not being able to handle their employes in a effective manner. It is ultimately not fair to either parties. Makes more work for everyone. There is so much confusion in how things should be run and makes disorganization less productivity, and more stress."
good,I enjoyed working there. I always had a positive attitude. It wringing up people.as fun
good,everything was about numbers... If you didn't satisfy a customer on the day they needed a 100 dollars...to meet quota..no refund
good,"I found the schedule to be very good. I would arrive at work and having had excellent training when I started with J.C. Penney, Inc. I would know exactly what was expected of me daily. All of the breaks which were allotted by law were strictly adhered to by the company. Management was very easy to communicate with and managers had a heart for the employees daily success. Co-workers were very friendly and many friendships were formed amongst them. The most difficult part of the job came when there was a very rare customer complaint. Usually the customer complaining had a rough day elsewhere and they were easily calmed as a result. The most enjoyable part of the job came, when you saw the customer smile because they were truly thankful for the help they received from you."
good,"I learned a lot and became very mature when I had this job. I had a lot of duties because my boss would leave by 4 pm and the rest of the day until close was all me working. I also helped her do her job with ordering new products. I loved the stylists there they got me through my day they were mother figures. The hardest part of the job was just if it was a busy day checking people in while answering three different phone lines got hectic, but it makes you learn more. The most enjoyable part was that I loved what I did. I loved making people happy telling them about our sales or giving them a product they really wanted."
good,"The day starts with to see that merchandise are all in right place,open the register,make sure every thing is clean then feel happy to greet first customer .Learned that everybody loves greeting and attention ,though you cannot make everybody happy but try your best and give good customer service.Management varies,some are really good people and listens your problems and try to help."
good,there is teamwork & a good working relationship exist in the store.
good,"A typical day at JC Penney involves a lot of physical work. whether its stocking shelves, building fixtures, or working on the loading dock. My co-workers  are very helpful with everything possible"
good,JCPenny Catalog call center. Training wasn't that great either.
good,Do to all the revenues it's difficult to keep up with the changes
good,"A typical day as the Support Expert is scheduled start is at 6am, trucks pull up to the dock at 6:30am.  My team starts to unload pallets between 6 and 28 and then we start to organize the hung apparel.  My team gets this completed in approximately 5 hours then it is taken to the sales floor.  While the team is taking racks and cages to the sales floor I am getting ready for the next days truck with prepping what goes back to the dc.  I am also managing dot com orders with checking them in, organizing them into there bins and then entering them so the automated dialer can call the customer to know there order has arrived.  I am then organizing damages and liquidation products preparing these items to be returned.  In the afternoon we receive Fed EX and UPS separating  and NFS items and delivering to different departments.  Key items such as jewelry has to be secured and checked then delivered to the department.  On the days we do not get trucks my responsibility is to prepare returns in jewelry and other goods.  In jewelry this includes making photo copies of the item, logging it, entering it on UPS for pickup and securing until the UPS carrier arrives.  My day usually ends around 3:30."
good,"The most enjoyable part of any job, has been that of customer service. I enjoy problem solving, "
good,"My co-workers on the upstairs floor and some downstairs as well are the best part to my job. We like to joke and have fun but we get our work done while doing it. some of the management like my boss who is manager of the upstairs, and the Store Manager, are wonderful. The rest of the managers are mean, cold, heartless people who don't have people skills and should never have become managers, let alone part of the company. The hardest part of my job is keeping everything clean and organized on the shopping floor. Perfect displays of clothes get ripped apart by customers and fitting rooms are trashed constantly. There are also rude customers that come in almost everyday. Rules constantly change, and the department set up changes almost every week making it difficult to find anything. When you have good people working with you, a typical day is fun and we get things done without hassle."
good," a fun of laughter with customer, and doing and cutting hair   I have a learn a lot of ways to cut different styles and aso about the products they used they are so much to learn about hair and products   the management is very good they schedule you and work with you  my coworker are great the work with each other   the hard par of the job was dealing with customer that don't know what they wont   the enjoyable part of was making the customers happy and and the swonderful hair color they look great that what me happy when  they I ;love the cut or color"
good,Good company work well as a team and try to have everyone work together to make it a better company
good,commission jobs UGH.rude customers off and on.but overall it was a good company to work at
good,A typical day at work would be ringing up cusomers and empting fitting rooms. with some folding and haging of clothes. I learned how to help customers find and order a purchase a product online. Management was always helpful. My Co-workers were always helpful when I had any questions and nice to work with. the hardest part of the job was finding thigs to do when there was no customers to help. The most enjoyable part was ringing up customers ater helping them find what they were looking for.
good,-fix clothes
good,"A typical work day would involve setting out new merchandise, maintaining the department, and striving to do sales by encouraging customers to have a store credit card and highlighting the benefits. Delivering good customer service was always a key part of the job. I learned how to use my time efficiently since there were so many different tasks to get done in the work day. My co-workers and I worked together to keep our department running smooth and organized. The hardest part of the job was handling a disgruntled customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving praise for my hard work."
good,Helped customers look for what they needed. Everyone worked as a team.
good,"The company itself is great, they really teach you how important it is to go the extra mile for the customer, their values and point-of-view were respectable and understanding, they new how to treat a client like royalty and trained every one of us to do the same."
good,I learned and grew a lot in the customer service field in this position. Definitely glad to learn this skill of a trade.
good,"A typical workday consits of making sure all freight is hadled and shipped in a timely manner without damage or inaccuarcy. Ive learned that change within a company is a must.The managment always supported desicions made by employees as long as it would benifit production. My Co-workers came together to solve problems as a team. The hardest part of this job came around the Holidays, it was not hard but a challenge."
good,it is a great place to work however management spents to much time beating around the bush instead of just telling there staff what is going out
good,"Pros: Co-workers, easy money and great experince"
good,"When I first started, I loved my job. Interacting with different customers offers a great outlook on so many different aspects of life. However, with a new CEO came big changes. The management that had been with the store for years was let go, and those that took their place or were left over treated the employees horribly. The manager even made associates cry multiple times in front of their customers. Overall, would have been a great job if not for the higher-ups."
good,I was very young when I worked here.Everthing seemed hard but I rose to the challanges.I learned with time everything gets better.This job helped lay the foundation for the excellent customer service skills I have today.
good,"JCP Custom Decorating is job that involves interacting with customers who are interested in home decorating. A typical day in the life at JCP includes qualifying the customer, exploring their needs, creating the perfect design and closing the sale. Responsibilities include writing technical specs for the job, and following through with cross functional production and supply chain teams in order to ensure customer satisfaction."
good,Always Productive
good,the day started with invatory then a staff meeting before the store opened then it was full of helping custamers and keep the store in a save condition so it whould be save for every one too injoy
good,"During my time with this JCP has been a positive experience. Before the changes occurred the location that I employees was more family orientated. The possibilities were endless which gave me the opportunity to work hard and show how determined that I was to grow and become a strong positive part of the company. And within 6 months of employment I received two very welcomed promotions. Now needless to say all has changed. Our open door policy is never exercised. My staff has become repellant, assistance from my colleagues are unable required and the job has become overly stressful. Which leads me here. I miss being personal with a company that appreciate there employees and honors their consumers."
good,"I work from 4am till 12 pm. I supervise 11 people doing receiving merchandise for a retail store. I enjoyed being a part of the JC Penney replenishment team,we were like a big family and had lots of fun.The management team and I worked together to get the job done in a timely manner,however there were some commucation issues. The hardest part of the job was getting up at 2:30 am. My team was like my family and I enjoyed that"
good,typical work day was sales and cleaning.i worked well with all my co-workers.the most enjoyable part of my job was working with people

good,I enjoyed the fast paced aspect of the job. As well as the ability to meet and make life long friends.
good,"a typical day at work involved taking care of the customers, keeping my department clean and organized. i got along with all my co-workers and management."
good,"I worked at JC Penneys as a seasonal sales associate, and loved my job. One thing I didn't like were my managers. For example, when it was time to find out who they were keeping, they kept putting off having the meeting, and in the end they never told us if we were staying or not, they just stopped scheduling us. Usually I wouldn't mind much, but they told us they'd have a meeting and they didn't. Then when I went to ask, the lady was very rude. (it was her last week at this location, and she was upset. Very unprofessional)."
good,Even though this job was a temporary job I had a good experience. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful. I learned more on how to sell products more easily and keeping the clients happy and satisfied.
good,customer service keep area clean the most enjoyable part of this job would be having to interact with the customers
good,"I enjoyed working @ JCPenneys ,and it was fun for the most part.But i needed fulltime and it was really hard to get fulltime status,and fulltime benefits.And the pay does not compliment the work that you do,and the raises for the most part is none exist.And no easy to move up in company."
good,Great vacation policy.
good,the company was a good company very fair with worker very honest .
good,"Daily I drive sales in order to create gross profit. Challenging sales reports daily to make changes for advancement. In order to drive sales, I have to ensure that the associates are trained to deliver knowledge to customers about the products we offer. I enjoy associate engagement and learning the wins and opportunities through the business. The associate team are honest and they have one on one time with customers to communicate to me what can grow the business. My job is sometimes about coaching and associate development. Their are times where uncomfortable conversations must be held in order to produce the best associates."
good,This was a good place to work when in college and in high school. It helped me get by and helped me learn people skills and learn the basic skills of business.
good,"I love my job as a supervisor and the associate that work in my department. Over the years, I have learn the value of good customer services. From time to time I do get customers that can be a challenge, but I continue to keep a smile on my face and try to help them the best way I can. I love working with all the other supervisor, we're like a small family and tend to have lots of fun."
good,"I would have liked to stay, but was only hired for a 30-day project."
good,"Good working there,learn alot, there were always informative morning staff meetingswith the JC Penney staff that I got a cance to particpate in,"
good,good company to work for but they are steadily changing policies and procedures and consistantly reducing work hours
good,"whenever i wasnt servicing a client i had to work the reception area, the landry are and clean and sanitize"
good,This was a great company to work for. Great communication between coworkers and supervisor.
good,Love the people I work with. But not respected by all leads. One has made me cry a couple times and yelled at for no reason when I was doing what I was supposed to be doing.
good,It was a good first job to have. I worked with some awesome people and felt like I was able to work hard each day. It taught me how to work hard and be dependable.
good,Multitasking is a something i learned with this position. You really have to love customer service. JCPenney is not holiday friendly. they work with a backwards pyramid with the customer at the top and the front line cashiers second. it does not feel as if the front line associates are any where near the top of the pyramid.
good,Mainly a job for teens or people who don’t want to work a lot or prefer something more calm and relaxing. If you want a full time job with great benefits then I suggest you look elsewhere.
good,"JCPenney was my first job, and after working there a while they started to cut down hours so I had to get a second job. It was a good first job because it taught me good customer service tactics."
good,"The store I worked at was pretty decent. I didn't have to deal with any problematic coworkers and the salary was fine, so that was what encouraged me to stay longer than a few months. But this is essentially a sales job thanks to the higher-ups wanting you to make the customers sign up for the company's credit card and it can get annoying after a while. Not to mention the place can get very busy at times (especially during the holidays). So if you like working with customers, don't mind doing sales work and can handle a busy, fast-paced job then JCPenny would be a decent place to work at for a while."
good,"My review of Jcpennys is on an typical day of work everything once got smoother the more I learned everything quickly, I learned everyday how to become an better employee by assisting customers everyday I work its was quite enjoyable helping customers find what they wanted and got them home quicker with an smile on there face, the management was for the most part great , the hardest part of the job was my first day and because I was first learning everything but I learned it fast and it got easier."
good,For a stylist just starting out the salon is mostly slow after holidays and going back to school season. Had a hard time building a cliente. You get a discount in the salon and throughout the store.
good,"I enjoyed working at jcpennys, management was great. If I needed anytime off they where more then happy to give it to me. we had weekly meetings to talk about sales and what sales were going on so everyone was on the same page. it was an overall great experience."
good,"The work place can be nice. Your coworkers can easily become friends, and are people you can relate to. Managment can also be nice, but will sometimes take you for granted."
good,"I enjoyed JcPenney’s, but it was kind of poor at the management and comprehension. I had a good time with my employees, we worked great as a team, I just wish the managers took their job more seriously"
good,come in and take out merchandise or go to recovery and help get the store back to part. The managers are very chilled and not much help to the associates.
good,I work In the salon I love my job and the environment they pay fr salon worker is jus really low no one can live off 8hour and nobdy makes comission everyday so it's hard to bring home a good check other then pay everything else is great
good,"they were lacking on getting lunches and  breaks during busy hours."
good,"This place is a great place to get your feet wet and get a feel of what it's like working. However, my transfer made me not feel as great about working as what I used to feel. I was left completely in the dark about most of my information and how things would go, contacting the store is nearly impossible at times (even if you try all departments), and in general, the work gets repetitive. The staff there are very nice, however, and are a good team to work with."
good,"This would be a great job for kids first out of highschool ,or even a summer job. Depending on location and buisness, hours may very. But if you have a good sense of direction around the store, great energy around ALOT of people, then this would be a good job for you. Personally i liked working for JCP , but sadly My location i was at, wasnt doing too great in sales so i lost my hours. Also management wasn't all that great and began to take sides and or favorites. . and even with my experience there im not sure if i would recommend this to be a dream or long term job."
good,If you do not push yourself to go above they will hire from outside of the store. Goals are reasonable and the work is easy. It can get really hectic Durning the holidays so make sure you know how to move quickly and use critical thinking.
good,"Major changes made every Jan made the job more difficult, especially with associate cutbacks on the selling floor. All hours were put into the fulfillment team and at the registers with no one to help customers in the departments. Constant customer complaints of no selling floor associates hurt sales greatly!"
good,surviving the stressful challenge of the need for strong in person customer assistance expected by the customers in an environment that cant afford the resources due to on line sales shifts.
good,A typical day at work (depending on the position and your experience with customers) can be frustrating as there is almost always a lack of communication with protocol. Customers have little respect for keeping the order of clothing and there aren't many hours offered unless they like your work ethic or you get promoted.
good,JCPenney is a great first time job for teens who are still in high school. Management team some of them are very nice very helpful. it's very diverse.
good,"It was an okay experience. The co-workers were really good, and some of the management were extremely nice and understanding. However, they did work you. If you are a HUGE family person, do not take this job. I barely got to see my family ever because it's hard to get off for a vacation. They will guilt you into staying and over working, but they do make up for it by feeding you and throwing parties."
good,"This job was great while I needed it. I worked hard and got 2 promotions due to the high turnover of the job field. Although I got the 2 promotions I was still making less than 12 an hour. I would work there again if I absolutely had to but do not plan on it. I can tell you one thing though, I put the clothes back in a nice fashion because I now know how difficult it is as an employee to fold for hours."
good,My typical day at work is usually keeping the store clean and organized. I also help customers with all their needs. I learned better people skills and organizing skills. The management is always trying to strive to be a better company. The hardest part of the job is working holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job is that feeling of having a clean store
good,This was honestly one of my favorite jobs. The work was easy but fast paced.I loved everything but the pay. Plus they are now closed and it's a big bummer.
good,"I enjoy working with this company but not challenged enough and I prefer a better income there is not enough advertising for the salon, there are always certain people that play favorites and the customers are not distributed evenly. For the most part I also feel the product selection could be better and the education could be better in order to keep up with the constant changes in the hair industry"
good,It's not a bab place to work.But to many Supervisors that are lazy and only their to get paid.Doesn't really care about the employees just want the work done.Have employees that work here over 30 yrs and get the same pay rate for someone that's been there for 2 yrs.no pay increase for over 8 yrs
good,"Receive and Disburse  money to Customers"
good,"I started working here two years ago and they have treated me alright. I would suggest it to a high schooler as a first job. From my experience the management was good and for the most part, was an ok place to work."
good,"The position I held has been phased out. In Home Custom decorating faced a lot of challenges from top management and down."
good,"I worked at JCPenney for almost a year and never got a raise. When  I started, I had had 2 jobs before working for JCP. I started with a little more than minimum wage, and never got a raise, even though I was told I would before the six months mark. "
good,The job can be fast-paced but it's not complicated. You have to be motivated to serve customers. You are expected to do your part to help the store meet its sales goals.
good,"busy on certain days love my coworkers very easy to work with, manager is very understanding and great! can be slow at times lots of walk-ins and all brand new equipment"
good,"Scheduled 5-8 installers’ daily work of hanging custom-made window treatments across as many as 12 northeast Ohio stores."
good,It is a good job especially to start out with and has good pay and a flexible schedule. The managment can be kind and are understanding. There are great benefits that can be included and hours are good.
good,after my  shoulder surgery iff possiablity  I would like to start working after the holidays if possiable ? and to get more pay rases and respect from other co workers
good,"While working was an active experience, management pushes opening credit accounts to customers. While most of the customers I dealt with already had credit accounts, employees were still pressured to open as many accounts as possible. Only employees that opened many accounts continued on into longer positions."
good,"With my short time with the company I learned valuable customer service skills. However since I had a second job at the time, management was hesitant about scheduling and keeping me on after season. However it was a enjoyable experience."
good,"I think it’s a good place to work if you don’t have another job and play a sport. It is a bit hard at first but once you get the hang of it, it is easy"
good,They do have great management they help you will something there not hard just got to work hard. You will learn good fun stuff to do. The hardest part is that you always have to keep a smile on your face for the customers. Because some of them come in talking crazy looking at you mad. You just got to be a good worker and not say nothing crazy back. Because you at work and the customers is always right no matter what.
good,How the day went depended on the GMs mood and how we were doing in sales and credit for the day. the hardest part was being positive in a stressful environment.
good,Typical work day is cashiering and helping customer find their needs. Rarely does a manager have to be called for help. Sometimes the weekends got kind of hectic but overall if you are good on your feet and have patience this job is great for you.
good,"They rarely have associates on the floor recovering because most of them are at the cash register ringing customers, so the store is always a mess. Trying to find a particular item in a specific size in a mess is really difficult especially for Omni associates doing online orders, and they always expect a good score/rating all within a specific time frame. Its difficult when the store is messy all the time."
good,Penny's is not a growing company. They have not embraced the next generations shopping preferences even though the have systems in place to accommodate. They do not train or promote programs to grow their business.
good,"This was a fun environment to work in, that gave me the oppurtunity to work with many different types of employees and deal with many different types of customers."
good,"The job was fair, the coworkers were helpful, it was a safe job environment, I got to meet new people everyday, work with kids and adults, try to make the time good for the customers so they would want to come back, I would also help the Hispanics when they would come into the store with whatever they had to ask"
good,"Any day could be slow paced or fast paced, so you need to become adaptable to the change. Even if you are given a certain role, most likely you will learn another position, due to trying to be the most efficient in the work place. Most of the managers are very understanding which made working there alright."
good,JCPenney is a decent job to have for the summer or holiday season. The pay is Fairly decent and so is the actual work. Full time employment with JCPenney is most likely the most beneficial bet for working there due to the amount of hours given times the pay. The benefits and discount are a major plus!
good,Overall JCPenney is a great place to learn about retail and its a great starting job however they said their hours were flexible and most of the time they could not work around my schedule.
good,It gets busy all the time and i wasn't focused on one job. They were constantly putting me on the register and taking me to do other stuff out of nowhere.
good,"co-workers were fun and friendly, management could have been a bit better but the hours were flexible and an ideal job while in school. only down side was that at the time I was told I would not have the same shift on the same day of the week but found I would have to request it off."
good,"I was employed at the store in Lodi, Ca. for almost a year until they closed for good. I had the most positive first job experience there. After closing i transferred to the Stockton, Ca store and absolutely did not care for the way it was being managed. I quit after about 2 months."
good,"I loved working in home its slower paced less dealing with clothing messes. Overall though it was retail and retail is retail, management is good though, if your looking for a good part time job JCP is the way to go."
good,it nice friendly job place to work at I enjoy the people there but for me it not for me I am there so I can get a pay check I think they do a lot at reg to much info to put in for people
good,"Must be able to work in a fast pace environment.  Not enough people on the sales for to assist customer during peak time, and not enough cashiers and registers opened during peak time."
good,being around so many different styles and clothes at all times was different for me. i was working going to school and was a single mother so everything counted.
good,"I mostly worked behind the scenes in replenishment and visual departments, where the work was never done. The hours and job were perfect for me until the company changed CEOs and started changing everything. After that, I felt like just another number."
good,"for the most part, working at JCpenney was pretty fun because it is a very friendly store for one, i was pretty much friends with everyone there. the only thing i did not like there is that some of the managers do not really acknowledge how much work we do for the company and take us for granted"
good,There is always something to do when working in retail.  Work shifts went by quick. The hardest part of the job is learning you can't please everyone. Remember to try your best and you will be rewarded.
good,"I really liked how personal the people were. Especially the Manager, she was a very down to earth person. Even her supervisor was a fun person to talk to."
good,"Enjoyed many years of service.  My Home Manager was excellent to work under.   I enjoy meeting new people & seeing to their needs.  I would like to see JCP get back to having more selection of inventory in the home dept.  Need to bring back more selection of vacuum sweepers, lamp shades, dishes, glassware, bed skirts, rugs etc.  Too many times we didn't have items in the store...have to order online.  Also, most weekdays there are no employees to wait on customer's in the home dept.  Customer's would stand at home checkout counter with no one to wait on them."
good,"The store was a nice place to work but the job that i had as a janitor, i think it was slow-paced but there were times it did get a little busy but it was okay."
good,"na no answer, cutting hours Had to get a 2nd job,"
good,"The location where I worked no longer exists.  At the highest pay grade you load about 50,000 cartons of stock per shift.  Repeatedly lifting 10-15 lbs. of clothing for at least half of the shift."
good,Can be alittle stressful but all togethr its a great company to work with if yoiu atre a student.  The good part about this is that it was salary if I had the chance to go back I would  do things a little diofferent than what I did as a manager but hionestly I loved the job.
good,There really no hands on training provided. There programs and computer are way behind needs to be update to really do your completely. This job mostly focus on employees doing wrong then the shoplifters. Needs to get equipment in place to slow the shoplifters down.
good,"Customer service, answering phones, cashier, putting new merchandise out on the racks, organizing merchandise. Stocking, tagging merchandise and merchandise visual display."
good,"It was a pleasant  job but very difficult during the closing times around midnight or 1:00 AM.  I have to quit for medical problems. They  engage only part-time workers. I was working in the furniture department and it was at a slow path but in the windows department when I used to work before, it was like crazy. They decided to put us on commission and everything changed. The formers workers became crazy without respect for the new ones."
good,flexible hours allow you to work when you can do not have anything else  to say about  the  flexible hours only problem is working every weekend and no sick days.
good,"Friendly and kind workplace with positive people. They cut hours too often, good for someone or a student who is looking for an extreme part time position."
good,"Overall great company to work for if you are looking for a JOB.  Eventually you hit a pay cap and you realize that they are hiring supervisor trainees straight out of college before any supervisor positions open.  They either make a position for the new supervisor through rotation, or generally fill vacant positions with them as they open up.  I was in the building for 6 years and the experience managed to get filtered out to the point where none of the supervisors (about 7-8 on my shift) had been with the company longer than me.  This left no room for advancement unless you get a college degree, which they don't verbally encourage nor do they offer tuition reimbursement.  I liked working here a lot, but a college degree is not required to do that job and most of the successful years came when there were supervisors/managers that knew how to do the job."
good,"A typical day at work is assisting customer with inquires about merchandise. Organizing merchandise, recovering merchandise from fitting room and working on cash register."
good,"When i worked here it was a fun environment , they didn't allow you to stay on the cash registers a lot only certain people could. The management at the time was awsome"
good,"The place is neat and well equipped  with all amenities possible. I learned how to manage a team."
good,"This is a basic retail job with no exceptional qualities. The main problem is no paid time off, no vacation time, no benefits, and no discounts. Loweest possible wages."
good,"Good envioroment to work in, awsome coworkers and magement. Gets pretty busy around the holidays and back to school. I loved working there great atmosphere."
good,"in a days work you are helping customers, but mainly folding clothes all day so the day can really drag."
good,Too much work for little pay. It's a great place to meet new friends and to learn how to deal with many customers needs and attitude. It's also a great place if you want to reserve clothes.
good,A typical day at work is come in the morning and take care of the customer. What I learn about the job is that  need to find a company where I can grow.
good,JCP was a great fun fast paced to work at. I would open the jrs dept. clean and maintain the area. assist the customers with their needs. cash them out.
good,"JCPenney is ok to work at but you will not get a lot of hours, So if that is what you are looking for this is not the place to work. You will get some weeks 20 hours and some 10 hours. So that is the part time work there."
good,"worked different hours  mostly early  opening store and stocking shelves, learned pricing and working different areas of the store from  creating visions to dressing mannequins. assisting customers etc"
good,"There was no typical day of a job in retail. I worked with customers on size, color, and preference with sales. The culture was good and busy. At times it was very busy. I enjoyed interacting with customers."
good,The compensation was bad.  I didn't have the benefits.  I like the employees and the managers.  The workplace was relaxed and the management let you do your but was helpful when you needed them
good,"I had a great time working there. However, they were terrible at following schedules correctly and completely ignored people's posted availability. Other than that, great environment and team to work with!"
good,I ran the women's and men's shoe dept. worked on the the cash register the discount is the main thing I loved. Was a lot of nice people always come thru
good,On your feet all day walking up and down aisles filling orders for customers. I learn about all the different products we have in the warehouse. The culture is diverse and engaging.  The people I work with at the most enjoyable part about my job.
good,"It was an ok job, not the best not the worst. I do have to say that there was a lot of  workers. A typical day was check in go the registers check people out and help the customers out. The work place was very calm and laid back. I think the hardest part was closing i had to clean every department i could it was very tiring, The most enjoyable part was the kind co- workers and managers."
good,"pretty laid back job sometimes business was super slow, so you always have to find something to do. but whenever its peak season you stay busy. great coupons and discounts"
good,Everyday was pretty standard work for retail. Folding clothes and helping customers with a smile. The workplace enviroment was different depending on who was working but overall it was not really friendly. That was the hardest part of the job. You couldn't do anything without someone putting you down or complaining. People there are more concerned about keeping thier jobs then actually doing them. Overall other employees were extremely rude. Which caused a unpreductive and hostile work place. The best part was the customers. Of course there were some bad ones but there were plenty of amazing customers and that made the job so worth it.
good,Not a bad job but when not managed properly its a headache. The benefits are decent and they do give raises yearly based on performance. Difficult to move up in the company though
good,"Jcpenny is usually the busiest on the weekends where they have the most sales going on which attracts many customers. The work is not dificult, sometimes customers can be a little annoying but the overall work experience is fun and not a bad job for someone who has open availability."
good,It's a very fun place to work the people are awesome. We keep things light hearted but when its time to be serious we can get serious. There's always something to do and its never really overwhelming.
good,Very fast paced job with always changing responsibilities.  Good management and long hours.  Always something new to learn and master.  Job was a good stepping stone.
good,The people are friendly I really like the customers  as well. They just need to work on job security for there employees. An not blind side them with bad news after  everyone else knows
good,Managers and supervisors guy to keep all employees motivated and included and part of the team. Very upbeat environment. Great retail experience. Fun job
good,My job as a cosmetologist and retail associate has been an excellent opportunity to display my positive energy along with my talent. The management at Jcpenny's is quality but does not provide benefits to associates that are promised.
good,"A typical day at work was very busy and the workplace was very unorganized. Management was confusing because nobody let me know who was my boss and I had different managers. I wasn't really assigned a schedule so it was very unorganized. I did learn how to communicate more and make sure customers were satisfied. The hardest part of the job would have had to be folding the clothes because I worked around Christmas, so clothes were EVERYWHERE in the wrong places. I did enjoy wearing elf ears and greeting people most about the job."
good,Great job for a working student. This was my very first job when I was in college. Great people and also its quick to move up from this company as long as you are a great candidate for the job.
good,"In general, it's a pretty good job.  As a supervisor, I am expected to lead myself as far as day to day tasks are concerned which is nice.  Some days are pretty laid back, and some days I have a long to-do list that includes things like moving fixtures, re-merchandising sections of apparel, handling customer issues, coaching or reprimanding sales floor associates, putting away merchandise, etc."
good,"Orderfilling is fun and at time good to fulfill orders. Holidays food is giving at lunch. Alot of walking,bending,and reaching."
good,"nice and clean store, very supportive manager, i worked at kids area , friendly environment, hard working is appreciated and co workers are very helpful."
good,"It was a seasonal position. The management was not very well handled but I learned to take care of problems myself. If I had a major problem I did not know how to handle I would call management , ask a co-worker, or if I had to consult with customer service department. I did my job well and went beyond what I was ask, expected, and required by description to do."
good,JCPenney's is a diverse culture of individuals that offers advancement opportunities for those who work hard. The cons are that training needs work/update to help those in all positions to maximize their potential.
good,As my first job in retail i gained customer service experience and pushing yourself to do better. I definitely learned to be more responsible and to take initiative.
good,Jcp was a good company to work for its just the managers were not fair in most cases... Favored certain people and even let it be known...
good,"Assisted customers to find the right merchandise, style, size and fit. Kept checkout area clean and organized. Trained associates to be able to assist customers and do daily store procedures accurately."
good,"Check for any Mgr. instructions, check ad dates and merchandise, make sure all subs# are there, styles, colors, quantities, and depending on the day, pull it all out. Also, condense racks, move merchandise to be put on sale, mark it down. Also, cashiering, receiving and ticketing of merchandise, follow guidelines on pricing, and colorizing. Inventorying, and crowd controlling on special sales. Translating, and helping Loss Prevention, with new approaches. Got along beautifully with co-workers, leading, and following, when it was needed."
good,"Typical day was always interesting,something new everyday, management supportive, co-workers helpful and fun. Hardest part was being mirco managed. Most enjoyable part was teaching someone something that would help them be productive."
good,"have gone through a rough couple of years, but are trying to get back on track. Has a large amount of dedicated workers that are loyal to the company and it's vision."
good,"it was a real fast moving job that i loved very much pay was awsome"
good,It has its Pros and Cons. As of lately hours have been cut short and it isn't fair because people have bills to pay. Sometimes the managers can be a little over the top. They expect you to have three sections done by yourself with no help when its time for closing.
good,"It is indeed a great place to work, although the management isn't as good as they say they are in the interview. There is a lot of favoritism within the store. Also, the manager who makes the schedule constantly makes changes last minute and fails to let the managers on duty know, leaving them mostly understaffed during the day. Also, the store I worked at would not tell employees whether or not they are fired/let go/no longer needed, instead they would just leave you off of the schedule."
good,"You won't get very many hours if you're in college. I caught the managers along with a few employees talking bad behind my back, not a very good experience at all. If you need help, don't expect any help whatsoever from the store manager. Some of the employees are nice and will help you out when you need it. The only real good thing about working at JcPenney's is the customers and the employee discount."
good,"I was fun, relax, and good employees. Have to fold cloths and cash out customers. Pretty easy job, straight forward. Management wants you to do all the work."
good,I loved working at jcpenney everyday day. Great job love to go back and work as a great team once again  great support team great merchandiser
good,"A typical day at work was ringing up customers wit credit, cash, check transactions. Very flexible schedule. No room to grow. Schedule is not stable. Great job for students."
good,"I worked in the men's department as a Sales Associate which mainly consisted of maintaining retail readiness based off seasonal promotion, and assisting customers with any questions or concerns they had. I had great team members, but it was sometimes unclear what my supervisors wanted from us. Tasks were not thoroughly explained."
good,JCPenney is a great company to be employed with. The staff are all about providing great customer service to each guests that walk through the door. Guests wants and needs are number one priority.
good,"I don't like to say anything negative about my employers, so this is difficult for me to write. JCPenney is a company that provides excellent customer service. They do have several types of benefits. However, they completely lack in taking care of they're employees."
good,working with people was the highlight of the job. I liked my job for the most part. It was a fun experience. The work place was vibrant
good,"Co-workers are nice, some managers need to be re-trained in business etiquette with regards to employee conflict interaction.Shoplifting protocols need to be enforced or reviewed for better quality control."
good,"A typical day depended of what position I was scheduled for.  While I was in cash room it was a very independent role where a lot of attention was needed.  While working freight, it was a lot of team work, communication and planning as well as thinking on the spot.  On the sales floor it was very fast paced and customer focused. The only flaw I experienced with the management was the multiple cuts that occurred during my time there that left the store short staffed, but this was beyond the control of my managers. I had some of the best co-workers at this company that I worked extremely well with and have left the company with life long friends from it.  The hardest part of the job was working shorted staffed while still maintaining the same level of customer service to each individual.  The most enjoyable part of working with JC Penney was being able to take on so many different roles and learning almost every position within the store."
good,JCPenney had an awesome work environment and the team of managers treated the employees with respect. They throughly trained new hires and there was opportunity to advance.
good,"A lot of walking from one location to the next, some friendly people and I have learned to always double check your work and the most hardest part of the job is walking for 10hrs and the most enjoyable is getting paid weekly."
good,"The job was fun as long as the people you work with are fun.  They will do what they can to keep you under working full time.  However, they are very driven to make sure the employees are able to participate in fun events"
good,"You will be helping patients of the doctors. Hopefully you have patience. The company that owns JCP Optical is interesting, to say the least. However, the people with whom I worked were amazing and I loved them like they were my family."
good,Managers were not organized. Store was always a mess. Costumers became angry at some points due to clothing being scattered around and not organized
good,"At JCPenney, the most enjoyable part of job was being with amazing co-workers. My co-workers were fun and productive, They were fun to be around and to work with! My management was fairly decent. I learned how to properly read visuals. The hardest part of my job was not receiving more than one raise while employed."
good,"I love that there is no typical day at work for this company.  There is so much work to be done that you rarely do the same tasks everyday.  I love to multi-task and am very good at it, it makes the day go by so much quicker.  My co-workers and management are very friendly and fun to work with.  The hardest part of this job is to get your hours cut so badly because of budget cuts.  I have learned to be very fast and efficient at my job.  I am an on hands type of person and love learning new things."
good,"Wasn't there long so not sure what to really put about them. Working with the truck, like unpacking and things like that, that was fun. when i had to work out front with the costumers, that was a drag a little. Not the costumers, i enjoyed helping them. It was the employees, I wasn't treated like a JC Penney's employee."
good,the associates are very nice and helpful but there is no advancing within. task oriented not customer!
good,"Not a bad place to work. Good environment, management is okay."
good,this was a nice job until the hours were cut and the managers weren't always nice
good,"This was my very first job. It taught me balance between work and school. Everyday the manager had tasks for us to do from register, clean fitting rooms and check on customer holds. My co-workers were very helpful and full of happiness such as myself. The managers were very helpful and took the time to explain things so we could perform our duties to the best of our abilities. The hardest part of my job was juggling school and work. But, the best part of the job was being in a department that I loved and could relate to."
good,"cashier,selling credit cards,helping customers.nice place to work."
good,"Assisted Customers IN Need Of Help. I Learned a Little From Working There,Such As Being Patient With Customers Usually Gets The Job Done.Management Was Good.Didn't Really Become Friends With Co-Workers."
good,"I liked working there, and with the team members it was always exciting"
good,It was always very busy and messy with customers. The store is big so there would be a lot of recovery time.
good,I get along with everyone. I get my job done. I learned how to do alot there for my first job in retail I learned pricing signing restock dock work helping the visual team sometimes its nice and the people where great
good,"I go into work and I'm usually the neighborhood watch on duty. I handle the till as well as floor coverage.I handle the fitting room too. I schedule things out for my co-workers and put them in different places to control. The hardest part of the job is to accomplish everything in one night that I'm told to do, but i usually accomplish it. I close the registers at night when we close. The most enjoyable time is when I get everything done and don't have to worry."
good,"I learned so much about retail and sales floor. also I got the chance to practice my computer typing, and scanners."
good,It was calm besides holidays. Closing could be long but worth the hrs. I learned how to be patient with impatient customers. Management worked well with you and helped you with whatever you needed. Co-workers were nice and helped wherever needed. Hard part was checking people out on a busy day. The most enjoyable was helping people pick out outfits and having them try them on for you so you can help them pick what goes with what from shoes to jewelry.
good,"Processing shipment, hardest part of the job was the shift and hard floors, most enjaoyable was training in different departments"
good,"Continue to Grow Daily by following routine, training and reaching to partners."
good,Good seasonal job. No problems. Worked around very friendly and nice people.
good,had a wonderful  experience here everyone was very friendly and enjoyed coming to work on daily basis
good,"I really enjoyed working, and I grew as a person. The company really  taught me how to provide great customer service. I enjoyed attending classes to improve my knowledge. The hardest part was when I started and I had to learn the register, something that was completely new to me. I really loved the people I worked with, they were so helpful and fun to be around. I really appreciated all the advice that my previous manager gave me, he influenced my life in so many ways and made me realize how to grow."
good,"4th quarter of 2012 so many extreme makeovers were  made to the stores that the warehouse store support centers were not even getting 40 hrs during retail peak season."
good,"Recovered sales floor, cleaned fitting rooms, put go backs away exactly where they belonged. Helped customers with their needs and answered any questions asked by customers. When needed and short in staff I would cashier for the remaining hours of the day. Counted tally on closing times, plus made sure the sales floor was sorted and recovered."
good,"Working seasonal at JC Penney was my first job, the management was great and my fellow co-workers were always helpful. Hardest part of the job was when Black Friday came around and it was non-stop customer service but it was very eventful and such a learning experience and taught me how to deal with more than one customer at once. The most enjoyable part were my co workers. They always made you feel welcome and helped whenever you needed it."
good,"While my time at JCPenney was brief I did learn a great deal. Going through their Supply Chain Trainee program was a competitive and rewarding experience. My co-workers (Team Coaches, Team Leaders) were very easy to work with and were available for help when I needed them. I learned very quickly that communication was crucial in a fast-paced environment such as this distribution center. I enjoyed working with the team members and learning how they worked and how to motivate them. While longer hours and Saturday shifts were demanding at first, I felt that I was able to adapt very quickly. This was because I expected a position such as this called for such circumstances. I hope that this company is able to regroup, move forward, and grow again because this is a staple American company that needs to stick around!"
good,"Cashier position with a heavy emphasis on customer service.  Clean dressing rooms, ring up customers, assist customers in finding items.  Strong emphasis on opening new credit card accounts for which the cashier is given a $2 bonus for every application."
good,It was fun place to work. Not a very good place for advancement
good,It was fun working there it was just a little bit unorginized and hectic.
good,I was a furniture sales associate at Penney's. A typical day began by clocking in at 9 AM. I would attend the daily staff meeting and then balance my drawers. Then I would straighten the furniture displays. The store would open at 10 AM. From then until 5 PM I tried my best to prospect and sell furniture to walk-ins.
good,I learned how to interact with customers better. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers honestly because they made my day each day I came to work. Managment wasn't a favorite at first until she retired then the next manager was great.
good,"No advancement"
good,JCP has created a fun and friendly working environment that is great for any employee.  What they have done with the new look and feel is also great.  The downside to the new look and feel is that there is no direction as to where it is going.  They had a grand vision which was then changed in the middle of construction.  There seems to be a lack of planning and it has become frustrating to the stores and their employees.  Overall I enjoy my job and JCP but there is no stabilization.
good,pennys was nice job just getting to the point i need a fulltime job with greater pay
good,"Every morning before opening consists of meetings to insure that all employees are well informed with what's going on. Every night after closing there are meetings to inform all closing associates. What I've learned is how to handle different situations with consumers and co-workers. I appreciate JCP management. They are always constantly running back and forth to assist associates whenever needed. Management are with us associates on the sales floor assisting consumers alongside. Co-workers on the floor work as a team. The associates I have the pleasure of working with makes sure I am assisted whenever needed. I can't really sum up a difficult part of a sales specialist. Everything is fast paced, but I enjoy fast pace so. The most enjoyable would have to be working with my team members and the atmosphere JcPenney have built."
good,Enjoyed helping people at Christmas time place orders for their family members.
good,"A typical day for me involved delivering excellent customer service, handling monetary transactions, and making sure that the merchandise in my department and others was organized and well presented. I built upon my customer service skills that I developed at previous jobs. Management was friendly and flexible. My co-workers were likewise friendly and professional. The hardest part of the job was the rushes at certain parts of the day during the busy season. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know my fellow employees."
good,"I loved working with my co-workers, it was always fast paced, and there was always something to learn about."
good,Very busy days and encoouraging managment team . Great learning enviorment to succeed .
good,JCPenney's was a great job I have no complaints there was good management so that you could learm and grow within the company.
good,A typical day is loading and unloading truck.Greeting anf helping customersLee
good,helped mentally disabled kids perform everyday activites
good,The Management Team is very customer service focused. The service quality is above standard.
good,"There have been some significant changes in the JCPenney corporation recently this past year. The management and staff at my personal location was amazing. They provided a welcoming and warm environment for both employees and customers. However, in the salon department they are changing the stylist to become mere service providers for the corporation rather than build an actual business for themselves. This was ( This reflects in the way have changed their pay system, by taking away comission) what motivated the teams nationally to do well and bring in new clients. Now, I believe they will develop larger in turnover rates and bring in a different set of clients, but not quality and long term they will bring in clients that will not want to pay the prices the corporation wants to charge."
good,"Working here i learn to locate stuff around the store, Improve my customer service skills, Replenish of items, Floor jack operator, and how to properly unpack age of items."
good,part-time but it was fun oyou come in and the bullintin board woould tell where to sit that day and wheb to take break.
good,responsible for answering inbound calls from customers that were ready to order from the catalog they received in the mail.
good,Everyday is a new change. a great time to build your career and be part of the new vision.
good,You help customers with anything they need or want. This is a customer first company. They want the customers happy all the time and not to upset the customers.
good,JCPenney is a great place to learn. There are many opportunities available and friendly staff to answer all questions.
good,It was a great working experience and I would go back if it presented itself again.
good,i was a customer service associate i helped customers took care of registers and merchandise.
good,"A typical day at work is usually involving pricing some new merchandise, getting hangers before I clock out and working in groups to ensure that our merchandise is properly priced for customers to enjoy for a fair and square price. The hardest part of the job is getting more than 15 hours a week, but the most enjoyable part of the job is working with other people employed there."
good,i loved working for jcpenney it was a very good environment...
good,good work just not stable work easy going and well do able work i liked it it just wasnt stabble
good,Team work was on point within my department. It makes work/projects easier to finish and we all get along. Providing customer service gives me joy and makes my day.
good,"This is a very welcoming work environment in which I have work in for approximately two years, with a small group of about 13-15 people. We receive the delivery trucks; separate all items that were delivered in categories by groups, brake pallets down, then sort products to the store floor."
good,"Production Line, I loaded boxes on trucks, tag clothing. Its was a good environment to work in, long drive clear to spanish Fork canyon."
good,"good company to work for. Moved my way up in the company, started out as an temporary employee, got offered a job, and then applied internal for a bigger role that also paid more could of kept on going however i want to pursue continuing my education. built a bond with my supervisor, wanted to give me the lead position. if they see you put in the work and deserve it you will be rewarded."
good,"I enjoyed my coworkers as well as my customers. Everyone I worked with was very polite, management included. The pay could have been better, but overall a decent place to work."
good,Overall a good place to work. Just like any place could use some improvements. More full time jobs would be appreciated as well. Really like it there.
good,It was a cool place at first very climate control cool team workers until they got extra strict and I noticed we started losing good hard workers more and more by the day
good,"I think JCP was a nice job, with great staff. You always were in contact with the customers whether if it was greeting them or ringing up a sales. Merchandise exchange is very important working there."
good,During my time at JC Penney I have learned to delegate tasks starting with addressing Customer concern. I've learned to prioritize and manage the sales associates.
good,Working at jcpenneys you had a lot of job titles you were to fold clothes keep the dressing rooms clean and please the customers while cashing them out.
good,it was ok I enjoyed the staff still good friends with a few people. the morning truck shifts were cool I couldn't complain. pay just isn't enough to live with
good,"I loved working here, management was amazing, schedules were flexible, people were friendly. I didn’t like having to work a grave yard shift for Black Friday, but the quickness of the day was fun"
good,The pay was decent and they gave a lot of hours if needed. But at this location they did not allow any days off. We could not take days off our schedules even it was far in advance.
good,"Management was very relaxed, decent hours, co workers love to help each other. The days went by quickly during the weekend and sometimes during the week. Overall it was a good working experience. The only bad part is the wage. Some of my co workers had been there 3+ years and never saw a pay raise. I started out folding clothes and keeping up with fitting rooms, easy stuff. Then I was promoted to jewelry specialist where I had hours of training, I was responsible for all jewelry in the store, including high end diamonds. I never received a pay raise which seemed odd due to my extensive training and far more responsibility/liability."
good,"we unloaded truck , broke the pallets apart , put the items in store , price scanned them , worked in the dressing room too, putting go backs where they belong , seeing where everything belongs, and did back up cashier"
good,I worked in a call canter that no longer exists because there is very little need now that people mostly use online shopping and no longer really place catalog orders.
good,This was over 17 years ago. I had left due to my new career at LoafNJug. JC Peeny was one of the key factors in my traing as an LP Manager. Their customer service traing was second to none.
good,offered alot of overtime during the holiday season once it slowed down they cut everyone's hours. They pay back then sucked for the amount of hrs worked.The only thing i really liked were the discounts for Family & Friends.
good,"It is great to start off with this company, but if you have a passion that you are seeking, this company is only good momentarily. The corporate system is screwed up, and the communication can be the worst that I have ever experienced, but the workers are always like family, and the teamwork on their part is amazing. You also will not be able to celebrate any holidays besides Christmas, or take vacations during the fall, and winter because it is mandatory to be there otherwise you jeopardize your job security. It used to be a wonderful place to be, but over the years they have gotten more money hungry, and inconsiderate to employees needs outside of customer needs."
good,"My work day could start , morning ,noon mid after noon."
good,Good place to work at good benefits & just amazing got to meet new people & communicates with a lot of them helping them find what they needed........
good,Started as an associate within 2 yrs a manager. unfortunately there when a big change occurred may have stayed though if family issues hadn't arrived. pretty good insurance
good,"Pretty easy, typical day you go in for 4-6 hours. you do the fitting room, cashier, and floor clean up. if you work for 4 hours you get a 15 break and if you work more then 6:30 hours you get a lunch break. discount its great."
good,Loved working for this company. They worked well with my college classes. They offered great benefits. The only down fall is they never had enough employees. People were always having to pick up extra shifts because there wasn't enough people to cover all the shifts.
good,"A busy environment"
good,JCpenney is a good place to work especially if its your first job. You will have to talk to people and come out of your comfort zone a bit but its okay. I would love to work there again honestly. Good benefits and Great Co-workers
good,I loved my job because we kee busy. My duties everyday were folding and moving merchandise to correct areas. I was trained on the job to use scanning device for price verfication and merchandise area.
good,A good place to meet a lot of diverse people and learn different tasks in different departments. The downfall of this job was inconsistent hours. It was okay!
good,"The department was effective, though not the most efficient. The workers were intelligent, the immediate managers were intelligent (but stressed), and upper management was limited in their decisionmaking and comprehension of the issues"
good,A typical day at work would be slow depending on the days. If it was business days it would be very slow. Weekends were very busy and considering I was in the shoe department it was very messy.
good,"What I learned while working this job, wash to properly keep the sales floor clean. Also learning how to fold and organize messy racks efficiently. While not going to far away from my register to attend to customers checking out or nearby."
good,When I worked at JCPenney's I started out in commissioned areas. The first was selling shoes then drapery and last furniture. I made a good deal of money working on commission. I was very fortunate to have great co-workers and fair management that really cared about their employers. I had a good time helping customers to decorate their homes. The hardest part of the job was the competition you have with co-workers for customers. In one department we took turns which worked out great!
good,A typical day of work could be extremely slow with nothing to do so you get sent home. Or a typical day could be extremely fast paced and extremely stressful. Nothing good or bad to say about the company.
good,Jcpenny  was a friendly working environment  .gave me a better understanding on the retail job life. The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure my customer needs were met.
good,"The day starts off slow, but as customer come in to buy things you will learn to work hard under pressure. Keeping racks organized, handling cash or credit transactions. Very few returns and gift cards are handled at least during the time I worked there."
good,"Working at JCPenney can be eventful and stressful. While your coworkers make the experience fun as well as most customers, it can  be tedious and stressful with the amount of work being asked of one when it comes to recovering the floor. Lots of folding of clothes and lots of them to put back onto the floor with fitting rooms included which can stretch well past closing time. Especially during holiday specials. "
good,I wished I could have stayed at this job because they had advancement there but I got laid off  around the end of Christmas and I didn't feel like they did the people right.
good,"Its floor sales, nothing more. If you are a manager is a stressful environment. It is pretty soothing to work when the traffic of people is normal. Limited advancement opportunities and raises."
good,"The job was very relaxed. The main problems were the older employees would talk down and try to be your boss and were rude. A lot the other supervisors were pretty nice except a few. The schedule hours were horrible, sometimes working 1 day a week on a flexible schedule. They show a lot of favoritism and that's who got most of the hours. If u were able to open a lot of credit cards in a day, you got the most hours. Unstandable to a certain degree but a lot of great workers who are stronger in other areas not hardly working at all."
good,"A tyical day at work is relaxed, nothing to stressful"
good,JCPenney was okay for a starter job. I enjoyed my coworkers. Everyone seemed to be so close and friendly. The management was pretty decent. Holidays and back to school are sometimes chaotic.
good,"This is a great place to gain knowledge in contract language, negotiation strategy, and overall corporate strategy. I love procurement leadership, most have been working for JCPenney for 10+ years."
good,"Overall rating* `3-5"
good,"supervisor was super great and working black friday was fun, they buy lunch all the time and have pot lucks they are open to opinions and work with you with schedules and have great discounts"
good,"Review incident pending and look for resolution or update from pool they are presently in. Check e-mails for any projects or urgent matters. Review pending projects, PM.s, work orders and discuss with teams members and then assign according to whom available and provide guidance as needed. Check application status for any processes running to slow. Walk floor and communicate with floor personnel to keep abreast of upcoming changes and how systems are running. "
good,The people I worked with were super friendly and ready to help. Things get hectic during the holiday season but it's a great job for students. They were super flexible with scheduling.
good,"If you're not used to long hours, heavy work loads, high demand, and unwanted working conditions, then this isn't for you."
good,Most managers are good and actually care. I didn't have any major altercations. Typical work day as a sales associate was maintaining clean work grounds as well as cash handling.
good,It good place to work and get a discount on clothes and shoes and make-up. You make great friends and provide great customer service as well as you can come to JC Penney for hair cut and style because it best salon.
good,"Unrealistic expectations, over worked and under paid. Great starter job to get your feet on the ground and to get experience. Job training isn't that great. You learn as you go."
good,"employees are very friendly and caring, great work culture. management is difficult to handle, no room for advancement, hard on performance and employees expectations."
good,A typical day of work was productive and there was always something to do each day of work. I learned how to manage my time and how to use a cash register. Managers were always willing to help  whenever I needed it as well as if customers needed them. The hardest part of the job was being understaffed and not knowing what job I would have to do going into work. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and making them happy.
good,"I don't have anything negative to say I got laid off I would still be employed their if I did not, \\Pay was good customers were great, Time off . shared the hours with other leaders.. every other week end off."
good,"It's not too hard of a job, but you need to know how to be good with customers and give them what they want. Coworkers are great, best part of the job"
good,You'll never get bored there because there is usually always something to do and the people you work with are friendly. The management there is okay but could improve.
good,"I managed a team in a location for over 50 years. New CEO and management team took over and started changing everything with little warning to long term associates nearing retirement. I felt the job was too depressing, seeing all these dedicated people crying - needing to change their lives to keep their jobs."
good,"Welcoming work environment, but very routine, fast paced, and busy like most retailers. Managers always pushed you to do better and gave incentive promotions."
good,"Great place to work very friendly and nice people they take care of business with teamwork, but I will admit that it doesn't look easy to move up in this place of work"
good,"JCPenney was a good and well-structured job. The atmosphere was good, the employees are always kind. However, the hours were low.They treated others differently gave them more hours than others."
good,I would help put things away in the fitting rooms and help customers find some things. Management is alright. Its not the best. There isn't enough staff to cover the floor.
good,"The atmosphere was very chill"
good,JCP is a fun and diverse company that allow you to grow and offer a possibility of job advancement. They allow you to have a great job and life balance. Working for JCP gives you the opportunity to learn to work well with others and as a team. It allows you to obtain customers service skills as well as communication and problem solving skills.
good,"A typical day at JC Penney would be helping catalog customers with picking up their catalog items also, I would assist with returns of merchandise. I would contact customers via telephone, fax, and email with information on catalog purchases."
good,"This is a good company and i like the work but i must to quit on that period.  Also we have the great manager."
good,"For someone who used to work for higher pay the work and effort is not worth it. This job is mostly for if you want to start off with something and maybe just maybe get higher in the company. The management was shifting and my store and everything was degrading, including pay and employees to help with the work. The hardest part of the job for me was unloading a truck of 90 hours with just 4 or 5 people. Without a good budget or people buying they couldn't schedule you longer so you had to work harder."
good,"I like my job here, it was a shame the store closed.  Management was great.  Since it was a small store, everyone really was like family.  It was a lot of fun as well"
good,I enjoy the benefits and the people i work with. i like helping people out when the need help finding what they are looking for.
good,I loved the family aspect of working for Jcpenney. Salary wasn't great but they could only do so much for a entry level position. They treat their employees well and do a lot of employee appreciation events.
good,I love working with people finding clothes they needed to wear at a event and help making things match together with a attire they had.
good,"Well Jc Penney was a fun place to work at, I learned a lot over there, for example how to deal with angry costumer and I also got the chance to build amazing relationships with my costumers, I even had costumer that would wait for me to be attended because I always provided great quality to my costumers."
good,"this job was great I enjoyed the customer interaction and being helpful to the staff, friendly environment and great management team. the call center closed down"
good,For the most part this was a great job of course that were parts that I dislked but it provides good benefits and for the most part good co workers.
good,jcpenneys is a very nice place to shop lots of kind people.very meany people that will offer to help you find what you need to make it a quick and easy place to shop.
good,Jcpenny taught me how to build a bond with customers and also how to sell the product. my co-workers were extremely outgoing and helped out any way they could.
good,"I got great training at J. C. Penney.  I was able to work extra hours because they ran the store with a small staff and often had shifts available.  Sometimes the hours were bad--I occasionally worked until 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning.  Because they ran the store on a short staff, the store got messy quite a bit and it was a big job to put it back together.  It took everybody's effort.  The store had great management."
good,"Well managed store where workers are supported and encouraged in their job performance."
good,JcPenney is a fair company to work for. The benefits are awesome but the actual pay does not balance with the work of the employees. It most definitely is not a good place to work if you are considering to make it a career.
good,"Jcpenney is a very good job for retired people and young people who are still in school. Jcpenney has very flexible hours. A typical day would consist of speaking to team members, going to the register making sure customers are being taken care of in a timely manner, going onto the floor making sure fitting rooms are clean and also making sure customers are finding everything they need in a clean and structured environment."
good,"I enjoyed the atmosphere and the people I worked with. I learned a great deal about customer service and learned a great deal about my customers. I became one on one with the customer and got to know each and every one of them personally. Management never had our backs on anything and always made the associates feel low. Also it was like the assoctiactes ran the store and not management. "
good,"I appreciated my customers and fellow coworkers but from time to time the management at this location was more so looking for friends to work in their locations, It also became like it was more like high school then a normal work environment."
good,"An ok place to work if you haven't worked in a call center before."
good,"A typical work place was unloading the trucks and stocking the floors i learned how to multitask, the management was somewhat helpful when needed loved my co-workers the hardest part of my job was not having something in the store that a customer wanted and we didnt hacve the item that they wanted and the most imoortant part was seeing the customers happy"
good,"Ensure to provide excellent customer service through phone, e-mail, chat, etc. in timely and accurate manner. Serve as liaison between customer support team, management and customer to improve customer service and business productivity. Analyze customer complaints and provide appropriate corrective actions. Assist directly or route customers to the appropriate personnel for assistance."
good,"it was good, worst part was piercing baby's ear because of how they were in so much pain. The environment was good became like a family. But you only got your promised commission if your store made goal."
good,i did like my job in the beginning until managers was taking sides with co-workers. Overall i got the job done and did what i needed to do.
good,typical day at the salon was cleaning down the station and cleaning all supplies and tools that were to be used on your client. waiting for your client to arrive. styling they hair the way they desired. walking them to the front of  the salon to pay for the service they were given when completed and for me to return back to my station cleaning and wiping down everything and setting up my area for the next client. if a client wasn't assigned to you that day our task was to walk around the actually Jcpenney store and had out business cards and let the customers know about specials or free samples being given away in the salon. I learned different techniques that other stylists in the salon used for  they clients hair. I learned how to do specific services at a faster pace . the management was pretty okay. the co- workers were nice and lean a hand whatever needed . the hardest part of the job was not knowing exactly how to do a specific style that a client wanted. another hard part of the job was trying to find a customer in the store itself that wouldn't mind taking a few minutes out they day to come in to get they hair styled . the enjoyable part of the job was being able to work with the girls I went to school with. another one was being able to help the receptionist by putting new products out on the shelves . being able to receive free mini samples of products sold in the salon.
good,They are always looking for employees to promote and coach on a consistent basis.
good,Great place to work if you love to be on your feet and engage with customers and associates!
good,A Typical day at work for me when I'm first starting my shift would be to put my personals in the locker room greeting my co-workers as I go. Soon as I make it up to my department which is shoes let my team know that i'm there. Then that's when I start to help customers with any questions they may have or even if they need assistants with trying a shoe on. The most difficult part of my day would be when I don't have an answer to a question and I call management to help me with it but they never come and help. The best part of my day would be when I have all the answers to my customers questions things are running smoothly and we sale a lot of shoes. I enjoy that
good,The best teamwork I've ever had the privilege to be a part of. The people you meet are interesting and diverse. The middle management works hard to make it fun and drive sales.
good,"Lead Department- all phases of merchandising, markups and markdowns. Relocation of merchandise and sale set ups. Running Register and checking customers out"
good,Good work ethic. Great place to work. Get great customer skills.
good,Productive and sometimes fun workplace. Always on the run making sure i meet my expectations.
good,Learn alot about customer service maintaining my work area and stocking.
good,Not every day was it typical. In a department stores you never know what the day will bring.
good,"Although my title was ""Receptionist,"" I took on a lot more responsibilities than one would think. Our department manager left shortly after I started, my responsibilities sky-rocketed to keep the salon afloat. Every day, I'd start out by looking at each stylist's revenue reports. I'd make sure they were on their own individual task as well as the salon's. My stylists always commented how I was able to make complicated commission systems understandable. I'd make daily reminders and goals for individual stylists. Most importantly, I managed the books. I set and managed appointments for up-to 14 stylists at once. This involved time management and making sure to follow through with reminding clients of their appointments. I kept up with the retail stock, I sold, restocked, and ordered inventory. I made commission on my retail sales, so I quickly channelled my inner salesman and rose to the top of my sales charts. I would also go through each service completed and document the history in order for stylists to look back at each individual client. This job required learning quickly about the art of cosmetology and what was entailed with it's services. During down time, I cleaned and did various duties around the salon to make it enjoyable for each client. This was a daytime job and continuing my 4-year degree was most important, therefore I did have to leave it behind."
good,its was a fun and excited place too work in. I like meeting new people and they had just lunch time and gave us good breaks and they department store is nice
good,"my typical day at work always included greeting and assisting each and every customer that entered my department. Most of the time I greeted them as they walked in because as soon as you walk past the salon you walk into my department. I learned a lot from each and every customer. Not just about them personally but things in general, about life, love and other things. Management was for the most part really really nice. And I loved all of my co workers. They were the best part of my job besides my customers. The hardest part was definitely dealing with the difficult ones and there could be quite a few of them. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers that looked for me exclusively. And making new exclusive customers on a daily one on one personable interaction."
good,"Was a great place to work, friendly associates and managers despite usual work drama. After all the changes the company kind of went downhill cutting hours and all."
good,"My usual typical day at work consists of me working 1 hour on the my regular assignments such as cleaning the stockroom, placing display shoes or cleaning the shoe department. The rest of the day is spent assisting customers or doing projects from supervisors. I learned how to become better and dealing with all types of customers and how to become a leader and stay on top of things. My coworkers were all excellent cant complain about them. They were all hardworker associates. The hardest part for me was that i had to deal with rude customers. The most enjoyable thing was for me to be able to work with all age groups of people it helped me able to communicate with everyage"
good,The management was very helpful made working fun.I would start work 4am everyday unload the shipment that would come in.My co-workers made work more enjoyable.
good,"Jc Penney can be a great place to work. The company continues to cut jobs, even newer positions that were created for the new transition. There is no job security there. Hundrends of full time employees in positions, not sales associates, have been let go in mass numbers from the corp. office in Plano as well as store level. The stores spend too much payroll hours on constantly changing the prices (mark ups, mark downs, promotions), that there is little left to spend on when the customers are there in the store shopping. There is not enough floor coverge. The customers are walking around looking for help. The one or two employees are in a fitting room hanging up mounds of clothes that don't fit the customers. No one is around to help the customers."
good,"I would come early in the morning. We would unpackage boxes to put them on carts for a few hours. After that, we would take the carts down to the floor with scanners and scan each item to the racks in the specific department and put them away. This was 3 days a week. My co-workers were easy to work with, but the management wasn't nice to new workers. That was the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part was being able to interact with customers and assisting them when they needed it, especially during the holidays."
good,This was a great place to start out at as a hair stylist. My coworkers were very helpful. I learned so much about color and hair cuts from some of the people I worked with. I believe the hardest part of this job was having to leave it behind when I moved.
good,I was in the men's department so i would have to straighten the area and help customers. I learned how to size for a suit. the management was very distant it felt like. the co-workers were fun to be around. it was a simple job.
good,"A typical day at work was providing customers with the best customer service possible. Which included operating the cash register, making the store neat and clean, and helping the customer find what they are looking for. I've learned to interact with complete strangers and have fun doing it. Management was great they worked with me because I was going to school full-time so they worked with my class schedule andit helped me out a lot. The co-workers were great everyone knew everybody and we welcomed everyone in as a family. The hardest part of the job was putting out new merchandise because we had to change up the whole section and change everything around. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know your regular customers and helping them find what they are looking for."
good,"I worked and practically lived here for 6 years, could not balance life and work."
good,"I started out as a custom decorator and loved the experience to see the factory, how window treatments were produce and etc. Anyhow, the salary was draw salary (meaning if I didn't meet the quota, I'd have to pay back what I was paid). It was tough, so I transferred to a CSR, and it was a horrible decision! Mgmt was great and wonderful, I just had horrible coworkers where they would leave me by myself during my whole shift. I had to page someone, even mgmt, about four times on some occasions for help, but NO ONE showed up. At that time, I had two jobs, and this was my second one, and I would always leave late bc no one had relieved me. My coworkers, not all, were very high school, and lied to the store manager that I left my shift early leaving my area unattended, which I didn't. I do feel that JCP is a great company if they invest in people that are willing to work, and I do feel that I could have moved up in the company, but just like any other company, it's all about politics. Bc I was doing my job, and not gossiping with my coworkers made me in eligible for rehire. On a positive note, I did meet great people and the coworkers that I did get along with, were very sweet an helpful."
good,A great learning experience to work with customers and associates to make happy . Best feeling is when customers you helped come back .
good,"Checked sales,e-mailes. Talked to management to find out what to focus on,set sale,check on fast sellers, coach."
good,Quite place
good,Jcpenny is a fast moving work in recieving as well as in shipping. Have to be able to consistently pick up different sized boxes that weight a veriety amount of pounds. It makes your day pass quickly but you also have to work safely and efficiently. If you cant handle eight hours on none stop work jcpenny is not the company choose for you.
good,Sally might not pay the best but they sure they care of their workers
good,A typical day would be going in and going straight to payroll making sure times were correctly punched in by employees the previous day. Making sure the schedule was correct for vacation days entered. Dealing with decorators and vendors.
good,"Jc Penny is a real cool place to work. You meet new people, make new friends and its a gud learning experience in retail."
good,"For the most part, seems like managers know what to do to get through their shift but doesn’t seem like they work together as often to make shifts a bit easier. Also with scheduling, the supervisors or HR don’t seem to work together either, and don’t give great hours."
good,Most enjoyable part about this job was being able to move up into different departments and learning different areas in retail. Another thing i enjoyed the most was being able to be in charge of different areas in the store.
good,Its a nice job. it just the hours are bad. Some times you work one or two days a week. some times you work five or so days. Getting people to sign for a card could be hard as well
good,"Working at JCPenney is quite stressful, though over time you slowly learn how to balance your tasks with everyone else's and get the job done. However, if so much as one person slacks off, the entire team can be held back at the end of the day. You also eventually create great bonds with your coworkers, as you see them so often."
good,Fun to work at. It was hard to work there to. You had a family there. Everybody loved each other there. Lovable environment good  customers. Customers came first
good,The job at jcpenny was decent. Some concerns were that the management was very poor and there was some weird relationships with managers which was very inappropriate
good,"On a given day, my responsibilities consist of working on the store appearance, making sure everything is in the right place, and greeting customers consistently. This job gave me the opportunity to interact with people in a customer service setting. Thus, I was working and having conversations with a variety of different people. Supervisors knew how to level with their employees while maintaining authority. As a sales associate, I was responsible for getting customers to apply for store credit cards, which required a comfortable salesperson charisma, which I found difficult to maintain consistently. If JCPenney had anything positive to say about me, it would probably be my ability to get along with my coworkers."
good,The hardest part of this job is making people happy. Everyone gets along with each other. We love our mangers. Long hours always. A typical day at work is very slow and sometimes busy
good,Employee discount it great when you have children and a great place for home decor.  It’s my 3rd go around with JCP so it must account for something. Nice 401k too!! If you’re secure in your talent you’re in the right place.
good,"temporary positon, nothing bad to say about the company or the staffing agency.  great co workers, easy to reach staff. seems unorganized at times.  no issues"
good,"working in retail I've learned that, your generally not paid enough for what you do. They treat you as if your expendable. I would recommend Jcpenneys because it's a great company, they just have a few minor quirks they need to work out."
good,very busy fast paced environment...lots of opportunities for advancement...very great culture...hardest part was management.. most enjoyable was the associates...
good,"lower prices on the vending machine "
good,it was a good environment just the hrs were not there and well under paid.I loved my co workers and the supervisor was wonderful but i could not make a living off of what i was getting paid.
good,I would recommend somebody with no experience come to JCPenny . JCP gives the basic knowledge and tools you need to succeed in life . They work great with your schooling schedule and also give paid training .
good,"PROS: "
good,"In the mornings when I come to work or in the evenings I would come in with a smile before I would even clock in.  I looked forward in engaging with the customers and crew.  I was able to replenish the sales floor as to what products I believed were needed for the customers shopping experience for that day and though out the week. I found myself numerous times multitasking by answering the phones, ringing customers up and retrieving their packages from their catalog orders.  J.C. Penney s is a very diverse place to work and quite interesting to learn the different cultures of our fellow team mates."
good,I would like for the company have more personal to work among every department. If there would be more rules towards customers taking items inside the fitting rooms.
good,I liked to work there at JCPenney I learned a lot of things like customers service was my first job in the U.S. they helped me alt in that career and they are a good company to work for
good,work forcproductivee but some days were slower than others. the management was great bc sometimes when i didnt have a ride and i would arrive late the manager would cut some slack on me
good,Great for a little check on the side or if you are busy with schooling. Flexible hours and a nice group of people to work with. However the pay isn't great and raises are only 25 cents on average annually. Their budget is tight because retail is dying and the writing is on the wall. Most stores are very understaffed. Even management positions are underpaid. That being said it is a fairly easy job with minimal stress.
good,"Great team they help each other, fast pace. loved the early mornings"
good,"it was my first job, I learned how to work in a team, I learned about how to communicate professionally with people. overall it was a life changing for me."
good,I was always moving around trying to take care of things around the store. The roles were always clear. The mall cleaning staff helped out on busy days.
good,the only complaints I have about jcpenney is the lack of hours given outside of the holiday seasons and it can be a bit stressful during the crazy holiday seasons
good,dealt with many customers who were very opinionated and seemed to have a problem with everything. Since it was the holidays they wanted to find anything wrong with items in order to receive more discounts
good,"Most employees are young and have to stay after to clean up after each day. It gets tiring as you only get a 15 minute break for 4 hours and you need to keep busy the entire time. Holidays are extremely stressful. Lunches are not paid, and customers are sometimes rude."
good,"overall my experience working for jcpenny was okay for a temporary job a typical day at work was very fast paced nothing i couldn't handle maybe a little bit of help during cash rep would have made the store a little more neat and presentable. management was well everyone was nice and attentive i mostly liked Astrid, Jennifer and Pricilla because they were more hands on with the employees and the customers and really appreciated their associates so i believe they should get a raise. the hardest part of the job would be recovery because thats were you have to make the store look nice witch i understood so i didn't mind but it was a lot of work since there was always a mess. And the most enjoyable part of my job was meeting the people who walked through the doors of jcpenny and the coworkers i met and grew a friendship with. i lam glad i got the opportunity to work at jcpenny because i had no work experience so now i have a lot of confidence in myself and believe that i lcan accomplish any task i am given."
good,"A typical day was clock in and go right to straightening and more.  Then helping the customers, and cashiering them out and being friendly.  Then, restocking the shelves and clean the fitting room out."
good,Must be willing to with stand composure. Have a lot of patience while dealing with the public. Have flexible hours and willing to work late nights. Good communication skills.
good,"Total department accountability.  "
good,Jc Penney was a fun place for me to work for. Great people to work with.  Supervisors were nice. Able to learn all the departments if you're willing.
good,"A very supportive community style work environment. Caring co-workers,. I did very well as an up-sell employee and attendance was perfect on my part. It was during the very difficult time of our depression. There were no increases in wages. Penneys' did the best they could under a very difficult time in our economy. The salon was neglected and outdated."
good,friendly and casual atmosphere very stress free work environment with always something to do its a big store so you will never find a dull moment management is very knowlegable
good,"This job was very amazing, "
good,I didn't mind working here but definitely the hardest part would be having to stand all the time and organizing the sales floor after big sales or holiday shopping...
good,"It's retail.  So the hours are bad, working nights and weekends and holidays. If you have any buy-in in your business, you'll find yourself going into work on your day off or staying late after your shift.  But it is rewarding, fast-paced, and customer driven."
good,a great learning experience for working as a team and in high volume areas. a self starting and very productive work day with a management that needed a bit more working on but also dependable. co-workers were very interesting to work with.
good,"enjoyed all of my coworkers, made some life-long friends. learned a lot about retail, and customer service. this was my first job and I loved working for this company, and was very happy with all of my accomplishments while working there"
good,"Fast pace with many schedule changes daily"
good,"The company offered many opportunities for advancement. I learned so much from the trainers, they took the time to really explain the processes."
good,"Provide incredible customer service, answering customer questions"
good,"this has been one of the easiest jobs I have ever had, it was very fun working here and the job was such a breeze to do, you would take internet orders and process customers orders and pretty much shopped with them online,"
good,"there is not much i can say about this job, great place to work in college and it paid the bills"
good,This is a great place to work and learn new things with also opportunities to grow and the managers really do care about the customers but I believe most customers get what ever they want and take advantage of some of the policies.
good,"El grupo de trabajo era excelente todos profesionales encargados de una zona de cundinamarca, yo tenia a cargo 11 municipios donde desarrollaba todas las actividades de implementacion de la estrategia, infortunadamente el proyecto duro solo un año"
good,I would start out my day by talking to the previous worker and getting caught up on everything i needed to know then i would immediately go to pick up hangers typically at this point if any packages where being delivered they would come at this time and i would sign for them and log them in then i would check with my manager for any special projects that he needed done.
good,My day started off by putting out diamonds and displays. I also had to account for all diamonds and the end and beginning of my shifts. I also had to deal with customers one on one and that was great met a lot of interesting people really enjoyed that.I also had to learn hoe to change watch batteries and be able to add and remove links on jewelry. even though I did not work for the company too long it was a great experience all the same.
good,"easy going, fun, positive management team.  Great benifits. gentle but satisfying work.  "
good,"Ensured all merchandise is ready and available for the customers needs. Learning space allocations and proper signing for the shopper. Proactive to sales gains (credit card application) and reaching daily goals. Long hours, weekends and holdays was the hardest part. But, I enjoyed every minute of it. Engaging with the customer and  Satisfying the customers needs with postive feedback. "
good,Very organized and well put together but did have some employees who lacked in the children's department and out off work on us seasonal's. I did overall enjoy the friendly customers and I definitely learned that customer service is #1 at JCP and you do whatever is needed to satisfy the customer.
good,"Very fun, challenging sometimes with customers, co workers and management."
good,"I stephens, have work with jcpenny for four years,as a parttimer, currently working , when it comes around to this time of year jcpenny get low on hours, theres no hours to be given, so im looking for a second job. i love to work with jcpenny because we work togather as a team!! i worked thurout the intirer store started off in jcpenny hair salon as a front desk receptionist now workin in customer service."
good,JCP talent acquisition had a clear goal and a strong strategy to accomplish it.  Working under the pressure of a negative press and image (in the IT employment market) the  team worked together to meet hiring metrics.
good,Very needy customers can't seem to ever look for anything on their own. No health insurance until full time for a year.  I've never heard of any company making you wait that long!
good,"Like any retailer that offers flexible schedules, you are expected to be flexible and have open availibility which makes it both easy and hard to have a good work/life balance.  The hardest part is when you are an hourly manager, expected to stay at 40 hours or less so no overtime, but they cut hours, making it harder and harder to get what needs to get done within a specified time frame."
good,Im not into the kind of work i was doing with jcp. I wouldnt recommend it but everyone is different. For some people they would love this kind of work.
good,"Was relaxing and slow paced, was never too busy, Co-workers were laid back, could do anything you wanted as long as you were working. However, the hours were not the best which made the paychecks not too good."
good,"This is a great job for college students, or even high school students. Its a nice place of employment  for someone who is looking for some extra money in their pocket. Some managers do come off pretty rude and disrespectful at times but other managers are great"
good,Working at JCPenny was the best job I’ve ever had. It was a wonderful experience!the customers were over all amazing people to work with and the employees were wonderful drama free people that I will dearly miss.
good,"Recommends"
good,"Typical retail  Job with benefits for full-time employees. Most managers are fair and work well with employees, Must work with customers. Very hard work and servicing store and clients. Love working in the salon as the leader. Great position."
good,I didn't work here for long and the time that i did i was having problems in  my pregnancy but they worked with me in many ways. its a laid back productive work environment.
good,"I would say this job is very flexible and fast paced. You do have to be on point at all times due to a high-volume of guest we have. It is sometimes a conflict with scheduling, however, if you are a college student, I would recommend this job as a first job. You gain lots of experience and your communication and customer service skills will advance smooth and quickly."
good,"la gente es muy amigable y profesional, los jefes tratan a todos por igual"
good,"It's an OK job. Has good benefits and pays well, a lot has changed since we got a new CEO. We no longer have appreciation parties, it's just all work and no play. Can get stressful after a while."
good,"It's an good place to work,  but the way they pay employee's that have been there  for 5plus years and some that's been there for less than 6months is disturbing.. Unfair especially when you work your hardest to push garments out."
good,JcPenny's is a beautiful store with great clothing for you and your family. The store offers alot of discounts and also very nice jewelry. They hsve it sll shoes clothing even that favorite bracelet you want.
good,"It was a learning experience for me Spence I never fixed convayer belts before,but I had a good guy that though me and he did a great job.i loved that job and I wished it never end."
good,"Love the job. Get to help customers, i learned a lot. A lot about retail. I love my boss. Love that I can help people find what they need. However, the pay is not worth it."
good,Very fun work place... Worked there for the holiday season one year.. Not a very flexible schedule. The managers would bring in food durning the holidays so that was nice.. I did not like the lte hours though. Sometimes i wouldnt get home until 2 in the morning
good,I learned so much while I was here about being apart of one big working team. Everyone was always happy even though we were constantly on our feet and tired. the professional atmosphere was like a breath of fresh air everyday.
good,Working in the Portrait Studio was a great experience to see and interact with various ethnicities and ages. Each day was a surprise as to what will happen throughout the shift.
good,"It is a stressful work environment, but it is retail after all. You have to stay on your feet and learn the particular pet peeves of all of the managers. Personally, I think the pay is too low, but I wasn't there long enough for advancement. This is better as a long term-job than it is for a college student."
good,"I worked here at 16. It was a great starter job leading to more retail career options."
good,"When I first started working in JCPenney there was no doubt i was some what nervous but, Human resources and the management in the store was very friendly and helpful. I was taught how to move quickly and have a better memory then I normally had already. With also being educated in giving people great customer service. My Co-workers were also rather friendly and made me feel accepted and appreciated. The only thing I couldn't find my self enjoying was the rather slow days, where I was needed to simply walk back and forth through out the store, it felt more or less like I wasn't being productive. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing how helpful I was being in the team and with customers."
good,Very competitive company. Hours vary and pay varies on department and experience. Quality merchandise which makes selling easier but management was horrible.
good,Worked in the shoe department of Jc Penny and it was very tiering at times because it got super busy at times but as my Second job it was a good experience.
good,I enjoyed working here. There was a lot that I learned. There were also a lot of great professional people. I would def go back and work for this company.
good,"Good people to work with. Some of the upper people are great. Unless your a favorite, expect to leave state to promote. Meet great people that will help with anything. Beware of some store managers ."
good,I learned a lot about retail. Everyone was involved and helped each other out. No one was left behind. Management was understanding and very hard working to keep associates happy.
good,"The company is cool but you just don't really make much. Unless, you are a manager. People are nice that work and shop there though."
good,Often felt understaffed however the work environment was friendly.
good,"JC Penney is a wonderful place to work at, it is too bad that the store that i work at is closing and i might not have another store to go to"
good,"JCPenney is an amazing company that I've enjoyed working with since day one. Even through all the changes and negativity in the media, I've stood by the company."
good,A typical day at JCPenney was sooo boring. Its always dead and you can only fold clothes so many times. Co-workers were the only thing that made it worth while. Then again i worked at a slow smaller store.
good,I go into work and et my job done.some people are friendly and others not so friendly.
good,Very fast paced environment to work. Scheduling there is good because they work with your schedule especially if you’re going to school. Time goes by fast.
good,I think it’s an overall a good company I just need more hours for someone who’s trying to start a life. The mangers are understanding and do a lot for the staff.
good,"While at JCPenny i was heavily pushed to get people on credit for the store. the employees are very fun, but the manager is very pushy. the Hr worker is a very nice and kind lady who will help you get yourself up and running there."
good,"i enjoyed it pretty relaxed. and the store manager listens which made all the difference.the only thing that i personally was not happy with is they build their favorites. meaning that they have clicks their and if your not part of the ""click"" then your kind of a forgotten employee."
good,I would help with the cash register and help fold clothes. The managers were so nice and helpful with anything that you needed. I loved meeting new friends and everyday at work was so enjoyable.
good,"I enjoyed my time with JCPENNY, they always kept their stylist up on the latest with continued education, great teamwork, good contest that kept stylist excited about working there. Pay was good, and hours were even better."
good,"Here a learn more about customer service, Its a place were you have to give your all to make that the customer comes out satisfied"
good,"Busy salon. Great training, Great place to work and build relationships with co-workers and customers. Great place to star a career."
good,A laid back job to get use to. Cleaning and checking out people that come and shop.
good,I loved it ! working for this company gave me a lot of insight on how it is working in retail.
good,"A typical day at work would be assisting customers with their purchases and handling the money flow. I learned how to order stock and set floor plans. I also learned how to better assist customers with new training. The management was wonderful, really tried to show everyone kindness and understanding. My co-workers became like family, even after 3 years we are all still very close. Hardest part of the job was the unstable hours, I never knew what the next week would bring. The most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere, being in the mall I got to see a lot of different people."
good,"Early mornings and fast pace days....that was a typical day at this company. There were times when management could make the day almost unbearable, but always it was only when needed and within company guidelines."
good,loved working there becasue of all the people i got to meet i dealed with customer service im very good with people.During the time of september thru january i was team lead for the changes of the store i was in cherge of supervising over 10 people which i did outstanding i have leadership skills im very fast learner and im very dedicated to my work
good,"Analyzed daily the selling floor and stock rooms in order to create action plans to improve sales and customer shopping experiance. Learned how to use sales reports, customer service surveys, productivity reports to improve store enviorment, how to improve profit and customer service. Amazing co-workers and management. Most enjoyable part of the job is setting the new merchandise on the selling floor and making a impactful presentation for the customer."
good,There was no flexibility whatsoever with scheduling.  My supervisor was never available. Other supervisors were always super rude and nasty. However everything else about the job was excellent! A very OK job at best
good,Jcpenney cades about their employees and is a very good work environment. They have great staffing. They provided a great benefit package for full time employees
good,"Enjoyed working with my co-workers and store manager. I loved my customers, helping them with their shopping experience was special to me. The work was easy to do."
good,"i learned diffrent techniques about hair and the diffrent textures i loved my jcpenny family we had a great time in the diffrent class"
good,My daily job was to help customers ring up their shopping. Greet all customers and keep the area clean at all times. Check on customers that need help. The hardest part of the job was cleaning the area every hour after customers. I enjoyed the team work that was done.
good,On normal days you get your full 8 hours not hard at all the supervisor's are nice. The hardest part is peak season lots of work and mandatory 10 hour shifts up to 12hours . The enjoyable part is when they offer you PTO its paid time off. The part that sucks is there is days they kick us all out because there is not enough work and that can go on for a whole week and you don't even make your 40hours
good,"The JCpenney logistics center is a very multicultural place. As you are always working around different people and learning new things almost everyday. All employees respect and appreciate each and everyone's help in getting the jobs done. Also, managements calm and cool mentality allows then to have a very one on one relationship with every individual worker. Which makes the workplace an even better healther environment."
good,noreview available its a gud place to work for the experience is awesome so is the benefits and work hours
good,"I worked in the Salon I would come in clock in and go straight to the Salon and open registers look at my appointments for the day and set up my station. They would call for a meeting at front of the store and then we would go back to Salon and do our appointments unpack stock and answer phones and make appointments,"
good,"Customer Service, Cashier, display organization, credit card applications, approval process, denial process explanations, customer assistance, team work, took approx 20-25 phone calls daily pertaining to stock, calling other stores for stock questions, multi-tasking. When working here i learned a lot of people need help making the decision if the clothes they are choosing look right on them and finding things that fit. Some of the people i worked with were very nice and friendly but some others i don't think they liked me . The hardest part of my day was trying to get people to sign up for credit cards. They most enjoyable was when i actually got a credit card app from someone."
good,"Great Place To Work! I enjoy the sincere appreciation I receive from not only my boss, but also the people I work with. A heartfelt “thanks” goes a long way to improving my attitude and productivity."
good,"You will work either on the register or sales floor depending on what you are assigned to that day. The management is very nice and friendly, and is willing to work with your schedule. Unfortunately, the other people working there are stuck in high school, no matter how old they are. There is a lot of needless drama and talking behind your back."
good,"I Really enjoyed working here, over the last year, thre mamagment team is great. the day is very fast paced and always kept me busy, i learned how to multi-task and also improve my memory. the customer service skills i gained from here is an achievement im proud of. working with my co-workers was really good as we managed to work independently and as a team, helping eachother to acheive set goals. the hardest part of my job was too maintain the fast paced in holiday season of running around for 8hours, though with practice it became a natural skill."
good,Always on your feet. Constanly learning people personalities.
good,I enjoyed working at Jcpenny This was a part-time job while I was in college they worked around my schedule. This was like a family when I worked for them.
good,The only thing that I did not like was that they could not offer me a set schedule. The pay was okay but I enjoyed my time there. The management and the staff were very friendly.
good,Jcpenney is s judge free zone you are able to be you and the working environment is very balanced you never feel like your not good enough because the coworkers are extremely helpful and the mangers
good,"This job is fairly easy, must have patience, the managers are cool and nice. It would be hot in my department sometimes customers would complain. They gave me good hours"
good,"my first job, i was super excited. we had to dress in a perfesional manor and i loved that , i had awsomeco-workers and managers"
good,A typical day at work would be always busy having things to do at all times never wasted time or was bored.. Learned something new everyday. Co-workers were really nice never had a problem. Most enjoyable part of the day would have to be sharing ideas with co-workers to get things done faster and well done.
good,"A typical day at work was putting on a smile no matter how bad I felt. JCPenney was all customer service and basically that's what I was entitled to do. I enjoyed helping customers as well as my co-workers. I learned how to be responsible, follow directions, work as a team mate, and etc. The managers always said I was great for the company. I was always on time and never got written up. The hardest part of the job was lugging clothes out of the fitting because customer would try on more than enough clothing and leave all of it in the fitting room. Overall it was a easy job for me."
good,"It was a good workplace, (just not a good time for me to be there). When I was there I worked in the Kids/Home department and could help customers find items, by walking around with them, and using my cashier skills."
good,They only keep you if you are getting alot of ICaps( signing people up for credit cards) Not enough hours to survive............................................
good,"store manager was awful."
good,I would manage 50+ sales a shift. I also Interacted with customers and assisted them to have a great experience. I also had to make sure the sales floor and dressing rooms stayed clean.
good,"JCP was my first job. I had no expectations except, to make money."
good,the management isn't the greatest but the people you end up working with are pretty awesome. most of your coworkers are nice and the discounts are great. you get up to a 25% discount.
good,"staff horrible"
good,"Once again I like working with the public. This was my first retail job and I really liked it. Most of the customers were very nice; you had the ones that were never satisfied. Didn't really like working with teenagers. They were lazy and the older ones in age got stuck doing their jobs."
good,"Company wasnt condusive to growing its associates and promoting.Management stayed in positions a long time rarely an opening for advancement. Workload well balanced for its associates,recovery and sales associate ."
good,"overall great place to work. barely willing to work with school schedule. hours are not consistent enough. some managers would play favorites, and some were lazy"
good,"one thing i aways enjoied was traing the new stylist,iI licked it so much I worked there most of my carreare"
good,"I enjoyed my years at JCPenney, my first job. The early years were filled with Long hours, yet rewarding work. Definitely a sense of belonging and purpose that I liked. I think I endured many changes over the years, saw many managers, Most the best an employee could every ask for as far as respect to their associates. The hardest part was the changing atmosphere in retail in general."
good,Repricing merchanice through out the store because sales would change on a daily basic. I would stock and replenish shelves daily. Our team made sure that extra or overflow of merchandice was placed into our overstock area.
good,"I've worked at 3 different locations and the Covington  location was SUPERB!! Management was always friendly, outgoing and helpful everything flowed easily. As for as the other 2 locations everything was of urgency and management was very challenging. Typical work day was stressful because of attitudes and what I've learned is to do the opposite and that's to utilize team members skills...show recognition"
good,"I work in various and had the opportunity to go to School for Certified Beauty Consultant.I had very good time work in for JCPenney and also I exceed on my sales,"
good,"It's great work that you can throw your passion into. Especially if you like working with different people from different places."
good,"There was nothing to keep me occupied all the time, most of the time I ran circles around the store because there was nothing to do, I don't recommend it"
good,"Being a retail customer service is a fun job you will meet all kind of people, you work and shop at the same time seeing all kind of product make me happy"
good,"Decent salary "
good,"I couldn't last too long because I was trained efficiently but not by the right people, once i was on the floor another woman who had been there for 15 years taught me everything. Poor training is one massive flaw."
good,A lot of work given fast paced not a lot of room for growth or higher pay. management was all over the place. no one to talk to if you wanted advancement
good,"I worked for this company a few years back only seasonal, I did have a lot of fun and would work there again! the people where friendly and we all helped each other when needed."
good,J.C. Penney's was a nice place to work.  There wasn't much room for advancement. Needed full-time work.  Learned so much about Customer Service and how to make the customer happy.
good,"i looved working at jcpenney. i loved all my coworkers. there was room to grow, but only if you were a favorite. they say you get annual raises but 85 cents in 6 years doesnt really make a good difference when you have a family to support."
good,I don't even like to go into JCP now because of the jerk they have for a store manager! Thankfully they are going back to the old way of sales! I totally disagree with the way they treat long-term employees. New hires get better raises and evaluations than the employees who have stayed loyal and worked very hard for JCP!
good,no balance between work and home life very poor benefits. Management brain dead
good,Easy going day. Long as you help your customers. Store manager was a pain but other than that it was a decent job.
good,"the port charlotte location was a good location to work for, good supervision and great coworkers"
good,"I love my job, but I hate coming into work. Constantly feel undermined and not listened to as an employee. There’s really no training on any promotions. Sometimes I am not at 100% when I work, because of how demeaning my management makes me feel. If you have good management, the job is wonderful."
good,this was a part time job for me during my college career. Very flexible hours as a student I never had any complaints. Managers do play favorites and you really have to drive credit or you wont be scheduled for hours
good,I won employee of the month 10 times out 1 year and I still feel like i wasnt appreciated at all they never called when they fixed the schedule  and the managers really dont care
good,"First, if you aren't able to push credit cards, don't bother working here. There were three people when I worked there who had 80% or better rates of getting guests to use their JCP credit card, yet were expected to get the same number of people to apply for a JCP credit card as those who had less than 50% usage rates among those guests they rang up. All three had their hours cut to less than 4 hours per week."
good,"Staff is kind and encouraging, but the outdated technology can be very frustrating. Plus, the hours are not always ideal. Some of the management is not very understanding"
good,"JCP is a super fun company to work for - sometimes. It's all about the culture in the individual store. Sadly, it's not consistent. With the new CEO, hopefully there will be a change, but I'm not holding my breath."
good,"I loved my job. I had planned on retiring there. JCP has unfair treatment, they show favortism. I changed my career while I was there to help with the many changes JCP was going through. So my retouching career was slacked off some to help with image management."
good,"The pay was not great. The hours were rough, as we came to work around 5am and were expected to be done with work by 10. It was a high paced job with little pay."
good,This company does not care for your home life or if you have a family just it's productivity they pay well but that's because your benefits here sucks and they work the he'll out of you and make you do things that's not in your job description! If you like working your life away and not being able to choose your job here then it work for you!
good,"Arrive at work and start with clients, communicate with clients and learn information about others, management could be a lot better especially salon manager.  The workplace is diverse, the hardest part of the job is working with clients that want to come in and get something for free, complaining about hair styles, etc., the most enjoyable part of the job of course is when you can go in and have a good day satisfying you clients."
good,I personally had problems with the management at this location but right after I left most of them were removed. the job itself was a good job and I loved the benefits.
good,Easy flowing environment very friendly place.always a good day with the employees as well as custumers we became a family.holidays are the best time of year everyone is dressed up for photos.working around kids is also something i had fun doing
good,One of the few jobs I enjoyed and would go back to. Hard fast paced work but paid fairly. Only down fall is that management doesn't care about the employees.
good,Management as very rude and non helping. Really horrible to be there during busy days with no help. I learned how to handle multiple task and always stay busy.
good,"All of the lower level employees were fantastic to work with. Most LOD's okay to work with, however everyone I talked to didn't like the store manager and agreed the person under him was essentially the store manager since they did all of the duties of the store manager."
good,"I was a sales rep., working in JCPENNY. I working in the front being a cashier. I also walked around the store to help customers find what they were looking for. I enjoyed working at Jcpenny's, the only issue was not a well enough pay and/or hours."
good,The co-workers were easy to work with. Learned a lot about customer service and how to effectively multi-task. Gained a lot of cash handling experience. Flexible hours.
good,"I butted heads with a couple of the supervisors but otherwise the staff were motivated with free gift cards, food and parties. A typical day involved great customer service to the customers, stoking the shelves in the shoe department and keeping the area very neat.I learned how to stand up to clients that are trying to steal, or lying about prices. The management were helpful when asked how to do something there was great communication between the supervisors. My co-workers were great friends among their own department. The hardest part of the job were the customers the majority of them were great but the negative people were off-putting. The most enjoyable part of the job was the great friends that I made."
good,"The manager of the store was great, he always would let me know what a great job I was doing. One of the other supervisors gave many employees an issue including myself. "
good,"A normal shift would consist of doing fine jewelry inventory before and after the shift. Help with the displays, assist customers with their decisions and questions.  Jewelry repair reports and adding insurance to their purchases.  Sign up customers for a JCPenny card. I learned more about fine jewelry.  Most co-workers were a pleasure to work with but there were some that would snatch away your customer with whom I was working with in order to obtain the commission.  I liked interacting with customers and seeing a smile on their face when I helped them."
good,"Working for Jcpenney is okay, but  after ten years of hard work I am still an associate.  I have degree in Fashion Design;  it's time for me to move on to management or design.  I am confident with  my experiences I learned at Jcpenney."
good,Greet customers in timely and professional manner. Recommend and help customers select merchandise based on their needs. Maintain friendly and professional customer interaction.
good,"everyone is not on the same page, the management do whatever they want and tell you to do the opposite."
good,great place to work for not enough hours to pay the bills only 20 hours per week
good,"*sales, customer service"
good,I would come in and log in and work the cashier and store all day! I learned no matter how hard to work either you get a raise or not! Liked the co workers but didn't like the pay! Enoyable though!
good,"I did enjoy my time at JCP, but mainly for the people. The culture when I arrived was good but was slowly being eroded by money problems and more and more toxic steps to try to stop the bleeding. It really turned into a 7 days a week job as the company's problems are too large to ignore or not impact every aspect of work life. It's unfortunate, JCP was a really good place to work but it may be too late for them."
good,"I worked in the hair salon and it was extremely slow. It was more of a commission salon with a base pay of minimum wage. The people I worked with were friendly, but there was never a manager."
good,"A typical day included cleaning fitting rooms, working the cash wrap, and restocking when needed. Employees are normally younger and aren't very motivated."
good,"I'm not really a fan of the job, the staff is nice and it'd a nice working environment. Not really flexible on scheduling when you need days off, often declined. Good company, nice employees. Just not a job I will stay at."
good,"Good place to work and meet new people, helps you prepare for bigger and better things, i leaned a lot of new things to help me do better at other place I got to work at."
good,I was a first time college student at the time 2years out of high school. This job was fun at that time. I was the sales associate for the Homes Department. The employees worked together as a team.
good,Take out all the Jewelry from the safe and put them on the counter every day to be sure all counter is clean and organize to catch customer attention.count all diamonds to know that they match the inventory and subtract any sales every day also
good,"I enjoy working here. The various daily hours does not always work with the human body, can be very demanding, tiresome.  Not any compensation perks like they used too."
good,The only way to make any money here is to be here all the time. Your basically gonna get paid Minimum wage unless you can bring in 500 + sales a week. Extremely hard with little clientele or just starting out. They lack a high walk in overflow.
good,jc penny is a fast moving job at the JC penney in Kentucy managers worked with you on hours you needed and was good at helping but store hours could be a little draining
good,The culture at jcpenny was stressful. There were too many time constraints on unloading trucks and selling credit. The pressure to sell the credit card was unreasonable and unbearable.
good,"I would not do this sort of job unless you are a teenager, because they only want to pay you minimum wage.   You work extremely hard and are forced to work many different department, and get no training on the different departments so the customers think you are stupid. I just would not do this again unless I was absolutely desperate"
good,"- Poor Management"
good,This company as a whole is a great company just the people in certain places just do cut throat things. The management needs better training .Deal with customers and making them happy that was the fun part of the job weather if it was helping a little girl find a dress to prom to a church dress for an older woman.
good,Need more opportunity for you to grow that way you can advance more. Also need to restructure some of the management at some of the stores to ensure employees are happy
good,"When I first joined J C Penney, I thought I would always be there. But I soon found out that most of the employees were not at all friendly. And the security team watched the employees very closely. I was told that most of their shoplifting was done by employees, which really shocked me. "
good,It can be a very busy but messy day depending day of the week. Management is not that helpful and i feel they get away with doing noting. The hardest part is that the schedules fluctuate a lot and hours are not that good if you are part-time.
good,There was a good training system prior to starting on the floor that was really helpful. I remember this being an overall positive experience for my first time working customer service in retail.
good,"great coworkers, hours are good, had one entire weekend off a month, but had to work holidays n some sundays. salon needed updated also. enjoyed the store/salon discount. great benefit pkg"
good,"A typical day at work for me is getting there, clocking in, and becoming aware of what section/department I will be working in that day. While working at jcpenny I have learned how to properly use a cash register."
good,"I think the job alone could use a lot of tweaks here and there. They're very unprofessional when it comes to having conversations with associates, and are very inconsiderate of the needs for others."
good,I learned that no matter how hard you worked you had little chance of advancement and if you started as part-time you could never become a full-time employee.
good,"I worked here for apx 12 years in the payroll dept until Penney's management changed.  It started as a good place to work, but advancement is almost impossible, unless you are in management."
good,I was only a cashier at JC Penney's for a short while. I was happy with the way they treated everyone equally even if you were new. I had a hard time while I was working there and they gave me some time off.
good,"I worked in the children's department which was very fun. However, the management was kind of cruddy and there wasn't room for improvement or raises. Pay was not good."
good,"Decent hours "
good,"JCP was fun to work at only because I got along really well with my coworkers. Management was uptight, not very understanding, and not very patient with new employees. Employees to them are disposable and there will always be another."
good,Not the best place to work. Everyone is in it for themselves and won't help others with taking breaks. Terrible management.
good,I gained of experience in customer service and management at this company. I made a lot of friends hers and learned how to be a leader
good,"The work itself is not hard, however the micro managing is somewhat overwhelming. The people that work with me are amazing. I have learned to be more independent working with this company."
good,This was my first time working on a assembly line it was a nice experience a lot of moving and bending the shifts would go by quick.
good,"When entering the establishment, summaries of goals and sales accomplishments for each department is established. Entering the sales floor, fitting rooms and customer service at registers are done continuous. Management very nice and pleasant fellows. The co-workers are bubbly and genuine. The only dificulty is accomplishing recover and fitting room cleaned to standards when working a department to yourself without other coworkers helping. Everyone in this establishment is very nice and a joy to work with, they're job."
good,"Working at JCPenney was probably one of the better part time jobs that I've had.  While the wages weren't the best, they paid me more than any part-time job I held while in Illinois.  "
good,i enjoyed working there it was just an unorganized work place
good,for the most part everything was decent there just didnt like working mall hrs!
good,"Its a lot of work when you are on the support team, but its fun."
good,"I liked working there, for the most part the people were nice but others were mean. I liked working out on the floor interacting with the customers but did not like doing door to floor."
good,"The job was pretty easy, but a few customers were an issue all the time. But due that i learned a lot with how to deal with different kind of customers. The customers were very diverse so learned a lot of dealing with different kind of people and society.The job hours were horrible and especially the weekend hours , I literally had no energy after school and work , so had a pretty boring life."
good,They need better management and more pay raises. The employees were very friendly like family. The management needs more work as far as keeping a solid manager.
good,"I was very pleased with how lenient the company was with their work hours. I was able to complete my schooling, along with working enough hours to financially support myself. Another thing I really enjoyed was my co-workers. They really brightened my day and it helped the store run like it should."
good,"Coworkers are your ""you can do it team"". It gets you going through out the day. Easy but heavy work. Get to meet lots of different individuals and tricks for the job."
good,The managers at grand canyon are sweet and pleasant to work with but has absolutely no communication skills. I had a husband of 26yrs sudden die due to health issues and they fired me. No care no proper procedure on power line leave due to the death say i was job abandonment that was falsely accusation but im able to be rehired .the 9$hr. pay is a joke on their behalf and high theif is so ridiculous at the grand canyon location. Will not go back if they paid me double. No care no support not even counselor for my death and all i had was top reviews from customers everyday .
good,Fast paced environment and not a lot of floor support. Older cashiers seemed to be the cause of slow lines and miscommunication between customers. Liked being on the floor but always seemed to be on a register.
good,JCPenney is a great company to work for if you're in school for a part time job and for someone who is interested in retail. pay is low needs better management. has great employee discount though.
good,"They took up to much of my time and the managers were not too determined to have organization in the store, which led to staying super late after work."
good,"fun environment, fast pace, great music, can make a'lot of friends, organize clothes, collaborate fashion together, dress up mannequins, working on the register can get crazy at times, especially during the holidays but overall a fun place to work."
good,while at JC Penney i worked for the portrait studio . I also worked in the salon as a hair stylist after finishing Cosmotology School. I enjoyed working with the customers and clients.
good,"They trained me on standup forklift with no prior experiece. +"
good,This was a good place to start my cosmetology career. We went through a couple managers when through my duration with the company. We ended up with only our store manager as our salon manager.
good,Working at JCPennys was a good experience. New/regulars came in and always asked for me to help them. I’m a peoples person and I show that I care. I have a wonderful customer service training .
good,Ok place to work needs more pay and better customer support and worker support other then that I would recommend others working at jcpenny as a first time job.
good,"Needs Better Management, More control in different department, better line signs more employees give more hours to employee more understanding managers"
good,very slow job have to sit all day rather be moving round and staying up and moving around. the job is ok for the store but for others that like to be moving and not in one spot
good,Overall it was a good job to be in while finding myself. Would not recommend as a life career as the chain is dying off and internal growth is very limited.
good,A great part-time job but not a long term main job. I enjoyed working here but not enough money to provide for your family. If your looking for a second job then this would be a good one
good,"Clock in. Went to manger to job. Clean dressing room out, customer service, sales transaction accurate cash handling, organized sales floor, assistance to customers."
good,Fast paced environment. Learned that big companies plan the future for years to come. The hardest part of the job was the drive and the most enjoyable part of the job was the people.
good,Working at JcPenney was a very rewarding experience that taught me many new skills that I would not have gained otherwise. There were a few challenges here and there regarding the technology that they use (it could definitely be improved). but other than that it was a nice experience. I was able to schedule time off in advance without issues and worked hours that were doable.
good,"I enjoyed assisting customers.  I did not like the way management treated the employees.  Employees that worked were treated unfairly while the employees that did little to no work did what they wanted to do,"
good,"There was never enough employees per shift to get work done. Too many young people left on their own who didn't work and/or were on their cell phones when supposed to be working. Mandatory weekends, holidays, never two days off in a row."
good,"This was actually my first job so I wouldn't even know how other jobs compare to this one but in my opinion, it's just in the middle. Not the worst but not the best either."
good,I left jc penney because I got the job at lowes that paid more ans was not as stressfull. At jc penney I stocked shelves and then I went to a job fair and Lowes was there and offered me a jo. I helped open the Lowes in NH
good,Great Company to work for. Hours are typical retail hours but the pay was not as competitive as others. Learned a ton great first management experience.
good,"Jcpenny's is a great place to work if your looking for a consistent job. There are no pay raises, or any opportunity to advance to supervisor/manager."
good,i have nothing to say in the last 2 years that i have worked there they have taken away my vacation pay my health ins and i did not get a raise in 2012 and 13. when i did ask for 2 weeks off and was given the 2 weeks off 14 days i ended up recieving a phone call asking me if i would come in the second week and work. and i said no so then i was told i didnt have a job so i have to throw all my plans for that week out the window and go to work.
good,My first job and i liked it until everyone else became childish and reporting each other for dumb reasons. Management would believe everything and it felt like high school. Boring most of the time but i ts not hard just tiring to be standing up all day.
good,I liked my coworkers because we were there to support each other and keep smiling when you have rude customers who think we own the company.  There may be a reason why so many brick and mortor business are going out of business and doing everthing online.  Good luck to those who think this will make your life more convenient.
good,"Management is pushed to provide the best customer service, keep merchandise looking perfect, and coach employees to do the same. Very fast paced but fun."
good,"Good company to work for, an excellent environment. Awesome benefits and lovely customers to make happy. A lot of activity to keep you busy, and a lot of experience."
good,the pay was fair just to much cut throat from management to co-workers a lot of sossip through out the whole ware house and always down sizing ill be suprise if still in business
good,"J.C. Penney started out as a great place to work. However, as the time went on, the company starting losing their stream and there was no more job security."
good,It was a wonderful way to meet people and help customers but the management could step up a notch or so. This was a very disorganized business.
good,A typical day at work is working with customers and using the cash registers to perform many functions. I learned how to work in different departments and work with many different people. The workplace was mostly serious with jokes sometimes told. The hardest part was working with difficult customers when you are trying to help them and they are making it more difficult. The most enjoyable part was seeing customers walking away with a happy face and being satisfied with the service that I had provided to them.
good,I did not feel it was a occupation to have as an adult. The pay was not enough to even pay for gas to get there and I didn't like the problems that went with the company. It was a great job for a high school student that lived close. I do miss and love the workers.
good,It was a generally ok place to work for. I assisted customers and the customer feedback was generally honest and hopeful.
good,"I had moved from California to Florida last August and was looking for a job when, I was very fortunate to work at JC Penneys after being off work for 6 years, I appreciated that the Jewelry manager was willing to take a chance with me knowing how long it had been since I had worked.  I totally enjoyed working there the other co-workers were very helpful when I need help.  Made a lot of friends, I would still be there but the drive (4 hours a day) was making it hard to get to work especially with the cost of gas, I was only making $8.50 an hour."
good,"Most of the people I met while at JCPenney I loved. I thought they were very professional and good at their jobs. There were however a few that definitely could've used some improvement. The average day of work was pretty much the same thing over and over again, but because I got to work so closely with my higher ups, I got to learn some important skills and qualities."
good,"I worked as a cashier and handled a lot of money. I also helped customers get great deals and find exactly what they were looking for. My co-workers that were my age and older were fine to work with. The younger co-workers were less of a joy to work with, they played around and talked too much wile other people worked hard. The hardest part of the job working hard and seeing no kind of recognition. The most enjoyable part was seeing the grateful expression on customers faces when you help them out."
good,It is a decent place to work. I myself didnt have a problem. Although management could use some work on how they treat their employees.
good,"great work place, team felt environment, I am one of the leads in the Shoe dept. and I enjoy my extra responsibilities, which include Early Morning truck shipments, and floor planning of price signs and graphics, daily inventory display report, and standard customer service. In addition its my responsibility to make sure the shoe dept is kept to standard while all of my other shoe employees attend to customer service"
good,"This was a wonderful job, I really enjoyed do photos for family's. work hours were long but very productive. I worked alone most of the time, but when others were around we worked well together."
good,"First shift (opening the store) is a good/bad deal.  Manager spends 15 minutes giving out small awards for great customer service but more time lecturing about pushing credit cards, online ordering, and selling gift cards.  It's never enough and you are expected to meet the company goals even if you are only working one or two days a week.  Being singled out in a staff meeting is very poor management and does not push the employee to sell more of anything.  It is embarrassing and makes employees angry.  A bad way to start the day.  Co-workers are pretty awesome and the varying ages and length in service is amazing.  Watching a co-worker doing questionable things (wearing clothing from the racks before they purchase them) and disappearing for long stretches is difficult if it gets busy.  Sometimes the Supervisor on duty will answer the antiquated walky-talky system and other times it just continues to ring.  The computer system does not function properly and locks up frequently.  This does not sit well with the customers.  Manager is either in a great mood or the polar opposite.  Recovery after the store closes can be very good if everyone keeps up with it.  It can be a nightmare if only a few employees are pulling their weight.  It's retail and the pay is not great.  I really enjoy helping the customer's and that makes up for a lot of the other stuff that goes with the job."
good,"I really did enjoy working here! The environment was great, just lacked foot traffic because it is in it's own building. It's just time for me to get serious and find a Full-Time position!"
good,"Working there I enjoyed, but I notice that they are very stereotypical.  Me being an African American female, they always feel the need to tell me to talk, and act professional, and I am a senior in college getting a degree in sociology, I tend to believe that I act, and talk professionally, and being that I intern with children, I tend to believe I act and talk professionally."
good,"A typical day working at JCPenney would start off by clocking and head to morning meetings with managers and co workers. The managers go over what needs to approved, our customer service ratings, store sales, etc. I mostly did registers so I made sure the cash register had to right amount of money and organized the environement close to the register area until a customer needed help with merchandise or was ready to check out their merchandise. Other days I would do customer service out on the floor greeting the shoppers and making sure my department looked nice and organized."
good,Very easy and fun job. There was nothing hard about working in the shoe department.
good,It was different. Fun. But no room for improvement. Fast pace.
good,I was hired during the holiday season so I experience a very high pace environment it was a lot of fun.
good,Typical day dealt with signing all the information in the store and making sure my division was set. Marking clearance and other things they find wrong in my area.
good,"The hardest part of my job - I had to train myself by asking questions. Managers were not knowledgeable in Windows Department. I had to learn from trial and error. At this time there is no one besides my self and a new Manager that is learning this department. End result, customers are calling for information as to when I am scheduled to be in. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting & helping customers with their window designs and needs. There are co-workers that are there that are not dedicated and have no willingness to learn that department and feel as though they are thrown into it. There is one Manager there that is truly dedicated, I appreciate her and her ongoing training & knowledge she provides to all of us."
good,"I have been with JCP for 5 years now, in which I have dedicated myself to the company by trying to advance myself with my degree in RMM and become a well rounded manager. Needless to say the powers that be did not feel that I was right for them so gave me a job out of pitty. "
good,"Very bad working conditions but everyone was friendly, orders neve stopped coming in, nor had a slow day"
good,It was a great job to have right out of high school it taught me how to maintain balance in a work place.
good,"Management is questionable at best, my co-workers don't really do the jobs they are supposed to.  The hardest part of the job is trusting the people you work with, and the most enjoyable part is catching the shoplifters."
good,Race shouldn't factor into employment. outside of that great place to work
good,"-help people with anything they might need"
good,It was good job to have during the holidays when you need some extra money. I just wish they had kept me on after the fact.
good,My shift of graveyard and I had school as well so a typical day at work was tiring. I learn the roles of a shipper and a receiver. I manage my duties to the best of my ability. This job usually is for one man only. The hardest part of the job is unloading or loading boxes at the highest point in the truck trailer. There were no enjoyable part of the job.
good,"JC Penny Lincoln, NE		Customer Service Associate and Cashier	October 2011 – July 2012"
good,Fellow employees are enjoyable to work with. Fresh store enviroment
good,"When I first got to jcp, it was a challenging workplace, but since I've been there the environment has helped me reshap myself not only at work but also outside of work. Although, I did not give jcp a great overall rating, I really do appreciate the job for assisting me in professional and personal development and growth. I love what I do. I love being a resource to my external as well as internal employees, also training the employees (new & existing)."
good,Arranging items into shelves.Keep things in order for customers to select what they want.Freindly management.Co-workers are very good. Helping each other.Arranging items \back into the shelves is the hardest part.Talking to customers get their likes and dislikes and finding the correct item for them is enjoyable.
good,"So I don't think I got a fair view of life as a JCP employee. That said, I can see why Macy's and Nordstrom's are kicking the snot out of them financially. JCP has brands I've never heard of (and not in the good way), and don't really seem to have any specialty. One thing that is cool about the JCP at Citrus Heights is that they have an in-house salon/barbershop. There's a nice german woman there who does good work and gives good advice... Working there was alright and the coworkers and most of the customers made the place bearable. Corporate doesn't know what it is doing, and JCP's new CEO seems unable to really bring JCP back from the brink."
good,It was an ok place to work. Sometimes there were a lot of drama.
good,Can be a good job if you're ok with doing the same thing for years on end. Job security is limited at the moment with lay offs at an all high.
good,"A typical work day during the week is okay and reasonable. Assigned areas and tasks are normally assigned. However, sometimes the company doesn't prepare for if other employees call off. Sometimes doing projects such as laying out the store and redesigning it for the month can be hard but fun. The weekends are crazy and sometimes under-staffed, especially in the women's department, which is always packed. Another associate won't be scheduled to come in until fours, which you may only have another two hours until the shift is over. So basically one can be running around like a crazy person trying to meet the demanding needs of customers."
good,"I was employed as a Part time associate at the North Point Pkwy JCPenney location, and I did enjoy providing great customer service and assisting the customers with questions, concerns, and providing discounts to customers with the coupons advertised or mailers, saving the JCPenney Customers money. The typical evening at work would consist of customer service, cashier sales, recovery, monotering the fitting rooms, and helping out various departments where ever needed."
good,"No where to advance and worse now with Ron Johnson as CEO. (Thanks Ron!) JCP is trying hard to get back basic values and remember it's humble beginnings as The Golden Rule Store. The philosophy is working, but the marketing strategy isn't quite there yet."
good,"a typical day is open your draw count it, ring up the customer merchandise answer their question and clean up."
good,"I enjoyed working for JC Penney’s, there was a lot less stress then other retail job that I have had in the past. The management has encouraged me to stay with the company, and was helped me in every way possible to transfer to another store after my move."
good,It is a good time working there it has been very slow lately for a commission assosiate.
good,"I don't like to disclosure any information about it, I prefer not to say anything about this work place, would like to find a new job opportunity without say anything here"
good,"The good great customer's great co workers "
good,The way they do and say things weren't not helpful. You didn't have the amount of hours you wanted. I felt I wasn't treated in a respectable way. No organization.
good,Upon searching for employment this job provided safe traveling and decent environment and it is in a nearby local area the public transportation is accessible for many.
good,They always cut hours randomly  . Schedules get changed at the last minute. Management can be better .they could have better standards or employees and management
good,"it was my first and only job so i dont have much to base it off of, but overall it wasn't bad. there were a few rumors that i got called in for (none of them true) but other than that everyone seemed to be really nice and willing to help"
good,It's a nice job for high school students. It doesn't pay much and it's part time but it's laid back and not real busy until the holidays. It was a decent job.
good,"Management here was really bad and I ended up quitting after 6 months. The job was easy and I was told by my department head that I was a great employee, it was just the manager and a few coworkers that were the problem."
good,"My Job was only temp., but the time there was nice but I did not like folding all those clouths.  The employees and managment were kind overall and it is a wonderful company and great products."
good,its a bad place to work with management but good job itself. the management team sucked pretty bad. I think they need to fire the old ones and hire new ones
good,"This is a good ""starting out"" job.  I learned a lot here but I did not see myself advancing here.  I would recommend this job to young workers who need experience.  Overall, JcPenney is a good place to work."
good,"The leadership team is not honest. "
good,"Wonderful place to work at with great people . Great benefits , free food , potlucks , . Great Customer Service and it’s in the mall. If you need the excerise this is the place to work at"
good,"JCPenney was my first job, so I had nothing to compare it to, and I enjoyed my job for the most part. Now, I know that corporate sucks and they do not care about you. They push really hard for you to get credit card applications from customers."
good,It was a good work environment. My coworkers were nice and helpful people and we worked together as a team. We had a good flow of client traffic that would come to see us for our services.
good,I enjoyed helping customers and other associates when the lines got long.  It was a pretty good experience. I enjoyed getting sales first hand and discounts.
good,When the management changed it made a big difference in the store they started changing unassay things. Would make people move departments during shift . Would hirer new employees at a higher pay rate than I was at after being with the company for multiple years.
good,"I really enjoyed working there. I met wonderful people and made long lasting relationships. Of course, the pay was not very good. You had to work different shifts. But all in all I really like it."
good,Never enough associates scheduled to realistically perform job.There would be times where they had to cut our hours due to overtime. They throw you out on the floor without cross training you for different departments.
good,Working at jcpennys was just the same as working at home my job was cleaning and folding tables all day and working on the cash register when needed. I loved working at jcpennys they treated me like family which made me very comfortable and happy the only hard part about working there is that i get bored easily and I like when everything is busy so i can always have something to do and we weren't always busy. The most enjoyable part is that we had great team work.
good,"First time job only, you can do better. I have nothing else to say because I haven't worked for them in a while and I just want to get this over with."
good,"as a salon manager i was responsible for productivity, networking, fundraising, and making a profit, inventory control as well. also responsible for bringing in new hire and educational classes to advance employess"
good,Chill environment with possibility of advancement. great place to work with easy policys to follow. Working in the catalog department was a nice change from working retail on the sales floor. A lot of multitasking while assisting customers and Answering phones
good,"I worked in the jewelry department, I assisted many customers with their purchases, and then rang them up.  We were given a small incentive of 1% on the purchase price of fine jewelry."
good,I just worked here seasonally and we were always busy. The men's department is where I ended up and I enjoyed it the pace was a bit slower and I actually enjoyed the work. It was tedious at times but still a good place to work overall at least if they let you stay after the holidays
good,"JCP does care about their employees, however Management can be kind of rough. Overall, I enjoyed my time there but mobility to advance was slim to none unfortunately."
good,"I'd work there again but in a different position. Friendly management. Easy going work place. Customers only sucked now and then (meaning they would get rude over something that was their fault, ex. Past return policy time)."
good,"The environment is slow. A typical day at work during “slow season” which is basically everything except for Black Friday, Christmas and Tax Free Weekend, consists of checking out less than 15 people, straightening clothes over and over. I did learn how to work a register, how to handle money, how to be in charge of what money goes where out of the till and how to track it."
good,"okay place to work, very fast paced, very team oriented, big work place, nice customers, great head manager, nice coworkers, great discounts, good family place."
good,"I had a lot of fun during my time working at this job. I got along great with co workers, and management. This is a great work environment for someone looking for a job!"
good,you have to pick and be right on point with picking. People will rush you out there way or even run you over. Packing you have to pack fast to get the job done.
good,"managers were rude. talked about other workers. not good hours. expected a lot from you. not good pay. tried to stay as long as i could, but i ended up getting tired of it."
good,"Poor management. The customers were awesome. The  benefits we’re OK ! The salon was outdated,  however supplied everything you needed to do your job correctly ."
good,it was great for a job wile in school or college but the training is very poor they will train you in one area but very poor in more then one area and they will expect you to know thing you are not trained for in the first place
good,It's a good first job for a teenager or a college student. There aren't many opportunities for advancements and they rarely promote within. If you don't like working in customer service this is not the place for you.
good,"A big portion of this job was related to online sales and credit card applications. Hours were based around how many applications you could complete. Typical day involves running/balancing a cash register, folding clothes, helping shoppers."
good,"lots of work, and running the floor. little pay no insurance or vacation because I only work on weekends and sometimes through the week. co worker are ok sometimes you have a lot of people that do not do the job they just stay on the register or walk around. they are very flexible with your hours because I work also a full time job so they work around my schedule so that is great"
good,it qas a good job to me and they willlwork withyou and help you while you training on your frsit day and they make sure you do everything right on the job and they good to work with and it is a good fun job you joke around and help each other on the job
good,there are many benefits to having a customer service job. it teaches you the patience and understanding for merchandise placement and the trends. it also shows you how customers tend to shop.
good,I hang the  items help customer service got credit apps. that help me win the games of the most apps.  help customer find there right size and the right Style.
good,"As far as the job itself, I loved it. For the most part, the staff was extremely friendly but the managers had a tendency to be rude and demanding. They often asked me to perform other tasks that I was not required to do simply because they did not want to do it themselves."
good,I knew from day one the exciting environment and people would keep me engaged forever! My team is like a family and we have potlucks all the time. The customers are awesome! We have regulars that come in just to see us. Great place to work.
good,On Monday's I would recover the floor the best I could from the weekend. Stock the floor with merchandise that sold out through the weekend. Answer any manager on duty calls and answered any customer and associate questions.
good,"Everything was good there except management and compensation, the coworkers are okay in the beginning but then it feels like they tear you down, I had a few mental break downs because of them. I would literally be crying in front of the customers."
good,"Company treats its people pretty well ... a good discount and a lot of talk about respect and appreciation for employees. The first store I worked at was fantastic! Like a big family! But the second store had terrible management, and that's why I left."
good,"I enjoyed what I did and had a great time just folding clothing however, the employees there were heartless and one even said ""I am happy your mother is dying because she doesn't have to deal with you"" to my face."
good,I loved working at JCPenney but the longer i worked there the more i realized that they had poor management. Need better and proper training for new associates and supervisors.
good,I would go to work and things would be regular just like any other day. I worked in the women's shoes department and I made sure the costumers where helped to the best of my ability. I also kept my department clean at all times.
good,I would love to talk about my experience and opinion of this job with a representative of your company face to face. Thank you for your time and consideration.
good,"Great for college students. Flexible but doesn't pay much. Management is good, but isn't now open to employees opinions. Discount is generous. 1 hour lunch breaks."
good,"If your looking for part time extra play money yes but not to pay bills and support a family. "
good,Working at J.C. Penney's at La Plaza Mall was a fun experience they have so many good deals that even the staff can benefit from. You really get to know the customers.
good,"This JCP was different from others. There were plenty of characters that actually did their job and helped you do yours, while making the work day pass by pretty quickly."
good,"Work at JCPenney's was nice on a typical day.  I was working with some very nice people that were very helpful.  I started there during the holiday seasonal help, and it was always busy.  Helping people that came in the store was rewarding."
good,"I worked in the womens department, I assisted customers, cleaned out the dressing room, and put clothes back out on the sales racks. The job was enjoyable, I like working with the public and seeing the customers."
good,"Good Place but hours are pretty much given during the holidays . Other than that, you never get hours"
good,People in the corporate offices who know nothing of how a salon works but tell us what we are to do! Not ok with that! And the pricing is alittle high in the salon for t g e idaho falls area! That makes it hard to build an effective clientele when there are many more competitive priced salons right down the street...then if we don't naked our productivity standards then we are fired! Ya not ok! But i.love my boss and coworkers! They were great to work with
good,A typical day is working one on one with the public.  I have learned that all people like discounts and when you can help them out they appreciate it.  Other employees there are very nice and friendly and they are willing to help out when you call for help.
good,"Once you have mastered one task, it's on the next. If you are great at one thing, you better believe you will be doing everyone elses job!"
good,"i enjoy working here and learned many things along with dealing customers and learning how to deal with many situations bad or good. I feel that management has done a pretty good job considering the set backs and loss of many associates. The hardest part of this job was having other associates not be on the same page towards work flow and causing delays and minor setbacks for future projects and affecting the work environment in negative manner."
good,"I really enjoyed my time here. Unfortunately, the company was restructuring. I was able to use  my skills in  merchandising, human resources in a fast paced atmosphere."
good,It was a fun and knowlegable experience and i gained many skills and quite a vast amount of new skills during my stay at jcp.
good,Super Job that I loved. You have to like helping people and do your best to make them feel great. You meet a lot of wonderful persons and gain insight into the lives of others. Its very rewarding. I found it hard not express my full opinion when asked.
good,"I will not bash the company but am happy to have moved on."
good,"I was trained how to fit bras and shape wear. I put out stock. assisted customers with purchases, rang up purchases, and bagged merchandise. I offered customers the opportunity to open a credit card account."
good,"Restocking shoes, answering phones, checking inventory, customer service. I am able to get along with all of my co workers. We are a great team in the shoe department. The most enjoyable part of my job I get to interact with people."
good,My job would be better if I was not pushing a cart all day in the heat for 10 hours. Right now I am temporary and I do not know if I want to become permanent because some people there are very rude and inconsiderate. But I get through my days by staying positive and knowing that I am working to be the best person I can be until I finish school.
good,"It was  a fast paced work environment and you worked from the time you clocked in until the end of your shift,  You had to be dedicated and ready to work,"
good,The company is at a struggling point at the moment. It is difficult to move up in the company even where you are out performing the competition.
good,"You are never bored. Working at JCP is great for people like me who love a challenge. You have a large workload with minimal hours to complete it in. This taught me time management & associate motivation. I was a part of the management team so I learned how to motivate my employees to complete the work no matter how impossible the task seemed. I found positive motivation works best. I can't say any thing in my job was difficult to do,  since I don't view anything as a problem. I see everything as a challenge."
good,We open with good food inventory then gather to prep more for the evening. Given money to us for making change and get our safety inspection and uniform clean and correct. We then open with orders from our sales technique or just repeat customers and just enjoy throwing doe up and laying down a great looking pizza to deliver with a smile.
good,A typical day at work would be me scheduling appointments and checkout clients answering the phones and meeting and greeting people.  I need minima management.  I assist the stylist with rebooking clients.  The hardest part of my job is making every customer happy.
good,its a nice job to have if your working with out bills. The hours give are not reasonable to an adult with a family and a lot of bills. the schedule varies from week to week. you could possibly work almost 40 in one week and only work 20 in another week. Very unpredictable and unbalanced.
good,"J.C.Penney was my first job that i actually used a cash register, also helped build my communication skills as well as getting over a fear of talking to people i don't know"
good,"Being an employee of JCPenney, has definitely been a wonderful experience. A typical day at work consisted in constant customer engagement and operations. I learned a lot about people's behaviors and habits. I learned what effects the customer psychologically. The management team always made working enjoyable. The co-workers were the most enjoyable part of working at JCPenney. A lot of long term relationships were built there. The hardest part of my job would have to be the recovery phase. Recovering from huge sales and trying to gain balance again."
good,I was there for 3 years it was compatible with my school schedule.
good,Gained a lot of leadership experience. Was able to move around and advance.
good,"This store has quite possibly the worst store leader in the company. She has no people skills whatsoever. She changes the schedule without any sort of notice to anyone; I've called people and asked why they hadn't shown up for their shift and they tell you they printed their schedule and they weren't on it. Then when she's called out on it, she blames other management team members. There is a way to tell who made the change and every time, it is her. "
good,A typical day consist of being able to muti task and move at a reasonable/constant speed to keep accuracy and production up.
good,wasnt enough work so i really cant say much because it wasnt as long but i enjoyed the people there
good,"Learned how a new store is set up according to various departments,"
good,Can be a fun place to work for. Lots of supportive staff depending on the department.
good,"I manage Fine Jewelry, Fashion Jewelry, Intimate Apparel, Pajamas, Women's Accessories, and Seasonal departments so my typical day is to maintain each department, capture reports for Fine Jewelry of the day prior. Coach and train associates as well as participating in LOD(leader on duty) which I'm in charge of the whole store for 2-3hours daily. As part of management there is thorough training and on the job training this is what stands out as the most important aspect of JCPenney. All the managers work together cohesively for the common goal of customer service and making our departments run smoothly. The hardest part of the job is the workload of the departments especially when the day is shorthanded from call-outs. The most enjoyable part of the job is no doubt being able to help customers and not have to call a higher manager-we have the ability to make that choice that works best for the customer as well as the company."
good,"Overall cool place to work, but management was rude and never had your back."
good,"It was a wonderful experience, I learned so much about retail from cash registers, more customer service and sales, as well as supervising and being uncharged of a whole department."
good,working retail for the first time there wasnt that big of a deal..its just so so
good,"My first job so it was a learning experience for me. I love clothes and love to shop, so everything I needed was right there for me!!!"
good,it was ok just had its downtime thought it would be more constant work. i loaded trailers with packages for ups internet orders. management was ok just not around all the time and co workers always complaining.
good,"cleaning and organizing clothes, co workers worked together as a family."
good,"I worked putting out clothing on the sales for and unpacking the truck, not a lot of hours, pay sucked."
good,Spent every shift tidying up the store and helping customers
good,"worked in catalog department. answered phones, helped customers, and made online orders"
good,"I would get on Computer check orders that had arrived at Store. Call people to let them know order was there. I would ring up customers, take charge card payments, Place orders, give out orders, take returns, get money for Salon when they needed it. I worked mostly by myself ...Co-workers were mostly students who did not take work seriously. There was no hard part to my Job I loved Catalog Service Center. Most enjoyable was helping people, making sure orders came in good condition and always keeping the Customer happy."
good,"worked 8 hours a day and the pay was above expected, great flow of customers coming through the store. Sales and promotions brought these customers back."
good,"My job as a Visual Assistant and later Supervisor of Stock Replenishing was a challenging and rewarding experience. Both jobs had a visually creative element that was exciting and varied from season to season. Overal J.C.Penney was a positive work experience. I would have stayed if they had not cut all F/T staff to P/T, so I had to move on. "
good,"worked alone in own area, took orders, unloaded truck, pulled orders. stock catalogs "
good,I am a offloader regularly and I really enjoy doing it. I learned how to stack pallets and use a pallet jack as well as to offloader. Everyone there is very helpful and friendly.
good,The job was temp help. You didn't know when you went in to work if it was going to be for an hour or for nine hours so it was hard to manage and money.
good,it was fun meeting new people. I learned alot about retail. hardest part was the schedule. the best part about the job was getting to see the people that you were friends with at work.
good,I am very proud and happy to have been part of JCP company. It was a great place to work. Thanks to the position I had I was able to learn a lot of stuff. As a visual Specialist I was all around the store and I was able to learn a lot from all the departments as well as I was able to help everyone in the store not only the customers but as also my partners. Bad thing a lot of changes have been going on since the new CEO took charge. Now I'm unemployed but I'm sure with all the experience that I gained I'll soon find a good job.
good,It was fun when the store had customers. A lot of the time you will spend time there with only 1 or 2 customers in a 5 hours work day.
good,Everyday I would straighten up my dept. and operate the register for sales purchases.
good,"prepair to open store clean entrance doors,empty all trash,pickup floors clean floors,all bathrooms spotless, move inbound freight to designated areas,assist associates as needed,replace any lights not on and accomplish any other task assigned by manager or asst manager. How a store operates behind the scenes,to make it successful for customer experiences co workers were all fun and appreciate from your assistance. hardest part of job was alternating shifts each week. helping associates as well as customers when called upon"
good,They don't work with your schedule customers are rude to you due to the changes you never advance with this company.
good,I loved it and every aspect of it the only thing I didnt like is short staffed. JCPennys always needed help and never could keep it
good,The work was monotonous. There was no room for advancement.
good,"I had a great career at JCPenney and really enjoyed the time I spent there. Unfortunatley, I was 1 of 600 laid off during JCPenney's restructuring in April of 2012"
good,"I enjoyed working with the people at this job, other than management. There is definitely a problem at this store and it starts at the top. Management here needs to improve."
good,"Jcpenney is a Cool place to work. Management is very friendly and helpful, customer flow is very personal."
good,"A typical day at work would involve checking the Cash Register to make sure you had the proper change to operate, Helping customers with all their needs. Cleaning the racks, floors, and shelves of all debris and refolding the clothes items. The management was very helpful and in training all employees to perform all duties requested. My co-workers were very nice and helpful at all times. The hardest part of the job was running a counter by yourself when the staff was shorthanded. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customer smile when you were able to help them find the exact items they wanted."
good,"I work at jcpenneys as an inventory accuracy assistant leading the task team. Opening the store and getting things running efficiently and productively. In charge or inventory, liquidation, defectives, and orange. In charge of unloading trucks completing them and sending reverse back to the warehouse."
good,A great atmosphere but lousy pay. To survive they have made many cuts cashiers are overwhelmed with the amount of duties they have. Not enough people to do tasks such as merchandising
good,"Managers never stick around. Usually they end up leaving or resign after inventory. No management help when things go wrong. Computers registers, printers always broken with no support to fix. Lack of supplies, people doing their job. Pay is unfair, underpaid, and favoritism goes on. Leads or supervisors care more about sitting in the back office eating snacks then involving themselves in the customer environment."
good,There are always things to like or dislike. The medical benefits aren’t great. Prior positions held with the company were great. The current position is micro managed and a favorites club.
good,"A typical day at work entails a few things such as typical payment transactions, returns, exchanges, and cleaning in between assisting customers. I feel I have leanered a lot from working here, especially how to greet customers and provide a great experience at the checkout. The management was pretty much the same as it is everwhere; they can be hard on you but also understanding. The hardest part of this job is remaining calm and polite when a customer is not happy or satisfied with their experience."
good,"Great staff. Too early. Boss expected more than waged The shifts are flexible and the workers are pleasant overall."
good,"either your doin sign change, don't forget about the crashes the systems have; or You're breaking down the truck."
good,"Flexible hours, good environment. Easy going. One of the easiest jobs I've ever had. But if you want a full time job then this is not the place for you. They only offer part time & minimum wage."
good,It’s a decent place to work as far as customer service jobs go. If your thinking about working there ask for what you think you want times two and add taxes. Once you get in their is little moving up. Long hours but refuse to make you full time bc than they will have to give you benefits and every one know what that game is like after 2009.
good,"It was good at first but this 1 manager will make you want to Quit, she will try everything in her power to make you quit if she doesn't like you. Thanks"
good,"I am a student and working at this job i can barley make ends meet with what i get paid. I ave asked many times for more working hours but i have always been told i can not get due to budget,"
good,I was working a seasonal position so it was hectic at times but it was not bad. For Black Friday we received double our pay which was nice. Other than that it was a pretty average job not too stressful but not too relaxed.
good,"its not a bad place to begin your work xperience, it has decent positions and there is always room to improve on something. becomes stagnant quick though so be careful"
good,Good place to work just not fair wages. They put a heavy work load on you and at times it's overwhelming. Don't like certain people they are backstabbers. So be very careful of some people! :-)
good,"It was very demanding each day that I worked. I had many responsibilities to fit into an eight-hour day because I was not allowed to work overtime. (The only time I was allowed to do overtime was when it was during the holidays or sales' days when it was very crazy and busy.) That was the hardest part of the job---trying to get everything done in an eight-hour work day. I enjoyed having some fun with coworkers, though we had to keep it professional, of course. The most enjoyable part of the job were my customers---especially those who came in just to see me and who specifically asked for me. I made it my personal mission to serve them the best I could and to go to almost any length to get them the product they wanted---the right size, color, design, etc. And they truly were grateful. I even had some try to tip me or give me gifts, for which I had to refuse politely because it was against store policy to accept tips or gifts from customers."
good,"Since Jcpenny was my first job, I was very nervous entering this fast pace work space. But with the help of football throughout high school this was nothing to me, i was able to learn everything very fast and keep up during busy hours. The one thing i did not like about it was the fact that I never met my supervisor or manager that is why I do not have their information on my resume. Everyday I would clock in and go straight to a specific cashier location and never was introduced or given any sort of contact information for my manager. Upon me being hired, I was hired by two employees."
good,"A typical work day included selling and stocking.  I wasn't happy with my ratings even though I was up in the sales categories. we could have done better to get customers in the store. at first there was plenty of staff, then they started laying off. That meant more responsibility was put back on the employees.  The store started with plenty of sales specially around the holidays then the sales have been going down every since."
good,"There is extreme favoritism within the store and imediete supervisors do not share information with other associates , getting in trouble for other co workers when its not ur fault"
good,"Loved working at JCP , retired after 10 years. Wanted to try something different. Have been supervisor  for ten years at JCP, over home department and children's department and over Fine Jewelry department."
good,"One of the most enjoyable and frustrating parts of this job can be the customers, at times its nice to meet and talk to the customers and then there are the ones that you have to keep your patience and stay calm no matter how they act."
good,"I love my job as a Jcpenney associate. Where I currently go to school I was unable to continue working due to no JCP being near me. I worked inside Jcpenney for two years and then moved to the Sephora inside Jcpenney. I love all my managers. In both places it is  fast paced and busy. It always gives you something to do. The discount is wonderful. I was involved in a lot during high school and they were really good about working around my sports/clubs/events. And if for some reason you couldn't get it off, many co-workers would take the shift for you. You can't really blame JCPenney for this, but my biggest complaint would be co-workers. Since I now work in the Sephora, I don't have to worry about it due to limited staff in there. A lot of the employees hired by the management are just there to get paid, but often forget you have to do your job for it to be worth anyone's time. I found myself, as an associate, picking up the slack of my fellow co workers, which often left me irritated. The only thing I would improve would be my co-workers, but that isn't all on the Jcpenney, but more on the disrespectful people."
good,"I work on the truck team so early mornings. That being said,  I'm out by 10 or 11am everyday I work. It's pretty laid back and you are able to make decisions on your own. Management could be better, but that is a struggle where ever you go. They work well with your availability and dealing with the public is sorta nice especially when you know everything about the store. It is a very easy job, but you do have to use your head whether you are a manager, cashier, merchandiser, or on the truck team. I love working here, but I think it is my time to look for a new one so I can grow."
good,"okay place to work but not for my career. typical day was not busy at all. coworkers are not usually welcoming as they all have their ""groups"" and are mostly unprofessional and mixy."
good,A great place to work. The managers are so nice but the job advancement and potential for making more money in increments of 6 months at a time are not there. I need more money.
good,The environment is very easygoing but also fast pasted. 
good,"So long ago that I worked there, I really don't remember.  Staff was always fun, friendly and relaxed.  Lots of opportunity for continual training.  Good job"
good,"Back when I worked at JC Penney it was a fun, creative place to work.  I do know things have dramatically changed within JC Penney so I'm not sure what the work environment is any longer."
good,"Working for JcPenney started my working career, this was my first job and it really helped get my foot in the door for my career path. The customer service aspect will help me in the long run with my career"
good,"Overall enjoy Photography, customer service, a fun rewarding job."
good,"Cashier in the women’s shoes department, responsible for operating and maintaining the cash register and sales counter, receiving new inventory, counting stock, organizing different products, displaying product on the sales floor and recovering the entire store daily."
good,"All the employee's were more active with each other, helping when it came to difficult tasks. Hardest part was Holiday time, the store is flooded as well as the dressing rooms would be insanely messy. Enjoyable part was the holiday season as well, everyone would bring in food for us to have a lunch/dinner as a team."
good,Operated the cash register and inventory machinery.
good,"flexible schedule, easy job,  stressful because you have to pickup co workers slack, management was very uncomfortable to work with, i learned how to work with a diverse."
good,"This company is great, however when I was working there, I noticed some workers only work when a manager or someone of a higher level was present, being a cashier I had to help people at all times and during closing would have more work to do during the two hours because those that were not working did not finish their tasks."
good,"It wasn't so bad, but as a first job it was definitely an experience. The days could be really slow or really fast depending on the time frame. Depending on demographics, you will deifinitely be surrounding by a lot of younger people. Some of the managers are cool, while others are rude and brute, Not to mention the favoritism toward certain employees."
good,its a job but after a while it gets stressful and tiring. There's no room to grow at the company. A typical day is getting a scanner you wear on your wrist and fill orders that come in on the scanner. Breaks are short. The only good part about the job is the pay the faster you are the higher you get paid.
good,"The way management treated certain employees was not right. Other then that the company is great. Flexible hours , easy shift work, friendly staff, fun."
good,Retail was really cool to work in i loved being able to work with other people and being able to collaborate my ideas although it was difficult for them to work with my school schedule.
good,"Working at JCPenney Optical is a really great way to earn experience in the optical field and office management. Learning great customer service skills from one the best managers of customer service in Stockton. Unfortunately there's nowhere to grow. In a business run by USvision, everything seems to be limited. Limited amount of hours and no benefits to come along make it very difficult to make this a career choice. Only the Managers get all the hours and benefits and it's difficult to advance because the company is not growing."
good,This was not a career type job.  Just until I could find something better.  The coworkers were nice and management was good to work for.  Nice place to work.
good,This company has been very good to me over the years.  I started working here when also working at a factory and I've never had any scheduling issues.
good,I was really disappointed in the 10 min window for taking children's photos. That' s not enough time to photograph a 2 year old and I feel like your cheating the parents out of what could be awesome pictures once the child warns up to you which usually takes longer than 10 minutes.
good,This was a job that wasn't secure but did offer more benefits then many other jobs. Jobs came and went due to the shut down of many Warehouses. So job security was never set in stone
good,"the job was alright but management sucked. The ladies were mean and were constantly rude to me. Besides that it wasnt so bad, i guess. their is also no commission."
good,JCPenney's was my first job . I loved it there and got to work in many different departments. Had great work environment and employees and management. Overall Great place to work just need more compensation.
good,The store was always busy and always needed to be cleaned. Each manager had their center spots that they wanted to focus on more so one side of the store will be cleaned while the other side would suffer.
good,Everyday you have to meet goals  by getting credit card applications and getting a certain amount of money. I learned even more about customer service and what it takes to put a smile on their faces. I love working there because we work as a team. The hardest part of the job is getting credit card applications when the store is not busy.
good,The manager was never around especially for personal questions. I had to teach myself how to clock in and out and i was yelled at for not knowing how much time i was supposed to take on my lunch or break. They never gave me a name tag and she didn’t even make me a register number so cash people out. I was finally going to learn and she yelled at another employee for trying to teach me and another new employee
good,"I love this job compared to all my others at fast food places, but I can’t go full time and I need to support myself now that I’m out of high school and planning to move out, and this job isn’t enough."
good,"Load and unload trucks, or help others with loading and unloading, operating any special loading-related equipment on vehicles and using other equipment as necessary."
good,"Supervisors were amazing that I worked with, but store manager was horrible.  Pay was minimum wage, which I think should have been a little more considering the reputation of JC Penney.  Even when I worked at JC Penney, there was threat of our store closing, and it finally did this past year."
good,"Nice place to work if is just temporary or seasonal, but not good for long term or make career.I liked to be in touch with the people and help them in what I could and see the smile in their face was an incentive for the rest of my day."
good,Working at JCPenney's is not easy work it's grinding fast paced.It has a lot of heavy lifting and it's very fast paced.This job is not for everyone.I worked in shipping and receiving in  the warehouse. I have some knowledge of equipment handling.
good,Shifts went smoothly. Days were rarely slow. The sales floor was usually full of customers seeking assistance for on floor and catalog sale items.  Each department sales group worked in unison to provide excellent customer service.
good,The hardest part of my job was having to interact with many different personalities from both customers and coworkers. This made it difficult to communicate at times. Another hard part of the job is the pressure the companies to meet corporate standards and goals while having a scarce amount of associates in the store.
good,"I am a single lady who needs full time employment, which the portrait studio at Penny's does not offer. It is fun to work with the families and help them get quality pictures of their family and children."
good,I worked for 7 years. I worked in three separate departments   I enjoyed al.l. My job at bra department was fun. My job in houseware was very good. My job in towels and sheets as lamps. All very rewarding
good,"El ambiente de trabajo varía dependiendo del departamento y de tu supervisor inmediato."
good,Each day was very very busy. I learned how to work a cash register and JCP taught me a lot of patience. The majority of the managers were great and they worked with you.
good,"Very calm environment, management is easy going. Hours are flexible with little benefits, other than discounts, there's not much to benefits. Alright pay, with credit commission."
good,Jcpenney offers great discounts and you can use the discount at sephora. Closing shifts were horrible because sometimes we would have to stay 2 hours or more after closing.
good,"Employees were nice, had nice supervisors when I worked there. Computer systems could use some work. Other than that, I really enjoyed working there and helping people. Also, the discounts were nice."
good,"I enjoyed helping my customers.  When I first hired in we  were on hourly plus commission, then cut to just hourly.  When I became store supervisor I was given a lot of responsibility but not much pay raise."
good,I have nothing to write. This thing is forcing me to fill this out................................... I just have to say this job was not for me......
good,only worked seasonal but liked it. good hours friendly people. cool working environment work place provides food every so often positive employees and supervisors
good,I got to meet a lot of different people. It was not a hard job but the pay could be a little better. i worked there twice only during the holiday season.
good,JCPenney was a great place to work at. the only thing was that there wasn't job security once you became an employee. That was the only thing that I didn't like. Other than that the work environment was great !
good,"always on the go. a lot of work to do. many departments to help out on, have to leave everything clean by the end of the night. deal with various amount of customers"
good,"There is no room to grow but the job is easy."
good,"I like that after my office sitting all day job, I get to walk around do projects around the store to showcase it for every season event. I enjoy having diversity in the coworkers"
good,"it was a place where you can learn thing and deal with customers, the job was a place where we all got along and enjoyed the work place and had breaks threw out the day"
good,Enjoyable workplace. Managers were dedicated to making the store a fun work environment. Great employee discount. Looked forward to my shift each day and enjoyed my coworkers.
good,"When I was an employee, there was more of the teams on commission. Therefore, our customer service was always a focus. We worked hard but had a lot of fun doing it!"
good,"A typical day is pretty busy. Like most jobs there is always somethnig to do. I have learned the process of working in retail. I have always worked in customer service but always for the food industry. Management is okay. I think that there are definitely favorites in each stores so those people get away with things( not helping with returning the closes from the fitting room to the rack, or standing near the register pretending to work). the hardest part of the job is advancing with the company. The tasks I do on a day to day basis are pretty bacis and not hard but for people like myself who want to advance I believe there is a small window of opportunity."
good,"Employees are paid poorly and the customer service is not good.  To many cuts to management positions and very little growth opportunity.  JCPenney is failing and closing stores, get out now before they close your store."
good,Was hired for seasonal. Mangers were very demanding of employee's and would be mean to them. I did not think any of them deserved to be in charge of anyone.
good,Good Environment and friendly people but not very focused around work. leadership roles and job raises are not easily acessable. very relaxed but a strict dresscode is not very enforced
good,"Worked for the company a total of 5 years. Most of the time I enjoyed the job. The bad is no full time & have a flexible schedule. Work days & off days will always change. To move up, depends on how well you perform and previous job experiences. Rarely had a problem with managers. Each location could have good managers or bad managers. Typical day depends on what department you work in. Most fun was all the great people I met."
good,"It was a good work place till the changes were made,  Everyday of keeping customers happy and greeting them with a smile.  Learned how to zone and rebuild walls for the season change.  The management was okay not much of a people person.  A environment that you could relax in.  Holiday rush was kept you on your feet.  The music."
good,I work in JCPenny salon for three years. It was my first salon job so   i was fresh out of school so i was nervous. i worked on weekends and was very busy the only style i didn't really do  was weaving. I worked my way up to a senior stylist and was very proud of my self because i came a long way.
good,"It was definitely a fun place to work.  I cant say enough positive things about my co-workers.  They definitely have room to grow the store, they should, I think it would bring in a lot more business.  I cant say I would ever work a season there again just because I would like a secure job but i am happy of the experience."
good,I learned a lot about the industry. Working here and would be more than happy to return. Management was very good about keeping the employees informed about current happenings in and with the company
good,This was not customer service.  Worked on floor displays and placement of products.  Very much enjoyed co-workers.  I found nothing hard about this position.  I enjoyed being a part of the visual part of this department store.
good,The people I work with are great and helpful. The help line is also an incredible feature that got me through many problems with ease. The work can be demanding at times but helping a customer solve a problem they encountered always made my day as well.
good,"This was a college job, my goal was to sell people clothing. When people were ready to check out my objective was to convince them to get a credit card for JC Penney. I learned customer conflict resolution skills, how to work in a team environment and how to influence to  people to make decisions based on good logic. I really just liked helping people get what they wanted, that the best part about working at JC Penney."
good,"A typical day entails me getting the salon ready; from turning on the lights, walking the salon, making coffee to checking the messages. I learned a lot."
good,"A typical day at work consists of visual preparation,which is fixing and folding products to make them look presentable, also helping customers when I am needed. During my time at JCPenney learned basic customer service skills, P.O.S programming for the register, and the common folds of clothing. The management in JCPenney were very helpful, patient, and also very productive. My co workers tend to fraternize on the job often, but still carried out their work duties. The hardest part of the job was that the managers tend to move employees from section to section even if we had little knowledge of the area. The most enjoyable part of the job to me was helping the different varieties of customers."
good,"I worked in the children's department and I loved being able to interact with the customers, was given proper breaks and lunches. Being in the children's department it was a little slow, I would have preferred somewhere with a faster pace, but overall I enjoyed working here."
good,JcPenney allowed me to enhance my social skills by talking to customers on a daily basis. I enjoyed having the ability to help people everyday by locating merchandise and making their day a little bit easier. My fellow co-workers and managers made JcPenney feel like a second home.
good,"Typical days consist of customer service"
good,I didn't like the atmosphere of the job. Co-workers stayed talking about somebody regardless if it was bad or good. I try to stay out the way.
good,"Is a great place to work.   We have a great team to work with.  I enjoy the variety of duties to include:  working with customers (showing/suggesting merchandise,processing online orders, taking monthly credit card payments), stocking merchandise, assist with setting up new displays or moving merchandise.  I enjoy the interaction with our customers."
good,"Okay place to work, but as with most retail they cut hours and keep hourly pay low on their associates for company profits. Management at the Springfield store was very good and I personally liked my supervisor but they often were put into tough spots for touting the company line and doing what is best for their workers."
good,J.C. Penny is a great company with good people.  I am looking for full time work and they have nothing at this time.  It would be a great company for anyone to work at.
good,typical day there for me would be unloading big trailers also got moved around to differnt areas.i learnd about shipping and receiving as well as picking product.managment changed time to time it was ok.co-workers most of them slacked on work.hardest part was well nothing really.i enjoyed the 30 mins of break with the two 15mins of break time.
good,"The people that work here are incredibly passionate about what they do, and their demeanor was contagious. This was a great place to learn about the snack food industry and I enjoyed my time here."
good,"Working here at this J.C. Penney, is a great experience, even though there are a couple of people that don't quiet do there job."
good,learn more about the products while working there. able to assist the customers. co-workers were ok to work with. the hardest part of the job is stocking and dealing with customers who tend to be irate sometime
good,"was an okay place , first job . didnt know what to expect . but it could have gotten better , not really a career field . atleast not for me , peopel were friendly , co workers and stuff ."
good,"Started the day with a check with on floor stock. Filled any spots in general store, that needed to be restocked. I learned to keep store, restrooms and hair salon clean and in order. The management kept  changing on a monthly basis. There were no hard parts of this job."
good,"On a typical day, I would stock, cashier and provide customer service. I learned how to suggestive sell more often. For me the managers were a little unprofessional. My coworkers were a lot of fun and believed in team work. The hardest part was getting off late. The things I enjoyed the most were the employee discounts."
good,This was a seasonal job with so discounts on my items.The hours changed from day to day.
good,"I do like working at this JCP because of the environment. We have a great Management very open and accessible. Everybody for the most part work great together help each other. The hardest part of my job, because of the economy, the sales are way down the last few years. The most enjoyable part of my job is the interaction with Customers."
good,"I liked working at this retail job, the whole store was micro-managed and there was no need. But I loved working with the customers and with clothe."
good,"The job itself isn't hard, and the people you work with are nice, and you can connect with most of them fairly easy, However the promise that most of the upper management make to keep you around almost always fall through."
good,"Work here is very up-beat, there were many customers to greet and to offer my assistance. When it did get slow there was still a lot of work available to do, like fixing up the store and cleaning out the fitting rooms. I learned how to keep myself busy with this work environment so that I could keep my work space safe and clean while being able to help customers find what they need and cashing them out when they were ready. Co-workers were also pleasant and easy to get along with, whenever there was a line of customers I could call them for assistance and an available worker would come. The hardest part of the job was being able to find things in the back room. The most enjoyable part of the job was to feel accomplished with how much I got done and being able to help the customers purchase what they had wanted."
good,"My day to day job consisted of me being on the phones, placing orders, assisting customers with online issues and troubles pertaining to online and in store purchases."
good,"JCPenney was in fact the most professional company out of three of my reviews. Management at JCP was understanding and for the most part helpful. One strange configuration of the management team was that the Human Resources position was given to an actual manager within the company. This may have limited others from trusting HR with personal and interpersonal relationships within the store. The pay was not enough to live on, especially being kept at part time across the board. The employees in the children's, shoes, men's, and fine jewelry departments were all very great at their jobs and providing customer satisfaction. I CANNOT say the same for the women's department. Employees, mainly female from the women's department often clashed with one another, took extra long breaks, and lacked a professional demeanor. I would and have recommended this job to others."
good,"I find that they do much and changing,"
good,"This call center is very beautiful on the inside so you don't feel like you are just sitting at an office desk all day.  The center is nicely laid out and decorated festive for all of the major holidays.  The management is exceptionally friendly and willing to work with you around your other things you have scheduled. The hours are pretty flexible with the opportunities to gain bonuses such as prizes and cash vouchers to use on clothing and other merchandise.  Holiday pay is available as well as Over time compensation. The worst thing that can happen to you is that you get yelled at by an unhappy client, which hint hint, that's going to happen in virtually EVERY call center job,  The best thing that can happen is that you can get promoted to team leader and help assist in training the new employees."
good,"A typical day is to come into work and try to complete the daily task at hand."
good,"Advancement is not possible without relocation.  The company does like to promote from within and they do offer a management trainee program, however, to become a store manager or district manager relocation to another state is usually required."
good,"a typical work days is about 6 hours long, assisting customers, keeping work area organized, sized and clean."
good,"Management was like High-School Cliques, the work was ok, most customers were polite, and the coworkers were pretty friendly. Definitely one of the better ways to work in retail."
good,"A typical day is fast paced with regimented tasks "
good,"A typical day for me consisted of assessing customers online orders."
good,"Always something to do, kept busy even if not doing your regular hire job. Diversity in customers and cultures to converse with daily."
good,"A typical day at work is to preform all duties required of me and learn the new procedures like customer profiling, repairing of stretch watches, and rearrange show cases. I train new associates our procedures in the Fine Jewelry Dept."
good,"help costumers find a perfect dress or coat"
good,"*Primary interface with costumers and clients representatives from other company"
good,"Lack of communication between management, poor work ethic of most part-time/seasonal associates. Low pay, even for middle management. They do work around your schedule very well, so good part time job. I'm making more than most because I was a commissioned associate."
good,"this job i work seasonal doing what i love, which was getting my moring workout stocking and breaking down large boxes. the people at this job was very hilarious.the hardest part i would have to say with this job was when everyone wasnt working as a team in order to get the truck done on time. an enjoyable moment i had was when the manager took the freight team out for breakfast."
good,I loved the atmosphere. I loved getting to help customers. The managers were great.
good,"Co-workers/managers were great.  Very few, however, had enough experience to really get the place going.  "
good,"The that company is good to work for but the management isn't that great. Hard to get breaks, some of the employees that work there do not work they walk around doing nothing. The management know who works and they do nothing. Management will provide lunch or dinner sometimes."
good,"Overall it was fun, needed more hours and clients. It was cooperate so it could have been less strict but it was understandable as to why it was the way it was.  Very slow not many customers knew that it even existed."
good,"I had some great co workers who became my friends."
good,"A typical day at work would require me to check fitting rooms, hang and put away go backs, clean up clearance racks, set the floor with the manager, sometimes cover a managers shift while they take their lunch, take care of customers and make sure their needs are satisfied, greet them at the door and thank them for shopping with us and wish them a better day. The most enjoyable part of my day is seeing the smile on the customers face after I know that I did all that I could to help them and I feel accomplished. I also feel good when I can connect with the customer on a deeper level and make them feel as if I am their friend."
good,"Job title was Sales Support. Therefore, I was the one assisting customers, pricing, and making sure the merchandise was in a neat appearance for the customers. I learned how to interact with customers on a daily basis. To me management was the downfall of the company. I felt like there were way too many managers per shift and it was just confusing. "
good,"No, this was not my first job.  This was a job that I had to take because I had been laid off from all my jobs that were career potential.  I learned that I had to humble myself due to the economic downturn and accept that this was a job I needed to do at the time.  Immediate management was great.  I got along with the management staff with no problems.  Same with my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was coming to terms with the fact that I was working under my educational background and that I was underemployed.  The most enjoyable part of the job was that I like people and I found it very easy to work with the staff and the customers."
good,notable customer value and sales support. Great work experience
good,I learned how to provide great customer service and to put the customer first.
good,"JCPenney was a nice job to have. The hours were reasonable, the work space was clean and safe and the other team members were friendly"
good,"JCPenney is a great place of employment for a college student, like myself, who only needs a part time job to be flexible with class schedules. A typical day at work involves running the cash-wrap, organizing your department (folding clothes), talking with customers and assisting them with specific needs (online orders, sizing, etc.). Working for JCPenney, and retail in general, has taught me that everyone should have to experience working with the public in this way (it is certainly eye-opening). Management within the store in which I was employed was casual and very friendly, which made working relationships more enjoyable. Co-workers were probably the best part about working at JCPenney. We all have become friends, and working at JCPenney feels more like family at times than work."
good,"Okay job just need more advancement,not very busy outside of holiday"
good,"Fun, busy and very interactive environment which was gratifying knowing that you were able to help someone, increase my customer service skills in a retail environment, great co workers that were willing to assist , somewhat long hours but they mostly would be accomodating"
good,A typical day begins with reviewing and answering correspondence from overseas buying offices. Attending team and cross divisional meetings. Check on status of current project and work on the research and development of new projects. End my day with making sure that all emails for that day have been answered and prep for the next day and reviewing the calendar.
good,"A typical day at work would be cleaning, putting away clothes, folding tables and cashiering. The management was good and employees were nice to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers."
good,"On a typical day at work before the store opens I make sure that all shoe displays are in the proper location and all displays are out. When store is open I acknowledge every customer, giving the best customer service that I can give to them. Every day I learn something new. Helping people with their wants and needs is something new everyday and making sure they leave happy. The management team at JCP is awesome!!! I love how they treat their associates and of course their customers. They are such an incredible team. They work together to make sure everything is going the way it should and go out and beyond. My Co-workers are a good team. I work in the shoe department and we always help each other out. We communicate all the time to make sure everything is always caught up and where things should be. I don't have a hard part in my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is first, customers. It is always fun to work with customers and 2nd my co workers and the management."
good,I was a seasonal employee here i enjoyed it while it lasted but did not like the having to stay almost an hour after closing or sometimes until 1 in the morning. If you have kids this is not going to be for you especially during holiday seasons.
good,"A typical day at work is Engaging with costumers ask what they are looking for, for what occasion once they are ready to check out i assist them with their payment method. After a customer is done and other co-workers are not assisting customers we all get together and discuss who is responsible for certain closing procedures and we discuss who is in charges of what areas when we are free of customers to go and clean"
good,A typical day at work started at 3 p.m. and ended at 12 a.m.
good,"A typical day working a JCP is a day where, I grab a handheld scanner, pull up an item pick list, and grab the items off of the pick list from the stock room and place them in associated locations, while greeting customers, and performing custormer service."
good,This company is great for personal advancement in your career goals.
good,"Good people and management, fast pace retail environment especially during the holidays. Long hours, a lot of physical work , lifting, organzing, moving etc... good for part-time employment if needed."
good,"The most enjoyable part of working at JCPenney is talking with customers; there are a lot of different and interesting people in this world. Everyone of my coworkers surprisingly get along. The managers are nice and friendly; joke around a lot. A typical day at work would be interacting with customers, folding, hanging, register duty, and try to meet credit apps, and catalog referrals quota."
good,"A typical day at work was fast paced and customer engaging. Management was fun and fair. Co-workers were fun, there wasn't a hardest part of the job. The hours were fair."
good,"I like that JCpenney had a structure. What I didn't like was that management told me that I could have a specific day off, but when I took the day off, he claims he never said I could...."
good,complete schedules
good,"Management is mostly great people, but the hours you work barely get you through to your next pay check. Great for a second job or for high school/college age kids."
good,"This job consists of very low hours depending on the location, it’s more like a second job than a first. Not stable enough to live off of, there can be weeks with no scheduled work days for you :("
good,"Not a hard job at all, gets you by for the pay, would be a good part time job if you’re still in school. Friendly coworkers and fun managers overall it’s a good job."
good,Great work environment with understanding management. Has a relatively flexible schedule depending on circumstances. Has issues with understaffing from time to time but great place to work on customer service skills.
good,Fun work environment. Very busy. Management was good about support. Training could have been better. They value diversity and inclusion. The customers are generally upscale.
good,"At this particular JCPenney, there was definitely a sense of favoritism. Managers would be upset when things are completed at the speed they wanted it to, they expect you just to fold and throw it there, even if it doesn't belong. Overall, a decent place to work, but I wouldn't spend more than a year there."
good,JCPENNEY is great for the customer and you if you believe in customer is always right. But there needs to be more flexibility in work hours and job duties. There aren’t enough consequences when you are not performing to company standards.
good,"I worked in the fitting rooms as my first job. There were some great people to work with, a lot of mellow and level-headed people that helped out. The only downside is that it was a requirement to work on Thanksgiving, the building felt very closed off from the world and management. The assistant managers are great, but the higher in management people were the less connected they seemed to employees. However, they also had a lot of work and tried their best to help employees and customers. The hardest part of the job was that it always changed: some days would be fast and really busy, other days would be super slow. During the holidays you would work close to full time but come February and people would get their hours cut down to two days a week. Also, a lot of people would leave the job, and a lot would get hired, so you often couldn't rely on being close to your coworkers."
good,"Very good job, i learned how to stay on task and manage everything in my department smoothly. I enjoyed talking to many customers and seeing smiles on their faces."
good,It is a great job if you have kids in sports or extracurricular activities because you can kind of work around their schedule to make it fit. The part that's hard is there's really no option for full-time work. I love my job at JCPenney's just wish that I could get full-time employment through them
good,"Great place to begin working, everyone super friendly and offers flexible hours. Management tends to play favorites and that's the only way to actually get hours there."
good,Was frustrating at times when I wasn’t properly trained and they tried to make me work in those fields. I enjoy the work at times. It was like doing laundry for wor.
good,"Working for JCP was the most fulfilling time in my life.  Lots of challenges, learned a lot.  "
good,"Typically, the day started with finding where the need was the greatest. The hardest part of the job is it can get hectic especially during the holidays.  The most enjoyable part was the great coworkers.  They made the days a lot happier!"
good,"I have been working evenings and weekends at JCPENNY'S for almost 10 years. Starting as a seasonal cashier to now working in Home Specialty where I sell Custom Windows, Shutters and also Mattresses. My hourly base is 13.25 plus commission which makes up for the base rate and part time hours worked."
good,"I liked working here until the end. I was fired for supposedly ""stealing"" rewards points from customers which I never did but they didn't want to listen to reason. I get the feeling that they needed to put the blame on someone and since I was being set up, they didn't feel the need to investigate. I was about to quit to go to university so it was fine but even now, over a year later, I am still hurt by how they treated me."
good,"This place was amazing to work at. It was professional, organized, and almost laid back. No errors were barely ever made. The coworkers were very helpful. Easy to learn."
good,working in fast base environment helps your day to go by quick and make it fun in the same time. productivity is always the role key throughout the company.
good,learned multiple tasks and different departments. got to know frequent customers. handle money daily. the supervisors and managers were great to work with.
good,"Working with the JCPenney team was pleasant. I had good managers and coworkers. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the customers, especially during major sales. However, I really enjoyed working with my managers and coworkers and enjoyed tidying up the displays."
good,"Management easy to work with, good discount, easy work, employees can try to throw you under bus. Flexible schedule. Lower pay if on sales.floor. customers great."
good,"I've worked at jcp for 2 years now. Honestly the pay sucks, but the work is easy and they're flexible with hours. I am a full time college student so i only work on weekends. Not going to lie, after awhile it gets very repetitive and I start to dread to come to work but compared to other jobs its pretty easy work. You make an extra $2 per credit app you sell which is cool. Some managers are chill and cool but others are mean and strict."
good,"It was an okay place to work. They supply training and are willing to work with you on your availability. I don’t think I would want to work there long term, but it was a good learning experience for a seasonal position."
good,"Management was kind, but you never knew when you were going to work.  You had to stand the whole time and look busy even though there was nothing to do.  The pay is bad and there are no benefits."
good,Talking specifically on my experiences working at JCPenney has been great for the most part. I love the work that I do. Have a good work crew. I've learned to manage almost every department in the store. I do have to say the management used to be better. Not as experienced or productive in running the store as a whole. The communication needs to improve. The on floor associates do most of the work. Most enjoyable part of my job is when I come in I actually enjoy what I do and make people happy in doing so. I also have my work family who can always make me smile and understand what's going on around the store. We do have a nice break room for the employees but we definetly need some updates on equipment and renovations to improve the look of the store to make our customers happy and comfortable when purchasing items from us.
good,"Lots of opportunities to gain hands on experience within your position, about the commercial retail industry on a grand scale. But it is very difficult to advance within your position--management is great at moving people around if they desire to learn a new positions--so they don't have to pay additional employees.  They are great company for freelance designers. This company is in major debt so people are spread very thin and work loads are very intense with no flexibility to work from home. So any projects worked on outside the office you are not compensated for. No funding for company sponsored events or outings. People in the work-place a generally stressed and underpaid. Oh and no half day Fridays or leaving work early expect if you plan to use that towards your PTO hrs."
good,"I work for school tuition evening shift"
good,I like working there getting visits dicounts paid good was fun had good coworkers  the job was great like the old people that come in ask a million wyestions
good,"There was alot of theft between employees, and when I was stolen from, they did not prosecute or punish the employee that did it. Instead when I threatened with filing a report they gave me an option to quit or be fired and said that I wasn't doing good at my job. So, I quit."
good,"It was pretty slow, only busy during Christmas, black  Friday, summer was ok, co-workers were nice, not enough hours, they didn’t really care about your outside life, didn’t take doctors notes, they just wanted you there"
good,"that's really all that was good about the job, you didn't really get anything else. The store that I worked at in didn't really was mostly Hispanics and while i don't think they were racist it seemed those were the only people top be promoted to do anything else."
good,"Great company to work for but  they did not survive the cut. great with breaks and early starting times , overtime was optional in many cases , the compensation were good , management was fair and they informed you of all the daily work details"
good,"Friendly salon staff"
good,The workplace has been fast paced. The workplace has great atmosphere when it comes to major sales and season changes. The workplace is a great place when it comes to culture in general.
good,"Started right after college and learned a lot about supply chain and logistics.The management team is great, but the future of the company is uncertain."
good,"Handled more than $5,000 weekly with accuracy. Worked in the shoe department and I learned how to do the stock by, color size and style. Worked on the floor plan for men, women and children."
good,"They where really friendly employees to work with. Very caring and made sure that our customers where always satisfied with every visit. Mangers was very polite as well,"
good,"This was my first ever job and it looked quite promising from the start. As time moved by it wasn't as pretty as it promised. My salary for the work I was doing didn't add up, I wasn't paid commissions as I was told I would, and my hours violated every major event I stated I had before I applied there. Nonetheless several of my friends worked here with me and offered to take over so I could handle bigger matters in my private life."
good,I don't have much to say about this company.   I loved the people that I worked with.  The store I worked for was closed after I left the store for another job.
good,"im working as a seasonal employee for Christmas help, I have never met such a helpful management team in all my years of working,  tThey are energetic and acknowledge each and every employee, They truly boost the moral of employees at this store"
good,I would not be able to provide a review about this job due to the fact that my opinion would be very one sided and bias . However things could be worse or better depending on how you see it.
good,only really worked there before school had started but while i was working it was pretty fun. i was put in charge of a new program they were trying out when i was still brand new
good,"A typical day at work would be tiding work areas, assisting costumers, and occasionally moving around to bring items to their correct stations. Working at JC Penny helped me further develop my communication and social skills. Management was okay, it wasn't the best it could've been."
good,"Retail is a very challenging field, but I did appreciate the freedom my supervisors gave me to manage my department. The schedule is not set, and benefits are only for full time employees, so benefits are never guaranteed."
good,Over all pretty good place to work. I have learned a lot and love going in to work with the people that I work with. Definitely would stay working with this company for awhile.
good,Good place to work always something to do great spiffs in the department I worked in coworkers were great to work with the discount was nice supervisors were great
good,JcPenny wasn’t a bad Job. It was my first and I actually enjoyed it at first. I enjoyed that I made 10 an hour but I soon realized I was one of the few that was making 10 and hour. Other people was making 9..8 even. I heard lots of stories that the Manager wasnt giving people who has been working there for years a raise to get them to purposely quit to make room for new people to eventually have enough people to cut hours. I also heard the manager wanted some people to quit their jobs. I also have personal issues with the management. But overall JcPenny was a great job.
good,"Worked in the Home department. It was a 5 day a week with different shifts throughout the week. Typical day was helping customers, stocking shelves, keeping the store neat and tidy. The culture was a bit stressful because the management team had targets to hit each day so they drove that into each employee daily. There wasn't really anything to difficult about the job except maybe in the beginning when learning the register. Best part of the job was making new friends."
good,The workplace is good there's a lot of good employees but like every job there's some that you should just stay away from. The job is flexible sometimes when it comes to time off and sometimes it's not which can be a pain when needing those days.
good,"Good company to work for. Flexible hours, knowledgeable management. Over the years the store has changed. Not enough workers, poor customer service, junkie store. New manager whom is unfriendly to the workers and customers. He walks around as if he's an angry with everyone."
good,"It is a fast paced environment and their are daily goal that have to be accomplished such as opening credit card accounts and sells. It was fustrating when there were not enough cashiers on the sales floor and there were a lot of people waiting in line. Overall, I obtained good working experience. Most co-worker were friendly."
good,"Easy part time job if you need extra money. slow most days but come season it picks up, pay is decent for position, good job also for those coming out of highschool needing some experience on their resume."
good,"The people who work thier all suck nice people. The work environment is alittle slow, but the managers are for the most part relaxed. Problems were non existent n I enjoyed working thier"
good,It was a good and fun company to work for everyone worked as a team I really enjoyed helping customers every day I came in and if I didn't work I missed coming in.
good,"there wasn’t much that set them out from other company’s. they didn’t do anything super special for the employees, pretty much just work and then leave."
good,The company offered decent wages and opportunities to advance to another position along with fairly good pay raises.Jcpennys also offered very good benefits and vacation pay
good,Every one that worked there was extremely friendly and willing to help any one out regardless of how busy they may have been. It was nice being able to go to work and see the other employees smiling everyday.
good,"The job was fun and could be stressful at times, but then retails is known for such.  I loved working there and enjoyed working with my co-workers.  I would do it again."
good,"This position was a teaching, competitive and educational position.  I learned so much about windows and window covering.  The most difficult part of the jobs was working trying to find the items in the stock room.  I believe things have changed now, inventory is more organized.  I enjoyed working with my team.  The day consist of competing for customers.  Kinda fun.  This was a commission position which was a little stressful."
good,"My job was in the back unloading the stock and putting it to the floor. It was nice and easy going, but very time limited. I enjoyed myself on occasion but managers would be testy if we weren't fast enough."
good,"This job is good for teens looking to start off. Mostly flexible with outside schedule. Great coworkers. I loved working here when I first got the job. There was great management and they worked well around my schedule, however there is now new management and my schedule is ignored."
good,I was trained in different departments so I wasn't bored. I really enjoyed the Holidays because of the pace the days went so fast. A lot of people we'er stuck in onedepartment and they hated their job. If you did something they didn't like then your hours would be cut.
good,"My time at JC Penney, Flagstaff was enjoyable. I helped with ensuring the store was straightened and ready to serve our customers. I worked mainly in the jewelry department and I was able to engage with customers to serve their jewelry needs. I helped other departments when they were shorthanded. I loved to interact with customers and assist with providing excellent customer service.  I enjoyed meeting and working with my fellow associates and working towards meeting ourcompany goals. The hardest part was trying to provide great customer service during the holiday season. Giving personal care was difficult but doable. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to assist in finding the perfect piece of jewelry for my customers."
good,"Most people who work here are amazing. It's more of a family in a way. Depending on what your job title is will depend on your activities through a shift. However, when you start taking some time off or have a medical issue pop up, they start cutting your hours drastically. I love my job so much, but when hours seem t be taken away due to medical issues doesn't give security to myself."
good,"Jc penney has always been the store for working class americans.For that reason,it is a place where working is fun.Meeting new people every day from all over the world because of the location(herald square in manhattan)was such a pleasure and serving them was natural to me."
good,"this was my first job in high school, every time i visit it seems to be the same kind of employees. young people trying to make minimum wage, its an okay place to work but dont expect to start a life by working here"
good,"The hardest part was cleaning the entire store at 4 am and the store opens at 10am and it is destroyed at 10:15am. on top of that getting complaints from the people that put the clothes on the round or in the wrong department."
good,"Answered customer questions concerning location and price of merchandise. "
good,"Fast paced work environment in the catalog phone center. This phone center is no longer operating.  E-comerce training was very helpful for future assignments."
good,"A typical day would be to make sure all returned merchandise is off the counter and that the register area is clear. Make sure all fitting rooms are clear and no items are misplaced or on the floor. Try your best to get credit apps from the customer, and let them know they can save extra money if the customer uses a JCPenney credit card. I've learned that you can't please all customers. Management has done a number of tasks, like eliminate registers at the suits and shoe departments, which hurts customer service. It also makes it harder to find items for the customer, if they are looking of an item in a certain color or size. The workplace culture is very mixed, from college students to people in their nineties. The hardest part of the job can be  handling difficult customers. It also can be difficult having different managers ask you to do a number of tasks in a short period of time. There is also a lack of training in some areas that can make the job difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with very friendly co-workers. MOST of them are friendly."
good,"Worked here for over 10 years, have had no opportunity for job growth. Not happy. Work a lot of hours, and do a great deal with customer service. Our store was one of the most successful in the area, and I put a lot of hours in to make that happen. "
good,"I received orders on daily, merchandised was placed in bids.  Scheduled workers and supervised personnel and store. Open and closed store and vault.  Balanced jewelry and other registers."
good,"When working, pay attention to how the employees treat each other and customers. The customer service needs work and training on site is needed desperately."
good,"Job itself was satisfying but the management was unorganized."
good,a typical day a jcp was take a call answer the customers questions or complaint. Try and come up with a one contact resolution if you can if not try and help the customer or get them to the correct department
good,"Fast paced and almost always something to do, very friendly and helpful co-workers and managers. It was my first job and I would definitely recommend it to others my age. I learned how to work retail, ask for credit, and point of sale tools and how to properly work registers."
good,"I worked at the home store, so I was mostly in the bedding department.  I sorted and stocked merchandise.  I was a cashier, who handled monetary funds and placed online orders for the customers."
good,I worked at the Shared Services Center. It was a good place to start my post college career and provided me valuable experience. I will always be grateful for the opportunity.
good,"When I was at JCP there was much turmoil because of the economy.  There was also a turnover of CEOs and other difficulties in the company.  It is my understanding that all of those issues have subsided and that JCP is now back on track to grow again.  The last manager that I had was the best that I have ever had.  Unfortunately, she has since retired.  For the most part, though, management is good about recognizing progress and success."
good,Working there was very stressful fast paced and uncertain.  But overall I enjoyed interacting with the public meeting new people and helping customers find and purchase what they were looking for.  The only negative was the pressure of getting customers to open credit accounts.
good,It was a nice place to work just wasn't enough for me needed full-time position with more pay but overall a good place to be employed plus I received a 20% employee discount.
good,In the beginning of working there I was taught and shown a lot for me to improve and go higher up in the company but the last few year they had stopped teaching.
good,"The receptionist role at the Salon by InStyle at JCPenney was a pretty slow paced role. Helped stock inventory, maintained a welcoming environment for clients, work with the stylists and booked appointments. Overall it is a good role."
good,"good management , very laid back and family oriented. Schedules are very flexible. Not to bad as a part time job while your in school or as a first job."
good,This job is harder than people think.  It also offers a lot of rewards.  It allows you to build relationships with your customers.  I have made a lot of friends there and enjoy helping others.
good,"I like the people I work with and the company, but I cant afford to stay at this job. I can barely put food on the table. JCPennys has a good idea where retail is going, but should make sure their supervisors are taken care of financially."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of folding clothes, helping customers with merchandise and bringing said merchandise out to their car for them, checking available merchandise at other stores, helping on registers, and selling merchandise. JCPenney's helps their employees become more sociable as a person, and taught me the benefits of working as a team. The management was excellent, very friendly and professional. The most enjoyable part of the job, for me, was seeing the customers happy with their purchase, especially when I was the one helping them."
good,"Not a bad place to work, hard work just goes unnoticed and hardly any advancement within the company. Overall you get to meet a lot  different people."
good,"Working with the people is fun and friendly, but they cut hours all the time and really don't care if you need more money and hours to survive, even if you deserve it."
good,JC Penney provided a good oportunity for part time employees.  Commission positions received a benefit rate for vacation/sick time even for part time employees.
good,I enjoyed working there while I was there the people were nice you just don't get a lot of hours there and they don't pay that much but you do get a discount
good,"I am currently still employeed at JCPenney as a Designer Stylist. I am writing this review because I do not know what the future will hold but figured I’d share my input. I also started off as a receptionist before going to the salon floor. This company is incredibly cut - throat. People will fight to be number one, pocket tips and management especially LOVES to play favorites with employees - when you do management’s job you can do whatever you want here! Customers can be intense. Once you build a loyal clientele you will be fine. Fellow coworkers are mainly very supportive. Pay rate is awful for what you deal with on a daily basis. My advice to corporate - LISTEN TO YOUR EMPLOYEES! WITHOUT THEM YOU HAVE NOTHING! When you are not careful, management will take advantage of you. They think they can pretty much replace anyone. I warn anyone who comes here - as much as you will fall in love with your clients and coworkers, the rules here make no sense and management is all power play."
good,The environment is quick pace but that is expected in any retail job. My recent supervisor was very kind and understanding. Most of my co workers were nice and friendly.
good,I worked with them for a few years  I first was a nice place to work then I change management went downhill for me but made some friend and before my mom passedway she even worked for them
good,"Being a sales associate at JC Penny I was responsible for carrying out exceptional customer service to the many customers I came in contact with. This included greeting customers with a warm and genuine smile, helping guests find specific merchandise in the store as well as order items off of the store website for the guests convenience. Aside from working the sales floor, I also was responsible for ringing up customers in a professional and timely manor."
good,"The store and the salon are under different management with separate goals, objectives and work flow than the salon.  JCP has great coupons along with your employee discount on already sale prices means some really amazing deals!  Pay is extremely low for associates.  Not enough advertising for salon."
good,"its all around great job when its the only job your working at otherwise youll be double scheduled . its fun and easy , you can take breaks whenever you want as long as someone else is on shift with you ."
good,"I Absolutely loved my role at JcPenneys. It wa space paced, fun and super active. The people were amazing. Closing could be long but it was still fun. If I had the chance to go back I would."
good,A traditional company with a long history serving the customer. 
good,JcPenney is a very busy place to work during the holiday season. I learned to service the public with a smile because you never know who needs it. I love the people who work there because they are very friendly and most of the time will become your life long friend.
good,"Opening of tills, maintaining department, customer service. Very friendly and opening environment. Customers made the job both enjoyable and the hardest part of the job."
good,"This company taught me a lot as a young man, first of about how the money is just not there in the company anymore. The leadership was great but the hours were not. I liked it for a first job."
good,JC Penney was an amazing job! It was full of laughter and i always got along with management. It was the first job i ever had and i really enjoyed it. I stayed there for 4 years because i enjoyed working there. The work environment is relaxed yet structured so you always have something to do to make the time go by fast.
good,"highly automated, fast pace environment that required quick troubleshooting and situations were required to be resolved quickly and root cause determined."
good,"Very relaxed environment. Has its moments when it gets busy but other than that you find tasks to do. Met and understood different customers needs and how to multitask well. Co-workers were very friendly, helpful when needed. The employees were overall nice."
good,Very fast paced job. Expected to do reports and get them in on time even though they cut hours. Employees were stressed out and mgmnt. was not very helpful.
good,"A friendly environment and an excellent team work, the position placement depends on the manager in charge. Flexible hours depends on the position. Overall satisfactory working environment."
good,A very nice friendly place to work can be very relaxed but also at times very fast paced. they are very flexible with schedules but very inconsistent with hours
good,"Working in retail is pretty similar wherever you go. Each day we unlock the register and fold clothes. When we have customers we can check them out, handle their returns and exchanges, scan coupons and anything else asked."
good,"Management in the Beaumont TX store needs A LOT of help, employees were great, and we did get a lot of perks such as lunches and stuff they did for us. However, management needs a lot of help. They don't know how to manage their employees properly, they find all your flaws but don't praise you beyond a 'thank you' when you go above and beyond your job requirements."
good,"Like working in a High School with the theme ""Mean Girls"" every day. This company truly encompasses the true meaning behind the term ""Corporate Beast."" They'll call you family. What they mean is property."
good,a typical  day at work is stocking the floor making sure we there is enough product on the floor and helping customers find items thats not on the floor
good,A typical day at work started early before store opening. Setup was informative and set the pace for a busy day. Night shift was difficult but acceptable. It was unfortunate I had to leave but I had mortality in the family they needed me.
good,Retail is what you make it.  Come in with a customer service attitude and you will enjoy your job and your customers.  There are a lot of repetitive tasks but no two days are the same.  Great job for someone who wants to work weekends and nights.
good,computer skill and how to pull order.... training others who  need help to not just better myself but others as well. doing price tags as well. I was trained to to other task using computer and scanner
good,JC Penny is a stable place to work. The employees are very friendly and seem to get along well. Management seems to almost have rose colored glasses about expectations versus reality but some were better than others.
good,some great people u meet love shopping for great price clothes and also some great customers that are loyal to u for some help sometimes those little things that u will missed in life how u meet people for all  cultures....
good,JCPenny is a good job just for the money. Some of the people are nasty and competitive. They steal out of the locker rooms and staff refrigerator. Not a good choice.
good,The main focus of the company is customer service and satisfaction. From making sure the customer finds exactly what they need to always cleaning and maintaining all areas of the store to make each and every customers shopping experience a great one.
good,"Great place but not enough hours were given, also schedule were dramatically changed at all times, overall fun place to work with good employee discounts"
good,JCPenny is a nice place to work. Everyone is nice and helpful. The hardest part of working there is around the holidays because it gets busy and you don't get much time to organize your station.
good,"Good place to work on job training advancement working with other businesses product demos Working was refreshing good place to work ,i love working with customer. helping them to find what they need for their home or business."
good,"JCPenney was my very first job, though it was only for the holidays. The training was okay but the computer system was somewhat difficult to maneuver. It was a much more stressful work environment, especially around the holidays, but the coworkers were always wonderful and usually willing to help out when needed."
good,"Working here was quite relaxed if you didn't sell many jcp cards and make your goal. Otherwise, your typical day would consist of keeping your area clean and closing was great."
good,"This company was great to work for. MY particular location wasn't the best, but that was not a direct reflection of the company itself. Stores positions are great starter positions. Pay is as expected, but there is room for promotion and advancement opportunities so long as you prove your potential."
good,"Opening positions we opened the cash registers and counted available cash. "
good,I have learned time management skills. I really enjoy my job at JcPenneys. The people I work with have really made me feel like I am their family. The hardest part of my job is not being able to satisfy every customer that walks through the door no matter how hard I try.
good,"Short time TI on a new department store. Union Hall sent experienced hands to do Focal walls shelving, Restroom and dressing room finishes such as laminate sheeting and hardware . Materials and installation managed well. Management was from Chicago, but found the way to manage and keep it light"
good,"It was fun at first getting to learn how interact with people. After the first 2 months, I did not enjoy being there, management could have been a lot more interactive with us. it felt robotic."
good,Time went fast working in the children department. Always had something to do. I enjoyed who i worked with and the things that I got to do there. It is a pretty simple job and was okay with the hours i was given. I learned a lot about people skills and getting out of my shell. it was a perfect first job.
good,"On a typical day it is very fun and open to learn new things, but the management kind of sucks, but its a very fun fast paced job and I loved it. The hardest part of the job is talking to those customers that do not understand the prices and want another price and being difficult. The most definite and fun part is actually talking to all customers learning new styles of dress and having fun with all associates."
good,"Management needed lots of work. Not supportive or kind. Very routine, no new experiences. Some of the coworkers were very sweet but some would start drama."
good,"Great environment, everyone worked together well. Manager was outstanding! Felt like a family there."
good,"Lots of fun taking pictures of families, however corporate expectations are unrealistic. Need more time allotted in camera rooms with small children, and with demands of the job, need to increase the pay."
good,"The previous managers did not know what they were doing, and were extremely lazy. The majority of them definitely need to be replaced, but it's overall a great company."
good,This was a great job. The environment wasn't typical of most retail stores. This job helped me to be a good employee and how to be sufficient with time.
good,"I was a seasonal worker, therefore I was not given formal training for the job. I learned as I went along. On a typical day I would zone and work the dressing rooms."
good,being involved with the staff at jcpenny was really great and being a home specialist was awesome because i was able to help customers redecorate there homes and figure out what can be the best choice for there house
good,"A typical day of work includes re-shelving and restocking products, provide customers service, offer credit card sign ups, and working the cash register. I learned to work a cash register, I learned different brands of shoes since that was the department I was assigned to, and I learned to multitask between different customers and responsibilities. The staff there were friendly overall as well as the HR department. It's difficult at times to get a manager to assist when needed but that's something I expect to happen in most large department stores. The hardest part of my job was trying to get people to sign a credit card with us which I knew the company had goals to meet. While I always offered customers the opportunity to sign up, I did not like and often times did not try to persist and push a credit card membership on customers like I have observed other employees do. The most enjoyable part of the job was to help customers out with their purchases and give them a pleasant experience shopping at the store."
good,Like with most companies you are just a number and there is never any job security no matter how hard you work. You will have constant fear that your job will be eliminated in the next rounds of cuts
good,"Everyone always made retail seem so bad, but I've actually enjoyed my time at jcpennys. Unfortunately I had to quit my job because I went away for college but I could see myself working retail in the future."
good,Great place to work but not  enough  hours and no  benefits. A lot of  favoritism  among supervisors . Some of them are really great . Grat experience and nice manager he is great
good,"Receive freight, open it then place new items in various departments throughout the store. I learned that merchandise is displayed in specific ways to appeal to customers. Management worked alongside employees and cared about treating all fairly. Most workers  cared about working consistently until work  shift was over and in many cases, worked overtime. The hardest part of the job was lifting heavy freight items and trying to get all items put in proper places before customers started arriving and the most enjoyable part was seeing all the new merchandise and putting it on display."
good,"There is always something to do. Having to stay hours after closing time is annoying. Also, having to finish up other people's work in their department is annoying."
good,"A typical day on a weekday is never all that busy so a lot of work gets done. The weekends are more rushed and the store gets messy."
good,"In my initial admin role days were pretty easy. Very low stress. I experienced 3 CEO changes and being in this position (that has since been restructured) it wasn't very challenging. If you can manage to sit and manage a basic data entry position it is the most unchallenging position ever and decently compensated. Especially if your are a recent college grad."
good,jcpenny is a very busy store which meant lots of customers. they offer tons of coupons which is a good way to get clients in the chair. also they have the best deals on product
good,"I do enjoy working here very much, but I find it difficult to work here part time and support myself. I have learned a lot from working here, and would continue working here for much longer."
good,"I took this job because it was my starting point. I would not recommend this company. Favoritism plays a huge factor on how you are treated, paid, worked, etc."
good,"A typical day would consist of assisting customers, folding clothes and working the cashier. The hardest part of this job would be standing long hours."
good,"Nice company to work for, lots of changes through the years. Not a good balance between work/life though. Decent pay and schedule."
good,"Through out the day you clean up the customers messes and sell the merchandise to them. In this job you have to be on your toes or your work will pile up on you without even realizing it. The management is great with keeping you on task and store politics to a minimum. The co-workers have a different thinking pattern compared to morning and evening shifts. There was always complaints about ""drama"" problems. Which made that part of the job hard but the hardest part was cleaning up in the ladies underclothes department. The one part of the job I really enjoyed was working in the children's department because it always made me really happy to see the kids getting new clothes or toys. Their smiles made it worth it."
good,"A typical day would include a daily briefing and then we would go on with our day whether that be tickets or projects. I learned a lot with Servers and network equipment. Management played favorites, if you weren't a favorite you would feel left out. Some co-workers were great and some weren't as they would hold back information. There was no hard parts, the fun came in when we were rewarded for our job with quarterly pizza parties."
good,"I worked in the salon. The manager was amazing and understanding, but some of the stylists were mean and negative towards the front desk."
good,"I Think JCpenney is a good place to work a typical average day would be helping customers find clothes, ringing them up and folding clothes. I really do like my co workers i get a long with everyone it inst really a stressful job."
good,A typical day at work is to always be well informed on store promotions. Greeting customers as well as assisting them with store merchandise or products.  I've learned to be even more persistent when engaging with customer and fulfilling daily duties.  Management does well with responsibilities but lacks communication with employees. Co-workers worked well together as a team or independently.  The hardest part of the job was not really hard but rather challenging because of many other duties having to be able to completed.  The most enjoyable part of this job was guaranteed customer satisfaction and of course employee discounts and giveaways.
good,They were good over all but the manager would try to over work us. and not pay overtime. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the scheduling that management would give us. a lot of it was messed up from what it was suppose to be.

good,"Mostly folding clothes and watching people mess it up so you can fold it again, it's the kind of job to keep you busy. Having to unpack shipments can be a pain at 5 am but it's nice cause you get out early."
good,"During the holiday time it can be long hours without a break. Also you have to work on black Friday and the day after Christmas. Great for a single , lonely person."
good,"I love the people I work with. Overall not fond of how corporate makes so many changes, and cuts hours so often. You stay busy recovering more than with customers. I like the fact I stay busy, just would rather have a more meaningful job"
good,"JC Penney is a good company. If you want experience working with the public and working with a diverse group of co-workers, then you will like the work atmosphere in this company."

Making yourself learn and grow in the company affords you more opportunity for hours and responsibility.  The co-workers are fun and great to work with.  There is a warrior team spirit of giving. Being a part of giving back to the community is a great way to bond your employees. Having daily, weekly and monthly goals challenges the employees and creates a better place for customers to shop."

My co-workers varied, there were kind people and unfavorable people.

The most enjoyable part was holidays because I was actually able to spend what I was paid."
good,"Customer support, cashiering etc...everyday retail kind of retail work. It is located in the South Center Mall, and close to a lot of places which made it great. Great co-workers, flexible schedule."

good,"typical work day was customer service, always learning new things about the store , co- workers were devoted, hardest part was knowing where to put new merchandise. the most enjoyable part is people"
good,"This is a great job to gain experience, but do not be fooled. You may never get a promotion by just simply going above and beyond what is required. There are people who have been working for this company for 20+ years and are still getting paid hourly. However, that may be their choice, but is does not compensate well for those looking to pursue a career in retail. Great beginning experience for those needing a part-time job. Fun work environment and great learning experience."
good,"For those of you starting out in the job world, it's a great starter job. You can learn a lot about the real world, as well as about yourself, while working in this job."

I had to interact with customers and ensure their experience at JCPenney was pleasant and enjoyable. This was a challenge at first, but after a few weeks, I became less shy and it was easier to approach people. My co-workers were always very helpful in providing me with useful feedback to make sure everyone worked as a team effectively. The hardest part of the job was learning how limited the resources were for professional growth. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team members, they are were energetic and charismatic."

good,"Folding clothes, cleaning out fitting rooms, and assisting customers. I learned that hard work pays off by providing great hours and lots of recognition. The management was on top of their job and kept the store running smoothly. Co-workers were lovely, they helped out and were great friends. The hardest part of the job is the strain of being on your feet for 8-10 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the kind customers that you get to interact with everyday!"
good,"Every day I am allowed to help customers mix and match outfits by adding my thoughts in with their ideas. From measuring, fitting, folding, straightening, and more describes my day. I have learned how much measure anyone from a toddler to an adult, learned how to professionally fold the shirts as if they have never been opened. Management has died from my beginning experience of coming to the company. My co-workers are amazing, we know each others strengths and weaknesses in the department and even around the store. The hardest part of the job is just deciding what to do after managers tell you differently on the same project, just to do whats right.

I`ve definitely learned that security is needed in every business stores. There`s a lot more stealing going on than I realized before I started working in retail. I have great co-workers, we work very well as a team. The hardest part of my job is customers with bad attitudes. The most enjoyable part of my job is when you help clients find exactly what they needed and they tell you that you've made their day."

good,"I love J.C.P if they paid more it would be the best retail store in my opinion, and thts a big if."
good,I believe it is a great place to work. There are a lot of great people working there. Pay raises are scarce. Not enough hours for the right people.
good,"A typical day at work would start by communicating with customers, and checking them out. Beginning to return items to shelf, the entire shift/ Work experience is great, the only cons are flexibility and ""Credit-Apps"" A company credit-card application.

good,"A typical day at work begins when I clock in, go to my specialized department, and see what tasks my supervisor has for me. I had to provide good customer service while completing my tasks in a timely manner. The management is okay, the thing I would say needs to be worked on is the scheduling. My co-workers are wonderful, we are all like one big family. The whole environment at JC Penny's is a very family/homey one. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with a lot of customers on a busy day and making sure each one is satisfied, it is hard sometimes to keep up with so many people at once. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is all of the contact with the customers. I like meeting all different kinds of people."
good,"The work was steady and the customers for the most part were friendly. My co-workers and management were always there for support if needed, The hardest part was trying to keep up with the demand of getting our customers shoes when wanted, but I kept up with it!!

good,"Decent managers and co-workers"

The reward comes from the job itself instead of the pay and benefits. Would make a great first job just out of high school."
good,"I worked in the children's department, and as a result of the store having somewhat of ""budget cuts"" many times I worked alone. The people that worked in the department with me were always in the best mood and helpful.

The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and being able to be around children."

The people that I worked with made it worth while."
good,A typical day of work depends on which area you are working in and what you are doing. I have done most of the positions and liked them all. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet several hours.

good,I really enjoy my job. Sadly I mostly enjoy just the customers. The management in the store is so so. Some managers are amazing and some others just don't seem to have a grasp on how to treat employees. I would prefer to have a set schedule and I don't. I worked my way up to one and have since lost it due to many company changes. I did nothing to deserve these changes and don't feel as though I should lose what I had.

I learned what I wanted in my future career and how to important work/life balance is. I am a dedicated person and I always wanted to finish my job the best.

Nearly all employees and employers are easy to work with and are helpful for that they work as a team

The management was decent. My co workers were Team players. the job wasnt hard I just found another job much better. The most enjoyable part was knowing you had a good day at work in the end of the day."
good,"Providing outstanding customer service. making sure that every department is clean and put back together. Making sure that racks are sized and tables are folded neatly. Rearranging items if need be. I learned all of my skills from there cashier, how to add on to a sale, how to finish with a customer so that they would love to come back and that they would tell friends or family about our company.

good,"It is a department store, very much like other department stores."

good,"I loved working with the customers at J. C. Penney in the drapery, women's and home departments. However, the company required that I give an open availability for my schedule which I was unable to do. I would definitely consider a part-time position with J. C. Penney if there was more flexibility in scheduling."
good,Great just was not a secure hired for seasonal help. Great hrs andflexable schedule
good,This is where I began my trade further in customer service after Regal Cinemas. I was immensely more comfortable and much more open to speaking with customers. Helped pave the way to be a star employee at the Nordstrom Rack.

good,"It was really easily manageable with any life schedule and most of the time managers were willing to work with you. However, work load often times made you feel defeated with so few hours to work in but year after year keep getting more responsibilities when before you are doing everything just to keep up."
good,Managers tend to make you ask about the JCPenney credit card multiple times and having to keep a certain number of an apot. Dealing with customers that steal isn’t fun. You can’t chase them down your just have to score more customer service towards them till they can’t take it anymore. Hardest part of the job is getting customers to apply for the card. And organizing the entire section you’ve been assigned
good,Customer Service and employees do so well in interacting and positivity with customers. Work hard to make the customers feel special and grant the things they’re approved.
good,this was an interesting experience full of angry customers but great co worker relationships. if you are in need of a job immediately this is your go to option. they are always hiring and looking forward to working with your schedule and hours of availability. would recommend this job.
good,This is a fast paced job on busy days and you always have something to do.  Everything is focused around customers and the best ways to show merchandise.
good,The managers are understanding and very trustworthy. They are flexible on schedule. They are also dependable. All the associates are treated the exact same way.
good,"nice customers"
good,Good first job ! I really enjoyed working with jcpenny only thing is the pressure you to get a lot of credit apps but once you get the hang of it you got it
good,"The warehouse experience was great, we had to scan boxes off a line, and build them 7ft high, onto a pallet. We were set between the numbers of 300-600 a day."
good,"The staff are attentive in making sure their tasks get completed, and management does focus on customer happiness. However it can get rather busy, and certain managers can ask quite a lot of an employee to get a specific task complete in a short amount of time."
good,"It is a very easy job with lots of other good employees. However, there are a few people that were unfairly fired. The schedule is flexible with other schedules."
good,Fast paced especially during the holidays. I learned a lot about working a cash register and working with customers to make a better experience for them.
good,I’ve been to a few different locations; overall very nice company to work for. Most hiring is done very well and teamwork is high on the list. This and the effort to keep the stores clean and stocked are a giant help in keeping the customers coming back to this friendly longtime retail store.
good,"Management was very laid back, great associates to work with everybody was nice. Only problem was that management would push the credit cards too much. Unrealistic time windows to complete tasks at work."
good,Good place to work. The customers love to shop there so it is great to assist them find what they are looking for. The company has good processes to help be a profitable company.
good,Your typical day would be sorting clothes and putting them back in their designated areas. You on occasion would have to check customers out at the register.
good,Was a great place to get experience at. The store was organized an I learned so much from the manager. I was given a opportunity to work in kids section.
good,"It was a fun job that required me to put out the printing and signing dept. Working the ads and deals that would change weekly. I enjoyed working there for the holiday season, would recommend it to anyone looking for an entry job into retail."
good,"It was a great move around, just a lack of communication between staff. It definitely was order in the department that I was working in. Great teamwork.  The people I was working with have great communication. And great personalities."
good,"Customers can be a little coupon crazy but overall, not a bad job. The hours can vary by a lot so it's best if this job is strictly used as a part time job for yourself."
good,"Just make sure the store is clean and your life will be easy. They care about there workers and JCPenney will take care of you, the best part is the discounts"
good,"Overall JCP has been fair in employment. Always be on the lookout for ever changing upper management - which means ever changing rules. The positions i have held were fairly compensated for the work i did. But at times, there was additional work to be done, which would run into overtime. "
good,"JCP has great employees and has great service. The management is nice, respectful, and very helpful. overall a great vibe at JCP......................"
good,I loved this job even though the management was a bit unorganized at times. Great job if you are in high school or college student. Please be prepared for consistent change in this work force.
good,This job had its ups and downs the managers were super strict. You get paid more when you work holidays which was great but the cleaning up process at the end of the night was very had almost impossible to finish.
good,"I worked this job part time in high school, and it was perfect for that, It was a fu environment while being slow paced. However now, I don't think it would be a place where I would continue to work because I need something a little more fulfilling in my life."
good,"Customer services"
good,Show up on time and help customers and you wont have any issues. Can get busy on weekends but again i feel like that is typical. Managers were usually understand about shift changes as long as they weren't super last minute.
good,"Since Jcpenney was my first job I didn’t really know what to expect but I really liked how they respected your hours/availability, the only part I didn’t like was the changed in pay rate after the holidays."
good,"Client interaction, scheduling of same day and future appointments. Rendering payments for services provided. At time of payment I would provide suggestions on additional products that would be beneficial to the client."
good,"Perfet job for somthing temporary.  Little to no carrer advancement what so ever and hours fluctuate on the regular basis. "
good,Would recommend! The job was an amazing opportunity! Very self motivating and always busy! Provides great benefits and I had one of the best managers ever!
good,"I like working there but there's a lot of things I think could be better, I've been there for awhile and really think the supervisors are really good and I have no problem with any of the work I just think some of the policies aren't fair because they don't pertain to everyone and they should."
good,It was a good place too work.   Overtime was offered.  Location closed down and we were layed off. Furniture call center closed down july 2018. The end.
good,"I enjoyed my time with the company, I learned a fair bit about customer service and providing sales advice. Great entry level position with the ability to learn."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job doing recovery at JCPENNEY. I was able to work at my own pace, & it was nice to be able to work by myself. I was assigned to a certain part of the store & the work day went by fairly fast."
good,JCPenney is a good company that will take care of their employees and provide wonderful customer service to their customers. I've enjoyed working for this company.
good,"I was able to manage myself and successfully achieve department sales goals without assistance for almost 2 years. I was highly depended upon in my specialized department as there were no supervisors willing to learn my department in order to assist with custom orders for window department customers. It took the company a year to replace my much needed department computer printer. Initially when I started in the department, there was a mixture of five full-time and part-time associates. Before I ended my service with JCPenney, I worked with and trained another associate."
good,JCPenny is a nice place to work. Easy to learn how to do the job.  Easy to work with coworkers.  Management is helpful.  Not to hard to do.  Registers not to hard to work.
good,"JCPenney was my first real job, it was good to learn how the work life was before I got a more adult job that paid better and gave me better opportunities."
good,"I worked in the salon my team and co workers were amazing. The GM at the time was not as easy to work with he is no longer with the company, buy ultimately I left the company due to his poor management and his poor behavior towards myself and other employees."
good,Working retail was a busy job. Always on the go making sure you had the entire store stocked was important. Making sure everything was accessible to our customers was #1
good,There was always something to do made the time fly. Staff was friendly. Supervisos we're easy to access and communicate with. Rotate postisions so you never get bored with one task.
good,"J.C.Penney had a vision and that somehow got sidetracked over the years. It also offered careers to people, but you can't follow that dream anymore. Sure there are people who have been with the company for years, and I mean years, but the new associates coming to work for J.C. Penney can't count on that anymore. Sad, really sad."
good,"checking out customers' puchases, folding pants or shirts."
good,Working there was fun. I worked loss and prevention but I had good relationships with everyone that worked there. The employees worked hard to give the best possible customer service under the circumstances given to them.
good,Working at JCPenney was temporary for me some nice people and some the other but it was over all a good experience taught me customer service skills and how to organize a department.
good,"help customers find items that they are looking for, helping them order things online, and retrieve the items for them.  Management was available when needed."
good,"I had two store managers over about 7 years.  The first one was amazing.  I learned so much from him.  I maintain that relationship to this day.  Tough but fair.  The second manager was one of the worst managers I have ever worked for in any company.  In 31 years, I have never ever quit a job, except one.  This second manager was intollerable to work for."
good,Productive work place. The day started early and there were several different shifts. I had to supervise many employees. Opened and closed the store.  There was quite a bit of responsibility with this job
good,"Working in fine jewelry was fun, of course you would have a few bad customers here and there but nothing too bad. Training was very vague and done too quickly."
good,If you apply for cashier well you just wasted your time because you be around every where and their managers their are bad I recomend not working their
good,"A great team of dedicated individuals driven to succeed. We worked hard and respected each other."
good,"I loveworking with my coworkets quickly felt like family no plans on leaving.    I absolutely love my deepartment, theteammates, and overall feel of the store."
good,It's an okay job.  Flexible schedule. Great management. Some employees think they know everything. They push the jcpenney credit card. They do employee of the month and recognitions.
good,"I like that if something comes up they try their best to help when scheduling. The environment is good and I enjoy working with my coworkers, they are all nice and helpful."
good,"My first time working retail was at JCPenney. I applied in November, little did I know how horrible of an idea that was. I was hired for seasonal with potential for part time. "
good,"They really need to stick to what they say at time of hire.  If you tell an employee they will receive the maximum of 30 hours that should be set, with a little under is okay. But not 20 hours because new hires are now on board."
good,"Working in JC Penney showed me that the most important part about retail is the customers, and this ethic is something they held high. This same ethic was absorbed into everything they do from the standard check-out experience to the sale floor associates."
good,Jcpenny is either a very fast work environment or a very slow one. Depending on the day. The hours are very flexible. The hardest part of the job is probably keeping calm when a customer is mad over something small like a coupon being expired.
good,"Loved the job and the people."
good,"JC Penney is a nice company to work for, even if it seems as if they have lost sight of some aspects of customer service. The work environment wasn't bad."
good,"Todos los empleados son amables, la parte mas importante para la compañía es el servicio al cliente y te mantienen todos los meses con nuevos videos de como mejorar en el trabajo. Aprendí a cuadrar en las cajas registradoras tan avanzadas que tienen, a utilizar sus herramientas de trabajo como el ""warrior"", ademas de cambiar precios y acomodar y doblar ropa adecuadamente."
good,"JCPenney was an okay work place, however there was a lot of drama. It honestly felt like high school. There were a lot of childlike things happening. The good part is that during their peak seasons, they have a lot of overtime, and encourage you to stay."
good,"I did inbound and out bound calls about credit cards and orders that were done by the customers."
good,Very friendly older people was funny working with them they were comfortable to work with I was in the stocking business the boss was mean somewhat ..
good,"An all around good place to work, management really cares about each employee.I would say the most enjoyable part of the job here is that you get to know your customers and many personally. It is like a small hometown relationship you build with each customer."
good,This was a temp position I would of like to have more hours while I was working there. This was a great company to work for even though of it was a few short months
good,"Productive and Professional work environment, Friendly and professional work environment. Works schedules are flexible and good work environment and flexible"
good,"I Honestly Liked it"
good,"a fun and exciting place to work learn more about the ins and outs of retail sales, inventory management, pricing, zoning, stocking,shrinkage , accounting and customer satisfaction."
good,"Though the management seemed to be somewhat dysfunctional in communicating with itself, the environment offered numerous opportunities for refining experience in customer satisfaction and independent problem solving."
good,"it was a good company, short hours and fast paced. and there was days we work regular hours. it was good, i enjoyed working there. the walk everyday.."
good,"To put things shortly, I loved the job, I enjoyed giving feedback to my managers, I loved being around the clothes. The work experience was relaxed. It was the other workers, I was seasonal at the time, and I had long time workers coming to my dressing room to slack and gossip while I handled all the work. Eventually, I became a subject of gossip among a few of the girls, where a close friend of mine from child hood was working in a different department, and rumor began to spread that we were making relations. I didn't like how unprofessional they were, so I left."
good,Good place. Good benefits. Flexible. The issues were mainly with associates and backing each other up and working as a team. Management is a mess.....
good,Working here would be great for someone who is just starting out and looking for their first job or wanting to start over in a new direction. There's not a lot lot of pressure and opportunity to move up.
good,I enjoyed the work environment.  I love working with people and assisting customers this was the highlight of my job.  There was nothing hard about my job it was simple pleasure.
good,The company does not communicate well with between the managers and the associates.  This leads to lack of development for new hires and a high turnover rate as people are unable to get proper trainer.  Also promotions have been given out to outside hires at times and not always from within.
good,good company to work for just  not a lot of customer know  they have a salon. very slow customer traffic......................................................
good,"I love working at JcPenny in Biloxi,ms. The work environment is really nice and a nice safe place to work in. While working for this company I have learned the importance of customer service and the value of hard work."
good,Decent company to work for unless you are a single mother of small children. Makes child care very difficult as your schedule is always different from week to week
good,"JCPenney was my first job. As such, I wasn't really good at talking to customers until I was basically finished. My coworkers were really nice, but I think one didn't like me for reasons unknown. Doing the go-backs and floor recovery were probably the easiest parts of my job, mostly because I love to organize things and make them look pretty and that's basically all that part of retail is. Making the displays look pretty."
good,A typical day would include greeting the customers. Giving them excellence customer service. Help find what they are looking for. The team is like family.
good,"Nice place to work"
good,i learned how to be more organized. The most enjoyable part of working at JCPenney is just greeting and being around all of the people and helping people find what they need.
good,"Management needs to be better organized and scheduling for the next needs to be put out sooner. It is a good company to work in general, flexible hours. No full time positions available except for the manager is a big down fall."
good,A very thoughtful company that makes every effort to put customer first.  Always opportunities to work cross-functionally within the company to gain more knowledge.
good,"Good for an entry level job, finds ways to maintain you active. Good culture and rapid enviornment. Needs more management and harder workers to maintain the company afloat."
good,"People and customers are great to work with, and the environment makes it better having people fun to work around that have a good time! The place is overall a good ideal place to work!"
good,Everyday there was something new to learn and apply. I learned about sales and stock merchandise. Most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with different situations in the customer service area.
good,Jcpenney tries to always take care of its employees. I was a part time associate who became a manager very quickly. I was taught very well at this company and was able to take many life skills with me. Great place to work
good,"You came in through a specific door for employees, I was issued my in-store pager and then I clocked in. I had to wear this pager for my complete shift.  Go to my office and pick-up the inventory guns and begin the inventory process of the jewelry area. After that the store would open and the day would begin."
good,"Perfect high-school job, not a lot of hours to be able to live efficiently if you're planning on just have one job. Management was really fun to work with"
good,I worked for this company more than once first as an drapery installer and second as a window specialist. Customer service is the most important part of the job. Most of the customers are repeat customers. Everyone there works together to keep the store and motivate each other for sales.
good,"good atmosphere kind of boring not a lot of customers , let you go home if not a lot of customers, friendly staff, you have to walk around constantly."
good,If you are looking for flexible part time work this is good place to work. They do put a lot of emphasis on pushing for credit. So if you are not comfortable with that I would not recommend it. Not a lot of opportunity to move up.
good,"Multi tasking in different departments, assisting customer needs, be on your feet 8 plus hours."
good,I loved the stress free environment. The fast pasted days and the discount! Loved the discount! The store has excellent prices and even though I dont work there still my number one place to shop!
good,You can see who has more work ethic than others so it's easy to prove your worth. it can be frustrating seeing some of the women supervisors slacking.
good,It was a fantastic place to work although it does seem like it is a dying company and I would not recommend it as they consider full time as 32h a week not 40 and there is little to no job advancement ability
good,"Working here is just what you expect. You focus on customer service and do your best to help the store run smoothly. The management is good, but with so many employees you might just fly under the radar."
good,"Everybody was friendly and helpful.  My only problem was that it was as seasonal job, so it dodn't last long, but I undestand that it is a necessary part of the retail business."
good,"Started working her when i was 20 was a fun place to work until they started making changes that effected everyones hours, ........................................"
good,Scheduling hours are the worst part and can’t switch with anyone. Jcpennys is not a very busy store so there is not much to do or help people. Overall it’s still a good and stable work place.
good,I miss the benefits that JCPenney’s offer the employees. The location of the job was very convenient also it was a very comfortable setting for a call center
good,The task crew I worked with were probably the most hardworking members of the entire store but the management did little to acknowledge this and often times treated us unfairly. Decent place to work overall though.
good,"When I worked here, I enjoyed it.  You met a lot of great people.  You were never lacking hours and you really got to know your co-workers.  It was always busy."
good,"JC Penney is huge on creating a great environment for customers. They strive to bring in new customers, as much as keeping the ones they have. You're required to greet EVERY customer, and offer assistance. I believe that's a great quality to find within retail. Unfortunately not every store has that atmosphere."
good,"I was hired for Holiday Help only - Hardest part was standing on my feet for entire day. Loved working with other employees on the floor."
good,"I worked in the salon, it was only busy during the weekend and during the week was to slow paced for me. the older employees generally got the older patients that could come during the week."
good,"Nice job "
good,JCPenney was not a bad place to work. My manager was very easy to talk to and recognized the people who did a great job. There was a lot of team work which was great and for every credit card we opened we got extra money in our check which was a great thing.
good,I enjoyed my work here and the customer service  was great. They were very understanding of my family situation and allowed me to have flexible hours. Hated to leave but was offered better hours and pay elsewhere.
good,"A lot of my coworkers were always very tired after a shift. They expect us to do 4 things at once and sell at least 3 credit cards a day. If you didn't sell enough, they would let you go.  The demographic for the store is crabby middle aged men and angry old women."
good,"I liked working there. Most of the customers were nice.  The management is good, co workers were good. The hours were not great, which is why I had to leave, as well as the pay."
good,"This was a temporary seasonal job to give me something to do as a stay at home mom. I really enjoyed working with my teammates, received employee discounts."
good,"Charge customers for their merchandise. Greet costumers. Clean aisles. Count money at end of shift and make sure aisles and area is clean. Do specific jobs at register such returns, exchanges, charges via credit cards, debit cards, cash and checks."
good,"They love to move you around departments and they will make you push their credit cards on people. Management was very confusing due to the lack of written expectations of everyone,"
good,"Great people to be around.I make my job exciting by being myself. Fun,loving, and full of energy.They have really came a long ways with merchandising,customer relations."
good,"The job at a JCPenney as a recovery associate was slower and and didn't require much attention or effort, the pay was good and management was fair, it was a good job"
good,I would’ve stayed here if it weren’t so hard to work & go to college at the same time. I had a hard time juggling my life between school & work & my grades started to show it.
good,This was my very first job and I really enjoyed it very much.  It was a great opportunity to learn about retail sales. It was also very helpful since I was still in highschool when I started working there.
good,"Fun place to work, you do things on your own, very reliable upon yourself and time passes by fast. have your job task to do throughout the day nothing crazy hard just the right amount that should be expected."
good,Most of the people you work with are very cool. you have some days you have a lot of people there and some days you don't. it's only a good job to get you through school that's it
good,"Professional for the most part, very organized and way better than my last job. Satisfied customers and great management. Management recognizes associates for good deeds and the hours are flexible."
good,You can get discounts while working there which is great when one takes pride in appearance.  There is always something to do and you can get out of it whatever you put in.
good,"Loved this job and the amazing people I worked with every day. Unfortunately the economy flipped, and I had to relocate to a new area so that I could get a job that paid better."
good,"JC Penney was a pleasant place to work. I worked in sales with commissions.  Management was helpful in any way the could be. At the time, I enjoyed working retail."
good,"I enjoyed helping customers find everything they needed and also finding ways to get it for them if we did not have in store. Loved taking care of visual effects throughout the store. Loved putting out stock. Enjoyed taking a department and checking each rack for wrong items, sizing and straightening"
good,Cooperative work environment. Learned new things. supportive management. friendly workplace culture. Delivering project within critical time with team support.
good,"Good place to work overall, pay was fair, job was easy since I was in the jewelry department. I helped out clients a lot with jewelry (diamonds, gold, silver, birthstones, plated, etc), and watches. No major problems overall."
good,I like working at JC Penney because you work with different people and see different people. i like the fact i could help costumer around the store to find things.
good,Some days would be busier than others but if it was slow you always could find something to do like putting more clothes out or scanning more clothes. Hardest part was dealing with upset customers but I can always handle those situations and work out a solution. I enjoyed to be able to constantly be able to do things and to gain more customer service skills.
good,JCP had a good work culture. They were strong with HR policies. Their engagement programs were very good. Both for employees and customers. They also believe in employees having a balance work life.
good,"Like any other company, this one definitely has its flaws. Unfortunately JCPenney just isn't the place you're going to grow with and I say that because there is no job security there."
good,"helping customers experience a pleasant and enjoyable visit,"
good,Everyone was friendly and very helpful when I worked here. Typically days weren't very busy unless it was around the holidays. The job wasn't hard at all and it was very easy to catch on.
good,"I worked at JCPenny during the holiday season, and a temporary worker and was hired permanently. I enjoyed the job at first but then it became over whelming and the managers were young and immature, they favored certain people and would give the long work to the people who were hardworking but allow the people who slack to get away with it ."
good,introduced me to how working in the US is like. Management was good and always ensured that i had all the necessary resources to carry out my duties  successfully.
good,Worked with me and my complex schedule while I attended higher education. The culture of the job was easy going; except for the overly aggressive pushing of the JCP credit card.
good,Good job to keep while in school. I had the job while going to school in the morning and I was able to get full time hours for working in the night. I also was able to move up in roles.
good,"You have to keep moving when you work for JCP. Retail is never a dull moment, and at JCP you get a lot of new experience. helping someone find a dress to prom or a new shirt for there grandpa. its a great place for people friendly folk."
good,"Goal oriented, motivational, friendly team environment. opportunities to learned new skills. career advancement, encourages innovation, and buy new ideas."
good,The management at JC Penney were quick to realize my customer service capabilities and did not hesitate to promote me after a few short months. They are very observant of workers and provide equal opportunity for those who do their job every shift.
good,I only attented for a few months but it was a pretty good job it just didn't work with my schedule while I was in High School but overall it was pretty cool.
good,"Determine and set product merchandise prices. Calculate purchase subtotals, taxes, and shipping costs for submission to customers."
good,"Jcpenney was a great place to work for the most part, although I didn't spend much time working there. I was worked too hard though, for my current age at the time."
good,Constantly was behind a cash register helping customers with order/online orders. Measured customers in order to obtain best suit and other clothing suited for them.
good,It's a warehouse. When its hot its hot when its old its cold. There are some days when mandatory o/t is called is fast paced stressful and it can be rewarding
good,Productive workplace.  Company was experiencing financial issues that resulted in downsizing and layoffs.  Turnover was high due to financial environment of the company.  Beautiful corporate office with amenities.
good,"Within the stores I worked at (5 in total), a sense of family was created. I created many friendships from the stores I work at in the past. All stores did a great job in maintaining morale by hosting staff lunches/dinners, special days, and contests."
good,"I loved working for JCPenney.  I started working for them in 1994.  I worked in the Men's department, the shoe department, a year in the office and the finally the Salon/Spa division.  I loved working in the Salon, it was never a dull moment.  I learned a lot in the salon, from how to deal with customers to how to manage a front desk.  At one point I had 9 receptionists under me to help support the Salon.  I helped answer phones, check customers in and out, replenished the inventory, and worked on inputting schedules.  It was hard leaving the company."
good,"This is a great place to work for, you will enjoy the training at JC Penny.  They help you grow in customer service and you enjoy working with different people."
good,Each shift worked consisted of the upkeep of my department and helping to assist customers. I learned that retail is more involved than you realize for the pay that is offered. It was a good work environment overall.
good,There is always something to accomplish at JCPenneys. It a great environment for learning customer experience and managing customer expectations. Loved the opportunity
good,A friendly atmosphere that was filled with kind customers and coworkers. Working there taught me more people skills and brought to my attention how crucial communication is throughout every workplace.
good,I was 19 when I started at JCpenney. I learned everything I know now under the great leadership at the time. I was there for almost 10 years and the only reason I left was because of the management change.
good,Get in answer calls all day until it is time to go. Minimal time to talk to others- only at break or lunch. The management was great and they helped out when needed without attitude.
good,It was a fun place to work always busy have to be able to work quickly. I enjoyed working there but I had to leave because I was getting busy with school being it was my senior year & the only thing I would complain about is not having backup cashiers to help out as busy as we were.
good,"Enjoy my time with JC Penney's  I wished I could have transfer to the new location. But it was to far to travel. Worked well wit all supervisors, and leads"
good,JCPenney is a great place to work at. the associates there make you feel welcomed and they take care of their customers very well. one thing I don't approve is the way the mangers can be. they are not professional at all.
good,"It's been awhile since I've worked there but when i did work there in Columbus, it was fun. I learned a lot. Working in Kearney was different though because at that time, the store only let you work in one spot and train in one spot so, working there I was treated rather well because I knew every department. I worked every department. From what I hear now, the Columbus store isn't the same."
good,Enjoyable company to work for but the pay is pretty low even if you have experience going in. Its a good part time job for someone who just needs a little extra cash.
good,The best part about this position was the reconciliation and accounting for the store's overall daily sales. The hours were good for this position because you can go in very early and then leave early.
good,Working herevwas great the managers and supervisors was great had a hreat attitude and was alsways willibg to help on the sales floor.  Schedules were flexible and time off was easy to ask for.
good,"I always felt JC Penney had a good set of values as a company. They treated their employees well and used positive reinforcement to achieve credit goals. There was a sense of competition within the store on who could get the most credit. However, the store manager at the time was not great. The entire management team didn't work well."
good,It wasn't hard open boxes and put them in bins then wrap bin in plastic wrap the only thing I didn't like is you had to work on one pallet alone and after that you had to wrap it and take it all the way on the other side of the warehouse but it was an easy job
good,"Team work"
good,"The Women's Shoe Department at JCP is VERY quick-paced and active. Being able to remain on your feet for the entire shift is MANDATORY. The floor management is excellent and can be relied upon to assist with any question or situation, which was greatly helpful during the Christmas shopping time period."
good,"Customer Service mon to Thursday slow days on Friday and weekend very busy"
good,Working at JCPenney was fun. You always had something to do which made the time go by fast. One thing I  liked about working there was the paid time off and the 401k.
good,"I enjoyed working at JCPenneys it consisted of mainly returning go backs, ringing up customers, and providing customer service to all the guest. Shortly after I was asked to be a store lead that position was very busy but in a good way"
good,I have always liked that I get to do my job on my own without a lot of oversight. As long as you do well you are trusted without a great deal of supervision.
good,Great place if they would be able to grt managment on the same page employees are i enjoyed working there was a great place im not so sure now havent beem there in years
good,I respect my coworkers and managers very much. They are all extremely kind and are willing to go above and beyond to make customers feel welcome and to give them good service. The hardest part of the job is the two hours of recovery simply because it is boring. The most enjoyable is getting to see kind customers!
good,met one of my best friends working here and i am so grateful to have met her i call her my little sister and i wouldn't change her for the world jcp will always get love
good,relaxed good  people and  it  was  relaxed passed and  the  customer and  staff are  always  friendly  and happy  to help  easy to fellow the  staff  and it  was always  fun
good,"1. arrive onsite and replace backup tapes in servers"
good,"Excellent sales, great customer service and clean store too. Happy with the merchandise. Good displays very colorful. Styles of clothing. Very good selection of goods. Excellent styling salon. Great jewelry. They also have nice makeup and perfume counter as well."
good,"It has been a while since I've worked here.  Don't remember a whole lot honestly. Honestly I'd rather skip this portion, why is there no skip button? It'd be a great idea"
good,Awesome place to work. Nice environment friendly people. I've been here 6 months. I enjoy my job here. I would highly recommend people to work here. I enjoy JCPenney
good,"It was really easy to work there, all you had to do was fold clothes and help customers find what they needed. It was a really chill environment, but the only thing that I didnt like was that the work they expected us to do was not worth what i was getting paid. And I never got enough hours."
good,The working enviroment at JC Penny inc was fast paced with over 1000 employees working in a warehouse with forklifts and heavy machinery in each department
good,"Amazing team members, great place to work and grow your career.  Collaborative environment, people are open and approachable.  Texas is a great place to live."
good,"A typical day at work is having to come in and clean up the floor from last nights mess. Usually my day as a jewelry specialist, I have to not only be able to tend to my customer who are purchasing jewelry, but also check out people who need to be checked out in other departments, because they don't want to wait in the lines in the other two counters we have on the floor. I did learn many things working with diamonds, gold and watches. The management there can be a whole lot better than what it is now, they expect too much from the fine jewelry associates then they do of other associates. The co-workers that I had, were amazing, we all got a long and we helped each other out when we can. The hardest part of the job is when it is Black Friday and we have only one working register. Another thing that makes the job harder is when we have to put warranty on jewelry, but don't want to because of how bad the depot for jewelru repair is. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to make new friends from co-workers and working with new material every time."
good,"The work was hard , And it was busy work, It was at your on paste, And you did not have to rush, Did not have to have your boss over your shoulder, I did have help unloading from time to time"
good,Working for this company was fun when I was a teenager. This company did help improve my customer service skills along with opening and closing sales on a register.
good,"I love sale associate job and cashier job too. I worked part-time and the rest of my time I study. I worked 15 hours per weeks. I am still working there and at the same time, I am looking for another job after I got my degree in the accounting field."
good,"Retail life, slow throughout the week busy on weekends, summer, or holidays. Messy, rude customers more of a job for the younger crowd. Management wasn't bad though."
good,over worked and under paid. but management was nice and very understanding. i learned im capable of alot more then i thought i could handle. i enjoyed meeting different people.
good,"located in the mall of coop city,it was the first jc penney store in new york city.It was an attraction for not only shoppers who live in the bronx but also shoppers from all the 5 boroughs of new york city.Always busy."
good,"During my time at JCPenney, I made a lot of great friends and built a lot of great relationships with my customers. The work was easy and kept you busy, but it was time for me to move on with my career."
good,"Working for a retail company is always fun and creative. The opportunities are endless. The day goes by quickly while organizing merchandise, assisting customers and having friendly competitions with other sales associates to open credit accounts."
good,JCP is always trying to stay a player in retail. This mean they are always listening to their employees. The problem is the turnover. People leave and come back and leave again ALL the time.
good,"I was a seasonal worker. Therefore, I did not work here long enough to give an adequate review. I worked here for about a month during the end of the year holiday season."
good,Required to be very customer oriented.  Everyone is willing to help each other to get the job accomplished.  Sometimes required to stay very late at night when knowing that I had a full time day job and needed to get home.
good,I enjoyed the work because it was fast paced and involved merchandise that i enjoyed bringing to customers on the sales floor.  We had a great work staff.
good,A topical day at work would be cleaning and cashiering. When i say cleaning i mean folding and picking up the dressing rooms. While working at jcpenny i have learned a lot about retail and the the things that come with it like coupons and returns. Its not an easy job to do but i feel that everyone should experience retail. The only challenging part about this job is nasty customers and how to deal with them. I mean your going to deal with people like that but its always a challenge.
good,was a fun place to work at the time for some extra money.  it will probably close in the near future.  the mall isn't a secure place to work anymore with all the businesses leaving.
good,"A typical day at work was engaging with the customer making sure they could find everything they may need. i learned how to measure for dress suits. Management was pretty cool, but attitudes can get a little out of hand."
good,I worked at JCPenney for more than 15 years and in large part had a good experience. The people were great and the environment was pretty good most of the time.
good,"At the beginning, it was the best job in the world. Great coworkers, understanding managers, etc. But then there was this cutthroat power struggle involving this new lady who wanted to be manager and made life a nightmare for a lot of people. I heard she got fired after I quit though. Nice time."
good,honestly a good place to work unless you are a stocker or in a department that doesn't make much. hours will always be cut and sometimes managers can be a pain.
good,The customer service representatives at JC Penney were very nice. It was a very fun and light-hearted place to work. Management engaged directly with the crew members which made it an enjoyable experience.
good,"Jcpenny is a good place to work when the retail season is in high demand but when the holidays are over, people tend to loose hous and you can not live like that. but unfortunately people do not have the skills to do anything else."
good,JCPenney was overall a good learning experience and a nice working environment. JCPenney was very accepting of all clientele and most workers. This was a very nice place to work.
good,"Very busy work environment, very challenging to get different departments working at the same pace to reach desired goals."
good,"nice clean working  store, management is always helpful. everyone is there to help you, no one get mad at you. this is close to home, the hardest part of the job is, nothing, it is a great place to work. the most enjoyable is your co-workers they all  are nice and helpful,  you learn how to work with one another."
good,I was able to work along side other associates in the shoe department. The store was slightly understaffed which could make the job stressful at busy shopping hours.
good,"I enjoyed my time at JCPenny because they can look at you and know where you would fit in. For me, i never imagine id work in the shoe department. I was the second top seller there and loved helping people and working side by side with my supervisors."
good,I usually just go to my assigned department and begin to put cloths back and recover the area m. The hardest part is dealing with uncooperative customers. The best part is meeting people and making new friends.
good,Worked part-time and carried out my job effectively and efficiently. Was the employee of the year in 2014/2015. Got a lot of credit card applications.
good,"I had a great time working for JCPenny Sephora. I was able to learn  as well educate clients on new products. I had great hours and management was able to work with my school schedule. My typical day would be handling sales, cleaning around the store, restocking product, or helping clients with products. "
good,I was just working customer service so I would have to communicate to customers all day abd help them out with problems they may have and keep a well managed and cleanly store for the customers.
good,"JCPenny is a fast paced job, easy, but hard at times, never slow in the store,. Everything get s messy pretty fast so your never just doing,  nothing."
good,"Good managment "
good,Productive workplace. Family oriented. A typical day at work is steady. The work loads become heavier during peak seasons. When the work increases so does the hours to ensure that merchandise is delivered to the stores in a timely manner.
good,I would love to go back  very great place to be and very great store sales and items are great one thing I can say is they should pay more for all the work we do and get more discounts to
good,"At JC Penney, my day started with a general overlook of the shoe department just picking up loose ends. Twice a week I ran inventory and the other days I made sure everything was priced correctly, stocked and organized properly, and made sure the sales were put up on time. Management instructed if necessary, but most of the time I was left alone to do my work."
good,The Work/Life Balance makes this the ideal workplace.  The organization truly shows care/concern for its associates.  I would recommend and hate that the building is closing leaving many without a job.
good,"There are many departments, and positions, but you usually are in the same area.  Which allows you to specialize in the area to help customers.  Doing fitting rooms is very tedious and overwhelming."
good,Good place to work if you love retail advertising. People are very nice. Very fast paced atmosphere. Very corporate atmosphere with strong value emphasis.
good,I really enjoyed this job.  Management set up competitons between employers to who could get the most customers signed up for the company credit card.
good,I enjoyed working with everyone and I really enjoyed putting outfits together  for the  customers. The thing I didn't like is sometimes the customers were in a bad mood and took it out on you.
good,"Very calm days even when it's busy"
good,JCPenney is wonderfully diverse in it's selection of employees. Management does an awesome job at encouraging and maintaining respect and appreciation within company relations
good,"love working at jcp. hours are short but I works for my schedule. I have learned many things while working there. workplace culture needs some work. the hardest part of the job is dealing with upset customers. the most enjoyable part of the job, the early hours."
good,The environment was warm and friendly and the customers were always pleasant. I also liked the benefit of having an employee discount as a benefit for working there.
good,the workers in the salon were very nice and friendly. They helped out if I needed help.  The enjoyable part is knowing that the customer is satisfied with her hair.  my experience was working there was great.  I was able to take training classes on new things that were happing in the haircare world.
good,"Great fast paced work environment"
good,I loved working in the jewelry department.  I was a neat experience getting to learn about all the different kinds of stones and gold qualities.  I had a great manager.
good,I loved working at jc penny. it was a fun place to work. learned a lot from working there because it was my first job ever. My manager was very nice. would recommend.
good,I had a seasonal position in which I don't feel I was paid unfairly for. I wish my time with JC Penney would have been longer but they hired so many people for the holidays they pretty much let us all go.
good,"From what I could tell, the benefits were amazing, and with my particular position I really liked my colleagues.  I'm not sure how they are doing these days but I felt like the company had promise"
good,It was a fun place to work. I really liked my coworkers and the management. I learned a lot about people and the position I was in. it was slow paced some days and fast paced others.
good,Overall for being just seasonal employment wasn't a bad company to work for at the time. I have even applied to work there again. Retail companies are hard to work for. Don't get a lo of advancement.
good,I really loved working here when i was young. they worked around my school schedule and the management was so nice. Id recommend them to any student who wished to have a nice retail job
good,Keep the store clean through out the week. I learned how to precisely move the clothing racks to make the job more fluent. The management just changed but the new manager seems like he knows how to keep the work space clean and prepared.
good,"The company was a fairly good place to work, if it wasn't for school I would have probably stayed with the company. They were pretty understanding about my desire to go to school."
good,"Every store has different management and leads. How well they communicate defer with every store.I believe if they choose not to get new register and invest in associates, then this will be their downfall"
good,"Everyday it was a fast paced job, I stocked all the shelved in different departments and ticketing sale items and received new inventory. Our manager was very supportive of our work ethic and I always gave the clients the best customer service possible. At times, our store was out of stock for specific items connsumers had seeked for, I did my best to offer a variety of other alternative items. I learned to connect with the customers and still maintain a productive and accurate work flow."
good,Overall  JCPenney is a friendly environment to work in. Working in the salon can be competitive but this industry is about competition. Hours are based on productivity for every stylist so it can be hard for new stylist trying to build a clientele.
good,"Management was approachable, training was thorough. The one thing I think could be improved is the number of employees. I think they were a bit short staffed."
good,"Work/Life balance was non-existent, as well as career advancement. The training was extensive, but was sometimes irrelevant to the job on the floor. The hours for a salaried manager were crazy."
good,The job was good for the most part. There wasn't anything bad about it beside customers being difficult when it came to prices or returns. Co workers were nice and environment was safe.
good,"My managers and co workers were always a delight to work with , honestly wish i didn't have to move away. I LOVED MY JOB. would recommend this job to others, it is a wonderful place to work."
good,it was relaxed clocked in on a computer schedule tells me my break times and I just took calls about orders and tracking packages for customers JCPenney is a pretty quite work enviorment
good,This was a great job. I was mostly able to work on my own without someone looking over my shoulder constantly. I was able to help people who needed glasses.
good,"Again, I haven't worked for JCPENNEY in over 21 years.  Any review I have to make is pointless as the staff and culture will have changed so much that my comments are meaningless.  Again, I want the option to bypass reviewing employers like this."
good,"JCPenny is a good place to start working if you want to get into business because you will meet a lot of people from different backgrounds and work in different departments and learn many tricks of the business. I have also learned patience, and got the courage to stand for what I believe in because it is very easy to get swayed in commercialism and vanity due to exposure to pretty things."
good,"Typical day was either working as cashier or working with Utility Team (they are separate positions, and not guaranteed).  With the Utility team I would build displays, design graphical areas, organize stock and display merchandise etc."
good,"I really like working there but I am part time,  but if I went full time have to wait one year to get insurance only downfall I can see as I need them."
good,The people were always friendly.  Holiday times were very special since that is when most of the money is made.  Schedule was very easy and not very demanding.
good,it was a great place to work and I had a lot of fun...I was young when I worked there and needed to switch careers that is the only reason I left working there
good,"Not consistent in treatment of employees committing same errors.  JCPenney does have a good benefit package.  Ability to choose work schedule, as in four 10 hour days as opposed to five 8 hour days, is a positive also."
good,Good place to work if you are still in high school or college. Although due to not enough hours store is typically a mess. Management expects productivity with less manpower.
good,The work space was very clean and the staff and management was very consistent within their responsibilities throughout the store. The job as a jewelry associate was very calm but there was tons to learn but very manageable.
good,"Its a good temporary job. It used to be a great workplace until everything changed with new management. Meaning, everything was completely changed around and as a part time employee you have no benefits."
good,"Had a fun time working there. Lots of corporate events and busy work. Company is doing pretty bad, so if working there, expect layoffs. Can be cut throat."
good,"I enjoyed working for JCPenney !"
good,"managers were really friendly and would try to relate if you had a problem they wouldn't just leave you they would show you around and train you instead of having someone else showing you how to do everything, they would also give you an option of what department you wanted to be in"
good,It was a very cool temporary job. The pay was weekly . The mangment was very cool and nice . Always letting different people every night . The freight was very easy .
good,Fun but fast paced environment. Can be stressful. The manager is absolutely amazing. Health insurance is terrible. Pay is based on you and what you are willing to do.
good,I enjoyed working with the other stylist they were very helpful and nice and the clientele are nice people they were very dedicated clientele. Not a good place to build clientele because you have to have a certain amount of people in order to keep your job. They like for you to have a certain model clientele in order to work at JCPenneys.
good,"Had some good times, had some not so good times. I started my working experience here and it was a satisfying job. I learned a little here and met life long friends."
good,Great for a seasonal job. Very busy for the holidays very fast pace.. Not something to make a a career out of. Good for a first time job to get your feet wet.
good,Working at JCPennys is very relaxed and customer based. Working on the floor allows a lot of interaction with the customers. Hardest part of the job I would say is learning the point of sale system.
good,"A Crew leader gave me a hard time, and was saying I was messing up on things i did right. I had retail exsperiance in a higher class store and was rewarded with employee of the month. I always take pride in my work. So i was upset that I was accused of doing thing that I did not do on the sales floor. I also got some static from older emplooyees. I don't know if that was their way of tryin to run of temps or what. But other temps made the same complaints to me. I was very surprised because this is hourly pay no commission. Defiantly a first."
good,Always lots to do. I had a very hard time not spending my whole paycheck there with the discount. Excellent place to learn great customer service skills
good,Help keep store clean and assisted customers with their needs and helped customers help find items that they are looking for if not in store than in online.
good,"Meet great people with very different backgrounds, workload is always high. Management could be a little annoying but overall is a good place to work for. Customer service is the main focus recovery at nights could be challenging if there’s not enough staff."
good,The diversity at JCPenney makes it a nice place to learn about different cultures. they provide on going education and they make everyone that wors there comfortable. they are willing to work with you and theyencocurrage self growth. Management can be hard to work with but they sometimes work with you.
good,good store just need to work having more hours for employees. Certain managers don't do their jobs and keep the store close. I experienced  that the store consider customer over employees.
good,It was a great experience working with such wonderful people and had to chance to attain the skills needed for future employment like interacting with clients.
good,Fun work place can be really stressful when you are the only person in your department when it gets busy. On slow nights its pretty boring because all your doing is recovering the floor for most of the shift
good,Part time job I had in college. Good job for students. I unloaded trucks overnight so I didn't have to deal with customers which was a plus. Overall its an okay job.
good,I started this job at the age of 16. It was an experience I will never forget. Working in the home department was kind of boring yet relaxing at the same time. Nevertheless it was a great way for me to build my people person skills.
good,"Liked to work there back in high school, would not recommend it to someone over the age of 19. Good pay for a young kid. Retail just wasnt exactly my thing. But for someone who doesnt mind folding clothes then i would reccomend."
good,Everything and anything you are set to do is easy and self explanatory. Friendly work place. Holidays are super busy but nothing that you can't handle.
good,i loved working at jcpenney. I enjoyed with my team mates and enjoying talking to customers. Everything was very nice and well going. I was pregnant at the time and they were very understanding.
good,"Greet customers. Great customer service. Operate a cash register. Multitask efficiently; operate a register, answer the phone, stock merchandise and sometimes help in other departments."
good,Jc penny warehouse was productive and self-paced. The time went by quickly all we had to do was meet our quota for the day most times we were done early
good,"For students and those who don't know what they want to do for the rest of their lives that do not mind working directly with the public, this was a great job. Great discount on all store goods and you're encouraged to use it to wear their merchandise to work."
good,"At JCPenny, I would just recover the clothes with more of my coworkers. We would start at one area and go around from there. Other times, we'd clean out the fitting rooms by putting all the clothes back. The management was very strict at times but very flexible."
good,Clock in start morning rounds. Observe customers and all employee's monitor cameras. Operate CCTV cameras. It was a clean working and the staff was awesome.
good,They are very friendly and have a good support system and can give good hours. I learned a lot with them being my first job and my first retail job. Hardest part trying to have long hours while still in school. The most enjoyable the employees because they were nice and funny. We were typically busy since we were in the mall and had great sales.
good,I loved working a department that could easily learn about the clothes and prices and how they work I also offers credit credit cards to those who were intrested
good,"I had a lot of sales, pricing, dept policies to remember. I loved working with the general public in helping them find the right style of clothes and prices."
good,Fun place to work except on very busy days because you had to stay until store was put back together and even if that meant working till 3 or 4 am and then hours cut at end of end week.
good,The customer service experience of job is great for persons seeking retail experience with customer service - job training process is super - pay is competitive
good,As a visual merchandiser I definitely gained experience into how a retail store is constantly on the go when it comes to change.  This was especially obvious when it came to the seasonal changes throughout the year.
good,It's a great place to work. I think the only thing that is bad is the communication part. There is some communication but it's not the best. They need to work on it a lot.
good,I hired on as Christmas help and they kept me on the schedule for 10 years.  There were so really good times and I met some great people at work.  This was always a part time position for me but I am a full time JC Penney fan.
good,Can't say too much about this job because I do not like retail.   This was a means to an end after relocating to Arkansas.  Management was motivating and encouraging.
good,"I enjoyed being able to meet people from all around the world working at this store.  It was a challenge at times to work through customer complaints, however i always did my best to make sure the customer left satisfied."
good,"This was a great summer job, especially for teenagers or someone with no work experience. I graduated early, therefore I was available all day so no complaints there. I enjoyed the atmosphere."
good,It was fast paced and really easy dealing with the customers in varies situations. Learning the process of handling different situations and malfunctions was over all good. Training was long and stretched out.
good,"I had a great store to work for in Eau Claire, WI.  Made some good friends and worked hard in the process.  Wish the wages could have been more, but standard for retail."
good,It's a good job to work as a seasonal person to earn money for the meanwhile. They pay alright to standard that they should pay after standing all day.
good,"I learned customer service skills, and typical day like a 9-5 9.00/ hr. "
good,I've gained a lot of experience and knowledge. i was able to obtain call center and high call volume experience. Management could've been more professional but overall management was helpful with guiding and preparing for the work place. Enjoyable part of the job is because of the company worked for.
good,"A typical work day was clocking in and going to department/registers and setting up your work station or grabbing a walkie talkie. Look over your department and see what needed to be done - such as cleaning, restocking, etc. "
good,"I learned customer service skills as well as handling cash registers"
good,flexible hours. decent amount of hours per week. some managers hide in the back and let the associates do all the work. some customers can be a pain. must have patience.
good,JCPenny only gave me part time hours. I made very small commissions when I did work. The higher up management were great. My actually manager was ok could have been better.
good,"Ensured that every order on the line that was worked was accurate, keeping the warehouse clean, picking and packing orders? Loading and unloading trucks"
good,I really liked my job at JCPenney. I was able to work in other areas. I drove a fork lift during my time at JCPenney and I liked going to work every day. Fun place to work
good,The only issue is it's almost mandatory for all employees to work Black Friday. This was a really sweet job the discount was awesome. The managers were great.
good,"Jcpenney has really good management.  They take all of your needs into consideration and really works with your schedule. The worst you would have to deal with is rude customers, but that's with any retail job."
good,Good place for temporary employment in my opinion.   Really easy to learn the way things work. Very cooperative with scheduling . co workers are very helpful and nice .
good,JCP is a great place to work if you need flexibility in scheduling. It is also great if you want to be in a fast-paced environment that is very dynamic in nature.
good,"l enjoyed working at JC Penney, and working with the customers and helping them with their shopping experience.  When customers needed help deciding on which shirt or skirt looks best on them, I felt like I was making their day and helping them smile and make their day a little brighter."
good,At Jcpenny I used to do many different jobs. one of them where loading and unloading the trailers that would take the merchandise to the store. I really liked my schedule.
good,"I worked part time for a few months during the ""Back to school"" Sale. Not much else to say other than I was kept busy. Good enough for me. I worked at a location inside the mall so we always had a theme going for all the seasons."
good,"Productive and competitive place to work. Very good benefits with chances for career guidance and mobility.  Very nice campus in Plano, Texas with covered parking."
good,JC penneys was a very team oriented work place.  Employees were treated fairly and everyone worked together.  JC Penneys has very good work hours and was very flexible with scheduling.
good,"Very good job helps a lot in building a better work experience and becoming a better associate, Was bale to move up in positions really fast, Managers and supervisors recognize good work."
good,"I did like working at Jcpenneys. the atmosphere was nice, fun and clean. However I did not like working those long hours on holidays. I did not like being obligated to work holidays. I also disagreed with some of the policies put in place for workers."
good,You can start as a cashier or sales associate. There are many positions within the store to move up. Store is kept clean and neat. The staff and management are great to work with.
good,"Great place to work and very good experience, nice people and affordable sales. The cool thing about working here, you can use the coupon of the week and also your employee discount when making a personal purchase."
good,JCPenney is a good place to work but they don't give enough hours. Everyone there is very nice and they treat you good. If someone is looking for a part time this is a good place
good,Typical sales associate job in retail. Had a great team to work with. They just didnt cooperate with my school schedule which is the reason I left this company
good,JCP is a very rewarding job you are indirectly dealing with associates making sure their clothing is intact before they go to the stores. Very busy place but productive.
good,It was a good work environment for teens and younger adults. The pay rate could be better. The management and other co workers were nice. When I worked here the registers were very slow and always froze up causing problems and longer waiting lines at the check outs. Now they have updated the registers and changed a few other things that seemed to be problematic. They didn't run sales either when I worked there and a lot of the costumers did not like that. They have changed a lot of issues and seem to work a lot better now.
good,"During the time I worked, it was very busy due to being a seasonal job. I was able to manage all of this due to black Friday and staying for overtime."
good,"had a major bug problem and it had never died down. Manager was unorganized and always had missed lunches also, kept changing hours to benefit only her own more then employees."
good,"Hrs. were ok.the hrs. Varied from week to week. pay wasn""t that great but the atmosphere was veey pleasant.  Worked as a group and independantly a lot. Was given different learning opportunities . A variety of incentives for extra pay."
good,I worked there for the season and it was fun enough I stayed on after the holiday season. I enjoyed working with some great people and making lifetime friends.
good,"JC Penney was a good work experience for me, I had time to grow with the company, and had fun meeting deadlines for other competition. Great boss and very funny co workers. Everybody got along and had no problems working together. Safety was the number one issue making sure the work place is safe. I had great customer service always greeting the customers with a smiling face and ready to work when I get there. So much to do I was never bored. Loved being apart of a team."
good,as a photographer for this company I enjoyed all the smiles and laughs and memories I got to capture for families. My manager was an outstanding person to work for and made work a fun place to be.
good,"I love the people I work with, they are like my second family. Really means a lot when you tend to spend more time in the workplace than your actual home."
good,"A typical day at work involved analyzing and reviewing the data and resolving any issues that arose to complete the task at hand.	"
good,JCPenny builds an atmosphere of cooperation between its various teams. Team participation is highly valued and encouraged strongly with all employees. All employees are respected and none are discriminated against. Personal motivation is strongly encouraged as well.
good,This position will keep you busy throughout the day. A lot of customer interaction and recovery of the sales floor. Co-workers were great so it helped the days go by quicker.
good,I participated in many activities. I did spend many hours on my feet with pretty short breaks. There were times when the there were not enough people to handle the load of people coming in.
good,"I have had two stints with the company, my first as a Cosmetologist and returned to the company as a Salon Manager. The company education and programs along with my work ethic and dedication has allowed me to sustain in this industry for 20+ years."
good,"Here at this company their is definitely a great way to grow , however not much appreciation is shown for going the extra mile on ones work environment."
good,"You are able to get a discount on clothing, and it is a slower work environment. They don't always have a set schedule however they do offer night and weekend shifts for students."
good,Enjoyed assisting the customers in selecting the right outfit for a certain occasion and receiving a pleasant response of Thank you for you help.  The staff and other workers were pleasant work with.
good,"typical retail job, you learn about customer service. nothing out of the ordinary, you get paid minimum wage and work a part time schedule. pretty good store discount"
good,"at this particular job, i assisted customers on the floor that needed help as well as operated the cash register. the job wasn't difficult at all. i also assisted with the dressing rooms"
good,"Hardest part was keeping up with the fitting room cart, management was very flexible with scheduling. Fine for a part-time job. Was on my feet all day."
good,"Get familiar with every department because it helps you to know how to be flexible if needed. This job is really a job for college students who need a little extra money in their pockets or someone who has a primary job. This is not a job you get if you have a high car note or rent. It exposes you to tons of different people. It will also teach you about the area you're working in. How to properly fold clothing, learning about appliances, and why thread count is important. Just stay open minded. They have a great company. Its always an opportunity to branch out or grow within the company."
good,"Nice staff, fun place to work.. Though it is slow-paced, for the time I worked.  Though the general manager is nice, he came across to me as creepy..."
good,"Although it was a more relaxed environment, there was only one person in management that made sure everything was running smoothly throughout the whole store. For anyone who's been there, you know it's a pretty big store. It was hard knowing what to do and where to go when I started because that one and only manager was always busy."
good,"It's a very slow place during the week but the weekends get very crazy and very busy. The management would be on top of it but, it was just a job that helped me pay for school."
good,"It was an interesting place to work, long hours, under staff, unorganized. wrong scheduling. Computers kept freezing, over booked. "
good,I enjoyed my time while I was there. Not a secure place to work though. Very busy and set schedule.  There was hardly any career advancement until recently when the new CEO came on board.
good,"Easy first job, you dont do much other than put away clothes. Long hours standing with uncomfortable shoes because you must always be dressed professionally."
good,a typical day at JCPenny... Your department that you worked in always has to stay straightened and organized - neat and tidy.If didn't have the product in store you contacted different stores to see if they had what the customer needed. Helped out in different departments. Alot of times you worked alone.Cash handling is involved
good,"This is a workplace that is perfect for a high school student or as a second job. The hours are very inconsistent, the work is easy. Very fun environment and employee discount is a plus."
good,"I actually quite enjoyed this job, but the manager who ran the store when I worked there ruined it for me. I was constantly blamed for everything that went wrong in my department even if I wasn't involved. I loved my coworkers & the discount was nice. The manager was eventually relocated due to complaints."
good,"JCP is a pretty good place to work overall for all ages.  They're willing to work around school schedules, etc. Our store managers were exceptional. Friendly atmosphere and great team players."
