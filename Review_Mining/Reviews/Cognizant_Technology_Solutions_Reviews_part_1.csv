rating,review
bad,Poor Compensation. No scope for career growth. Management not willing to give hikes or promotion. No scope to moving into newer technologies. Working hard or not working is the same if you are billed.
bad,"Cognizant is another no talent IT provider who continuously raises many red flags with their questionable hiring practices and treatment of US workers. The entire organizational structure is a total sham and makes zero sense from a business perspective. Management is misleading, unfair, and biased against workers who they are not able to 'bill' the 'client' for. I'm not sure how they even make a profit. They will use you, abuse you, and throw you out when they don't like you anymore. They change the rules and project dates every week and no work ends up being done. Constant yelling and screaming at each other due to the project being a total mess. Extremely unprofessional company and a total nightmare to work with. I wouldn't work for them again if they were the last place around!"
bad,No one will recognise your efforts. If you are in billable then they say ok for everything that you ask. When you come out of the project managers behaves like they don't know you even home manager also behaves the same way. Worst management i have ever seen.
bad,"Company is run by non Americans"
bad,"How cognizant even makes a profit is beyond me, with so many internal and structural changes on a weekly/monthly basis I honestly don't think anyone has any idea what is going on. Management swaps people in with zero experience, then they are gone the next month and someone else takes their place. In the world of IT this makes zero sense as you need to know what the plans are well before starting any work on networks or infrastructure, as things can go bad very fast."
bad,"Hated the culture which was oppressive and made you feel unvalued, they set ridiculous goal and the HR head was a joke!!"
bad,"This place is full of corruption and hypocrisy at every level. Their entire business model is a fraud. Morals and ethics in the workplace are non-existent at cognizant. American workers will be singled out for harassment and abused on a daily basis. They just make things up and change the rules every week so nothing ever gets done and no progress is made on projects. Management does precisely what they criticize employees for doing and take zero responsibility, all while ranting and raving like little children in weekly meetings. Employees will be deprived of basic due process right up until the day they are fired. They are used, abused, and thrown out when they are done with them!"
bad,"I would not recommend Cognizant to any person. This company is awful in every way, shape, and form  typical Indian company that’s ill managed with clueless people."
bad,"The job is pitched by recruiters as a great Temporary job with Permanent possibilities, but that's not true. By company policy they promote Temporary labor to save money on their bottom line. They never offer any employees permanent positions."
bad,"I will always oppose Managed Service Providers. They stack the desk against US workers and are destroying the US economy with outsourcing of good paying IT jobs. Cognizant views employees as the enemy and it shows everyday. They will cheat you out of money on a weekly basis and lie to your face all the way up until the day you are fired (it's not a matter of if but when)"
bad,"Run. Run as fast as you can."
bad,"They just seem to make things up as they go along with no real long term plans or goals. I was there for about 2 years (unfortunately) and we seemed to make zero progress on anything. There is a new problem with management or the so called 'client' on a weekly basis and nobody has any clue how to get anything resolved. Communication between departments is non-existent, often causing frustration and confusion on a daily basis. Would not recommend for an 'MSP' or to work at either!! They will do a massive takeover of your IT department and run it into the ground!! Beware!!"
bad,Acredito que a área que mais precise de ajuste é o RH da cognizant
bad,"With companies like cognizant you have to ask yourself what's the risk/reward there? There's just so much that can go wrong when you outsource all of a companies IT functions it seems like more trouble than it's worth really. The totally biased and Un-American company culture will make you cringe..........."
bad,Would not recommend. It is a sweat shop environment. No employee interaction is allowed. The pay raises are given to the employees blanketed not determining each individual performance. There are no opportunities for growth.
bad,This is a short term employment with constant changes almost on a daily basis. Employees are micromanaged with no room to breathe or the freedom to use the bathroom unless you ask for permission but definitely not on busy call days. Management is young and does not have the knowledge or experience to lead. Team leads are hired right out of training so they are as inexperienced as the employees. No one seems to know what they are doing when employees ask for help. Training does not reflect the job duties entirely as things change on a daily basis. People are constantly absent on a regular basis making more work on those who are present. Hardest part of the job is trying to use 20 different systems scattered all over the place and constant system issues that affect productivity. The enjoyable part is meeting new people and making friends.
bad,"No assurance on on-site, and to crack internal interview it's a big headache, blocking associate for months with out any projects, no good hikes and proper on site opportunities"
bad,"Worst management i ever worked in my life!!!  Liars, unprofessional, unfair treatment, and pay was worse!!!  Run dont walk away from this place.  Not worth the anguish"
bad,If you like a hostile work eviroment full of discrimination this is the place for you.  Manager are coached to make employees uncomfortable so quit. 100 % Attrition Rate. They do this to make room for India Employees who are here on Work VISA's... It's total Sham Gaming the Work Visa System
bad,Employer was not a good work experience. The employer was a micro manager and only seemed concerned with how things looked and not how processes operated. The preceding was in my opinion.
bad,"No so good company for an individual, no job security, Management is not good, rude behaviour from managers. Too much pressure during work."
bad,Very partial in rating employees.They have some Directors in their Chennai office and these People will lick shoes of thier bosses for their personal growth. No credibility in annual rating system.
bad,"Here we go again....cognizant is another outsource company that is killing the American economy and outsourcing millions of hard working American IT jobs. Of course, outsourcing always looks good on paper, but doesn't translate into reality that well. Avoid at all costs, it's simply not worth it......"
bad,"I am going to be heavily biased here but I must stress I can only talk about my time during training. I sincerely wouldn't recommend Cognizant Technology Solutions as an employer to any graduate that is looking for a trustworthy company with organised employees, planning and communications."
bad,This company is not one of the best to work for. The work is slow to come to you. The management don't know what they are doing. I pretty much learned nothing that i didn't already know. The training was non existent.
bad,"Where do I start,"
bad,"I recommend looking for something else.  No one no has a clue what is going on; they make it up as they go.  They go by billable hours so any none productive time such as responding to emails, follow-up, system issues are deducted from your hours.  Management  and team leads only care that you are answering the phones that is all. Payroll good luck I know employees that have submitted there time but, have not received their checks this happens on a regular basis.  Pay close attention to your PTO hours. Seriously if you have another job offer take it and avoid this place it SUCKS!"
bad,"1) No job security"
bad,The managers I work for are horrible people. Stay away from West Point PA. and Release management. Insulted daily for asking questions. Absolutely terrible culture. People are burned out. It's really sad.
bad,"This place is a total dumpster fire. Management is pathetic and can get very hostile towards employees they don't like. Add to that a totally counter productive work culture (no skills needed, you get a good yearly review for simply submitting your timesheet every week!) The work is straight out of a high tech horror movie. Like a high tech sweat shop/call center. They want you to work late nights and weekends with no overtime pay. If they get too many lawsuits they just bring a new CEO in to do cleanup. Im embarrassed that I even worked for them but hey it paid the bills"
bad,"Cognizant is poorly managed and has no interest in doing right by their employees.  Relocation benefits spelled-out in my contract were never awarded to me, nor did the organization cover my travel expenses, as agreed upon when I was hired.  Thus, when I resigned, I had thousands of dollars in credit card to to pay back on my own.  I have no positive feedback for Cognizant."
bad,"A real mess of a company...totally incompetent in all areas"
bad,"FIRST of all, cognizant is not a real IT company. They simply put warm bodies in chairs for staffing purposes when companies outsource their IT departments. They literally pick up employees out of the woods and give them a computer. That's it. No skill set required. Heck, you don't even need a social security number!"
bad,"No confidence in management or leadership"
bad,"Everyday day is a stressful day. management are horrible.you are micro managed throughout the day. Work place culture are bad."
bad,"Unless you are lazy then this is the place for you. "
bad,"The worst company with irresponsible management."
bad,"Cognizant is probably the most corrupt company I have ever worked for...and that's saying a lot. If I could give them a zero rating I would. IT professionals should avoid this company at all costs"
bad,"This job sounds good until you learn that the only way to get promoted is based on who you know, it is very click like environment, the professionalism does not exist."
bad,"The whole structure of the assignment was not well organized. The leads were also contract and admittedly did not know what we were experiencing or what we had to go through to complete a task. The supervisors and instructors did not speak English, it was very broken and difficult to understand. Every time a task was submitted, the quality control always found something wrong with it. There was not a single task submitted by anyone that was considered correct, whether it was or not. It was frustrating to work there."
bad,"Unfortunately, Cognizant outsources to other countries like India and we trained those employees for 2 years just to find out that they stole our jobs.  NOT A GOOD COMPANY."
bad,"In regards to the technology side, reps are exposed to the most horrific images via the internet. Beheadings to child molestation reps have to deal with these images while being stressed by an inexperience management team. This jobs will give you PTSD some experience nightmares, anxiety and depression!"
bad,"Horrible place to work, you are replaceable. Everyday they start training more people, because no one lasts there. It’s just not worth the energy. Better jobs are out there!"
bad,"No accountability"
bad,"Run as far away from this company as you can. They are a horribly managed MSP (managed services provider) who do not value you or the work you do. Once they took over the IT functions of the previous company I was with everything fell apart. The company has literally ground to a stand still while cognizant managers and techs have absolutely no idea what is going on. It's almost as if they have no IT training or experience - at all. Management and HR are a total nightmare to deal with and should all be fired immediately. Constant battles and miscommunication create a toxic work environment nobody should have to work in. The plans change every single day and nothing gets done...cognizant will lie to you, cheat, and manipulate you in every way possible because they don't understand the US labor laws or work culture in America. My direct manager was a total disgrace and alienated everyone in the company. Some of their practices are borderline criminal. Once I found out me and cognizant were not on the same page going forward I left immediately and found a MUCH better IT job. Good luck to whoever is left..."
bad,"Bad on all fronts. Biased management, unfair behavior  with some employees while favoring others. Discrimination based on your nationality. "
bad,Bludy waste Experience never join such bludy company waste of our precious time money everything all that happens there is bludy politics not the work I am suffering lot financially by working there
bad,"Cognizant is one of the worst company to join. No hike, no bonus, no onsite , no promotion"
bad,Management didn’t know anything. NO advancement unless you were a favorite! Didn’t care about their employees. No job stability. Only had a 5 yr contract with Pepsi and there was no guarantee that it would be renewed.
bad,"Every day we were told to go home with out pay a few hours into our schedule because we were not needed.  I was never given a day off that I requested.  Management leaves you terrified to go in everyday. The environment is hostile, however I am still there while looking for another job because I have a family."
bad,Avoid working here at all cost. They never will reimburse your relocation fees and there is no training or skill or career development. High singing bonuses should be a sign that they are desperate for people to work for them because their retention rate is LESS than 50% after 1 year.
bad,"Cognizant is no longer the company that we used to have in the early 2010s."
bad,Management are horrible and do not properly communicate anything. They also have a massive turn over of staff indicating gross ineptitude on the part of site management
bad,"Famous for employee laid off culture.If your project is ramping down & team is unable to put the finance,they will directly give separation from company."
bad,"They hire freshers out of college. Make them work on obselete tech. Do not care of employees. Waste of skill, if one is talented. "
bad,Worked here long ago... not sure whats happening there now. Should be good. Used to be good at that time. .................................. the coffee was bad.
bad,"Terrible company. I was moved to cognizant from another company and from day one cognizant was trying to move my job overseas. After a little over a year my job was finally consolidated to India and I was forced to train someone overseas to take my job. Terrible management, terrible benefits. Basically this company is all about being cheap and cheap is over seas in India unfortunately. I would not recommend anyone to work for this company unless you like no job security, only 2 weeks of time off and other awful benefits."
bad,My job was offshored to India.  The company places you in a redeployment pool were other managers supposedly review your resume for other job openings.  The only job offered was that of a customer service representative which was a 50% cut in pay.  What they fail to tell you in that these positions are currently in the process of also being offshored to India.  They also failed to communicate to me that the company is currently Trade Adjustment Assistance certified which entitles me to retraining and the possibility of extended unemployment benefit.  This company shows a complete disregard for their employees and I would not recommend working there.
bad,Company was very inconsistent. Rarely was there help from supervisor. Not even management knew how to do their jobs. They never followed protocol. Also played favoritism.
bad,"I will Never recommend anyone to join this company. "
bad,Work is incredibly stressful and your role is always changing. Management is terrible and no one has any idea what is going on until last minute. There is no organization within the company and there are major communication gaps between departments. Also Human Resources is completely useless as they do not help employees with any issues they are experiencing. This company does not have standard operating procedures much less understand why they are so important which lead to terrible business practices. Also raises are non-existent. There is no recognition for the work that you do in fact they often try to demote employees and decrease salaries. I would not recommend anyone to work for this company.
bad,"Inkompetente HR, undurchsichtige Firmenpolitik, keine qualifizierten Mitarbeiter..."
bad,"If you work with this company, have kids or a husband, you may as well say goodbye now. If u have anything planned u better makes sure you have it planned around the hours because if you don’t they WILL punish u for missing work. Every time I turned around I was written up. I called 30 min in advance to let them no I would be late, I got written up for telling them that. DO NOT WORK FOR THEM!!!! You are just another number, another slave so managers do not  have to do any work. NONE!"
bad,"Disorganized, Not aligned on anything"
bad,If I could give management NO Stars in this rating I would.  Too many Chiefs getting nothing done.  Management turnover was unreal.  Here today gone tomorrow.   Everything is done through email so nothing is face to face.  They do not care about you personally.  To much confusion!!
bad,The computer would work some days and other days may take a few hours to come up. Attach claims to correct authorization. I didn't learn a whole lot. The management team needs a lot of improvement. The hardest part of the job was not knowing the job due to lack of training. I met a lot of nice people that also shared the same concerns I did about he job. Always unsure if doing the job correctly.
bad,"Leadership is a joke, no skills or education on Management is needed to be a highly compensated employee with a role leading others in this organization."
bad,It is another Indian consulting company with mean Indian managers. Nike was the client when I worked through Cognizant and Indian manager was the worst mean manager I worked with in my whole life. Major workforce consists of Indians on H1B’s without any professionalism talking in Telugu and walking in huge groups at the client site. Worst H1b abuser Indian company in US. Worst job experience of my life!
bad,"There is no organized management,no career growth for freshers. There will be no value for the employees passion,worklife balance. They expect you to work 24/7. Totally worst Experience"
bad,"No culture, no respect for your time, no transparency with management, treated like a number, random layoffs, empty offices. This company has gone downhill in the last year. I would not recommend working here."
bad,Be careful when thinking of working for this company is all I will say. If you just want to make money no matter what the stresses are then your fine. If you actually want to care about what you do and want structure. Look elsewhere. VERY unorganized to be working for such a huge client. Not worth it AT ALL!!!!  This company should be your last choice in the decision making process
bad,"I been with Cognizant for almost couple of years and relocated to almost 4 places all over in US. Never got a hike, never got a promotion. I recently resigned."
bad,Too much of management politics in the company. Not a sustainable company in a longer run. Not good work-life balance. Not a place to explore and learn new skills.
bad,"People have groups based on states as well as languages & promote their own people, outsiders will always suffer. Company focuses more on their own targets & compromises always with Employee's benefits. They have nothing to do with you progress..."
bad,They do not care about their employees. There is no communication. Management is horrible. Training is not sufficient. There were so many errors that I found and no one cared.
bad,"There are no pros to working here; if I could give them ZERO stars I would"
bad,"Very caste and region centric organisation. Truly unprofessional and politically driven..."
bad,One of the worst companys I've ever worked for. They told employee's who worked at the Linthicum office that the contract was for Five-Ten years. They lied about the salary as well and you didn't find out until you received your first paycheck.
bad,"Ils sont un architecte à l'ancienne qui impose de programmer en perl, et qui impose des architectures pourris , je vous conseil pas de choisir cette entreprise , car je me suis auto-former et j'ai réussi ma mission en tant que stagiaire. ils montrent rien du tout . ils partagent pas d'information ."
bad,The pay is horrible and the stress and management of this company is horrendous. Management has no clue what to do and refuses to listen to their employees when asking for feedback. Have to relocate every six months and they do not offer compensation.
bad,"-No promotions (rules changes every year)"
bad,The project I work on for this company is so incredibly mismanaged. I have heard other projects are not as bad. The management team at my project has no idea what they are doing.
bad,This company promise a lot but doesn't do much that workers would enjoy. Working days are long and management just don't take good care enough of employees.
bad,"..Yeah, thats right.. they fool the clients around so much that no one actually realizes what is going on.. the management talks a lot, but bottomline is there are no take aways.. they complicate things, and make it undoable.. and the worse effected are the people actually working on stuff. No one cares what you accomplish when you work here..."
bad,"In the new structure, if you are a CSE there is no career for you. They expect you to bring new business but no commission. there is no new learning and the leadership less care about its employees. When I decide to leave the company, I was offered a counter offer and offered a new job role but after accepting that offer they took revege on me and literally isolated from me being part of the oragization"
bad,"Very bad management, salary is very low, managers are not friendly and not professional. Horrible place to work... working at cognizant is not a good idea"
bad,There are not any opportunities to grow within the company; policies and procedures are outdated. They do not offer a work/life balance at the workplace.
bad,"Very mismanaged.  They accidentally deleted me out of the computer and they tried from Oct 19 to Jan 12 to get me back in.  January 12 was my last day.  I would recommend this place to anyone."
bad,"Cognizant is not a company that you want to be involved with."
bad,Treated everyone like dirt. Wouldn’t recommend working for them. Lied to us many times. Blamed us for things out of our control. I don’t know what else to say besides I wish I would have quit sooner.
bad,"Growth purely depends on the project / client / location / vertical / Horizontal and the time you joined the project. Depends on the aspiration one has for the growth in the company. Most of the managers are aligned to typical life to achieve more. More the money you bring is better the prospect for growth in the company. We can find wide variety of people around. Right from the people who say, I am good with the job I have and need nothing much to the people, who are found online for 22 hours in a day working. Company recognizes everyone based on the manager but not by the individual. Everyone speaks about work at most of the time. Even entertainment is seen as task to finish"
bad,I do not want to provide this information at this time. because information provided to the internet has a way of getting out ever under the best of security.
bad,"Freshers are put on bench for almost an year. "
bad,"have lot of politics inside the company."
bad,I am not sure how I feel about this project. Management has no backbone or acknowledges cultural backgrounds. Highly stressful things change hourly. Tough work little pay and no benefits.
bad,There are not too many opportunities in the organization at this moment.Proper care is not given to the talents.Promotions and Onsite opportunities are very rare
bad,Company gave me a job and five other employees from the Caribbean. Promised us that we would have project and be made full time employees. Well guess what... we didn't get projects and they gave us the boot. I moved from Puerto Rico and I spent a lot of money to relocate and start again in Tampa Fl and those fools just fried us after so many promises. lost of half truths and smokes and mirrors. A lot of people were angry after this. Never going back. Thank you anyway.
bad,"Worst management ever, Has good infrastructural and cab facility but the senior management team is very bad,"
bad,Cognizant used to have a very good work culture but today it has one of the most pathetic work culture in IT industry. Instead of giving importance to work it is more concerned with exams and time in office.
bad,too much uncertainty in the organization at this point in time. people are being threatened to pick up projects are impractical locations and HR is in on this with the management
bad,South Indians are hard working but their politics is what creates the company very difficult for Americans. I was there for sometime and it was atmosphere with back biting all the time.
bad,"Management is not supportive or understanding. "
bad,RUN !!! Do not think twice about applying for this company. In a nut shell this company lied from the beginning. Managers treat you like a metrics or a SLA that needs to be meet instead of a person. Clients are allowed to belittle associates and decide on a personal level who stays and who goes. If the client likes you your good if they don't they get together with your manager to figure out a way to get rid of you nothing is based of knowledge or skills or job performance. When contractual agreements are not being meet management blames associates instead of fixing the problem at a bigger level. They also expect you to work without the proper pay. All upper management does is point fingers ! I had a total of 4 managers and none knew what they where doing. Please don't be fooled by the hoop la you see online this company is bad news !
bad,Poor salary revision. Overall not a good place to work with. It doesn't matter you how you perform. It does matter how the management is screwing you though you been a part of 1st rating.
bad,earlier this company was good. now its going down. no new learning. no flexible hours. management too harsh. no increment. too much of attrition happening
bad,"worst place to work, Nothing new to learn. Management don't support  during escalation. Every one wants to save them self. good for freshers to get experience"
bad,"CTS is a very fun filled, yet learning experience.  Ensuring excellent customer service top clients in top priority.  Ensuring deliverables are met  is top"
bad,"Lot of stress, very little to zero appreciation. Only communication skills matter. Coding skills do not matter. If you are good at MS Word, MS Excel, PPT, Cognizant is the right place for you. If you are good at coding, look elsewehere."
bad,"Despite how ever the higher authority of this organisation is my immediate supervisors are a bunch of people who don't even know the spelling of professional ethics."
bad,"Cognizant is one of the world's leading professional services companies, transforming clients' business, operating and technology models for the digital era. Our unique industry-based, consultative approach helps clients envision, build and run more innovative and efficient businesses."
bad,No future for those whose does not do buttering in this company.No promotion for senior people and no salary hike as compared to other companies.No work life balance and no concern for employee
bad,"No Job Security and performance rating is not done on your work basis but done on the basis how good your relation with your manager."
bad,"Typical day at work was horrible,  emails all day long on what you did wrong . It is not a positive environment. I learned not to work for a company based from India. The hardest park of my job was going in to work everyday knowing i was going to be miserable and had no chance to move forward and excel."
bad,"No Job Security, no job security on this company,you should always make happy your supervisor to get best rating.No need to work just satisfy him and make him smile on every sec while on office and even home."
bad,"Promotions are very hard. Merrit can be manipulated in many ways."
bad,Many promises were made at my interview.  Very few of them actually became reality.  You are all but patted down at the entrance to enter the workplace and you have to keep your personal possessions in a small locker.  You spend more time at the job than with your loved ones and are not allowed to have pictures of them on the shelf you are provided that they consider as a desk.
bad,"No option to choose technology or project , No freedom to learn new things , Very high pressure in projects , Less work life balance, Management is not good to employees"
bad,Very worst work life balance Ever seen.Recruitments without proper project plans.No process adherence.Very vague management and no proper co ordination from top  down .
bad,"Need a job urgently.Cognizant has a very bad management structure."
bad,Poor employee appreciation ethics. Extreme insecurity caused by low amount of time for lay off notice. Uncooperative management and HR personnel. Lot's of difficulties with having my Cobra coverage case initiated and finalized.
bad,"Everything about this company is awful. There is no control over your career and mental stress is high. Avoid at all costs. Stay away, don't apply here."
bad,"Good place to start your career but once you gained experience worst place to stay there.Only manager words are heard no concerns  for associates Worst HR policies only designed to protect Management."
bad,"taking calls for retail chain store back to back calls for your eight hours. Allowed only 1 fifteen minute break, and phones are old and outdated. Supervisors and managers are unorganized, schedules can have you working until midnight. Overheard a supervisor tell an employee not to speak their native language - they do discriminate. Horrible place, no benefits."
bad,"Treating Employee as fools.Not giving career growth and encouraging all sort politics ."
bad,"Not good in any terms."
bad,"Typical day was working on current contracts, leasing follow ups. Assisted General contractors with drawings and clients."
bad,"Ethically challenged organization that severely lacks integrity and honesty.  Executive leadership is strong, middle management group is poor, at best."
bad,"There its always about revenue, not concerned about employee or their aspirations"
bad,"SharePoint Consultant - V 2013, 2010, MOSS 2007, ASP.Net, C#.Net, ADO.Net"
bad,I played a role as Technical Lead and I enjoyed working with lots of different people.
bad,"Work flexibility"
bad,Need to improvise the  Management and Employee Care programmes. 
bad,"Process adopted to have one side gains(only company will have gains not the employees). Higher level (designated) will take the grudges on the lower levels, this is not  viewed by the company.i suggest never join cts."
bad,"Main goal of company is to make money by taking American jobs and shipping it overseas. The process is rushed causing many errors making the customer service experience terrible. HR department is a joke. No telephone numbers and if you so manage to find one you can only leave a voice mail. All done via email and you get a generic email back saying someone will be with you in 8-10 days. Pay is a joke. Constant mistakes and getting it corrected takes weeks. If you get a paper paycheck, you receive it 7-10 days after its due. They don't care about their employees."
bad,"Even if we will work more than 16 hours a day,then too it will left unrecognised"
bad,I worked in this company for almost 8 months.CTS recruited me on H1b for project which they don't have and I lost My H1 transfer.
bad,1) Their DM's have to sell their services to end-client so as to get people on their bench back to work ! They don't do that now (because they say they are a premier company and not a Tier1/Tier2 bodyshop); rather the DM's just sit there hoping that the business will come to them. This is ridiculous and must be changed.
bad,There is no flexibility for employees. Favoritism is big within the company. The systems are always down our just don't work which makes it hard to do your job effectively.
bad,"Cognizant over commits to the customer in order to get the business. Later the onus fells on the employee."
bad,"It has become best to worst. No human value for employees, it is working like big contract firm, not like service company. Your services are required till you are billable, once not you will be thrown out. Company has no plan, vision for future , all are short-term goals."
bad,I'm sorry but I seriously don't have anything good to say about Cognizant except the only ones that could relate to the struggle of working there are the other Social Media Content Moderators and Analysts (PE's).
bad,"Very catty local management. Problems with nepotism. Inconsistant and unfair treatment of employees. Management rarely knows what is going on. Was told HR  Department was in India and the only way we could contact them was via email, as I was going through the process of quitting I learned that we do have an HR dept that is not India, but in Kentucky. Local Mgt are Liars and hide thibg"
bad,"Cognizant is a weird place, too much work, too much stress, you will get the half of the money that you should be getting. Also company has very small goals, they fired me one day before my project ended because they didn't want to pay for the bench period. I felt like it was actually a sad move that shows what cognizant is all about. Look else where, you don't want to be sucked in this circle of contractos."
bad,"Although an hourly employee whose team lead will dock my pay 15 minutes I'm late from break/lunch for a collective 2 minutes throughout the entire day, I have to fill out and submit my time card on my own time. Again, my team lead--as well as others--monitor my time. There's not much advancement to be had in the offices in which I work. Morale is very low while turnover is very high, and not just the hourly employees: 3 team leads and one trainer left for other jobs in the span of 7 months. I've seen less turnover at fast food restaurants."
bad,"Wow, where do I start.  HR was as useful as teats on a boar, utterly useless.  Lied about job being direct hire.  Didn't have a company laptop for first 6 weeks on the job.  Stay away unless prostitution is your only other option."
bad,"This company is full of lies, lies, and more lies. Did not receive annual raise, did not start at hourly wage agreed on. 3 Managers within a year hired, fired or quit, they never promote from within, employees usually leave a note on their desk at lunch and quit."
bad,No support expected to do too much with little resources Management is unprofessional does not know how to manage Manager is too busy running his restaurant and does not have time to manage his day job duties
bad,"Management had no idea how to run a successful call center and engaged in favoritism and nepotism, as well as pitting employees against each other, HR had no concept of confidentiality and regularly leaked private conversations to the general staff.  This created an unhealthy and toxic work environment."
bad,"The management seems to chastise everything you do, and does not provide the opportunity to learn from your mistakes which can be frustrating for someone who continually wants to get better."
bad,"I had good expectations when I was hired by Cognizant. Unfortunately,Cognizant turned out to be just a very bad managed BPO organisation. There was no support by top management, no sense of belonging to a team, few cliques of locals and East European folks in charge of the project on client premises.HR was non existent. No transparency, lies & unfair redundancies:AVOID."
bad,"Indian working culture. Most of the processes are broken. Too many unqualified associates. Top Performers are leaving the company and no one cares. Very bad image out in the market. Leadership doesn’t care. Delivery issues all over the place. No collaboration between countries and regions. Lots of silos, BUs not collaborating with each other. Too big to fail!"
bad,"This company bought TMG Health about two years ago. The culture of the new company is to pay miserably, provide job training not relevant to the actual job. Everything has to be figured out yourself. Help desk for IT is all  Indian. Almost impossible to understand their accents. "
bad,"We are required to work 10 hours mandatory OT per week, then train our replacements in India.  This company is not trustworthy in what they tell us.  We went from nobody will lose their job or they will place us in another job to you don't fit any of the jobs available.  They are getting rid of us slowly, so they don't have 500 TMG employees without a job & going to the Media.  Why are they allowed to move all our US jobs over to India?"
bad,Very negative working environment .Most employees are looking for other jobs. Management staff talk negatively about other employees .Miserable place.
bad,"What the company doesn't like to talk about but which is really true is the fact that the underlying business model for Cognizant rests on taking U.S. jobs and sending them off-shore (mostly to India).  The company can talk all it wants about 'going digital', but in the end the money is made by laying off domestic workers and replacing them with far lower paid overseas employees."
bad,"This is by far the worst place I have ever worked. On my last day I really wanted to punch the manager there....so disgusted. "
bad,Management needs improving.  Do not expect to stay as a permanent employee as they have/will be going over shore.  The hardest part of my job was getting correct answers from anyone.
bad,"I actually enjoy the job, but the management is so inept they cannot even calculate the amount of holidays the team has to take per month in order for everyone to be able to take them."
bad,Needs better leadership and direction.  The consulting group has no structure and I was lied to regarding my role and responsibilities at the time of employment.
bad,"Never join cognizant especially in kolkata as they does not care about employee just clients."
bad,"This company cares about one thing and one thing only, profit. Loyalty, tenure, personal dedication only matter when it leads to continued and growing profits. There is no management structure to speak of as nobody has any idea what anyone else actually does. I held 5 different positions with the company and never got a job description that even remotely resembled what the job ended up being. I was paid roughly 65% of the market value for the position and it was never corrected despite repeated requests. Internal promotion is a joke as they hire from the outside at every level. "
bad,Underpaid and overworked. Definitely wouldnt recommend. aasdfasdfasdfasdcasf qwefawfasfgasfvafafafawfasdcasdcasdfasfvasdcaSDFADFASDVASDCasdfcasfgasdfasdfaDFS
bad,"Remember to ask before you finish offer negotiations, for EVERYTHING you intend to get in your benefit package.  Do not take ""normal corporate benefits"" for granted and assume Cognizant has them.  Cognizant gives to those who ask, at best.  If you expect something, you need to get it in writing that you will get it."
bad,Stay away. Bad company. Toxic culture. Back stabbing and  untying throat environment. Low salary. Unqualified management. A lot of favoritism takes place.
bad,"The mid-level Managers are mostly a mediocre bunch, hired to do timekeeper and class leader duty. Daily work involves repetitive stuff with the managers chasing you to do stuff in 9 hours, that you can positively complete in 2 hours. Going above and beyond what is expected off of you, is not appreciated. I learnt through lots of trials and tribulations at this place that hard and honest work is not appreciated, but will draw the ire of your managers and the people above them. "
bad,"Terrible management, very uncaring and dont have a clue what they're doing. Compensation is not worth the amount of work they make you do. Offered all benefits, but for bad companies and at a high price. Overall, it will slowly kill you inside."
bad,"You will be treated unfairly, not cared about, and your ideas for improvement will go to waste. Management is a joke; don't know what they are doing. This place will make you slowly die inside."
bad,Cognizant has no room for advancement; you are stuck in the same role that you get hired in; regardless of experience; Leaders feel intimidated with people that are more experienced than them
bad,No professionalism at all. Every decision was reactive not proactive. High School tattle tail environment. People with degrees obtained outside the country were stuck doing claims processing. They were wasted.
bad,"The Management doesnt plan for who puts lot of work and make the team grow. No one in the juniors resources were used to build skills, instead using for the Events. None of them improve the technical Skills."
bad,"Slow, lazy environment"
bad,"I wouldn't work there the company expects too much and you skip lunches to do your other assigned duties, Not cool"
bad,"Salary hike is not there."
bad,never join this company. there is no work culture and no professionalism. poor management and no process. false commitment by the hrs. no work life balance.
bad,Daily we have to meet our target.november to February we have huge amount of volume.Every Friday we fun activity and pot luck.we celebrities each and every festival.
bad,"At Cognizant, you are only valued until you get sick.  SLAs mean more to them than your well-being.  Also, in my opinion, their version of ""Service Desk"" is a disorganized call center and upper-management is a joke (you see their true colors after the fact, they stab each other in the back, and do not communicate with one-another), which is why I resigned.  Make sure that you Google the company before you accept a job offer with them."
bad,"Nothing to write good on Cognizant."
bad,"Poor Structure, completely disorganized from top to bottom in management structure. They have one person doing 3 peoples jobs. Compensation is a joke in comparison to the job market. I was specialized beyond the job duties of my work and they took full advantage of it. I worked 70+ hours a week and it took a serious toll on my health and personal life. The entire account I was on needs to be cleaned out and start over. Sadly, they have someone willing to step in an fix the issues and try to make it a better place to work but the stupidity of management will not allow this. Trust me, you'd be happier working a retail job or dare I say a Wells Fargo than this awful place. Do not accept any positions within the Insurance Accounts with this company..Poor stability and incompetent team leads and managers who are under qualified to be doing the job. Literally every employee they hire is undependable or becomes depressed and just stops showing up. HEAVY MICRO MANAGEMENT from people who don't know how to manage"
bad,"No Work life balance, We are treated like manager's Slave. Expected to work in personal time, weekend, At the end  of the year if project changed due to ramp down will rated extremely bad"
bad,"Complete waste of time for professional workers."
bad,"Not a good place of work for the people with talent & Knowledge...."
bad,I accepted a position w/ Cognizant due to my office closing. My position with the company was poorly represented. I would never go back under any circ
bad,"If you are uneducated, dishonest, are a brown nose, have no respect for yourself or others, enjoy micro-managing people, have no business being employed in your position, are arrogant at work (while outside in the real world you are a loser), like to use your position to bully and intimidate others, have no interpersonal communications skills, will sell your soul hoping to climb an imaginary corporate ladder and have the personality and mannerism of a mosquito, you would fit the criteria needed to be a trainer, TL or hold a management position at Cognizant.  If you enjoy feeling uncomfortable, being criticized, lied to, working with no proper training, making $1 over minimum wage with no benefits, being discriminated against, feeling threatened and made to feel like a dog, this is the job for you."
bad,"some projects are misfit for roles."
bad,"Disorganized management, lack of client focus, misalignment on staffing, no bench management, zero opportunity for growth, 100% virtual without any network integration for new hires, no consistent path for promotion."
bad,"I’ve worked there just recently two years, management is all over the place. Their expectations aren’t rational due to the lack of clarification for PEs to properly do their job."
bad,"No recomendable, no es un buen ambiente, te exigen mucho por poco que te dan"
bad,Stay away. They under pay you and they do not supply you with the proper resources to successfully complete your job depending on how new your project is. There are always system issues.
bad,"The managers created an atmosphere of dishonesty and bullying. Steer clear!! They use shady business practices, such as having hourly employees work off the clock."
bad,They are a bunch of hypocrites and back stabbers. They smile in your face and constantly talk about each others behind their backs. All they do is gossip gossip. They just simply don’t practice what they preach.  They hate their contractors because they make more money than they do.
bad,Run run as fast. As you can. This company is the worst that I have ever worked for They think of themselves and not the employees. I have worked for the company they bought out and they turned it into heck.
bad,My experience has been a nightmare. There does not seem to be one person in upper management who actually has a good idea to improve anything. They treat their hardest working employees like garbage. Then after treating them like garbage turn around and still ask for those same employees to go above and beyond. It's sad. I have never been exposed to incompetence that was this deeply rooted. If you are reviewing content and see something that is disturbing (which you will......every......single.......day) I really hope you're able to work past those feelings with a generous 9 minute wiggle window you are given. For the amount of horrid things I have seen there this job is not worth it. With the management that is behind the scene it just becomes unhealthy.
bad,I found Cognizant treated their employees well only if they were filling a desired position with a client. They also talked very poorly to the employees that were H1B. They did not care about what we wanted and would tell us that.
bad,"There is a hiring spurt because people are quitting here in Teaneck - most of the core jobs are being filled by H1B visa people on temporary visas (from a certain country) or many of the jobs are being outsourced to India.   "
bad,Poor management.  Change of management team was constant and roles were completely all over the board.  No structure and misuse of talent as well as efforts to appropriately provide a sense of security in the work place.
bad,"I did not sign up to work for this company. But they and my previous company came to an agreement, to essentially sell our branch out. Which honestly killed any potential career growth within my old company, and turned and growth with the new company into a dead end job. So thanks for that."
bad,"Management does not support young families, frowns upon you putting your family first.  Culture is demoralizing, and the morale is low for this company."
bad,Company has a high standard which is impossible to reach. Company requires you to have 98% correct accuracy when monitoring content and there is no room for a mistake. You will be given a 2 warren of not meeting the goal of 98% correct accuracy and will be terminated after that. There is no job security with this company and people get terminated usually after the 90 days probation period of being on the floor. Rules pertaining to monitoring the content constantly change and you are still responsible for maintainig 98% correct accuracy. I do not recommend this company specially if you need a job security.
bad,Very unprofessional. Biased. I had issues with my manager and they took a biased decision on the issue which I didn't like it personally. It is only my perception though.
bad,"The work day is not very strenuous. Your job consists of viewing social media posts (photos, videos, and text comments/posts) that are reported for potential abuse and determining whether or not they violate the policies for acceptable content."
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for. You are only a number to them. A robotic number is how we referred to us. The bathroom facilities are absolutely disgusting. There are only 3 stalls in the women's bathroom so you spend a good amount of time waiting. The amount of people who do no wash their hands. The break room does not have a big enough refrigerator to hold the amount of people, some have to keep a padlock on the lunch box to stop people from taking food out of the lunch boxes. You are not allowed to have your cell phone on the floor, must be kept in your locker. So if there is a family emergency it's hard for someone to get ahold of you because they have to get ahold of a managers phone first and then they will relate a message to you. They ask for our opinions and how to make it a better place to work since attendance is a big issue, turn over is a big issue. When we discuss the concerns on the floor and suggestions from discussion with our peers on how to make it better, ore enjoyable to want to come to work, nothing get done with any of it."
bad,organization is on downhill for last 1 year. management is totally clueless and that for a company working in business to supply cheap labor to multinationals to do the IT related work.
bad,"Horrible management. Horrible workplace. Does not pay on time. Sends checks to wrong addresses..........,..............................................."
bad,No place for someone looking to go ahead in there career. Promotion are only for who can be a managers pet. technical knowledge is zero with managers .
bad,"What a company! Talk about getting an IT job that has you doing everything but IT. It's not a good company to work for, management says they care but actions speak otherwise. "
bad,"great potential, little reward, work and life balance is non existent, no job security whatsoever, management is what you would expect in an environment like this."
bad,"Extreme workload, 0 work-life balance, extremelu poor quality managment. No advance planning from leads and managers about work, and always over-burdened withwork. Behavior of Team leads, managers and senior management is extremely poor, they directly threaten to throw out of job, giving poor ratings, and 0 support. 0 job security. No career growth, no future. Employee needs to work like anything for years, min 5 yrs before expecting any promotion. Overall not a suitable place to work."
bad,Been with the company for a while and I have seen some many restructuring changes with no succes of getting things fixed. There is a great lack communication on all levels . One of the most frustrating parts of management is that you are thrown in many directs just to get any kind of answer. Not one person can truly tell you what is expected of them and there's a feeling of always being in fire drill mode. Great efforts are rewarded with backlash and bad reviews.
bad,I've been with the company for less than a year. They brought about 200 new employees on for a new contract they just started. The management sucks and the staff is quitting left and right as if they know something we don't. There is little organization and even less structure. There is a lack of communicating and an abundance of misinformation. I feel like I'm on a sinking ship.
bad,"i rejoined cts but same dissapointment.high level politics,no job satisfaction.my suggestion never join cts .now a days going through very bad phase..."
bad,Not a very great place to work if you want to advance your career. To much hierarchy and operational inefficiencies. There is no proper performance management system too
bad,I have joined this organization in the month of November. As per the current scenarios there is no job security over there also the managment is not supporting at all
bad,Cognizant is no different than the other IT service vendors. Work satisfaction is average since it depends  suitable project availability which in turn depends upon luck. No one makes an effort of skill mapping with project allocation for employee satisfaction. Do not expect any support from management or immediate managers as everyone is only looking after their own benefit.  Sycophancy and nepotism is ruining the workplace culture.
bad,"Overall performance of the company has come down hard on the employees, The rating and incentive structure was not upto the mark this year. Not gone too well for many."
bad,"They treat you like slaves, no work life balance especially at Coimbatore location. It does not feel like working in an MNC, work culture is bad. More & more stringent measures like time at office, certifications are brought in..."
bad,Big politics happens at every level.  Everyone trying to get promotion will try to do many account level activities and will try to put his leg above you to get his growth.  Please avoid such company at any cost.
bad,"This is an extremely poor Company to work for, ""blame culture"" mentality coupled with lack of support makes for a poor working environment"
bad,This is by far the worst company that I have ever seen.  Everything is a disorganized mess and you can't get an answer or resolution from anyone.  The travel reimbursement process is outrageous.  You have to use your own credit cards for travel.  The expenses often take more than 30 days to be reimbursed.  You really don't have a manager.  Everyone is a free agent.  All they care about is sales.
bad,"I had worked in the field of Mainframes for an insurance company in United states. "
bad,"No career growth in Cognizant if you join onsite. You have to be absolutely non-performer and expert in making good relations with managers outside work to see any career growth. Despite being a technology service company, there is no place for technical people. Stay away with any Indian IT services company."
bad,"I worked with Cognizant for a year, and leaving has been the best thing. The people on your team is what keeps you going on a day to day basis. Other than that management are atrocious to deal with. It is  hard to deal with any of them as they're all in cliques. The HR department might as well be non-existent as they never get back to you. There are little to no benefits also and the money really isn't worth the unnecessary stress."
bad,"Poor Management and no work/life balance. You will be disrespected if you are female."
bad,A lot of work for low pay. Was hired through ReqRoute as a contractor for $13 an hour. Required to use multiple systems to obtain the information on each claim and use a tracking tool for productivity purposes. Not my ideal job by any means.
bad,"Racist management. A lot of disorganization and people not qualified for their jobs but hired because of their color. They will openly disrespect you and treat you like you are not human, use you for your skill and never appreciate or acknowledge you. If you are a person of color with a brain and good work ethic you will not be good enough for them"
bad,not a good place. Lot of work preseeure.No leaves granting. Saturdays also working. No project release. No promotion. No salary hikes. Worst managers.
bad,This place is horrible to work for.  Hostile work environment from upper management down.  Poor communication.  They will straight out lie to cover themselves.  Do not work here.
bad,I can't describe in words. After 17 years if someone decided to move on anyone can understand how many reasons will be there. From your team lead to higher management they make sure that you are not happy. Very very bad immigration team.
bad,"The management is so weak. The manager does not know how to manage. The HR always smile and very unreliable. Whenever being asked important questions from employees, rarely provide correct answer. And sometimes might be angry and tried to get revenge back with employees."
bad,Their biggest concern is billing and do not care if you are a high performer as long as you are a billable resource. Management takes no interest into what is actually being done for the clients.
bad,"Pretty much a tier 3 shop and a big no no for some one coming from a top tier b school."
bad,"Moja przygoda w Cognizancie w Krakowie trwala tylko 6 miesiecy i dziwie sie ze tyle wytrzymalam. Bylam bardzo rozczarowana, bo slyszalam niby dobre opinie o tej firmie a juz na samym poczatku zostalam oklamana przez HR'y w sprawie wynagrodzenia i innych ""benefitow"" w firmie. Odpowiedzialam na 30 maili z firmy jeszcze zanim przyszlam do pracy. W biurze na Wielickiej jest koszmarnie brudno i wszyscy maja to gdzies, kuchnia i lazienka wygladaja jak chlew. Na badga czekalam ponad miesiac, wiec kazde wejscie/wyjscie z firmy laczylo sie z czekaniem pod drzwiami az ktos mi nie otworzyl, reguly pracy - brak. Zdawkowe szkolenie wstepne bez informacji o firmie i sposobie jej dzialania (szkolenie to zostalo przeprowadzone miesiac po rozpoczeciu pracy). Nikt tak na prawde nie wie co jest poprawne a co nie, team leaderzy zgarniaja kase, ale jesli jest cos co zrobienia to umywaja rece. Kazdy robi to co chce a potem wielkie narzekanie na wyniki. Co chwile szukaja pracownikow, bo ciagle ktos odchodzi, HR'y nie sa w stanie przekazac najwazniejszych (i podstawowych) informacji nowym kandydatom. Nie ma mozliwosci awansu, nie ma szkolen a kazdy pomysl usprawnienia lub ulatwienia pracy jest ""olewany"". Nie polecam."
bad,Cognizant Dont promote within the company. There is not any communication from managers to associates. high turn over rate is huge. I have went through 6 supervisors in less than 2 years.  Unorganized company
bad,Cognizant has a work structure that is based around numbers. They really don't take the time to spend getting to know their employees outside of reports and other number based means.
bad,"This company is full of big egos and politics. The only employees who get promoted are those who are friends/related to leadership. Condescending management and high attrition rate. Coworkers are amazing, leaders lack in making work enjoyable."
bad,There is no structure with this company they don't know much about the healthcare side of business and it is very stressful working in an environment that does not give you all the resources you need to be able to full fill your job duties.
bad,"Worked here for 5+ years. Each project I was on was terribly managed. No one knows what they are doing and honestly, you will not be provided any room to grow our advance your career. Very cookie cutter and the cookie is not even good!"
bad,"If you are not from India you are placed on bench without getting a new project. Another words you are fired for not being Indian. Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes."
bad,Worst management ever.  Run away.  This was the worst professional experience ever.  Leadership NEVER has your back ever.  If you wish to excel stay away.
bad,"Company growing, no plan though, inexperienced management.   Company has no plan nor direction.  They do not treat overseas employees very well when they are transferred to the USA."
bad,there is no work culture. Lot of biased towards South indian region. Join only if this is the last option.However benefits are comparable to other organizations.
bad,"The management of my project was difficult to deal with, pretentious, lack the ability to lead and always was on the search for a scapegoat. "
bad,"It was a new experience, as this was my first job. I was able to mould my self as a working women from a student. A place where you can find too many people like you and make a lot of friends."
bad,There is no job security at this place of business. I've had several anxiety attacks and panic attacks at this job. management loves to play retaliation games by putting you on a performance improvement plan that will come back and bite you in the tail. Their scoring of your work is heinous at best. I wouldn't recommend a high school graduate that is trying to start their work career here or homeless person as well.
bad,Individuals are incentivized to work alone and back stab others to promote themselves through the organization . Fellow workers will try to get other workers fired in order to make themselves look good.
bad,Need to focus on employee satisfaction. There are no clear roles or responsibility. No culture to reward good performance. Everyone trying to shy away from work due to the environment.
bad,"1.Not validated the skills "
bad,"they need to provide a work from home option at least 10 days per month . its very tough to handle work as well as home.its based on team now. layoff is not happening based on non performing resource , telling silly reasons to layoff the peoples."
bad,Company give many learning programs but don't get time to attend those programs. Hence nothing to learn. Management plays lots of politics and no HRs are involved in IJPs
bad,"no importance to associates who are working, they need only deliverables and managers are ready to kill to get the work from associate."
bad,"Better place to start but no big opportunities, management is ok and no great exposure. Most enjoyable part if that if you have friends you will enjoy the project that you stay in"
bad,"Steals jobs from the US to ship to India, and makes employees feel they are not valued. High stress environment because you never know if you're job will be the next to be sent to another country. HR and Payroll are impossible to deal with as there is no one to talk to in person, you have to email someone in India who takes more than 24 hours to respond. I would never recommend this company to anyone. They do not value their employees at all."
bad,Too much of dirty politics which makes work culture really bad. Guess this happens in my unit. The case may not be so bad at other places.
bad,"Not a good one. Un-organized, no commitment from company to any employees."
bad,Under Internal Information Technology Integrated Service project
bad,"My advice I worked there for almost 11 years, I received a raise of $1.50 in that time frame. People that were hired after me, made more than I did. My work load"
bad,The job is easy. The management act like high schoolers. The company that does the hiring for Cognizant is unreliable. They tend to mess up your pay on a more the frequent basis.
bad,Communication from site managers to those at the bottom is horrible. No one knows anything. If you’re lucky you might get a great team lead. Great benefits
bad,"Wasn’t as expected."
bad,"Tech and Non tech people works hard and equal. Can learn a lot technically if interested more. Could learn to struggle."
bad,"Poor leadership skills, High favoritism environment. Your Job will be threatened daily. Filthy work environment bed bugs in office along with cockroaches"
bad,"Do your homework regarding management."
bad,"If you are looking to rise in a company, this is not the place. Instead of promoting from within, they hire outside of the company. They hire people with no medical or claims experience."
bad,"This company is a massive bureaucratic machine. With no interest in employee well being beyond the bare minimum required by the law. Even then if they can get away with treating you worse they will. "
bad,"The company is unethical with an HR department that is not tangible. Promotions are not based on work ethic. The worst management endured in years. All decisions based on the dept as a whole are not logical. Its so called open door policy, when speaking out against something, will result in you being chastised, targeted and ultimately fired by those in charge, My site in particular was treated like step child. Colleagues have experienced missing pay, The company handbook is only recognized when benefiting management. Rules and regulations to employers are unstable and ever changing. I could produce a book to the EEOC in regards to my experience here. This company, at my site in particular, is ghetto, tacky and unorganized. While the job tasks were indeed simple, the environment and things mentioned above allowed this job to be stressful and unorthodox."
bad,This job is so stressful in retrospect. Management knows the high stress people are under and makes the job even harder. They do not support or defend employees.
bad,Not all worth working.. They just employee people transfer from.process to another and throw them one day.. Ask to forcefully resign.....................
bad,shady  operation managers blackmailed one another ops mangers to fire certain classes all at once for no reason. some even left Bec cause they felt it was wrong to do. always had new team leaders never was stable on who was in charge or who were yr bosses. gave bs  excuses as to why random people had to be fired. they literally had no care about their employees . then when people needed unemployment due to performance they made reasons up about how their attendance was the issue which was a lie for about 15 people who were terminated.
bad,"No good increment in the company.    "
bad,Would never recommend this company to anyone or even think of going back to work for them. Typical IT consulting firm. Hardly does anything interesting.
bad,I would sit and review billing so doctors can receive payment for diagnosis and test given to patient.  I learned how doctors get paid and that procedure codes and medical procedures must be accurate.  The management had an atmosphere of goofing around and making people laugh.  the workplace culture was like a party campus during the winter break.  Hardest part of the job trying to read all of the meticulous codes .
bad,"During orientation the HR team will make you feel that you have just been hired to this magnificent company. WRONG!!! Once you hit the production floor everything changes. From the horrible management team to the constant policy changes to the unrelenting disappointment of fellow co-workers this job will stress you out more than necessary. The sad part about is that the job is fine, but the managers are terrible. I would not recommend this job to anyone that is looking for a career. However, if you need a quick check or job for a while this is the place. The only people who have job security are those in upper management. Worst job I have ever had."
bad,"•	Facilitated one-to-one interviews, meetings and workshops with internal and external stakeholders to gather requirements"
bad,"Managers tend to overwork the good employees while letting others slide by only doing the bare minimum. Then, we have to finish their work, and fix all their mistakes on top of our already large workload."
bad,Not a good company to work for as an American.  Horrible culture. Company expects you to move across country after each assignment.  Co-workers will not speak in English in front of you.
bad,"The male India people treat us citizens on us grounds like they treat women in India, not appropriate here in the states, harassment training should be a requirement."
bad,"Management is worse, they have no care for employees health or employees condition. Without considering the employees, they make them work like anything and ask them shift anywhere without any regard for them."
bad,"*Good Management"
bad,good place to work with. Managed  around 20 members with high efficiency and did both management and technical work effectively. played a delivery manager role pretty effectively and learned and exceled both in project management  and technical activities.
bad,"No Job Security, Mostly Tamil people management they don't have idea what to do. just politics will play major role, just remove most of the higher tamil people company will be in a good position."
bad,"In this company, you will find no value for innovation,hard-work and exceptional skills. Micro management culture of the leadership team will make seasoned professionals run away from this place. They will offer bonus component in the annual package but you will never achieve their benchmarks. Rather they will make sure you will never get the required scores in performance review to become eligible for the bonuses. They boast about diversity hiring and promote hiring of citizens. However their attitude towards the US citizens after the hire is pathetic. They discriminate US citizens and they don't last longer in their roles. I won't recommend this company unless you have no other options."
bad,"Management states diverse and unified but stays insecular all the time, favours people of one particular state has has more regional affection of work place. HR aligns you into projects irrespective of your specified experience stack into irrelevant technologies and expect you to work over labour."
bad,"Do not work here.  They use you like a paper towel.  Free parking.  Some nice co-workers.  Downtown location.  Good restaurants nearby."
bad,"Joined as an associate for a process, however that process was shut down and move to 3 different process. The salary they offer was very good, but the work life balance is very bad and even the management. "
bad,"Work day was pretty much the same as with Supervalu. Eventually Supervalu was sold to a new company so there was no more work. I was given the opportunity to travel to New York to learn a new job. I really enjoyed learning collections for a high end company, I was able to work from home with little supervision. I felt I did a great job, my collections increased each month. I loved my job! But then it was outsourced again and so now I am unemployed. I was not told in a professional manner and the communication with Cognizant was very poor. I have never worked for a company like this. The management is very poor."
bad,"The company offers great benefits, the assignments I've been placed on are easy, after you sift through the complexity of the explanations/examples given."
bad,"I worked as Salesforce tech support. I received no formal training and it was encouraged to work extra hours, though your breaks and lunch hour and you were not paid for it. I was also told to do all my research/ learning at home. Intimidation and threats were common on a daily basis. No one would help you with questions."
bad,The evrionmebt was so negative; it was like walking into high school all over again. Management didn’t care about big picture things and people who should have been let go long ago were running things.
bad,"The culture at Cognizant is not one that considers their employees. Despite what they advertise, all they care about is the bottom line, regardless of the affect it has the people actually working."
bad,"Most of management will put a target on your back. “If you have integrity,honest or actually care about your coworkers.  You should look somewhere else to work You can get fire by not wearing your badge to work four times but not get fire for getting “caught “ having  coitus in the “ tranquility room “ . Managers can get brought to HR for harassing co-workers “sexually” and still work there but if a SME is found helping one of their co-works to get them training they need “required” to  maintain metrics to meet company goals that SME will be targeted by leadership. A team manager breaks agent works accommodation. People getting high in the bathroom or parking lot.Also if you keep and maintain a high accuracy score you will be accused of cheating one of the three will follow .  Now it doesn’t matter If you and you co-worker that seat next to each other have the “same” accuracy score you would get accused of cheating.Leadership will do one of three things 1.) move you seats while placing a target on your back . 2.) If you are one of the  SME’s  they will send you back to training. Now if you pass that with 97 percent or higher  , you will be fired for cheating. 3.) Change you shifts without you agreeing and they will still send you to your next shift with a target on your back.  The most insane part about people getting fire that actually  care about the company accuracy at a 80 something percent. The company is suppose to be at a 98 percent.SME and agents that had have high accuracy was terminated but some of QA accuracy is at 70 percent . "
bad,"It is like body shopping company, if you are billable you can stay otherwise you will be let go.I worked wit this company for 7 years mostly in client side."
bad,Its a good place to work but only if the managers are supportive and friendly. working at cognizant is not job secure and rest everything looks good. an associate is required to work based on managers sayings.
bad,"A typical day at work would be executing test scripts and validating backend logs and making sure the services are working as expected. "
bad,"Usually you will find projects with support and testing."
bad,"The place is pathetic, with illogical decision by higher management and mid level management. Working resources are made to work hard, but the people buttering the management are given promotions"
bad,"If you are favorite person of your manager, it will be heaven. Else its ok until and unless you stop buttering or earn yourself in the hitlist of manager. Senior management will take survey and does nothing. They have big mouth about policy, ethics etc etc but if even if you see your manager doing unethical work or policy violation, don't raise your voice as at the end you will be the victim."
bad,"* multiple managers --- all giving contradictory orders"
bad,Management only cares about the metrics instead of the quality of work. Offshore co-workers are sub-par at best. Management has no interest in making them better because they are cheap labor and help the company’s bottom line.
bad,Very unprofessional and the director called us Monkies. No respect or stability. Very chaotic. The pay was good and so was the benefits. Expected more from the company.
bad,"Managers should be more apt to train and encourage. "
bad,"Overall I love my job and working with different people, and the travel opportunity, however, microagreassion, bias, gasligthing is  a big part of my work experience on a daily basis with my management team. I did reach out to the resources (e.g HR) available to me, but no response or support received. To survive here, you need to be of a certain race/culture and have connections on the executive level. Cognizant needs to work on being a more supportive company, holding the their executives to managers accountable for their interaction with the staff and lack support, communication and support."
bad,"Your position is not guaranteed. You are given extremely short notice of your position ending (days notice) and left scrambling to find another spot in the company or another job in general. Before cognizant took over, TMG was a good place to work."
bad,"This company promises the world and gives you nothing. Out sourcing all work to India leaving 100s without work, nothing but a disaster. Dont waste your time!"
bad,"It is a work place with full of politics. Andhra, Tamilian, Bengali lobbies exist. If you are a lobby member then you will get good long term project at offshore or onsite. Onsite account management doesn't care about the employees nor even involved in the employee's placement. One will never find right resources with right technical skills in the right projects."
bad,"I cannot speak for the entire organization. I can only speak for the social media project. This is probably the most frustrating job I have ever had. The mission of the project--amazing. The work being done--phenomenal. The front-line people--outstanding. But when it comes to management, it is a horrible mess. The site leader is as ambiguous as he is distant from the leaders he has in his organization. He only takes one person's input and protects her with a passion that makes his other leaders feel insecure and voiceless. In the time I have been with CTS, I have had 2 coaching and development sessions. It's a mess...we could be great but our senior leader is impeding that greatness and contradicting it with every move he makes."
bad,"You have very little control of your work. Frequent location changes and sub-par work culture. The compensation vs work load is out of proportion. Benefits used to good, but not anymore"
bad,"I have not been at the company very long but it is terrible , you are literally under a microscope and they seem to be a little prejudice. You are afraid to tell management because you don’t want to be fired which is sad."
bad,The Management and workrole assignment is very poor. Employees interested in Particular domain is specifically assigned to different domains and Employees in particular location is specially assigned to different work location rather than the nearest location. This drastically reduces the effectiveness of work since employees dont have job satisfaction and also get more work pressure. We get paid for working 8-9 hrs but many have to stay behind and work more than 12-14 hours.
bad,is not willing to stand up for it's employees when client is being unreasonable and has extreme demands.  company has no problem lying to it's employees face one minute and firing them the next minute.
bad,"They gave my job to an H1B from India. When a project ends, you have five weeks to find another or they terminate you. You're expected to move to a new project every two years. They only care about the ""offshore"" team in India."
bad,The company will keep having problems with payroll not getting paid on the pay day as schedule and then wait sometime 1 week or two. The manager of the Amgen project is terrible and has no manager skills.
bad,"I have joined CTS 3 years. Since then company opted lot of changes in its policies which I don't feel in favour of employees of Cognizant. "
bad,"Our company was purchased by Cognizant and in the time since being taken over there is no teamwork since most all resources have been laid off (2017) or benched as they call it.  Now resources are stretched thin and only a few know how things work.  "
bad,very bureaucratic. Lot of office politics. good brand name. extremely fast growing company. The job satisfaction depends completely on project you are working on
bad,Management is ethnically motivated.  Not fair to American born employees.  No patience despite language barrier.  Expectations are unreal.  Google reviews are true.
bad,"Very unprofessional. procedures are always changing and quality gets updated before the reps, so you get bad marks for things you don't know have changed yet. It feels like they set you up for failure. All management sees is numbers."
bad,"Cognizant pays well for an entry level position, but does little else that is attractive for a young professional. There is almost no opportunity for career growth. The company is over 90% Indian in most locations, so if you are not Indian you are culturally left out. The work I was asked to do is something I could teach my 13 year old sister to do, if I had any work at all. From November 2016 through the middle of January 2017 I had no work assignments. None. I went to work and sat at my desk for 8 hours before going home. This is a dead end job"
bad,"A decent place to work with good job security, the real problem is the pay, and hikes , you end up writing an insane amount of appraisal documentation to just get 1% hike"
bad,"They do not care about you. If you even think about speaking your mind on how to fix something or speak against management, you might as well quit, because they WILL fire you. Everyone at this location is related or are long time friends. Mom & son work in HR. There’s an entire chain of the same last name working at the company in high up positions, they are IN FACT ALL RELATED. It’s be in your best interest to stay away from this place. NO ROOM for growth."
bad,"I was working at cognizant for about 8 months. We got a new manager and everyone did not like him. He wanted everyone to work 95% of the time with only 5% of unproductive time, can you say that's a little unreasonable? I got 'trained' on 3 different work types, there training is terrible. We had a QA who checked all the quality and made sure people were doing their jobs correctly. You probably think they got paid pretty well? not really, the QA only got paid 12 an hour while new hires doing the bare min. got paid 13. in a span of 2 months we had 3 team leads quit with a lot of other team members quitting. "
bad,"Great salary. Entirely too much information in a timed environment."
bad,"learn how to not have a heart."
bad,Cognizant is not what it used to be. Practically very slow growth. It's for those who want a relaxed life or are incapable. Smart freshers dont stay for long. Two years is the best you should stay otherwise be prepared for a very average life.
bad,"Large company with over 200,000 employees. Very different environment involving offshore delivery teams. High turnover rate. I was at this employer for 1 year and the management structure completely changed from director, assistant manager, teams leads, all the way to associates."
bad,"Your career solely depends on your manager. "
bad,completely discriminated against.  don't work for Indian management - toxic culture - undermined my career potential - HR is toxic - this company runs an organized crime ring - lots of modern slavery in India
bad,I would never work at this company again... Very unprofessional... No leadership.... No appreciation.... Not enough training.... Short breaks and they make you do company related things on your breaks... They don't know how to communicate with their employees.
bad,"Awful place to work. Loved my fellow co workers,  but the management would micro manage everything about your day including the amount of time spent using the restroom. There is no work life balance as they force you to participate in a sitewide shift bid every few months.  If you have FMLA, you will be openly punished for using it. They will make sure you know that you can be replaced."
bad,"The manager is not good. Lack of management skill. No discipline. Don't understand human. Even the appointment time, also can not be on time as arranged."
bad,"a typical day at work starts with getting your work for the day from leads."
bad,"bad place place to work, very bad management training was very bad, unstable work place no promise in long term work all contracted work not a work friendly place"
bad,"This is body shopping company, the management that you deal with are narrow minded and you be fired if client ends billing and they dont have another opening with in 2 weeks. If you are in Canada they dont have enough presence. Stay away from this company, there are better once out there."
bad,"the domination of the senior people over freshers."
bad,Good work culture when compared to other off shore companies. Work and life balance is good. Poor office culture and very little balance
bad,This was truly an experience working alongside a criminal attorney. Learned alot about the legal system.
bad,Needs to be more systematic; hr needs to look into associates problem
bad,I have worked as QA lead and has learned leadership qaulities to lead team in tough times.
bad,Not a great company to work with. Provides poor remuneration and facilities.
bad,"the computers are out dated"
bad,The company does not let you know you are not meeting job standards they wait until your score is the lowest puts you on a thing called pip for 2 days and let you go
bad,"Cognizant is a good organization to work with. As it is one of the most reputed company, a fresher can easily see his/her career growth."
bad,I found anything which is called management over there... Downgrading the reputation of CTS by their lack of management sense... More people will quit
bad,"Pay is not enough"
bad,"System issues was daily, training was not very helpful as the trainers were also fresh in learning the new software and were unable to answer any questions we had. Passwords were not ready for access at time of training. Very poor management."
bad,"They give very less salary for arts and  science graduates. "
bad,Bad management in IT Verticals Jon's are being moved to India and no communication between management and employees until issues arise. Jobs are moving to.india at rapid pace
bad,"Cognizant only cares about its growth, they do not care about employees. it used to be good company but pathetic policies, managers and senior management."
bad,"General shift is available which is really good, but growth wise very poor. Management is not at all good. Good thing is day shift is available which is really good."
bad,Its better to choose any other company if you have the option.Previously it wad one of the best.Though in the present situation it is not recommended.
bad,"This review is based on my work experience in India. There was no work life balance If you take responsibility then everything is put on your head, Bad management did not commensurate your effort to rewards."
bad,Need to be improved. No clarity on the business winners & upcoming new technologies. Regionalism works within the teams for any decision. Talent enhancement is at stake.
bad,"Cognizant has some great clients where you can work. But it is not a recommended company if you want to grow."
bad,good
bad,"Salaries paid are very less, especially after the CEO change. RDP, Learning, politics, etc. Only boot lickers will get onsite opportunities. If you do your work perfectly, you are not in that list."
bad,Management wasn't fair they had their picks. Not very understanding when you had to miss work due to unfortunate circumstances. Always on edge if you wete going to have a job the next day. Highly stressed when it came to meeting quota.
bad,"A typical Indian company running with American MNC credentials."
bad,No review. Have not had good experience with Cognizant as a company mostly due to what seems like a lack in very poor management in the current project
bad,"Good onsite opportunities, but it is very hard to see any career growth. The travel/visa management team is very poorly organized. The higher level management is doing micro management now-a-days."
bad,"While i enjoyed working with the people within my practice, the rest of the company is disjointed and fractured. The company switches missions on a dime to whatever is the hot buzzword of the day, hoping something with resonate with its client base. Not exactly a long-term strategy that leads to job security."
bad,The place is mismanaged. HR is a joke  The people are miserable and underpaid. Some employees conduct themselves like B$t#$s. Talent goes unnoticed...
bad,Cognizant Technology Solutions was a terrible company to work at. There was no opportunity for career development and often times the company tools were unreliable. The orientation and other preparatory courses do nothing to prepare you for the projects or client experience. There are rarely any resources to utilize and you can only succeed if you are lucky enough to get a decent manager.
bad,Not a good place to work for. Management does not understand the employee problem. Not at all employee friendly company. Overall it might be good. but my experience is really bad
bad,"not a good company , it has a very bad structure of  overall managers tree. every day it's a firedrill if you are  cognizant employee, "
bad,"Cognizant  had been one of the best organisations to work with, but recent changes in policies have made the organisation to be quite regressive and not a fun place to work."
bad,"No proper management new pilot process started after 6 months. No work at all for 6 months. But when the process actually started no 1 knows what to do n manger n sdm n everyone wants big big numbers from day 1. Client driven not cog management driven. No coordination, no team work, just blame game n raising fingers on 1 another. Very bad office politics."
bad,"Extremely ambitious company. Doesn't treat employees very well. Moves work offshore or brings offshore workers to the US to replace US workers. A good company to learn about the corporate environment, but not a long-term career company."
bad,Totally management is not recognized technical talent people and the persons who are getting good ratings means they will manages higher management with regional/language/politics.
bad,"Good for freshers"
bad,"Good"
bad,"I joined as Highly skilled Business Analysis Professional in CTS from Accenture Consulting Services as Sr. Business Analyst. "
bad,I would not recommend Cognizant for run opportunities to anyone who has an option to work somewhere else. In the US as the US teams are pushed to work 8 AM - Midnight to support a 8-9 hour shift with overlap from India.
bad,"As living in KL, the tax that you paid as a foreigner is okay but the company would give you unnecessary promises with money problems that you need to travel back and forth with tax company as they did not paid for my tax and also the financial department of the company should not be trusted d as they would not easily handover the salary to foreigners. My advise would be when your contract ends negotiated with the company firmly."
bad,"The business operations of the company and the model of the company are not suited for success within the security and GRC teams. The sales teams were not held to task about placing the consultants within the GRC and security teams.  The sales team would try to solicit the other business teams to do their research and analysis for leads and would knowingly ignore strong leads.  The culture was not suited for long term planning and you were constantly receiving hostile emails from overseas members and their was definitely a full view of bias on promotions and awards.  The five weeks of bench time when the sales team was not held to task to identify new opportunities for certain teams makes it very hard to work there and it is not good for building your skills as Cognizant does not pay for tuition assistance, or any training and when a good conference for security or risk was identified you could attend if you paid for it yourself."
bad,"From the outside, lots of apparent opportunities to succeed. The US operation is a veneer of respectability and management by US employees. Reality is that nothing has changed: all decisions and management originate offshore and are managed onshore by the dominant offshore culture. If you are not a part of that culture real advancement will be limited. "
bad,"Training was awful. Never gave you all information needed to do job. Jobs keep getting transferred to India. Some managers were awful, ignoring pleas for more training or help."
bad,At first I was told I would get a certain amount to join the call center role I adv them that I made more then that in my current role. They said you’d have to be an A/R Rep in order to make that kind of money. When I got the call back with an offer I was offered the AR rep role PLUS BACK UP to Call center. However my pay stayed the same... I tried to fight it and no one got back to me. From day ONE there is NO training not for call center not for the A/R role. They sit you to shadow someone for a day or two and that’s it. It’s beyind unprofessional all employees talk about each other and management??? FORGET IT! They have no clue how to manage no leadership they are rude intimidating and disrespectful. They do Not Give you the resources you need to succeed. Some and most managers and team leaders love to micromanage. This is not a career job it’s for a senior at high school with no worries or real stress to have not a career. This place is awful I don’t know how management sleeps at night. Pay sucks
bad,Cognizant’s work environment is geared to an open concept community work environment. They do not allow employees quiet work spaces but have open table working. For IT workers this is not conducive for clear quiet thinking times.
bad,"The ""project"" as they call it for the client is somewhat of a disaster. The scope and goal are never addressed and answers are never given by management about what is expected from the client. Your assessment comes from arbitrary scores based on a matter of perspective about what is right or wrong based on company policy and is entirely subjective. The working culture promotes general degeneracy and there is rampant marijuana abuse even in the company parking lot. The whole building has an air of unprofessionalism."
bad,"As my title.suggests, this company will only use US workers to train their Indian workforce. THEN ship your whole department offshore!   OR bring in Indian Hb1 Visa holders.  Notice most reviews are based in India.  And what do you get for all of your hardwork?? No raises, No promotions, No thank you"
bad,"There are worse jobs out there that pay less, but this job could be better. If you're just starting out in IT then this will likely be a good job to get experience at, but you won't make a career out of it unless you are in management."
bad,One of the worst companies I have ever worked for.  The American workforce was neglected in favor of the Indian workforce in terms of career advancement. If you were not promoted within two - three years you were managed out of the organization.  There is no bench and if you did not immediately have another project to go to you were also let go within six weeks.  Any internal transfers for new opportunities to preserve your job had to be done at your own expense.
bad,"Employees are not treated well. Big place of politics when it comes to performance rating. Work culture is not too good. Employee treatment is based on the manager, it varies from project to project."
bad,Only time you have Job Work/Life Balance is when your not on a project.  A work day starts and ends with meetings.  And most of the meetings can be avoided by an email or two
bad,"Training was a joke. We were told to read a manual for a week because they didn't have our logins or badges.  We received our badges but still didn't have our logins for a month or so.  Only the first class that had started months and months prior had a trainer from the client, everyone else had to learn stuff on their own. People were quitting left and right. People that didn't know anything about healthcare were hired at a higher rate than people without healthcare knowledge."
bad,"I genuinely did not enjoy working here. The management is based in India and the Philippines, and will openly refuse to have conversations about compensation and career advancement. Those who are promoted are the ones who ally themselves with the managing individuals through gossip and flattery. The place is a figurative snake pit"
bad,"My company was bought out by Cognizant and at first we were all excited. We told to expect the world and at the moment 500 jobs have been off-shored with more to come. For my daily use I work on a computer that is 8 years old and has trouble loading excel spreadsheets. Everything for them is based on quantity, not quality. My department needs to keep a certain level of work volume completed or people will get removed and redeployed to other departments. This volume is reflected in projects that are weighed the same, something that takes 1 day to complete is counted as the same as something that may take 2 weeks. In the end the quality does not matter as much as quantity. "
bad,"It was one of good consulting firm, but in last 5 years this company is  doesnt care, in terms of employee care, compensation etc. Only Manager's YES man can survive here."
bad,They think they own you. The expectation is you are a transient worker and will move about the country at their beckon call. They stated they would find me work in my region and kept sending me 50 or more miles and up to 2 hours of one way commute times.
bad,There were many of my coworkers jobs replaced due to offshoring positions. Those of us who stayed had the luxury of answering escalated calls from customer unhappy to be speaking to some in Cebu.
bad,"Very Difficult to advance if you are not Indian.  Management does not take any interest in your well being.  Had 4 managers in 2 1/2 years and never had a salary increase or performance review."
bad,"Decent Salary but Poor Management. No perks now."
bad,"Cognizant management does not get involve in day to day activities, they have the matrix system laid down to check the work life of the consultants, overall its more hours to work."
bad,"It is good place to start your career but never think of settling down in cognizant. Not a good place to serve for more than 3-4 years. The hikes, appraisal and incentives are pretty much below average for an MNC"
bad,"Worst company to get associated with and poor standards of salary benefits, work life balance and no job security. Management does not allow you to switch to your area of interest."
bad,"Don't join if you want to learn new skills or progress your career.  You'll be sold the dream and then live the nightmare.  "
bad,Managemet is not good at all. People using their personal relationship to get promotion and really frustated with the work pressure. Salary scale is too low.
bad,Cognizant offers a great benefits package. However can improve on the lack of training and many long hours. Need to work on checklist and training for employees.  No feedback given from management on how you are performing.
bad,Life depends on Manager you are tagged to.They tend to burden you with a lot of work and compensation benefits are not too good.Training period is awesome.Locations prefrences are asked but very rarely fulfilled.working in south is a challenge as some people are not that supportive
bad,"Good work life balance, good people ,.. very engaging management, great career progression. no mobility. great opportunities to work from locations like pune chennai"
bad,"I started as a fresher in cognizant. Everything here happens randomly. Nobody cares about the skills you have. Very Bad management, definitely not a good place for learning."
bad,Good learning on dealing with things  and time management too. Also learned how to be with people and also learned the team work and contribution towords team work
bad,I have suffered big time within 4 months. This company is not suitable for experienced people. Experienced people are not considered as human beings. I have seen many people fired for very silly reasons. I request experienced people not to join this company at any cost.
bad,"They are not giving onsite opportunity in spite of  working to hard from last two years ,no salary increment , no promotions."
bad,"Company is good for pay package."
bad,Je ne souhaite pas parler de mon employeur actuel. je me contente de dire que je suis de nouveau à l'écoute du marché
bad,Only the people at the top are treated well and make money. Very little respect for Admins.
bad,The same review I had given earlier for cognizant. The job makes employees to get projects and deadlines achieved rather than learning and growing better for self and the company.
bad,"The environment of work is just like any other office job, but with people from many nationalities. This helps you learn to adapt to different cultures and be flexible."
bad,"Expected something happened something,management is not at all good..."
bad,"Von außen betrachtet ein guter Lohn, aber nicht für die Arbeit die ich in ihrem Projekt verübt habe, es war mental und körperlich anstrengend, mit grafischen schlimmen Arbeitsaufgaben und furchtbaren Arbeitszeiten in Schicht, die Familienleben quasi unmöglich machen."
bad,"Many practice work in silos, Not much collaboration. "
bad,No Indian holidays and even on election days have to work. We do not expect much on hikes. Work pressure.   At the end not happy to work in cognizant.
bad,"Reviewing social media is stressful enough then you NEVER get a full/ proper paycheck. "
bad,The pay was fair and the coworkers for the most part was awesome but just one Manager on this project made going to work a chore and always changing shifts made planning your life outside of work almost impossible
bad,I have been working at Cognizant Technology Solutions full-time for last 14 years. It's not a very good place work. There is no work-life balance and its very hard to change technology or learn anything new. A lot of bureaucracy. Management has no regard for employees. Compensation is not very good and specially when you keep working for a long term.
bad,"The job as a social media moderator at Cognizant, Tampa; it kept my head spinning.  You have to be a mind reader to excel at that job.  They teach you one way but when you do the job the way your were trained they tell no, that's wrong or no that doesn't apply in this instance.  The training is whack. Team leads have favorites and will use their authority to get you fired. You can have identical approaches to evaluating a job and if they have a personal vendetta against you they will mark you answer as incorrect.  They put so much pressure on you and if you are determined to stay then they will fire you saying the job isn't a good match for you."
bad,Very little planning from leadership and absolutely no support from off site HR. No communication or transparency of plans or activities. When they do give information its always in half truths.
bad,I love to work in cogizant but the pay is not good for me so i would like to move from this company as soon as possible. As per my family need iam searching for the new company
bad,"You will survive if you are already a well rounded professional. If you need any mentoring/support you will be in Trouble. You will be thrown into a pool to survive in your own. Of course if you are lucky you might work with a good engagement lead so you will learn. If you bring in business, be prepared that you won’t be rewarded at all if you do not have connections up there. Overall it’s a jungle. Don’t join if you don’t have to."
bad,"Poor management, no cross training, favoritism, unfair, will discontinue projects at drop of dime, unstable company moved around a lot, unfair decisions"
bad,"The ""project"" as they call it for the client is somewhat of a disaster. The scope and goal are never addressed and answers are never given by management about what is expected from the client. Your assessment comes from arbitrary scores based on a matter of perspective about what is right or wrong based on company policy and is entirely subjective. The working culture promotes general degeneracy and there is rampant marijuana abuse even in the company parking lot. The whole building has an air of unprofessionalism."
bad,"I have been working with my current organizations from 2016. After joining I am very much disappointed with this organization. Because it is not a worker friendly company. A very cheap level management is here. Every time you will face issue with work location like Bantala(Kolkata) and there is no one to hear your voice. They will try to put you down. Everytime politics is there in those team members. Hardest part of the job is how will you survive everyday you will think before coming to the office."
bad,Organization is poorly managed and does not really understand the process of technology sales.  Largely a consulting company and is run like a consulting company.
bad,A good place to get new skills but not a place for the long term.  Expect demanding environment that will train you but expect you to swim in the deep end right away.
bad,Good company with good environment and maintain work balance and awareness programs for employees.But the contract employees cannot become permanent after 6 months also that is the only concern
bad,Managers at Cognizant used to make our team work day and night without any regard to work life balance. That resulted in the burnout of employees and low Employee Morale.
bad,This is a very stressful Job. They do  not listen to people that work there. Since we are are third party job whatever the client say's go.  You are easily to get fired so everyday you go to work you have to worry about are you going to get fired are not. Management is poor. There is a lot of hear say at the job and also alot of drama back and fourth.
bad,"Yes, Cognizant is a huge global company and does a great amount of 3rd party contracts. The assignment I was placed on was social media moderator. Very taxing on the mental health and definitely not worth the pay. The project went 24/7 within a month of being told it was a Mon-Fri kind of job and with promotions, your outside life did not matter. Horrible communication with management and if you wanted a promotion, you would either have to be on the more intimate side with upper management or extremely good friends with them. "
bad,"I had been working in CTS for more than 10 yrs and in the offshore there is no workife balance and in the onsite also they pay very less salary in compared to other companies. "
bad,Cognizant is a difficult company to work for given that they reorganize constantly and move people in and out of teams given their offshore/onshore model. They are primarily and offshore company with a domestic presence.
bad,"Few leaders are horrible to work with, especially who got hired recently from other consulting companies. Cognizant has a great culture but these leaders are creating damage."
bad,n/a not interestedi n writing a review about the lack of proper management or the complete lack of company culture. leaving for a reason and theres a reason no one stays longer than a year.
bad,"- Better avoid going to CTS after gaining some experience"
bad,"The company was great to work until 2012 but after that everything changed."
bad,"Not a competitive work environment, Long work hours without any extra pay, no work-life balance, lax management, no a great company to work for, limited growth"
bad,"CTS very much lacking good leadership , anybody searching for a solution cannot become a leader or be a leader , one who make a path can become a leader. After seeing CTS management , i enhanced my leadership skill by the mistake done by so called leadership in CTS."
bad,Process based organization..My department has retained its product development culture with many relaxations on strict cognizant structure.Management team too is aware/trying more on it
bad,"The location I worked at constantly changed managers and leaders for the local project. We went through at least ten of them in three years . This includes all levels from supervisors to overall department manager. It was a bit ridiculous."
bad,Many issues to be solved in the finance and accounting departments with little to no support from senior management. The trend for this company is to replace onshore workers with offshore making collaboration and timely communication extremely difficult.
bad,"Whatever the opposite of ""work smarter not harder"" is the motto of Cognizant. There is basically no career advancement if you don't play politics and work 50+ hours a week."
bad,Does not have regards to the employees. Just another selfish company like many others. Not a safe place for Onsite workers. Everything is being driven to offshore.
bad,"Can have good opportunities to work if project team, project and management is good. If employee is trained in one technology then he/she should not be transferred to any other technology."
bad,Overall management is average with some being good as well. Need some thinking inside. The billing pressures are very high and value added provided by anyone is not being considered.
bad,"Pays peanuts to employees. Not many clients in Silicon Valley."
bad,Hard to get projects when resources are looking for next project and not fun with culture. Micro Management culture. Lot of politics happening in the team. Jobs are in secured at this point in time.
bad,"Good Education system"
bad,"Very poor place to work for a long time. No project follows industry process. No transparency in appraisal. RDP linked to appraisal is a pain. Exaggerated commitment to clients on deliverables only to win contracts and continuous pressure on employees to achieve the same. Poor workplace maintenance and attitude of managers towards employees. Appraisal cycle and hike timelines are awry and no benefit if employee switches from one project to another in between. Career growth from A to SA will be stretched from 3 to 6 years if employee is a lateral recruit. Overall, certainly not a good place to work here."
bad,"They just hire u like herds of cattle and put you into completely irrelevant technologies."
bad,worked as senior associate in bfs domain working environ is ok and looking for core finance job. working envirnment is not soo good for long term................................................................................
bad,"I worked for Cognizant for a year and never found a position at a senior level. Upper management never gave straight answers on how to find a position in the company or gave all of the facts considering traveling or relocation.  Many of the senior jobs were given to Indian associates with less experience . "
bad,"- Cognizant is just another contractor and not better than any other"
bad,"Cognizant is een hierarchisch bedrijf waar eigen initiatief weinig gewaardeerd wordt. Erg afhankelijk van de manager's mening. Lange werkdagen, vroeg op en laat eindigend (denk aan het off shoring component). Veel buitenlandse collega's zitten in hotels/appartementen en hebben 's-avonds niks anders te doen dan werken. Dus jij ook."
bad,"Acquired knowledge about testing approach, client interaction and other behavioral aspects of an organisation."
bad,I would prefer not to review my current employer. They are unable to provide me with a career and that is what I am looking for at this time.
bad,"Overall, this seems like a good company, but for the most part it is very hard to advance to the next title and the pay increases are horrible."
bad,Very poor work culture with 10-12 hours of min work hour everyday
bad,"Description of the Project:"
bad,"I've heard people say its a good company to work for , but then , perhaps i got the worst project of all , or the others were just lying."
bad,"There are a lot of new concepts to be learnt. But not a co-operative and not friendly , encouraging atmosphere"
bad,"i like to work smart than working hard, work in the company is excellent, but poor growth and career plan, we need to extend the time in work hour, work life balance is difficult"
bad,Process is easy but the management is horrible.They fire employees on silly issues.Man power is low and high work volume.
bad,"Joined this company to work on a large project at AT&T, but it turned out to be a very high-stress position, with very long hours. The pay was OK for a contractor, but really no benefits to speak of. Unfortunately, the company throws contractors in to fend for themselves. Beware of what the account managers promise the clients, as you will have to produce (e.g. work magic) or get tossed out the door. They definitely do NOT have your back, if there are any issues that come up with the clients."
bad,"A skilled and proactive Support Executive with a strong background within leading global organisations. Experience across various business operations, establishing a sustainable and reliable support function with a flexible, constructive attitude and polished communication skills. Tenacious and positive self-starter, focusing on customer service. Management of challenging project initiatives involving complex co-ordination and influencing skills. Previous experience in diverse, multi-national organisations, gaining an understanding of the requirements of demanding, evolving environments and conflicting priorities."
bad,The job is easy. The management act like high schoolers. The company that does the hiring for Cognizant is unreliable. They tend to mess up your pay on a more the frequent basis. Only thing good is the pay.
bad,"Lack of any benefits, non-existent bonus structure which pays just few hundred quid, lack of motivation from lacklustre, idea-lacking upper management"
bad,Challenging work environment.  Poor management. job security issues. Not a stable environment.  there is a major shuffle happening in the company they have a poor bench policy. The managers need to be more engaged with there team and communicate on future work and development
bad,"Learnt UiPath RPA tool here."
bad,This is a company suitable for freshers and beginners. But if you want to grow in your career it's not the best place. Also the compensation is very low when compared to other companies. The paid time off is just 10 days per year.
bad,"lack of knowledge for scrum masters and managers "
bad,"Nice learning opportunities."
bad,"You don't get no raises, you don't get no job title for doing plenty of other jobs than what you were hired for. The people are sort of friendly but, they may seem that way and they're actually backstabbing you! I did like the PTO and the hours were great 7 to 2... I think that's good but take your chances working at this place... Just be ready to settle for less then your worth and to be fed bs!"
bad,"hire locally then ship jobs offshore.  Very foreign oriented.  Infrastructure is all in India."
bad,"Formly known as Bolder Outreach Solutions.Training is almost non-existent. People in lead positions are not mgmt./supervisory material. They have only obtained positions due to knowing and working with Area Manager in previous job. HIPPA violations are rampant! No local HR Department. All correspondence is done thru email with an average of 3 day response. Work is based in hospital setting and you have no support. The hospital says jump, mgmt. says how high. They do not support their staff no matter the issue. This is a contractor/vendor position. So job security! Applications are submitted to Social Security Administration and Bolder will submit any application to appease hospital and patient even if condition does not warrant. Adequate follow-up to applications are not followed thru even though patient is assuming they are receiving representation. Bolder does not show any compassion to families and patients. They insist you see uninsured patient/family member asap to assure hospital receives payment for services. This is hopefully accomplished by submitting Medicaid application, disability application, or completing financial assistance applications. Management is unprofessional and speaks and uses email to insult and ridicule staff. Management is back stabbing and tries to pit co-workers against each other. Was able to use this position to get back in workforce, pad resume, and gain contacts to obtain another position. Otherwise I would not recommend this organization to an employer or an employee. Starting pay for Patient Advocate is $15. After a year was increased to $15.75."
bad,A typical day includes connecting with stakeholders to discuss the new procurement and renewals coming up for the customer account. Interlocking spend and numbers that will in turn decide the strategy of procurement. Coordinating with vendors on day to day business and becoming aware of the new offerings and commercial models coming up in the market.
bad,"I worked for Cognizant Technologies for many years.  I enjoyed daily interaction with the end-users & providing support to them."
bad,"Incompetent Management."
bad,"Very stressful and quick paced, management changes directions frequently depending on client demands. Not very organized and you basically just put out fires."
bad,"There is never really a conversation on which location is best suited to a task. It's basically trial by fire in the sense that they will assign a task and then demand that it be completed with little to no assistance."
bad,"I was promised after 3 months as a contractor i would be hired full time and earn my full wage, my boss never fulfilled that promise. He asked me to take some time off because there were no contracts at the time again promising that when I came back it would be as a full employee, then when i was brought back 5 months after the promised time, he acted like it was my idea to leave and he was doing me a favor bringing me back as a contractor again."
bad,"It used to be a great company but it is fast losing its identity and becoming some other company thanks to lateral hires from other companies for leadership positions. A lot of intra-organizational competition and individual ambitions over the organization's success are becoming common suddenly, which is going to kill the organization in near future. It is those people who killed this company's competitors being part of them have just landed here to recreate the magic here!"
bad,Working for this company is ok if you are just starting to work in IT and looking for a way to get your foot in the door and gain experience. But as a IT Professional with years of experience it is not a very good place to work and most of the attention is given to the offshore depts. in India and elsewhere.
bad,Cognizant is definitely not a go to company if you are a beginner.But a great place after we worked in other companies for a long time.Not flexible in changing between projects.
bad,"Micro managed, no one was held to the same standard, each manager has their own set of rules, wage increases and bonuses are promised at one time but are always pushed back by months. The process of trying to get fmla is stressful in an already stressful situation. Would not recommend anyone to work for this employer."
bad,"Hey this is my personal matter and according to it i have provided my reviews."
bad,"For an American based company (Corporate Headquarters - Teaneck, NJ) this is a very Indian oriented company.  Many of the leadership positions are staff by Indian's with a cultural bias towards Indian employees.  No real chance for advancement if you are not Indian.  Management is focused on the revenue, at the expense of the employees well being.  A client harassment situation that was reported to management, was not dealt with, because of pending SOW contracts with the client and references the client was providing for additional new clientele.  Communications is very poor."
bad,"This company cares about one thing and one thing only, profit. Loyalty, tenure, personal dedication only matter when it leads to continued and growing profits."
bad,"Though Vision of Company is good - Vision of Management is Blind."
bad,Not enough is done to train existing associates in upcoming technologies and only hires new associates to do the job .Preference  for opportunities to given to associates who have a lot of experience on paper.
bad,"Some projects are too over burdened and some are too too under worked."
bad,"Bad management, poor salary and HR threats."
bad,"I worked for TPS in customer service, Client Service Representative. If you can stomach being micromanaged and can handle a call center environment then this would be tolerable for those individuals. The pay does not compensate for experience and everything the job entails for handling each call and your expected to answer emails. I have learned rushing causes error the opposite of quality. "
bad,"Working at cognizant, the company itself is great, but management SUCKS. you will receive great benefits and vacation time, PTO, benefits etc in the door but, its one of those jobs you have to walk on egg shells once you get a chance to get to the floor cause at any given moment you could be terminated. they hide things from you until its been called out by a rep. if you dont understand the work they're not willing to help you. they need new management. its jus like any other call center."
bad,"The work place is good and people are diverse. Work and life balance is present. Rewards and fun activities are something to look forward to, especially during a tough work week."
bad,Communication from Management down needed improvement but in general the work culture was very good. The expectation was high. Employees are expected to be fully competent with their project team role. Training options are good to help ensure success.
bad,"While the individual people are fantastic, there is a diametric clash in work expectation at a cultural level. Eastern vs Western Ideologies on how to approach work."
bad,No work/life balance.  Travel expectations are unrealistic for people with families.  There is definitely a culture adjustment in trying to train your ear to understand the accents of your team.
bad,"Management shows partiality. Opportunities are not open to all. They select whom they want irrespective of skill set, experience and talent. Salary and hike is also not good. They have not given hike for last year."
bad,lack of communication with cognizant managers.   left to yourself to try to figure out/sign up for benefits. NO HR help at all.  Never included to help make decisions that would have expanded their business
bad,"overall Bad as management is not good at all. Disorganised way of Policies, No clear instruction to team from Management. Though I got a good Team lead, but no clear info from Upper management"
bad,"I have learned a lot in this company which is the best thing I got it from cognizant."
bad,"*Managers should support and encourage the team members."
bad,I joined cts on 29th of december 2015. They hired me for Batch operations and server and application monitoring. i was right there from the transition phase for my project. my role got diminished and we all members ended up doing a reporting job rather than the described role as per the MSA. Too much of partiality.
bad,"Was good earlier, but the culture is becoming totally Military nowadays."
bad,Make sure you know about where you want to work. What is important to you and what you are able to do as far as OT or work life balance.  Flexibility is very important as is a broad skillset.
bad,"Good place for lateral hires. Monetary concerns for old timers. Management needs to look for old timers who are struggling with low packages, instead more focus is laid on new people joining the organizantion."
bad,Bad experience overall. Not good for people who really wanted to work hard as too much work politics is involved. Bad management as well.
bad,Middle management doesn't know how to manage. Most show preference to and prioritize their own kind. Those holding work visas given top priority to find new projects. No guaranteed job security. Poor health benefits. Horrible work/life balance.
bad,They have many onsite opportunities. The work culture is bad. The management is not up to the mark. The higher management is completely ignorant about technologies.
bad,"This is a very indocentric company wherein advancement and role development is difficult as management overlooks it. The benefits and salary are great and what keep me going, but there is no room for advancement if you are a US hire."
bad,"The management ruined my life, without giving promotion they made me to work there for 4.5 yrs. The management never cares ones problems. All are false surveys conducted inside."
bad,very bad and non co-operative co-workers. I did not have a good time working for this company. I wish the work culture was better. Company expects the employees to work even on weekends
bad,too much work load and very less pay. managers put lot of work pressure on employees. not helping clients requirements.
bad,"Good work place , career opportunities.Lacking good leadership , transparency. Less compensation, promotions, Hikes. Partiality towards set of people. Less proficiency."
bad,"It was a good learning curve."
bad,"Not a good place for personal growth and career advancement. Less work life balance, compensation and benefits are satisfactory."
bad,A contract level position that will permit one to earn a little side income. Not very attractive in terms of career advancement. All permanent positions are obtained through union membership.
bad,I am not satisfied with the kind of work I am doing.Its not helping me to grow technically and enhance my skills.However the atmosphere around my work life is somewhat okay.
bad,"Cognizant is a good place to retire. Its like govt organization, management doesn't who is doing what and survival is very easy"
bad,The management inside the project for united health care military and veterans is scattered and shows favoritism towards a pretty face and tight body. The absolute WORST Management team I have ever worked for.
bad,"Good to have working in CTS, the provide better work atmosphere."
bad,"Pays well, Management does not care about people, they count them as only NUMBERs"
bad,"poor hr practices"
bad,Its a truly Chennai based service company with excess of work load and typical indian style management
bad,"Cognizant is an off shoring company. Their primary focus is to have as many billable resources possible. In the interest of scoring high on customer satisfaction, employees are expected to put in high number of working hours."
bad,Very unfriendly to employees unless you have settled in one project. Your identity gets lost if you are changing project. It does not matter what you did at past as your clock resets with every change in project
bad,"There is not much upper management support.  Even though it may differ from project to project, it is usually difficult to find the necessary support from management when necessary."
bad,"Experience was not good for a new mother as they dont have flexibility/WFH facility and less hectic project."
bad,This is not a consulting role. Most projects are staff augmentations and little to no work culture or mentorship. Very difficult to discuss problems with managers and no clear line of command/anyone who is supposed to help you solve issues.
bad,"Some projects in cognizant are really good. They get management support, good work life balance, fun team, time to do other activities and good growth. But if you are one of those unlucky ones like me, your life will be very bad. No work life balance and the management will just push you till you complete the work. You might even get calls on your off times and holidays. Also involves lots of office politics and you have to be good in it to get some good opportunities. Recommended for people who can do really good office politics."
bad,"add some context to your rating.summary rating .......Politics and biased, not a friendly atmosphere.....age and gender bias.....not a healthy atmosphere..."
bad,"Good Learning Opportunities"
bad,Initially I enjoyed working here.But I got transferred to Bangalore due to personal reasons. After that team started torturing me as I had to work here independently.I wanted to participate in many events but couldn't participate just because of this team. Even if I work there was politics going on blaming me not doing the work.My manager believed them.So I got frustrated.Till now I'm still working not bothering about it just to show the people who tried to pull me down.
bad,"management not good"
bad,"It's good to begin your career with."
bad,"When i joined this company, i was very exiceted to worked with this company but management is not cooprative with employees, so this is my view about this company. Company is good but management not good."
bad,Good for starting your career. This job is for students. the salary is only good for Poland life. There are no oportunities for promotion. tHEY HIRE FROM OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY.
bad,"It depends upon on which location you with Cognizant and on which projects you're working. I'm not happy with the upper management, and policies they have. As we have work from home, but not allowed even if we have emergencies. And if we go talk to HR then they take no action on those person, and in the end we employees only got penalised."
bad,Management is the main issue here. They've created a toxic work environment to better serve themselves and do not treat people like people. The HR department will drag out any complaints until they fade away.
bad,Really disappointed how management does not provide clear goals and communicate effectively.   Career development is barely existent in this company.  No formal training provided.
bad,"Long day with constant follow-ups, however, open work environment. Understanding management with work prioritization."
bad,"No growth for freshers. Had fun roaming around. Not much learning and experience."
bad,Cognizant has a large presence in Chennai and therefore many opportunities for growth and internal movement. There is a constant inflow of projects which helps us find opportunities for growth.
bad,"Cognizant does not care about the employee's . There are no annual reviews or cost of living increases. no merit increases, etc Lousy benefits . The salaries are well below the industry norm, at least in the United States"
bad,"Positive Outlook"
bad,"Typical day at work would be with several conference calls with a dozen or more people... stressful for me b/c it was hard to understand through the cultural gap (as an American while everyone else is from India) & often the only way to pick up relevant information."
bad,Management does not care about the employees nor support them. the hardest part of the job is convincing that a plan wont work. Then they spend all day meetings discussing who was at fault
bad,I worked at cognizant a little over a year. The pay is great so are the benefits. The environment is sucky due to management. The management is very messy and lack as leaders. They’re not trained to manage and they hire in teams to do they job without even raising pay. They laid 60 employees off without notice due to the bad management.
bad,Your experience in cognizant depends on the client and supervisor. You can work on different technologies and chances to work with multi-location teams.
bad,"1.no job security"
bad,"It's all about the money. Fake people in management. Some unskilled people trying to run the show.  Don't care about their employees really, unless they are providing them with big bucks."
bad,"CTS is no longer a fun place to work .Full of dirty politics and groupism."
bad,"This company dont give you much opportunities, on the name of Automation they have reduced work force and there is no automation gone live yet resulting too much pressure on existing employees."
bad,"My typical day at work will be at the client site with a lot of meetings organized on my client's calendar. Though most of my times are spent with the client as I'm being represented as a Scrum Master for one of the client's portfolio account, there is a lot of opportunity on learning the project nuances."
bad,"Management are not really good. Higher up usually take on client side than you. Client is their highest priority. "
bad,"Good company for freshers. Academy will try to help you learning."
bad,My manager was extremely unkind and ill mannered and hence I had a tough time. The work life balance was not pretty good and the role that was promised to me at the time of interview and the role that was offered were different
bad,"A typical day at Cognizant involved repetitive work and lots of workplace gossip. I learned more about the system Facets which was great because I was pretty familiar with it previously but there is always more to learn. Management seemed to be removed from the actual work and was more focused on decorating the office or participating in inventory calls. The hardest part of the job was being around all the gossip and drama, most coworkers judged others on things that were non of there business. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things regarding claims examining."
bad,No respect for women at this company.  Very little collaboration.  The culture is not a healthy one to be in.  Worst working experience I've ever had.
bad,Too many changes in the strategy & overall direction in last few years. Much less employee focus than what it was earlier. Absence of work - life balance.
bad,"Depends on the Project, If you get a good project then your life is good otherwise you have no choice but succumb to corporate politics and low thinking management."
bad,"I is a good company, but contact end. Staff is very helpful, kind and understand. If you have appointment staff let you go to you appointment with out getting trouble."
bad,"Not have much of work"
bad,"Got nothing positive about it. It used to be an awesome company. Not anymore. Getting a good manager is like roulette, you get awesome managers and some times very poor ones."
bad,"The onboarding was a mess. I was told I'd be starting by June 1st after a couple phone interviews in May. Then it seems like I was forgotten about, until I received a call from them around July 1st. Everything was hurried through, and I started on July 17th. There was an online exam for Help desk skip assessment. I was able to negotiate a good hourly wage so that was a plus. My background check wasn't complete for nearly 6 months after I was working for them. There was very little management interaction or support, and all of the contrators on the project were isolated. I was told out out of the blue one afternoon that they were laying off all contractors not at headquarters for my project. A month later I still was not placed on another project after relocating for this job 9 months prior. My only options were a handful of positions across the country. After seeking unemployment for having zero hours of Income, the company actually attempted to fight the claim stating they were unaware of any changes to my hours and that I was still working full time. This didn't hold up in the end, but it was sure ALOT of extra aggravation. I left the company after a month of no new local opportunities."
bad,everything that was presented at the time of the interview and during the 12 week training period did not happen. Employees very unhappy and most looked for other jobs and left the company
bad,"If you're looking for a stable job, this is not the place to work. Job security is awful. They make you go through 4 weeks of training and in the fourth week if you don't pass 5 days worth of tests you're let go. And you endure more training if you're not meeting their HIGH standards on the floor and if you fail training you're fired.Great people, but stressful environment. Everyone was worried about losing their jobs daily."
bad,Poor management. No proper team to speak too. No point of contact. A lot of bench period. Stagnant place. No growth opportunities.No choice of work. No focus on employee satisfaction
bad,Promises made and never upheld regarding compensation and career advancement. Most of the upper management team were either founders of the company or brought in from the outside.
bad,"good work culture"
bad,"Unless you were Indian, the odds of getting a promotion or a significant pay raise were negligible.    The company while based in the US has an Indian culture and mindset with no work life balence."
bad,"They have several clients that they will convince you to work for.  When you finally get to the client to work for them, the work that is given is rarely relevant to your field."
bad,"Politics in everything."
bad,The company hike was so low never even expected that we would be paid so low. We were the pilot batch and we grew the process in the US market and also IN market was a additional project we acquired based on our performance but we were paid less and fact is we have grown from a team of 5 to almost 100 as of today...
bad,"If you want to work in App Support, please apply here. The work is stressful. You can be called on to work in odd hours, weekends. Managers are self involved and hardly pay any heed to employee requirements."
bad,"Salary at Cognizant is great until you learn they don't want to pay for overtime, break federal laws, and expect you to work all the time at odd hours of the day. It's a great starting position, possibly, but once most people gain some experience they run as fast as possible."
bad,did not like the environment; very unprofessional. Was not organized. The turn over rate was very high. All and All I would never work there again.ppp
bad,Work-life balance is not good at CTS. Low salary for employees who started career at CTS .Not possible to get a development projects for the desired technology
bad,company is good..! However the Management is not accepting the opportunities to develop the employee careers. Management always think about their project.
bad,"Cognizant advertises itself as a big company with big ideas ready to take on industries. Truth is it can rarely publish a corporate email in readable English and God help you if you call the help desk. Don't make plans for a vacation trip, you just might not be able to take it. They do offer excellent benefits though. They just can't seem to find steady contracts for American employees and keep them. Sad state of affairs."
bad,"The work is monotonous,  with less learning and no knowledge gaining. "
bad,OLD company was acquired by Cognizant seems to be a okay place to work for but I need job stability. Not much communication about what changes will coming in the near future.
bad,"Cognizant has steadily declined in past few years."
bad,Cognizant in outsourcing sector does not encourage its employees in salary terms and to be frank the hike i got in two year was only 1000 rupee.But the amount of workload was only piling up on me with no benefits at the end.
bad,There is a lack of company/ workplace culture.  They do not believe in having a strong bench. The work is challenging when there is work available.  Make sure to have a severance package attached to your offer letter.
bad,No challenging work. Facilities r good but pay is very less. Not much transparency regarding the processes involved. The company has to get deep in terms of technical aspects
bad,"Got to improve my communication skill and network"
bad,"Overall, this is a good company. However, I feel, in SAP Analytics, the management is not good . Workplace culture is also not good. There is a lot of stress because of wrong policies of the management"
bad,"Progressive but work life balance not maintained. Client requirement driven work culture is followed but employee centric orientation is missing and also not willing to invest much on employee enablement or empowerment, that leads to frustration and in turn performance deterioration."
bad,"I was working with many great Engineering Companies but I have problems to highlight the special qualities of Cognizant. There is no particular care of their remote working Employees. The hiring process is cumbersome and takes far too long. Too many phone calls need to happen for basic processes. You will get forms after forms to fill out without anybody explains why. "
bad,A good company to work from learning point of view. The management is not so supportive and no fun activities are performed at the workplace. There is always so much of work pressure.
bad,CTS is a good company that I am working with at present. But the reason why I am looking for change is to explore myself to find better job where i can use my knowledge regarding capital markets nd different kinds of products in it and also to work with a dynamic organization which can best utilise my skills and allow me to grow along with the organization
bad,"- Company is one of the major IT services companies "
bad,"The experience is always different for different people. Mine was not that good but for some it was great. Most of the work require shifts so my typical day starts at 2 in the afternoon. The work was mainly data processing, developing SSIS packages and running a few scripts. "
bad,"Not good, expectations and goals settings are totally biased.There is zero recoginition for folks with good attitude."
bad,My second stint at Cognizant. First one was in IT delivery. That experience was much better. This time it is in Analytics. All I can say is that the management is extremely poor and lacks vision in any form. Salary and hikes are also poor.
bad,Work here was not so great and being joined as a fresher big responsibilities were not given and work is also relatively not so challenging. I used my personal time to understand the application and not so much help was provided by senior members.
bad,No promotions. Only favoured ones are promoted and those who stay late are considered for promotions that the ones who actually complete their work within stipulated time
bad,"Similar like any other It Service Company with similar processes and "
bad,"Overall work life balance is good. However not many chances of advancement in your career is there. Employee preferences of working are not given priority. Poor utilization of resources and skillsets are also prevalent. Higher management behave like the CEO's of the company and seldom pay any hhed to employee grievances,. HR policies are also far from being realistic and they act as mere extension of managers."
bad,Good to hear that indeed is a job provider which helps people to search for the right kind of job an individual is looking out for in different sectors.
bad,It is a good place to start your career. I learned to work independently as well as in a team environment. The scope of  learning new technology is less.
bad,I am a dedicated and hardworking person - always keen to learn. Always focus on learning the business I'm working on. Combined with functional and technical background make me unique candidate for any position.
bad,"Hi"
bad,"Management is worse, they wont even consider your consider if you are having health problems or family problems. they make you work like slave in the location where they want you irrespective of your home town."
bad,Great opportunity to get exposed to a variety of challenging projects.  I learned more about the Indian version of Accenture and the aspirations that they have to take a leading position.  My co workers were capable and gifted in unique ways.  The hardest part of the job was to engage in the most effective way with all personalities.
bad,"Everything depend on luck in this organisation."
bad,"Lots of opportunity to get exposed to different ongoing projects, locations may not be the best. Hard to move up along the ranks"
bad,"As the company exploded to more than 2 Lakh employees, ethics, work culture gone out of the window. Managers treat their associates as slaves. Need to wait at least 5 Years to get promoted. Stay out of it."
bad,"I learned  how to adjust time with Work."
bad,"Its ok to work but many politics and not a good place to build career."
bad,"Less than satisfied"
bad,A busy schedule of 9-10 hrs work everyday. Its challenging and satisfactory. It increases the appetite for more work and to compete with others in same level.
bad,Coding all day. Worked there for a year and a half and never got hired permanent. Was laid off at this position.
bad,"While many individual teams and resources are excellent, the overall culture is nascent in its consulting practice. Administrative resources are weak or non-existent. Benefits are below industry standards. Organizational structure is overly complex with inconsistent management practices."
bad,"The culture is very Indian and if you are a caucasian female, you don't get treated with respect."
bad,"yes i have a lot of unforgettable moments in this pried of time ,really in this experience helps to became a good position in administration filed"
bad,"Wake up and login around 8am, arrive near or before 9am.  Work through lunch and leave the office around 6pm or after.  Hardest part of the job was being on call 24 hours a day every day.  No recognition for hard-working employees."
bad,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation is an American multinational information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing company. It is headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey, United States, North America. Cognizant is included in the NASDAQ-100 and the S&P 500 indices."
bad,lot of training skills provided to employees and good growth
bad,"1> Very good placing for learning , not only for acquiring technical skills but also facing various other typical challenges of work environment ."
bad,"Getting worse... bad employee benefits these days"
bad,a good company for growth with wide fields to choose from but not many opportunities available. good work culture.
bad,Mid level management is playing politics.You can survive only if you do butter on management.
bad,"Lot of Opportunity. But no trust among executives."
bad,Cognizant is not a good company to work in. Job security is not there in Cognizant as well the work load is very high and salary and year end appraisal is very low.
bad,"Cognizant has a habit of promising things that they cannot fulfill. As an associate here, I was promised growth, and flexibility into the different spectrums of technology that interest me. Instead I am stuck in a dead end project, with no time to advance or pick up competencies in other fields."
bad,Was good company 2 years back however day by day it is getting worster than worst company . There are many mangers who have experience around 10 to 14 years and they don't know how to handle resource and screw up your career big time
bad,"Work culture not too good for US, extremely influenced by onsite workers."
bad,Do not care about employees. Always think about revenue. You have to work always now it is also in the weekend. There isint a month were you have worked at least 20 hrs.
bad,"Good for Initial level, Worst TSC those are not taken, care associate as per their skill set. If you are billed you will be safe else TSC forced you to relocate you on other location."
bad,"Expecting Associates to work more than 10 hours    "
bad,This company has contract work. If contract is lost there is no guarantee that you will have continued employment with them. The training was performed via Web-X by workers in the Philippines. Very difficult with language barrier and constant interruptions.
bad,"Cognizant Technology Solutions offers good opportunities to learn new technologies, and to improve your presentation and communication skills.  Overall benefits package is average."
bad,"The company repeatedly promotes people to 'artificial' roles within the company thus creating additional layers of management that cloud the ability to get clear information about decisions regarding your client assignment. This also happens in the HR department when trying to get resolutions to errors in vacation time or pay changes. "
bad,There is no direction as you are a third party contractor and are seldom asked for your opinion or advise about the work that you do.  Then what happens is a protocol is decided upon without your input and you are expected to make it work.  This is a precarious position were you are expected to produce but are given no management input nor power to influence the outcome.  It makes for a very dissatisfying experience both professionally and personally.
bad,Not a very nice place to work. It is not the work pressure but some worthless middle management that sucks. There flexible working hours but that is due to client and not the company.
bad,"Find out for yourself. All experiences are subjective. Programmers act professionally.  The culture depends much on the boss values. When your boss has honor, integrity, honesty, and professionalism, then you can work efficiently and productively. If your boss focuses on politics, intrigues, spreading rumors and gossip around the office, then the environment becomes stressful and unpleasant."
bad,"Boa devido aos benefícios e salário compatível com o mercado, ruim por qualidade de vida, pressão, gerência péssima e organização pior ainda."
bad,The calls were good however the management style and chain of command made me feel like I was back in jr. high school.  The management is so unorganized it makes you feel like you have 10 bosses.
bad,Cognizant has several opportunities. The upper management appears to confuse. They do not understand how to run a business. They made all their designs base on friendships
bad,Not a very positive working environment.. I  would not be looking to work for them again.. The working environment had poor advancement opportunities..
bad,"I was working with them as a foreigner and all the foreigners in my team got bullied by the local staffs, including management team. They always brought up that our salary was higher than theirs and we should work more and cover for them."
bad,"promotions are not driven by employee achievement, it is rather based on the work relationship you maintain with your boss and senior management. The salary compensation is also poor, it does not differentiate between people working in cosmopolitan cities vs working in small towns/cities"
bad,"Treated like a child by manager, as if I had been full of mistakes. Workload increased exponentially due to senseless desperation from Managers internally, but even more so externally. I was mislead about benefits that turned out not to be true. They will easily mess up your paycheck and then make you wait for next pay-period to correct it, instead of cutting you funds immediately like any respectable  employer would do. Background checks are a joke (which is a good thing for some I guess) - the agents conducting the checks are clueless and reside overseas. They could not even find my old high school, something no other employer has run into with my background."
bad,"Health benefits are good, pay is average, management is the worst, micro management of time is like being a child in a daycare. On the flip side if you do need help, you wont receive any. Environment is awful and so is management so everyone is miserable all the time. Not great. Would not reccomend unless you want to keep to yourself and not work hard in a call center environment."
bad,"It is a good place to start a career, nice team, lot of fun"
bad,"Target pressure and stressful job"
bad,"From my experience, leadership can be biased, they don't listen to their employees it is incredibly disorganized and everything takes months to accomplish after request."
bad,Management wasn't informative or communicative in terms of new projects or provide information on project completion. Management is also difficult to reach.
bad,Poco entrenamiento respecto al nivel de trabajo y eficiencia que se espera
bad,I worked at CTS for 1year and had experienced a very worst management.There is no people's management at all.there is recognition for your work.But they have a very good work culture.
bad,"Management is very poor, they do not communicate with workers and still expect you to know what they want. While they like to hire from within, there seems to be a bias as those who are promoted are friends with or dating other higher ups. "
bad,"The culture is different i have spend more time with this company but there is no work life balance, the company has good prospect and plan but not for the employ who work for them"
bad,"Cognizant's main need is to make as much margin as possible from all the clients, and focus on delivery and quality was always put at risk. It was always a challenge, as Cognizant leadership preferred to bring in resources from India to the UK for client projects, and this always caused a problem due to client expectations, cultural and language barriers."
bad,"higher management has not much interaction with technical developers."
bad,"Poor management in regards to project. Learning opportunity we are having. "
bad,"If you want a simple job where you can go in and go out without it overtaking your life, you can do worse. "
bad,Management and HR is pathetic. God knows how they got into that high profile role. Top management treats the below level employees as if they are God. Due such attitude with o% leadership I have seen majority of the valuable employees resigned 20 FTS in a month. While u give notice they will try their level best to harass you if you deny their proposal to stay back.
bad,a typical day at work with less technology advance in technical career and management takes decision without considering the employee benifits and day by day cost cutting hurts
bad,"The company has a good vision for the next ten years. They are growing fast, but need to invest in their first line managers and providing support to lower tier teams."
bad,The culture is not a good fit for women and particularly mothers. Company infrastructure hindered performance. More transparency is needed on key accounts related to staff augmentation.
bad,"This needs detailed planning and more detailing the tasks as the project progresses."
bad,Good place to start my career and I have learnt many skills. Work culture and environment was good. Team coordination was amazing. Great place to work here.
bad,Recent changes in the org structure are confusing and unclear. Opportunities to grow and explore new things are very less. Still a good company for beginners.
bad,"Your value to Cognizant will be recognized by your direct superiors and your colleagues in your department, but as far as the company as a whole you will most likely be a disposable resource."
bad,Cognizant is a good place to work to learn but be ready to put in long hours. I normally put more than 50 hours a week that doesn't including commuting time of 4 hours a day (20 hrs a week)
bad,"Good place to learn process, online learning and work for top US, UK clients. "
bad,"job work and life balance is not good."
bad,Drama!! Management can't get it together take everyone more than 90 days to actually get paid for their raise. HR is friends with management therefore nothing will be done.
bad,If you want a job similar to desi government job then this is the company. If you are looking for a company pushing the boundaries or technology then stay far away. Copy paste coding expertise with reasonable  salary then this is the company.
bad,"Benefits provided to the employee is not at all satisfactory and management system also worst."
bad,"No work appreciation"
bad,"As a fresher this company is not suitable for growth as people not allow you to learn and always ask you to do excel copy work."
bad,"Process Obstacles galore, Its difficult to make things move. "
bad,"It was good working with cts"
bad,"Projects are tedious, clients are tough to handle , no salary benefits, no recognition to work , hard work is not recognized . promotions salary hikes are very poor."
bad,"This has become a place for doing politics.Everywhere dirty blame game ,leg pulling and bullying.After working so many years i felt like i have wasted most valuable asset i.e. my time for working this company."
bad,"Its Good learning experience but the compensation is not that great for amount of work."
bad,"•	Third party reconciliation of portfolios on behalf of client UBS in Triresolve and identifying the root cause of dispute which in turn help in resolution in margin call process."
bad,"I had good overseas opportunities, back in India its not so great."
bad,"Needs to improve alot in terms of promoting right org culture especially at middle management level"
bad,"good workplace but kolkata office is full of Biased people; technically its a very good place to work and learn, but promotion and rating policies are not transparent. Few Bengali managers are biased during rating cycle.."
bad,Poor pay; competitive and sometimes dishonest environment to get ahead. Difficult to get promotion; Sometimes lack of appreciation for work. Vacation policy dos not match usual standards.
bad,"Less Employee Benefits, Good for people who want to stay for long time,Employee freedom is less, Business development team is good in marketing CTS"
bad,"Start the day with checking the mails and responding to the same. Allocating work to the team members, review the completed tasks, Manage and plan the day"
bad,"The Management is focused on the growth but it misses the bottom of the pyramid to take it along."
bad,"Adhoc tasks fulfillment"
bad,The jobs itself is really nice and manageable. Being told everyone is getting let go only week in advance is unacceptable.
bad,Training was given by someone who had never worked on the phone floor. Management usually hung out by their desk and when one asked for help they usually did not know the answer you were sent to a co worker to resolve problems. The procedures were constantly changed by management as if they did not know what it was that they wanted from their employees. The hardest part of the job was trying to figure out what information was useful to keep or what was going to be the next procedure that was going to change. The most enjoyable part of the job was the unity with the employees. We all understood that the changes were some times confusing so it was nice to be able to relay on one another to make sure we got things done correctly.
bad,You never know when you will be laid off. Told it was temp to hire for 90 days... there are people still working there as temp employees that have been there over 2 years. Don't like being lied to.
bad,"Many of the executives are offshore in India and they expect you to work a tremendous amount of hours without pay.  They accomplish this with their management by putting them on salary.  I worked from home, in the car, in the office on weekends and holidays.  It was never ending.  There is no work life balance. "
bad,"The day begins with taking the stock of the pending assignments, review of new joinees, preparation of status reports, followed by working on tasked assigned to me. Also throughout the day catering to requirements/queries of my team lead."
bad,"Well the feedback is based on my current project and would vary with other teams. The project that I work for has lots of constraints as far as work-life balance is concerned. Working hours goes late into nights , work even on holidays , festivals and not much support from higher management. Team also is not supportive and not much of Team unity is found here."
bad,"I am into 6th year of my work, and have worked in many big projects where got the chance to interact with so many people and so far it is good."
bad,"This is a Big Body shop, don't expect quality work. there is no HR guidelimes and process. Its just how much you can manipulater everything"
bad,"less opportunities"
bad,"I played a diverse number of roles in development using different platforms like JAVA,ASP.NET,PL/SQL,Sybase.This switching of platforms are a great oppurtunity to learn different languages.The senior level management is helpful but u should be able to show them real productive work.Co-workers are quite helpful and make u feel at comfort.The hardest part is getting on the bench which would eventually stall career growth."
bad,"They have a decent benefit package but their pay is super low for the Minot, ND area where the oil boom is. People are almost homeless working there yet they won't increase pay. Cognizant is taking business overseas as well, so job security isn't there for some. Working here may cause trouble if you are looking for job security and supporting a family."
bad,Our process is 24/7 process so everybody will not meet at any shift.
bad,peaceful work environment
bad,Good Company. work culture is ok. provide opportunities to learn new skills. Compensation is not that great. Need more improvement on people management.
bad,"Just hiring bodies to answer phones. This phrase has been used by management several times since I started working here, and it explains this company's business practices perfectly. Training was handled poorly, the infrastructure is almost non-existent, and within two weeks of getting hired, they began talking about outsourcing this project overseas."
bad,"IT Service Desk and Services Management. Process Re Engineering, Quality Management, Resources and People Management, Operation Management, Operation Management"
bad,"People were very nice. Management was helpful. I learned a lot in the short time I worked at Cognizant. The structure of the training for the project we were working on was a mess, they should really get that in order."
bad,Company was good but recent years it lost its value. Less opportunities available to work with latest technologies like cloud devops machine learning and AI
bad,I bent over backwards for Cognizant! I loved the people at Cognizant. I moved 3x completed all of my RDP all of my reviews were either a 1 or a 2 and still no promotion.
bad,"This Co. has multiple projects  & management doesn't have the skills to maintain their SLA's. They hire contractors (1/2 quit the day after paid training ends), put them through a Q-Clearance type of background check, and then get rid of 'em as soon as the business volume drops. CSR' s are taught 8-11 systems and keep 4-7 passwords that each expire in different time frames. The leads expect you to funnel through 30-50 phone numbers, 7-10 web tabs, and take full notes on everything said. Even if you do all this the project leads can't protect you from an incompetent and biased HR. The company has to pay their client penalty fines every month because the daily miscommunication, stone age systems, and inefficiencies put their business output below agreed upon levels. A good company for the quick easy money during peak times but not a company you wanna settle with."
bad,"Like in most IT orgs, there is a skill and work mismatch most of the times and people are assigned projects randomly. Even if you are unhappy with your project, you cannot ask to get released due to the fear of getting laid off as per all the news circulating."
bad,Work Life balance is good. Work at onshore is flexible. Career growth is a big question. Work place culture is OK. No transparency between management and employees.
bad,Cognizant is an average place to work. Packages are well below market average and additional benefits are also very minimal. Though there are academy training provided but they are not directly related to current roles.
bad,"My Role was client facing one, good work life balance. Management is not supportive. Yearly hikes is good."
bad,"Poor management, no fair opportunity for advancement. Was employed there for 4 years only received a 30 cent raise. People came in under me making more money. Favoritism."
bad,"Leadership''s policy is ""Do as I say not as I do"". They hate their job. They have no problem saying or showing it and they do the bare minimum to help assist you in doing yours. The trainer's goal is to get out of there so she can go to her own business. And she even uses company time and computers to procure bids for her own company. It's hard working in an environment where you want to learn and leadership leaves you to work it out on your own. The environment is hostile, unfriendly, and unprofessional."
bad,Multi national company with good presence in banking and financial services industry. Good working environment and decent benifits for the employees of the company.
bad,"Cognizant is a great place to work and improve one's profile but again it depends on your luck. I got an opportunity to learn a lot of technologies and gain certifications. Management is kind of poor in almost all domains. Work culture is pretty good in cognizant and job security is also high. "
bad,I have 10 + Years of Experience working in Cognizant and as an IT Professional I had ups and down during my tenure. There will be internal politics in any IT Companies. But during recent Past the environment has changed drastically in Cognizant.. HR is non responsive and management doesn't care about employees aspirations.  I see more of Fake commitments from Higher Level just to get the stuffs they wanted from associates and never fulfill the commitments given to the associates.
bad,Would not have no one apply for this company. The management is not the greatest . They tell you that you are a valuable asset but you are just a body in a seat to answer the phone.
bad,It is not as how this company was a few years ago. Employees are losing their faith in the leadership because the change in policies is not oriented towards employees rather towards money making only with total disregard for employee satisfaction.
bad,I was hired as a PE and a person who monitors blocked information on social media.  I was switched to a new project on my 3rd day of training to a project called BI.  BI never had content to monitor and I worked over night so I forced to stare at a blank screen for 8 hours with out pen paper books or web browsing to help with boredom.  Managers would often get mad if we talked to our neighbors and gave occurances for sleeping or talking loudly.  Management is a terrible joke no one knows what's going on because of lack of communication.  Rules changed everyday.  It was a horrid experience.  Management will talk about u to other employees behind your back.  Only upside to cognizant was the pay for night shift. But its not something I'd ever recomend this job to anyone.  Your forced to use PTO for sick days and vacation days.  You are not allowed to ever be 1 minute late.  Its the worst job I ever had
bad,"Employee welfare and salary Going down day by day and the management were doing all micro management nowadays."
bad,I like the benefits but the compensation is lower compared to other companies. Training is horrible. You get thrown out in the field with little training - you either sink or swim. No work life balance.
bad,This has less on-site opportunities and less career advancement options. Manager oriented. There are many improvement points. It should take care of employees.
bad,I hated it management sucks. not a good place to work. they are unprofessional and have no control over the work that goes in or out. not organized. the center manager was super rude and passive-aggressive.
bad,"Managers need good soft skills to manage people."
bad,okish  work culture. Fast paced company and employee friendly.  I will not recommend this company to anyone until you are in dire need for a job. One should definitely negotiate the salary here.
bad,"Deliverables to client are the most important thing at work. Learning and career growth are not a priority here. Work becomes monotonous and work environment is uninspiring. Since teams are generally overstaffed, becomes difficult for everybody in the team to get a sense of accomplishment or job satisfaction. Its more about keeping up appearances and less of doing challenging work. Tend to get lost in the myriad of process one has to follow daily."
bad,"I have been working at Cognizant Technology Solutions full-time (More than 3 years)"
bad,"Laterals - Please do not join, Only folks for whom this is first company can survive. No hikes for recent years..Not much of visa initiation going on..and currently company is ramping down and hiring contractors"
bad,"It is a fine company to start when you are fresh out of grad school. However, there isn't much learning that happens after finishing the initial training program."
bad,"Management is immature and tries everything and blames it on the lower rung. "
bad,"Overall experience was good but the working environment is not that good and this is for the Chennai location. "
bad,"Worst company to work as a fresher. No work life balance. No scope for improvement of technical skills. Useless place to work. You wont get work related to your skills. Completely support projects. Worst rating and promotion systems. Worst policies. Bad HRs , bad managers. Avoid it."
bad,"Unable to make work-life balance due to heavy work pressure and weekend work. Also the Job is not secure here. No increment, salary also no satisfied according to the job role"
bad,"I was part of a start up that was acquired by Cognizant.  Most of the people who survived the acquisition were Indian  nationals."
bad,Technically it is good place to work and learn but   Work environment is not so good and there is no regular update we will get as part of management.
bad,Internal groups and team politics help non-working associates to grow in ladder and actual working associates won't get recognition or won't get help from HR's on year end appraisal issues. Associates will be forced to leave or left with no option to remain in the same level.
bad,"Good place to work, work culture and management/senior management need to be more employee friendly/supportive or at least need to communicate more frequently and address associate concerns periodically."
bad,"I have not found any work culture in organization."
bad,"good place to start a career, but underpaid"
bad,"This is a good place to start if you enjoy customer service, you are well trained and get good compensation. The only downside for me is the scheduling, you are told you don't work weekends at front but then are expected either every weekend (one day) or every other weekend."
bad,You work all day and have to put in long hours after work and then you have to study for Cognizant assessments which you have to take on the weekend because there is no other time to take it.  Each assessment takes 4 hours just for the test and there are tons of them.  Most of the skills they test you on are not even used on the job.  These are a large part of your yearly review.  Somewhere in there you are supposed to take lessons on management as well as do the jobs of the offshore employees which they like to call managing.
bad,"I am a re-badged employee and the process of becoming a Cognizant employee has been terrible. Communication about what I need to do and process changes have either been very late or non-existent. I've typically found out about what I need to be doing well after I should have been told and it's been very frustrating trying to figure out what I should be doing and how I need to go about doing things. You would think that with a company as big as Cognizant, they would have this figured out but that just isn't the case."
bad,"A typical work day would be working on coding and documentation."
bad,"Be very careful when negotiating they will ask for your W2s to see what your past salary was and then offer you a compensation based on that (W2s)."
bad,"Working for Cognizant was less than desired. Their approach to business is not in the best interest of the external associates or the clients we serve. Their approach is to streamline processes that aren't conducive to giving clients the service that they should receive. Most of the management staff was grandfathered in, and many of them do not belong in a management role. Companies and managers are supposed to encourage growth and improvement, this company has no interest in developing internal talent."
bad,There used to be good opportunities but now growth is saturated.Top management is good but middle management is the worst they do not work just play politics
bad,"learnt what an organization is."
bad,"Support for current customer need"
bad,Working in Location Constraint with different types of domains and in different technologies
bad,"Good colleagues and fun environment."
bad,"Expertise in the POS application in which i have been working for the last 4years."
bad,Company is good for freshers to learn and take experience but overall experience is not good with middle level management . It is difficult to reach to HR .
bad,"Worked on Support Incidents raised. Learn about shell scripting, Oracle DB2. Managed to handle 3 different applications independently on the same time."
bad,"Cognizant Finance is a very good company to work with where I have learnt a lot in my career life. Due to lack of work life balance, i am trying to join another company and also to have wide learning experience."
bad,"Lack of direction, culture very unstable and lots of turnover. Issues with compensation and promotions. Bloated yet understaffed in many areas, need some major improvements."
bad,"UPPER management is spiteful,vindictive,micromanaging prey on those they dont like and advance those they favor .They gossip about their underlings and abuse their authority  consistently"
bad,Definitely would not work for this company again they do not care about their employees  would not recommend anyone to apply here they come In buy positions and out source to another country
bad,"I honestly don't know what happened, I enjoyed my job there until they pulled a few of us aside and put us in this thing called PDP where they would pay us for a couple weeks to find a new position within the company or somewhere else. I applied for the position I had previously (Insurance Processor) at least 11 times and once for their new job for Medical Billing I think it was. They called me back twice, said they would talk to my manager or something and would get back to me. I NEVER heard a word back ever again and they ended my employment, so basically it was a really rude way to lay me off.  I find it very unprofessional how they handled the situation as well as the lack of communication on their part."
bad,Its not a place you can really turn into a career there isn’t  much room to grow in the company. Everyone basically makes the same amount just like $1 more the higher you move up in the company.
bad,"Cognizant is a massive corporation with most of its people in India, so it is hard to talk about the overall company. "
bad,"This was a classic consulting role where one always worked with the client directly, so nothing much interaction-wise with the parent company (Cognizant) except the manager i worked with. Unfortunately not the most professional experience with him, but nevertheless a lot to learn from the client experiences"
bad,"This is really an amazing job. Easy and fast paced. You need to be very flexible and adaptable with new information coming in every day in regard to policy and business need. "
bad,"As like in any other company, nothing that can be game changer for you as a employee . If you are billable resource no body cares what about you until something goes wrong on billing side."
bad,"I have worked at Cognizant for an year in Quality Assurance team. Although, there was something to learn in the initial days, it wasn't the same later on. One's chance of learning depends on the Management's allotment of man force to individual projects."
bad,"Would of been nice if they would keep jobs onshore instead of sending all the jobs offshore.  But that is why they are a multi billion dollar company, they don’t have to pay off shore the wages they pay us."
bad,"It used to be real good place to work, but the centre of influence is definitely Chennai. Also, a lot depends on the managers, who were very efficient in the beginning. Things started to slow down and opportunities began to slim down after a couple of years"
bad,"I liked a lot of the people I had the opportunity to work with, but HR was a nightmare to deal with and they did not compensate well for the industry or location of the job. Getting any sort of pay increase, even from promotions, was worse than pulling teeth. There were always excuses for why in had to be later instead of now. Ultimately, I couldn't afford to keep working for them despite enjoying the people and many aspects of the job."
bad,"Job security is there but Management is not good, no work life balance maintained. "
bad,The Company doesnt need whether the Employee is happy or not the just go on for numbers productivity is the only thing they required may they loose many employees soon.
bad,Too big of a company and your career path depends on which project you're assigned to. They tell you you'll be able to work anywhere in the country and then they ignore your preferences of locations.
bad,being that the call center had just open thing were not organized with the company the hours was not good hours as well as the days off that was told you would get.
bad,"I had an amazing time with my client site and would have gladly stayed with them indefinitely. Unfortunately for Cognizant, they only care about having a resource with an ever-expanding skill set. I was not encouraged to learn the things I wanted, rather the things they wanted to 'sell' to the client. Things the client didn't necessarily want or need. "
bad,Working for Cognizant has been a lesson in promises made and never kept. Consistently understaffed. Team Leads and Managers also understaffed as they keep quitting! There is talk of promotion and upward mobility but it never happens. No consistent support for advocates on the floor and they are ruled by Workforce Management who does not allow time for coaching or other needed time off incoming calls. Advocates are given unequal grading by Quality Team and the rules for grading are in constant flux without notification to advocates. Supporting a company that does not want to improve on systems that are ineffective and being berated daily by consumers that have been mistreated for years makes for a miserable work environment.
bad,Not a great company to start your career with. Salary growth is extremely slow. You will not get the technology of your desire. Lots of politics in appraisal rating.
bad,"The project has been managed by this contracted company for 5+ years with a lack of structured process to maintain information and documentation on the operations and what is expected out of the team. Training is done by other team members that management assigns to do it without any true training documentation. Failures due to lack of process and policy documentation is quickly ""handled"" by management without understanding of the technical aspects of what they are implementing which causes further failures due to only seeing the issue as a money issue."
bad,Company is operated and structured like an Offshore Base Company which does not fit with US Based Employees.  Cognizant needs to be focused more on Organization structure more like a US Company
bad,"Excellent knowledgeable people, lots of things to learn, however completely irresponsible management, they just want to have work done without bothering about your concerns."
bad,Learn the most required language to speak while joining it will benefit a lot.This is my personal experience.Salary wise it was good.Getting transfer to only some states is easy.
bad,"management is too bad and too much nepotism at least from my kolkata work  experiene . Kolkata is not for IT at all . Work cullture is not upto statndard if compared to Bangalore, Chennai ."
bad,"Cognizant Technology Solutions is good company to start your IT carrier. However, for the experienced candidates this company will provide more work pressure and you will be able to meet work life balance"
bad,Given unlawful ratings without any reason spoiling every employee future by mismanagement leads to creation of bad name in the client view. Not taking any suggestions or any inputs from employees on rating.
bad,"You need to know people to go up the ladder simply, work mostly does not matter. The senior management is corrupt."
bad,"I've noticed they suck in recent graduates, chew them up, and spit them back out in time to hire next year's crop. Despite being told I would be able to work in my chosen field, they have repeatedly chosen to place me elsewhere. And then given jobs in my field, which I am more qualified for, to someone else. About had of the people I met during orientation have not/will not complete their first year with the company because they decided to get off this flaming wreck of a ride."
bad,Is a great team oriented place that highly encourages working together. Has a great environment within the call center floor as well as great people to work with.
bad,"The advancement will be truly based on the projects you get. Anyhow the management will just manage and the leads and managers will also manage. So, who will do the work...it's you (aall the scrap work like filling excels....)"
bad,"It is multinational company, The standards of the company is awesome. Have great clients and very well versed business groups. High level management is excellent."
bad,"It is best place to start your career.Learning is awesome."
bad,"Okay to work but  :("
bad,Not good for freshers to begin their career here. Decent salary but poor in terms of hike and bonus. Too much internal politics. Higher level management is inefficient in handling critical issues.
bad,"I was initially in an Application Maintenance Project and moved to a Development Project. The Project I moved was a developing tools for Legacy System Migration and it was a newly formed team in Cognizant. I am the first person to join the team and was reporting directly to a Director. So totally it started with a two member team. We need to show our proficiency based on that the newly formed team would persist for a long time. "
bad,"Got to know about various people coming from different nativity culture and how to make use of the knowledge gained and how to create ourselves from the knowledge we gain."
bad,Its a good organization but how make you space here that is up to you.
bad,"Managment was not friendly , co workers were ok, very mixt cultures - I liked that , there was a lot of free time in the day , when there was nothing to do , we were not allowed to read or use internet so it became really boring . The salary was terrible, but I met some really great people that im still in contact with."
bad,overall experience was average. good place to learn as a fresher but with limited opportunities for career growth. company gives decent overall facilities.
bad,I’d still recommend cognizant as a place to work due to the actual company being a great company. My current project and leadership there is where my concerns lay. This should not reflect them as a whole though.
bad,It could be better.  Company Is not employee friendly. Promotion cycle is bad. Performance evaluation is not transparent. Employees not allowed to choose desired skills
bad,"Not an ideal company for a fresher. Join this company only if you have good experience and want to settle down. For people who are hardworking and want to learn new technologies, this is not the right place"
bad,"Work was not appreciated here, unless you have to be slave. management is worst, no increment for the employee. Based on politics rating is decided and not on work and dedication.."
bad,Eviction of workforce is very much true.Tough condition and usage of minimum resource for a task.Good for learning and building.I am based at bangalore
bad,"Pros"
bad,"since this is a company based on offshoring benefit , work life balance hardly matters for cheap labors. salary is very low and only carrot available is client side opportunity."
bad,"Not enough opportunity for producers to advance.  Too many executives who do not contribute value.  Many times, arbitrary decisions from executives hamper ability to service clients with no real information as to why decisions have been made."
bad,"Good company to work. "
bad,"well,we need to work for 9 hours from 9am to 6pm ...Job is not interested at all.no humanity and  enjoyment .....always  selfish,tedious in nature...."
bad,"Hard place to work"
bad,"Poor re-use of intellectual property and poor middle management handicap successful delivery of projects.   This job required me to start my day at about 4am, then go into clients, work till about 5pm then on conf call from 9pm till 11pm."
bad,"Learned a lot in technology and management prespective"
bad,"I got to learn many things in my 1.5 years at CTS in both personal as well as professional life."
bad,"My experience working at Cognizant was good up to the point where after my six month temp contract ended I was not hired on full-time, despite being told despite receiving emails from my manager two months before, stating that I would be. It came as a complete shock to me, one which I was not prepared for, and it put me in a difficult spot financially. "
bad,"I have worked for Google Ads team in Cognizant."
bad,Leadership (managers and above) demonstrate incompetence almost daily. They outright lie about the job description until you are hired where it soon becomes clear that you are working on a virtual production line reviewing disturbing content. They have slowly striped what little freedom people  had. Overall the job got worse every month as the few people that were making a positive difference ended up quitting not worth your time look elsewhere
bad,"Corporate, Client & Support staff are completely disconnected when it comes understanding what part and responsibilities each groups has. Too much corporate red tape."
bad,"Hectic schedules also depends on the management. Hours are valued more than the efforts or delivery, extremely stringent on the new hires which makes it stressful"
bad,"too much politics plus not enough opportunity for personal grwth"
bad,"The culture seems to be ""throw them into the fire...the ones who don't cry about being burned will stay, while we can always replace the others"".  Some may thrive in that environment, but I wasn't one of them."
bad,I was trained in java and sql. The technique used in the learning was a self learning training. I had to google and refer multiple books to solve the problems . It was a wonderful learning experience.
bad,"Depends upon the project. "
bad,"Desi managers are not well educated how to handle employees."
bad,It used to be a great company but now with cost cuttings it is not worth it. Promotions are political and delayed. This company has been lucky on various accounts.
bad,"The company provide work life balance, plus the flexibility of moving to any location of your choice, along with the opportunity to work with the client of different geographies. However, employee engagement is poor."
bad,"a typical day at work is just doing as if ur forced to the task with no advancement in level and guidance and realistic mentoring."
bad,NO work life balance. Management is not good. Bad location. Bad HR policy.cognizant is not a good company to work in for freshers.
bad,"Pros"
bad,"Good for Lateral entries. Flexible Work timings,Good place to work,Fun."
bad,live in major city but very few opportunities when contracts are client cancelled. Not always easy to pick up stakes and relocate for 3 month project.
bad,Average company with good policies but zero growth opportunity. Appraisal system has no relation to the work performed. There is no clarity on how the employees are promoted.
bad,Although benefits match american system integrator very few things to look up for. Immigration and relocation policies are good and they are the icing on the cake. Rest all depends on the mercy of the client. They call it the new 'Body Shop'. So if you want a career look else where. If you are looking for GC then this your company and be ready to sacrifice everything else.
bad,"No respect for associate Skills. Not satisfied with this job. Can't see any scope for my career growth. "
bad,"Not Employee Friendly, everything depends on project allotted, which is completely random .Unprofessional Atmosphere."
bad,"It was a nice place to work. Got the experience to interact with people from different backgrounds, however i felt that the management was a bit hard to approach."
bad,Cognizant is a company to work with. very nice and emplyee friendly.
bad,"Unable to keep employees happy.  Sat at a computer in a cubicle during the day, benefits good, has a gym available."
bad,"Everyday would fix some codes to test for satisfying the client's requirements."
bad,Cognizant came in last year and bought 45% of the ING employees in order to offshore our jobs. We have been allowed to stay on to train our replacements. We have been assured that we will have jobs after they move all of our ING jobs offshore. I have enjoyed doing my Quality Review job for ING.
bad,Good and fun workplace....I have gained so many thins in things company
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job. I learned how to support projects
bad,I joined this company as a fresher. I had training in one technology but got project in another. Horrible experience. no good exposure. Company is worth joining only if joined as a lateral joinee.
bad,"Nothing great, but professional place with decent people. CTS has lost its secret sauce which propelled it to its current heights. Its a bad model in a dying industry full of fakers at top level."
bad,"The work life balance is very good in CTS. But the only drawback is that your work is not very much appreciated and the compensation package is less."
bad,"The exposure or chance you get, to work on new disruptive technologies boils down to your interest level. The hardest part of the job is, there is no clear cut path defined."
bad,"Good Management but no promotion on time."
bad,Too much of politics in and around. Your promotion and other benefits depends on how close you are with your manager.A person with 10 and 6 years will get same designation or Band.
bad,"I have learned and enhanced my skills in ASP.net, web services, WCF, SQL server, Oracle database. I made my team members to work part in various skill sets and earned effectively in their careers. The hardest part of the job is experiencing the key areas of learning."
bad,"There were good mix of all age of resources, it was a fun place. We used to play a lot after work. Those were golden days of bachelorhood. Work wise we had a very tight and heavy schedule due to client's pressure."
bad,"I have been with Cognizant since 2006 and what I am today is because of Cognizant certainly. I owe both my Technical Expertise and my Management skills to Cognizant. My experience working onshore was only due to Cognizant. "
bad,"Working in Cognizant for past 4 years.Workied in retail,insurance,communication domain.have development of ODI,OBIEE and testing knowledge"
bad,"This was one of my dream company. Good team members make a team good successful & a happier environment to work. I got the worst team member. Lingual Politics, micro management are some of the biggest issue. Everyone is interested in others work not even doing their own. Even HR's are hard to contact. Pathetic experience."
bad,"Good company for people with family, Work life balance is awesome, work from home options. The only problem is projects if you get a good project  then you'll be fine, not happy but fine"
bad,"to be frank i had no work at CTS not only me most of them."
bad,Good company with better work environment and supportive team. At times stressful at times zero work. Perfect work life balance. No hike. No promotion. Very poor management. No travel..
good,"Cognizant is worst in terms of all. I do not prefer working here anymore and always recommend everyone the same."
good,"I work as a PMO executive.I got to learn a lot esp in terms of managing allocations and creatimg various reports handling huge amount of data for employee onboarding offboarding."
good,"If you want to warm your chair, this is the right place. No palce for merit. Everything is based on the no of years you have put in the system. Right from top, it is chaltha hai attitude. 1-2 team members will slog for the remaining 10 team members. Reactive senior leadership."
good,"Poor Management not ethical -no work balance internal politics, unethical HR policies bad management not employee friendly no job security bad reputation"
good,Learning opportunities could be better. As also job security. I would like much better compensation and benefits and work life balance. Hence I am looking for a better opportunity.
good,"They are the worst in compensation and benefits and the salary for a Project Manager would equate to the part time workers in USA. "
good,Customer Satisfaction now-a-days is rated more than employee satisfaction.
good,It really depends on the project and the PM you work for. The first 2 years was great since the colleagues and the supervisor were really professional. the later projects - not so much
good,Career growth is slow. Work gets monotonous after sometime. Work timings are sometimes flexible; for some people it was hectic. Management in my department was okay.
good,Starting with a package which is offered and then on no hike as such and crunches in the job /  team. Preferred to layoff people basis the look and feel and not at the disposal of deliverable.
good,"Due to process Relation Benefits some how issue in there Company Management. Though I wanted to share my two years work Experience is good. Good Behavior, Helpful associate & Good Leadership."
good,You can learn and grow but it is becoming considerably difficult due to the large workforce. Therefor lay offs have increased and attrition is at all time high
good,"To summarize Cognizant, It has many ineffective managers who do not win the trust of their teams and use their team members for their own career advancements.  I will never go back to work for Cognizant but will refer others who want to start their career."
good,"I have worked for cognizant less than a year. "
good,"Overall it was nice experience to work in cognizant."
good,Fast growing company. Good work culture. Nice colleagues to work with. Nice exposure to newly joined students from college. Good Training programmes.
good,"Stressful environment "
good,Working as a Scrum Master /Business Analyst /PMO /Project Co-ordinator at Cognizant Technology Solutions having 8.4 yrs of experience the Scrum team was very cooperative and fun to work with.
good,"A empresa paga o salário e os benefícios em dia, apesar do salário ser abaixo do mercado, incentiva o treinamento dos funcionários."
good,"There are a lot of Visa workers that get worked like crazy. Then there are a few workers that are citizens and kind of fly under the radar and don't have much work. There is no type of work culture, I am under the age of 25 and there are maybe 2 co workers that are the same age. Just over all not a good company to work at if youre a young professional. You wont learn anything and will be stuck in your job. No one wants to help you get a different job within the company and the bonuses suck."
good,"Its a multinational company. And big brand also. "
good,Cognizant tends to maintain their employees who have relocated from India (currently working in the US).  Always have a backup plan as MSP's can drop you in the event the client you are assigned to is planning on going in another direction.
good,"Chill company management is worst."
good,Career growth is very slow. Very little increment per year. Don't get paid for extra time in most of the projects. Less opportunity to learn new things.
good,Lack of career growth. No clear road map for the employees when it comes to career growth. Not much of option to update the technical skills. Poor management
good,"The environment is very reactive; a very dependent and title driven organization. No thinking outside of the box, or understanding of client boundaries."
good,"In the Mumbai location, management is really bad, we were not allowed to think out of box... decisions taken at higher levels never took into account employees' opinions or emotions."
good,"At cognizant I worked as Programmer analyst for 1.5 years. One thing I can surely say is that you won't find any inspiration and motivation to work continuously as the management doesn't care at all about your growth. Only thing that matters is satisfaction of Top management. More than one lakh people working in this company, still see where it is."
good,Not at all profitable  for BCA graduate. Work category is same as other destination  like PA and associate but salary is less. You do not have choice to switch to your preferable domain or technology.
good,"I was only there a short time, I learned very little as I was just hired and thrown into my position with no system training, I was not given expectations of my job, there was never a performance discussion and the culture I felt was very toxic."
good,Job Security were not there. And simply they will hire people and remove high package people.And Partiality no promotions if we want promotion we need to lick the manager boots.
good,"Company and job profile was good but Management and policies are poor. There is no job security. "
good,"Company is more revenue driven and client focussed than taking care of employees, made multiple false promises during hiring but nothing was done later"
good,"Productive place good for the freshers , for experienced its not much in it. Need to utilize the maximum opportunity in the organization."
good,"Good place to learn but work pressure will be more. Rating depends upon project manager, once get good name from manager last long and the same for bad name also."
good,Although it's one of the largest IT company but it has it's flaws. In house employees are not compensated as good as the lateral hires. Promotion system is weak and partial at occasions.
good,The management literally finishes work life balance in the company. The projects are not that good with very less scope for career advancement. life is hectic there.
good,Management is very lethargic to respond to changes. There is no Rewards and Recognition towards your work. Plagiarism at work place where seniors take credit for juniors work.
good,"When I started at cognizant I was excited to finally have a grown up adult type job.  Unfortunately I found out that many people who worked there were stuck in high school.  Lots of cliques at this place and if you are not in one  or you are not in the right one you should consider your days there numbered.  For example when I got hired I was the only Male on a team made up of all females.   I initially did not worry too much about that dynamic because I have always gotten along with women better than men at work.  However, being the only male on the team I was often subject to the ire of our team leader who was a disgrunteled divorcee who seemed to take out her ex husband woes on me.  I was often berated loudly and in the presence of the rest of the team for not doing things correctly and after that I felt that I was the pervible  punching bag for any one of the ladies who had a man that did something wrong to them.  I never felt comfortable on the team and no matter how hard  I tried to be one of the team I was never really welcome.  I caution anyone who gets a job there because another problem is that you are not officially hired for six months and if you have not made it in the correct crowd then expect to be let go because you are a contractor and are not even paid from cognizant until your six months are up.  I was disappointed because you get a lot of half truths told to you and then a lot of things change to the point to where you can never truly master any one aspect of your job.  Good luck to anyone that does get a job here maybe your experience will be better than"
good,"Initially interviewed for a specific job with the understanding it was a ""Permanent Placement"".  Once I moved the family it was only a contract which ended a year later. Position was 3x the software that I submitted for."
good,I do not have any review comments to add here and hence I am feeling to leave this textbox field just like this so that others can put up their comments.
good,"Like any other place, it depends on which project you are in. some projects are stressful and some are relaxed. Good compensation if you ask for while joining. Min hours for swipe in-out mandatory."
good,"The company is a good start for junior to build their careers. Every day you will learn new things. However, the big concern from my point of view is that they are lacking good managerial skills. They don't have actual career paths, you wouldn't get promoted. The work-life balance concept doesn't exist in their dictionary."
good,"Cognizant can be a great company to work for; however, they bring their Indian Cultural beliefs and heirarchy into the way they conduct their business.   If your not part of the cultural elite then you are outcasted.   There is a lot of cut throat and back stabbing going on at all levels of the company,   Also I and many other associates were asked to resell materials and collateral produced by other consulting firms to our client base.   Very illegal."
good,"Management should give some importance to the employees, overtime hours should get paid off and the leaves should be there in the calendar!"
good,"If you are hired for Kolkata - make sure to get yourself down and enjoy with unprofessional people. "
good,"I do not wish to share the details of my experience. As my experience was not good and they senior staff was very cold and unhelpful. So, there is noting to discuss."
good,"Working there a year of my time, I noticed a lot of the companies good and bad potential. Upper management doesn’t really enforce the rules of discrimination in the workplace on no type of level. I was harassed and discriminated at the job, I had reached out to my upper management and they did nothing about the situation. I felt so at an unease of the work environment that it force me to leave the place. It’s always constant changes and never really a standard guideline. They hiring people in management positions and advance position who they favor the most and not people who actually know to do their job."
good,"Not too much fun of it. The management is not very well.  Technology perspective, it is a good working place to keep up. There are wide varieties of technologies are in place."
good,"No clear management chain.  No clear metrics for promotions, maybe popularity-based? Horrible working hours. Very long hiring process.  Plenty of parking would be only plus there."
good,What ever do at your workplace all your growth is dependent on your higher management decision.They don't consider you even if you do good at your work.
good,"I am working in cognizant past 2 years and I already shifted  from bangalore to hyderabad as internal job posting."
good,"I get to work as an architect in some projects and in some projects get to work as a project manager. The projects are good and keeps me motivated. But most of the time, CTS management distracts you with mis management of projects and resources or there sudden high priority work on business development or There aggressive rule by authority management style."
good,"Answered phones for assigned Client, everything from products and to computer/systems errors.  Hardest part of my job was the chronic system phone issues and no idea how long to fix.  Hard to do my job with all those issues"
good,Will not recommend if somebody wants to work as a developer. They have more testing projects. Management is not good. Incentives are also less. work life balance is okay.
good,This company does not back fill positions.  The work is distributed to the employees that are still with the company making the work load impossible.  This makes a very stressful environment for all concerned.
good,Nice building and people. Company provides free food. Minimal opportunity to spend time learning or cross traing. Does not provide tuition reimbursement.
good,"Organized and well led by the CEO."
good,"Very very less development projects."
good,Lack of career advancement due to the unfavorable company HR policy. Looking for good opportunities which will fit my skill & experience. Hands on experience on H4 Hana OTC.
good,"work life in cognizant is very poor, no proper planning will be available. superiors put the work load on people who ever works dedicatedly. no proper management. managers in the projects will of irrelavent experience. but their communication skills will be good. Very poor job security. not a good place to work. For temperary job it fits best."
good,Good no work life balance no salary perks not employee friendly presently all automation projects not upto industry standard no job security and other perks
good,This can be a rewarding but challenging company to work for. Because it is so large it is easy to get lost in it and not know where to go. You constantly get overlooked regardless of how well you perform.
good,Not a job to stay at for the long term and poor management.Poor communication with employees and no chance for advancement. Company is only interested in quantity not quality.
good,"Management is good, but the workplace culture can be improved. "
good,A typical work day consists of processing PERM cases assigned to include assessing educational and experience documents. Determine filing category based on documents provided. Contact foreign national to request for  additional educational and experience letter documents. The hardest part of the job is to convince the foreign national that the educational and experience documents they have provided does not conform to the company's PERM policy. The most enjoyable part of the job is the dealing with other PERM contractors.
good,"typical day- nothing special"
good,"Dedication contributes to our success."
good,There are no advancement opportunities and no regard for the workers. This company focuses heavily on quantity and encourages management to hover over workers creating an uncomfortable environment.
good,It all boils down to the project that you get into and the leadership you are under. Often the projects are under evaluated and billed too. So the pressure comes over the developers to put in additional effort. Also there are many recruits without enough project and often developers are made to work outside their area of expertise or comfort zone. This makes life tough especially if the project is a short term one and you don't have enough time to learn.
good,"Would not recommend this as a first experience but especially because the program is not well managed."
good,"Its a Vendor Based organisation and the projects are throughout several places within Kuala Lumpur. Hence you will be posted to onsite coordinating and managing I.T. projects. Most of their client are from banking and insurance domains. "
good,"it is a good company with lots of opportunity to travel outside and make money."
good,"Best place to learn, high quality training has been provided with sort of facilities."
good,"Decent job security but brutal hours due to offshore/onsite model. Forget about your life. People are good but planning, project execution, skill levels of offshore team are very mediocre. If you are a US Citizen or have a green card, stay away from this company. H1 people, not bad compared to other Indian companies"
good,"Job security is good but the management is not good."
good,"I have learned many things like, more aggressive towards the achievements with in the team work and understanding and working towards the management requirements and adhering standard legal agreements as per the process set."
good,It was a small company that is run by my friend. It is small small start up company.Good for a fresher.
good,"nice place to work, but if you got Kolkata location, not good for you!"
good,"Good company with bad managment in middle level."
good,"Nice place to work"
good,Job training was poor and inconsistent. My training class went through 4 trainers in 8 weeks.
good,Cognizant Technology Solutions is not a good place to work.They allways try to cover key issues and convience the client that they are doing a great favour.Please dont believe that.They have no idea what quality means.
good,Learned a quiet a few technologies but I was not exposed to front end technologies so being full stack developer I felt it should be given opportunity for them to learn
good,"Lack of cooperation between teams, No option to improve the technical skills. No encouragement to move foreword.Lack of communication between the team member aswel with management."
good,Manager and HR will not tell you the policies or other things transparently. HR will ask to check with manager and Manager will ask to check with HR. No employee engagement activity.
good,"The management style is a bit of a joke.  It's so scattered that it's really hard to tell there's any management at all.  For example: I received no training for my job.  I just had to figure it out as I went, which is something I've done many times before so it was no big deal, however it increases the turnover because not everybody can do that.  We get random rule changes at irregular intervals and often are dinged for making mistakes that were policy a few weeks prior.  It's a haphazard and stressful place to work, and all the problems come from management.  The work itself is difficulty level: fall off the log.  If it wasn't for the frustration of having no guidance, no clear direction, and fairly poor tools, it would be a great place to work."
good,Company is good however depends on the project that we are working in. management is not identifying the potential of the skilled resources in my project
good,The projects are not there. The salary is less. Dont want to work here again. The people are good at the  company though. Loved to be with them. Thank you.
good,"Pros"
good,"Not so bad, few people in the organization are very bad attitude and spoiling the company fame and name."
good,I have definitely grown in my career but not at the PACE I would have wanted. Management was really poor. There was not much encouragement for upskilling
good,"There have been Management Issues.Management offers to listen your problem and sort it out , but it not happens."
good,"Cognizant hire in bulk and when they have no work, they fire easily without any reason. We cant think about stability and work life balance specially in Google Project."
good,"There are some really good teams out there in Cognizant. But there's no cross functional trainings. The compensations are so less that you would be better off without them. The management, the work load and the ratings depend on how good you are with the higher management. So try your luck!"
good,Management is pretty terrible. The attendance policy is ridiculous..  Communication is pointless and there's no much room for growth from what I've seen. Pay could be more for everything you deal with.
good,"I have been working from home since I started 11 yrs ago.  The only pay increase are bonus payments once a year, which really doesn't amt to much at all.  There really isn't any hard part of the job, just learn what you are suppose to be doing and do it correctly.  My Manager is one that lets you know how well you are doing and if you have any questions feel free to contact her."
good,"Cognizant is an American multinational corporation that provides IT services, including digital, technology, consulting, and operations services. It is headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey, United States. Cognizant is included in the NASDAQ-100 and the S&P 500 indices."
good,"I have seen a lot of politics played in this company, This demotivates the employees and reduces their output. I got the opportunity to work with different clients and learned new things. The management is very poor in this company"
good,"Good infrastructure, and other basic facilities, but work-life balance gets disturbed. No job security. good place for getting experience. professional work Culture."
good,This could be a place to get a great start in the field but management is running the place to the ground. This is a vendor that i honestly dont think cares if the workers have a long term employment. You can advance and there is opportunity but again management only cares if they receive a bonus. Swag is given to only friends of management and there is no respect for adults. You are treated and talked to horribly if you are not liked.
good,I do not feel comfortable giving a review of the company given I still work here thank you. The days are short. The company is new. That's really it. The best part is the free food.
good,"Not a great company to work for, anymore. The company should focus on the Associates more and recognize them as needed. Focus is only on the time spent in office and not on the work."
good,stressful job there is lack of upper management and it is hard to take days off when you have accrued PTO because of lack of other supervisors and coverage.
good,I think it's a great company as compared to it's peers but beware of the politics.  Too much politics. Too much of work pressure and lot of operational constraints that takes up majority of your work
good,"Good learning environment will be provided for projects but no or limited freedom to choose technologies/projects. Moreover, there are less opportunities for career progression and compensation and benefits are very low."
good,"Not a good option to start career with as they Have lot of people on bench as freshers"
good,"No Work Life balance."
good,Subsumed many companies over the past 3 years but have not integrated them well. Limited business knowledge in US industries and culture.  Lots of talk poor execution and employees pay with layoffs.
good,Job culture is bad. Work-life balance is not there. Management is bad and full of politics. Good initial package but not much increment thereafter. Good onsite opportunities available.
good,"Cognizant is a very aggressively managed company.  The ""pursuit teams"" are constantly trying to close the ""next deal:, but many times they have to scramble to assemble a team to deliver on the promises made.There is also a single minded focus that all positions should be filled by someone moved to the U.S. from off-shore."
good,"Lots of. I am listing only few of them. First of all, respect your freshers. Make the system little transparent. Apply some kind of meritocracy instead of random and haphazard process for the selection of freshers in the project."
good,"Um dos problemas maiores da empresa sao seus gestores, e vem das hierarquias mesmo, desde o diretor ate o supervisor, que nao trabalham diante profissionalismo e sim de acordo conceitos pessoais, onde caracterizam pessoas pelo que elas fazem de imediato a eles e nao pelas proprias qualificaçoes."
good,"It might be a good opportunity for starting your career if you do not have any other opportunity."
good,I had a pressure work with team and no management support for my growth and if you go with salary i never seen such a waste salary for senior candidates
good,I did work in India at Cognizant in Hyderabad. I was hired in U.S as a full time employee but the treatment of the U.S employee at client location by the Cognizant Manager was not good and its demotivating.
good,Lack of options to move forward or upward.  It is difficult to have people desire you should not be promoted or given a raise when you have never even spoken with them.
good,You can learn the technologies on your own or with the project requirement but never expect career growth and good salary. Had politics just like other service-based companies.
good,"One cannot expect growth and advancement. "
good,"Cognizant is good for learning  for project management & good culture & fun activities"
good,"Good to work and chance to explore or enhance our skills on our leisure periods. Work Culture has to be planned accordingly to avoid pressure/stress on daily basis. Overall If I get a chance again, happy to take my career. Thanks"
good,Its a good company to work with. Has many different kind of projects which gives exposure for learn. work is quite hectic most of the time. apart from work there will be many extra curricular activities organized for employees.
good,"Management needs some serious training.People needs some serious management skills  company develops when its better from roots, the envelopment from roots need to resorted again."
good,"In a typical day in my last position I fulfilled management tasks of opening and closing  the request facility. preparing first draft, response to client emails and internal emails across the other team member, also negotiating specific terms with clients, handling SH-Inbox on rotation, coordination with credit and legal team as per the requirement."
good,It was a great place to work but had many cons like no fun and entertainment on the job. always work stress and pressure and no medical benefits provide low salary and long working hours.
good,"It is Good but have to work with the unlikely Project Management."
good,"As the job profile fall under BPO category, there were so many points to follow and hence not that comfortable working under BPO. There is highly confidentiality in work which is good in one way."
good,Energetic company. Among the top ones and growing at a fast paced rate and adding with acquisition each vertical is almost a sedate business unit and acts independently
good,"Needs better intermediate leadership.Stringent work deadlines."
good,"To work with cognizant i learned a lot of things like team handling,objection handling and many more. For me its a great experience for me and it may be beneficial for my future tasks."
good,"Top management force work on the junior analyst. No job security, can be ramped down without notice. Zero recognization of your talent. Can be asked to relocate or leave the job"
good,"Core translation job."
good,IT life will not suit to smart peoples ... there culture is worst I have ever seen . Every one will know about you and they know how to give work to us .
good,"Good company to work for, but salary hike is very less."
good,It is good workplace. I have been associated with this company for over 3 years now. Has lot of opportunities. Pay was initially good and so was the management.
good,Not satisfied with work culture. In my 10 years long career didn't find any other company with manager driven decisions and no transparency. Will not recommend anyone
good,Excellent clients to work with but not very good work life balance.Good co workers.Enjoyable part of the job is getting the opportunity to wok with Fortune 500 clients.
good,Mostly baised because of the geographic location. I am specifically talking about my project. There was too much of work and very less space for career growth. I was trained on mainframes but the project I was working had a obsolete technology. Even a google search won't fetch any details of that.
good,After completing the office  hour timings then  after the managers takes long meetings for more than one hour which delays the leaving time. and everyday it happens
good,Started worked as fresher and learned a lot over the years. I'll join again If opportunity exist. Over all a good experience
good,Love the people I work with but the cognizant contract no room for advancement and no ability to be brought on as a no contractor employee
good,It's a contracting job and there is no guaranteed to be hired on permanently. They give three months at a time to renew your contract if they feel the need for it. Data entry was the main part of the job.
good,"Learning space , Fun place , politics, lack of transparency and leadership, good life balance."
good,Learnt a lot in this company as it's mine first.A good work place for freshers and experienced.co-workers are supportive. The hardest part of the job:- weekend support
good,Cognizant is a growing company and is acquiring good market share. It has good planned growth and has great benefits. It offers good opportunities to offshore team members.
good,This company is poisoned with regional biasing and group-ism. This company has grown over last 10 years during which lot many leaders have exploited it to its fullest.
good,Natural inclination to inspire and motivate co-workers to perform independently and maintain effective performance levels..
good,"Its moderate company to join. Work Life balance is totally not there in cognizant. Also, the perks are not the best and neither of market standards. However you do have a job security at Cognizant"
good,"was in US shift, learned AR process, supported by co-workers"
good,Today most of the people are opting to get  job in govt sector like banks and other govt institutions rather working  MNC mainly because of stress and long working hours to meet the targets that the management has decided while getting the business.
good,"I completed my training "
good,"could be better managed at people level"
good,The company culture is great! Many opportunities to be promoted within and recognized for your hard work and achievements.
good,Lot of work and very less work life balance. Used to work for almost 12 hrs a day. its hell lot of different in product companies
good,"I have enjoyed working there.  I have learned very much and loved my job.  The PTO that was carried over from ING was great.  I wish that my job would not have been sent offshore, because it was a great experience and I was really good at it."
good,Highly qualified co-workers. Learnt a lot of new technical stuff. Hardest part of the job is dealing with clients and management policies.
good,Job Satisfaction depends on the kind of work a person is offered in a project and also on that person. The company is definitely a mixture of good and bad projects. I have only been in two. So not so much experience there to write a proper review.
good,Cognizant has a good culture and employees are given a diversified learning opportunities across multiple verticals which will allow employee to gain market knowledge.
good,"I’ve seen Cognizant make promises to customers first then scramble to make it happen.  Workload is heavy for one person then if something goes wrong it could be used against you.  While verbally saying to take vacation, they need you to give it up for the job u are doing especially while on assignment away from home.  Then deduct it all from you at end of year and verbally say “you should have planned better”.  You email your supervisor for updated info but he is so busy he doesn’t respond for days, if at all.  They promise a job schedule but it is a moving target.  Our manager had a bad temper and pulled us into office and yell to get his point across.  Unfortunately, Many misunderstandings due to cultural and language differences in my opinion."
good,Was nearly 100% utilized over fourteen years.  Seldom was concerned with being staffed at this very large company.   Became well versed in all areas of the telecommunications industry
good,"System needs changing and system needs to be more rewarding for the associates. Plenty of room to improve."
good,"The opportunities provided are immense"
good,"It is a good company to gain experience in the domain. It also gives the associate a great platform to learn and apply the qualities you need."
good,"Not the place you want to be if you mind having to relocate every time you reassigned to a new project. If you are rolled off a project and they can't find you another one, you will be terminated and you get stuck in whatever metropolitan area they asked you to relocate to."
good,"Life at Cognizant depends on which team you belong to. In the US, luckily I had a good team, but things are difficult at offshore. Compensation and benefits are at par with industry standard, but the work culture at Cognizant India is pathetic."
good,"The company does not show much sympathy for the welfare of its employees, in most cases the employees are the ones who demand its benefits. with respect to the market their salary offer is lower."
good,"Nothing to talk about. Please see my ratings. Good for freshers. Also people may get onsite opportunities, depends on their work and project requirements."
good,Many leadership personal exercise open bios policies towards their own people from South India resulting in quick promotions to climb the high ranks comparing to other US citizens. Layoff numbers for none Indians is much higher than Indians. Many none Indians at the end of their assignments are laid off only to be replace by H1-B1 visa holders.
good,"i started my career in Cognizant. The opportunities were pretty good and I had a good foundation. The clients which I worked for were very big in their own fields and the server maintenance of those clients gave a very good exposure"
good,"Long days , extended travel, working in the onsite offshore model was valuable, enjoyed the ability to cross multiple industries. overall a positive experience . The company has a high burn out rate due to the travel and long hours."
good,"No work life balance at all. Salary is very low.  Even if you dont have any work, you have to complete 45 hours a week. Management is also not that good."
good,"You work at a client location where you follow their schedule and are constantly going to meetings. Most of which are not really necessary as same issues are repeated on a daily basis. "
good,"Project work was good, however the culture in that specific project was toxic."
good,"I broke my hand off the clock and wasn't cleared to return after surgery. So they fired me calling it "" Job abandonment "" So I guess just don't get injured."
good,PTO 10 days every year with no set time in to accrue more. In order to receive more days you have to Roll over time (out of your 10days) to the following year.
good,No transparency from management. They seem to do everything last minute with no clear direction or realistic time lines. They state that they want to increase the North American work force but continue to move jobs off shore
good,There is no job security. Benefits are negligible. Leave policy is very bad. Overall work-life balance is not possible while working. Management is very horrible.
good,The work scenario in CTS is pretty average. The pay is very basic and the learning curve is also pretty flat. Overall an average place to work. Facilities give are also very basic and should be way better than what they give.
good,"Good Company to work with. Good scope of learning and exploring new domains."
good,"They need to promote more people from within and to pay more in accordance with the cost of living of the area. They also need a better system to advance the careers of the employees, I want to learn selenium and automation but they keep giving manual work."
good,". Different work culture in different projects depending on client location"
good,"Intense organization to work with, lots going on, many tasks and associates. Very fast paced environment, with little focus.  Factory setting, with a top-down structure."
good,"Good working"
good,"It was a good company. Cognizant is a multinational corporation that provides IT services, including digital, technology, consulting, and operations services. It is headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey, United States."
good,No value for talented resources. long term managers are not doing work just serving by doing politics in team and spoiling team members career by giving low rating to terminate talented resource.
good,"A parte operacional da empresa é simplesmente fantástica, pois lida direto com o cliente e o ramo é TI, logo desempenhando a demanda tudo se resolve, e o que não estiver dentro do esperado logo se resolve de forma interna."
good,Overall to rate cognizant can do still much better by placing right people with good team handling skills. Pressures have to be reduced for the comapny to grow in a smooth way
good,It was a good job to work at.  I just wish it was a permanent position. I would love to work here again. They just have to be able to balance work and outside problems separately.
good,"However salary increments are very less. Bonus/incentives are received twice a year however it is included in the included in the CTC and according the rating you might get the full incentive or that might be deducted"
good,"Cognizant is a good company for a first job, if you need a first experience but not a good one to stay in long term. There is no possibility to make carrier there. A typical day, is starting at 8 AM, ends at 5 PM (one hour break) and you spend the hole day before your computer, the working chairs are not adapted so when the end of the day comes, you have backache. "
good,Talented co-associates
good,Started off as a great company to work for. Then my supervisor disappeared and we’ve gone over a month with no supervisor or support. No opportunity for advancement was told directly that they only intend on hiring from outside for upper management positions.
good,"Pros:"
good,"Good company , so many jobs are offered by this company "
good,"Bad Managers - no attention or feedback to employees"
good,"Was able to learn quite a few things. However, there was no work life balance and always used to get the projects with very hectic deadlines which caused lot of issues."
good,"1. worst work place culture"
good,"Was a good company, now it lost all the charm as it let go many good leaders. The main business and profit making part is near shoring and offshoring."
good,Cognizant is a good place to work and learn but never expect career growth. Typical diplomatic managers expectations at onshore. Lots of learning opportunities.
good,"If you work in support project, we can sit in same team for years and get some contacts to get benefit. if you work in pure development team, you will be released often and the new team will considered us new joiner to the company. For technical growth development team is good. For career growth support project is good."
good,All managers are average. They don't know how to manage the things in this company. My work was to handle the database as well to maintain it. I learn by myself. Nobody teaches me anything.
good,The company is good only for those who have good projects under them. The project allocation is totally random. It does give importance to academic qualification and experience.
good,"As a Company, Cognizant is a good experience when it comes to Employee benefits and perks, shared services functions and vendor operations. But there are a few departments in which the management is so poor that the work life balance goes for a complete toss. Right from team lead to Director, people are only bothered about targets and revenue generation. This has resulted in extended overtime hours, working on weekly offs, health issues, job dissatisfaction and hence high attrition rate."
good,"It should be noted this is a review specifically about the Brazil branch. I've no doubt the US one, or even the Argentina one, is a much better picture, so take this with a grain of salt."
good,"I have been working with Cognizant over 2 years and worked multiple projects.They have very limited presence in Canada, Bringing lot of resources from off shore."
good,"No work life balance, stressful, always a running day. Management always look towards work closure irrespective of employee needs/personal priorities. Under paid specially for the resources traveled from offshore."
good,"CTS is good company for a starter the only company which gives jobs during recession time, Security of the job is good as it gives a lot of Oppurtunity in and around CTS in any Domain , As it is a Service based company hike is very very Lean and Management is not that much good"
good,"One of the best and the leading company in the world, as we all know to keep it that way it need lots of effort. Competition is the moral of the company. In order to understand the true meaning of competition one has to work with this organisation once in their lifetime. "
good,"Workplace culture can be improved. Hard work is not valued much. Being working here from little over an year, never got a hike. False promises from HR'S who hired."
good,Good to work and job security is not there. The freshers can start their career  int he company.The work culture is good and management is ok and systems are still has to be improve
good,"For some of those, it is great company to work. But there is no balance in terms of job security..... Nothing much to say about this company except getting project is difficult."
good,"When i joined this firm it was really a good company and have so much to learn with in.but now a days management sucks.HR policies are going to be pathetic."
good,"Fun based company "
good,"Can learn many technologies here "
good,Nothing new.. perks tend to go disappear as you on-board more and more employees.. bangalore location.. manyata tech park .. paid transportation......
good,"Not good for  fresher if he is given Kolkata location."
good,"The company is provide a good platform to freshers however the monitory benefits are not much. The overall employee befits are average as compared to other MNCs. "
good,Always associates have to lose their life to satisfy managers and customers but nothing in return. personal life gets disturbed if you are really committed to cognizant.
good,"*Need more support and encouragement from managers."
good,"1, Good place to work. "
good,"Cognizant is a good company if you are willing to stick to your domain and grow. But, if you one plans to switch their technology it is not easy to find opportunities."
good,"A good organization for starting carrier. "
good,"Cognizant used to be a very good company, that's the reason why there are many people who are more than 15+ years with Cognizant. But as the company grows, it becomes less employee friendly and more board / investor friendly."
good,"I learnt how this company will take sudden decision and without prior info they change the rules."
good,The culture is not that good and there is no work life balance. The Management hierarchy is not employee friendly to discuss the issues and the problems.
good,"Workday Functional EIB Inbound Outbound Integration "
good,"Worklife was quite monotonous with CTS with limited areas to explore career opportunities. Since I worked for less than 18 months , I couldnt find many reasons to stick with this company."
good,"Totally depends upon the account you worl for."
good,"Good Lateral packages but less hike there after. Not much growth opportunity in a particular role. "
good,My first job and had a good learning curve. Higher managements are supportive and professionals. Work location is good and facilities can be improvised.
good,"Normal Work Place...Not so good. Poor technical opportunity."
good,"Good worklife balance and other so many inspirational, CSR activities and other benefitial events are being held."
good,"Great growth plans, good opportunities for front line associates, able to gain significant skills in multiple types of business"
good,It is good place to work with challenging projects in critical environment in this organization. Providing proper leadership experience and trainings.
good,Not very good in terms of job culture and management. Salary benefit is below market standard. Some what job stability is there
good,"learnt team management, and fun environment in office, superb coworkers.mostly the office timings are not satisfied it is the main hardest part of the job."
good,Inadequate compensation. Not enough training materials. Poor and inadequate incentives provided to top employees. Not enough international opportunities. Poor work life balance.
good,"Most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people.  It was a tough place to work at due to the lack of transparency within the managerial staff and account representatives.  "
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"Pros - Growing company, lots of users, It's a product that is contributing to the world."
good,"Usually the typical day is longer like  many other consulting jobs, I have learned a lot on during my job. Overall it is a hierarchy driven company, sometimes the decisions goes unbalanced. Which I would consider the hardest part of the job, otherwise the job is enjoyable we will have our own freedom to execute the jobs."
good,"I work as PLC Product testing and support the develpoer team by testing the developed software."
good,"Poor salary structure."
good,"Daily responsibility for assigning all work to members of my team. Research expert in the area of contracting and background investigations. Six Sigma developer of coordinating all work with the DSM site for contracting and background investigations. Review of work for contracting teams (life, annuity and retirement services) along with continuing to QA agent background investigations. cross training plans, time off oversight, knowledge transfers to new teams in new locations, procedures, management of QA review management reports to show all work needing to be reviewed, is actually done. Support and reporting of Trends, Data Collection, Peer to Peer work Transition work to global offices for both our client and my management team."
good,"As with most global teams, the clock is always running and every major time zone contributes to the work at hand. In addition, as with many South Asian IT services firms, the onsite and offshore delivery model is challenging and one that requires all parties to be very flexible and highly communicative. Our clients are the center of all that we do and the reason we exist."
good,Hard to work but can learn.  Should take own efforts to align with market changes and developments.  Trend changes are reflected in  projects / work only after a very  long time                                        .
good,good work place. enjoyed working at this place. job security doesnt exist.good team members to help out always.fun loving wit cts
good,"Work culture should be improved."
good,Talk to clients on a day to day basis and transfer knowledge to the development team so they can begin development.  Everything besides management is okay due to the fact of the individuals that work there.  Everyone is very talented and creative.
good,overall a good company but you can not change project before 18 months
good,"I processed referrals and notifications for multiple specialties on a daily basis. I got to work at 9:00 AM and left at 5:30 PM. I learned how to manage my time, I accurately processed referrals and notifications. They constantly changed the processing steps on a daily basis, so I learned how to roll with the punches quickly and accurately. We worked with at least 6 systems simultaneously every day. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the lack of organization with management. I loved my coworkers, they were the best part of the job. I got along with each and everyone of my coworkers."
good,Wonderful place to work with effective co-workers but appraisal process deviates from the performance.
good,Data entry all day long.  Co-workers are friendly.  Management is very nice.
good,"Be with your team and the team would be with you. There are no such authority protocols here, you can talk to anyone, and the best part is even the CEO would reply to your mails. Yes we are a team."
good,"I was the go between for sales representatives of bone growth stimulators and health insurance companies. I enjoyed the work, but management was not in place."
good,"Productive and love-to-work kind of place. Learned a lot of techonogies in here. Co-workers are nice, friendly."
good,Good team work.And good recognition for the work performed.
good,"Not good for BPO carrier orientated people, Cognizant has very limited scope for growth."
good,"* Be essential to Clients"
good,"A good place to learn and master all aspects of  IT Industry , management, internal and external customers , work life,"
good,"In TCS i had served more than 7 years, each and everyday have learned lot of good things offcially and personally, how to improve personality and client satisfication, minkle with management and co-workers lot of things."
good,"Roles & Responsibilities: "
good,"Worst process where i was working, nothing was going in the right way."
good,"Good place to work and learn, but they will not teach you the easy way. "
good,"Will not like to say anything here. Does not wish to mention any pros or cons here at this forum."
good,"productive and Quality oriented."
good,"I learnt a lot about Secretarial in CTS. And I was guided by my seniors well. Since there is no work life balance, and to have new learning, I am expecting a change in my job. But overall I have been thankful and I am always thankful to my previous employers."
good,a typical day at work
good,".The company didnt have a good management, but the work environment was fun."
good,"Legacy IT operations with focus on on-going operations. Learned more about ITSM process, financial budgeting. Management is weak with outsiders treated really badly. Job opportunities are more based on ""who you know"" than job fitment."
good,"I grew and learned plenty at this job and I definitely increased my skill set. However, the lack of advancement and culture created a toxic experience"
good,"Nice to work, needs to work extra time when project demands."
good,"The company is good at giving wages as per the industry standards. Work environment is little stressful, management needs to be supportive to motivate effort, rewards and recognition needs to be promoted in the company."
good,I worked as Programmer analyst trainee for 6 months and learned a lot in terms of technology. We have to sit for bench for around  to 2 months in the period.
good,Good for freshers. After one year of doj associate will be promoted to jda. Later there will be no hike in salary. Need to struggle a lot. No management support.. No workculture
good,Good company to work money is also good in starting and good growth and if you have good luck then you will get an onsite opportunity as well .best of luck
good,"Previously a very well paying employer now lacking the charm of providing work Life Balance, Good pay, Job culture resorting to ways of Not promoting/compensating employees rather than deserved encouragements and rewards. Underwent big authority changes recently with big promises of a brighter future but still to prove its worth."
good,A typical day at work involves meetings with client site and managing changes on the client infrastructure. It involves a lot to do with client infrastructure and maintaining their changes on the website.
good,"No increment, incentive. No improvement . Totally I'm damaged . Here is mentally Torchar  and target is more than salary. Openly say very low salary. ....."
good,No great exposure. Typical mindset. Bad politics. Experience not necessarily match the level you get in organization and same goes for salary. Procedures can be more optimised.
good,"Good work life balance. "
good,"The teams I worked with were very talented in their areas of expertise. Many traveled from different parts of the country and were SMEs who were not needed on a full-time basis. They were great networkers and knew who to reach out to for additional information and ensured that they met their targets leading to the highest client ratings and add-on business. "
good,"Management failed to manage deliverables while I was on maternity leave and consequently the client ended the contract. I will say, however, that their separation package was highly comparable to those I have experienced at larger companies."
good,"Good company."
good,Job security is pretty low.  No real process for filling jobs other than a blind list of skills.  Could have used more training and direct support to ensure success from day one.
good,"Last resort. Management one sided, unrealistic productivity and cliques beyond belief. It was nice but once you have a voice, you’re looked at like a problem"
good,Great work environment. Easy to communicate with team and TL and management team. Training is provided at the beginning and refreshment is per request.
good,Enjoyed working in my position but it was stressful due to you think you are safe in your job but then you are told the assignment is going to be centralized or ended.
good,Fresher should not join companies like this as it will hamper their productivity.
good,If you are an adult looking for advancement and stability this is not a company for you if you are young and only looking for a paycheck then this is a great opportunity. I spent 2 years employed with cognizant thinking things will get better. You can be bounced last minute project to project. There is no real HR support like other companies offer. If you have any benefit or pay questions you have to email overseas who sends you a vague response and does not address your issue this by far was the most unprofessional company I worked for and sadly they have so many open  cases because of this
good,"Cognizant has overall very good management. Policies are employee friendly, workculture is good and healthy. Only con is regarding salary; appraisals are not very good and salary hike is very less."
good,"Management is the main reason why Cognizant struggles. The micro managing of a self managing position stressed their employees. Management was passive aggressive about employees needs and when things weren't done, the blame fell on you despite your numerous attempts to resolve the issue."
good,Cognizant is digital focused company with world wide opportunities in tech fields. If want to work overseas there are opportunities a plenty. Self directed learning is encouraged.
good,"overall ok company to work. No travel provided, rather ask employees to relocate"
good,"As the company is growing, the former resources are paid less and getting promotion is tough. Management of projects can be improved and resources interest for technology should be understood and trained."
good,Sem muitos critérios para avaliação. Pontos positivos e pontos negativos.
good,"Depands on client you work with ; Poor Delivery or client managers"
good,"Nothing to review much. Don’t force me to give the review which i don’t want to. "
good,"Nothing as such."
good,"This company is a jugaad writ large.  This is not the insult it might seem; an inelegant, jury-rigged solution is still a solution and they do get things done.   While there may not be any training, job descriptions might be completely deceptive, and there is no tactical plans for how to get things done, they hire people who can figure out to do without training or supervision, making up for all organizational failures.  Everything I’ve run into so far is a kludge, but everyone can’t be Apple and prefer elegance to speed."
good,"boring work life"
good,There is no clear transparency in regards to forecast and also job security. Management is not that much approachable. No equal opportunities and no cross functionality.
good,No encouragement to hard workers to grow up in the ladder. Hike is minimal and promotions are hard to come by. Overall very difficult for employees who traveled from offshore to onsite to survive.
good,The people sitting at higher designations tend to influence a lot of politics over others as a show of supremacy. This ruins the work culture. They will made you do all the dirty work while they sit at the top eating fruits of that labor.
good,This company is ok to work for.. but doing jobs with a company that only take on projects for other companies can be bad do to the projects are always ending or downgrading they have  poor management skills and language barriers is a problem..
good,"Only hire for short time , No Mentorship , You are on your own , They don't care about you , Mixed work environment , you have to bring your own experience on board"
good,"• Gave me a good amount of experience."
good,"Very stressful work place , lot of work load and very less benefits. Salary is very minimum , no fun activities, very strict atmosphere and micro managing."
good,"The company is good but the managers of some projects do politics which made me feel the company its self is bad."
good,"sometime back working in cognizant was good idea, but now management is taking weird decisions. neither client nor employee's are happy.  CTS is loosing hold on business."
good,"Overall work culture is good."
good,Worked as a Data Scientist in Cognizant.Work Balance is good.But job security is not that great.Learned a lot from peers and the hardest part is to convince the management.
good,Good company to work with except for few of the non-operating senior members of the team creating a negative energy in the working environment. If the management focuses on this issue then the new joiners to this company would love to work in this place.
good,I leave because shift switch 6 times in 5 months. Management lack on communication. I have great experience and meet amazing people. Overall is decent company to work.
good,"Your talent is secondary, only if you are the right palace and time, you will get promotions or hikes. If you fight with you manager you might get better opportunity but you will get in to bad books."
good,Overall good company . Life Balance with work varies from project to project . Very few managers trying to understand employee's concern . Project Delivery is everything .
good,"Work Life Balance is terrible. Very Less numbers of leaves, even though you have leaves if it is not approved its LOP. Not a good management. However, the only thing that will let stay is job security and some how salary."
good,"I have been with Cognizant for approx. 8 years and find it  nice place to learn and work. At times, there is less support from management  however overall it is a fine place to work and maintain a work-life balance."
good,The projects you would be working on are not great projects that help you catapult in your career. Low salary compared to other companies. Good training program. The environment is laid back generally you would have a couple of members doing most of the work for the team.
good,Unable to balance personal life with work life. Since I join this company I m working over the weekend as well. We almost spend our 12 to 13 hours in office.
good,"Gostei de trabalhar lá, mas não tinha perspectiva de crescimento por ser terceirizada do Google. Não ganhávamos os mesmos salários apesar das mesmas funções."
good,Had a bad experience with rotating shifts and support project and devoid of coding oppurtunities and victim of internal politics inside this marvellous organisation.
good,Not happy with work life. You dont get to do what you want to do. Salary is insufficient. Things have changed over the years and I am not happy with the policies now.
good,"I have been working at Cognizant Technology Solutions full-time"
good,"processed assigned claim workflow"
good,The work environment was very unprofessional and management was very poor. When you had a problem and voiced it to your supervisor they would not care.
good,"It was a bad unorganized work culture.One cannot find the POC  for his.her queries properly."
good,"It is a decent place to work but the work life balance seems non-existent in the company's operations in India. However, it was a decent experience and a good place for starting your professional career."
good,"Cognizant Technology Solutions provide a great work environment and provide great training."
good,"Everything depends on the Boss you will be working under. So, of you get good boss, you can get to work on different new technology. Otherwise, you will be sacked"
good,"Cognizant has a good number development projects. I enjoy my work.The work culture is also okay. "
good,"I have been with Cognizant for more than 7.5 years and find it  nice place to learn and work. At times, there is less support from management  however overall it is a fine place to work and maintain a work-life balance."
good,A good place to start as a fresher but you should move out of it after 2 years or so. Salary hike is not satisfactory. The work and life balance does not exist.
good,"No new challenges, always at the mercy of your manager. No credibility to efforts. Worst appraisal process. No value for work/life balance. No appreciation for deserving candidates."
good,People work here like a machines ... No fun in work ... Manager treat people like school students.... Less job security... No external trainings provided..
good,"Good compensation , training opportunities. Good in legal matters. Lousy senior management. Not proactive in nature.Good health insurance benefits. Not enough paid time off."
good,Cognizant pays salary is not equivalent to the contribution what I have made and there is always imbalance and there is no clarity on the growth road map.
good,"Poor Work Culture"
good,Productive work place is you are willing to relocate & will get Promotion only if your manager is willing to do so. Manager Changes very frequently. I have Multiple Manager in span of 3 months.
good,"It is a very unorganized  place to work. The systems don't work at all. One system doesn't know what the other system is doing. They talk about promotion, but never come through with promoting people."
good,"It was a good experience with Cognizant. It provides and treat its employees with care and the provides  customers  with good, timely and prompt services."
good,"All based on the manager."
good,"I have been working at Cognizant Technology Solutions full-time over 3.5 years."
good,Good place to start career. The upper management is really thoughtful. They are trying their best. Problem is too much internal politics. You can't stay neutral.
good,Nothing in particular. The real test of IPPs would be now with the advancement of digital shift and push for automation and only the best would challenge the future.
good,"At the end of day, it's what the client wants, that needs to be done. Any learning is after what the client and cognizant wants. The only way to learn here is on job, and for that you need to be in right project and right team."
good,"Being a part of Cognizant once can try to learn different technologies which is dependent on individual."
good,"Good company to start IT Career but low appraisal."
good,It was my first job as a fresher and took sometime to get accustomed with the culture and work. It was indeed a great experience and excellent knowledge growth.
good,"Time based promotions instead of merit"
good,"Constantly on call with Offshore Team. Almost no Work/Life Balance."
good,"For a company that has all of it's roots in tech service BPO there is very little innovation, proactive thinking, or logic.  They seem happy to blame their own shortcomings on the position they take as a Vendor Contractor, but it usually is simply passing the buck."
good,There are good projects where there is good amount of work life balance and working for such a huge organization has it is advantages and challenges .
good,"Pros"
good,The amount of work pressure is high. However the learning you get is immense. There are lot of training programs and certifications provided by the organzation.
good,"Cognizant is a huge company, and your experience will solely hinge on the project you land. There is no overall Cognizant culture, as most of the time you will be a contractor working at a client site."
good,It's no so best place to work.  Cognizant is having 90% support projects and it's very difficult to maintain work life balance in Cognizant. Also no manager or hr will check that whether our role is as per our skill set or not.
good,"Most of my career I have been in CTS, it was a great place to work but that ideal is slowly being diminished."
good,"Deveriam colocar mais profissionais qualificados, pois sou testemunha de promoções por amizades, sem mostrar bom desempenho no trabalho."
good,"workplace culture is good. But management is not good at all."
good,Good company to work. Strict 9 hours policy is followed. So much pressure from the higher level. Need the help of managers for promotion and all others
good,Cognizant is a place where there are plethora of options to explore but it is the hierarchical management because of which one has to struggle. There is a lot of politics and people at mid senior level positions do not really take charge of situations and avoid transparency. It's only if you are good in their eyes you may get a promotion. Projects are good and the work depends on the project. Since the company is based very far from the main city it impacts your work life balance.
good,"Day to day operation, so almost busy, lot of learning  via E-learnings."
good,"Cognizant is an aggressive services company with decent company policies. It is good place to work and allows changing departments. Currently it is undergoing inorganic growth path,"
good,"Cognizant offers a somewhat steady and staid work culture.  As a contracting company, it is always at the mercy of its client with no real recourse.  Else it has been able to establish itself as a niche company."
good,"Cognizant does not provide the right platform to showcase your skill.After doing  lots of work for the project, at the end the right person does not get the right rating. Those who get good rating who are favorite to manager in terms of his/ her personal attachment."
good,"Overall good, good to work. Not too many development projects.Many projects and accounts."
good,The place is filled with people who want to explore more. Management is quite good enough to hand you over the responsibility if you are capable enough to manage alone.
good,"Joined here directly from B-School, business consulting wing of the firm is a notch above the rest of wings. There are some limitations though - skill development for new b-school hires is conspicuous by its absence."
good,"Cognizant is a BPO operation, so when a contract starts to fail, all employees suffer. Due to financial restraints, the account I am working with has been downsized and room for internal promotions has all but disappeared."
good,"i have learned different technology in Network."
good,Management should encourage new ideas. Make opportunities open for all deserving employee. Should encourage all associates to learn new business concepts.
good,"A good place to work. Very challenging projects undertaken which adds to pressure.  There is Job safety to a great extent.  However, the salary hike is not the top in the industry."
good,Client based project work so experience varies depends on client. Cognizant management for engineering and manufacturing solutions isn't very good - I barely had any contact with them. No room for forward growth and no real way to get more additional experience at your client.
good,"Less growth when you are struck in the same project. Work life balance is ok. Compensation is better. Management at senior level is good. Mid level manager aren't that great, with few exceptions."
good,"This organization used to be great but has saturated now. Has become too big a company with lot of bureaucracy. Performance review process is outdated. "
good,"Based on the project "
good,"As a consultant who will be working at client location, the support provided to do the business is good, but when it come to personal development and support CTS lacks way behind. They do not have a proper onboarding  system in place. I was not sure as to which practice line i was part of until 6months, neither was i introduced to my peers who are in the same practice line."
good,"Good Company with lots of technical opportunity"
good,"- Reporting Managers are not fair, they are biased."
good,"It's overall good experience of work which I got. They gave training on networking and related things. The management was also good."
good,"time management is crucial due to the location of the company, not really accessible to public transportation.  Work/life balance depend on the account you are with, not all accounts allows you to have an extra time for non-work related activities, also the only team building you'll have is the company team building, no budget for account/LOB.  Processing of documents with HR is not that okay."
good,"Cognizant is fastest growing company but less opportunity for employee with the value of employee. Less onsite opportunity, very poor resource utilization."
good,Workplace has been very learning. But there is no career growth and no advancement as far as monetary compensation is considered.
good,My experience at Cognizant was a mixed bag of good and bad.  There are many well meaning people located at the top management positions the managers who run the divisions are some of the nicest bosses I have ever had.  I just think the team managers at least in my case require some training in management skills and perhaps in training new recruits.  I personally felt like the team manager that was training me didnt have a lot of patience and she felt bothered having to train me more. It almost felt like she made up her mind that she was going to do eveything she could to make sure I couldnt get hired on permanently.  I tried my hardest but all i ever got was crticism on something I did wrong.  I did not once get any feedback on what I did right so I was always guessing on what to do.  That all seemed to change when she had to report to the account leader when she him and I would have a meeting all of a sudden he would say she had been trying to train me.  I just dont think he was getting the hole picture. She was also going through some emotional things and I think that being the head of an all female team she didnt take kindly to having a man join the team. She seemed to hate guys with comments she would say and how she talked about her ex husband.  I think her personal feelings towards him were coloring how she saw me. She is only human.  Anyway I just think they have to do a better job of training and not lump training a new person along with the responsibility of leading a Medicare team and all that entails on to someone and think they will do well and not sacrifice performance
good,"Nothing special. A usual IT company. Always gives preference to outsiders. If you are in bench for more than 2 months, they will ask you to resign the job."
good,"worst company to work for,less pay and hike,the hardest part of the job,your co workers, the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"People are given projects, rather than giving them the choices to select the best one for them. Manager employee relations definitely needs to improve."
good,Plagued with mid-level manager bureaucracy. Taking orthodox measures to manage company growth.Not meant for more than average talent in the industry as there is no organization growth.
good,"people are very workaholic they don't care what ever happens to the company as long as their pockets are full."
good,i am working in cts.i have a good exposure at cts.i had many offers at cts.no stress work at cognizant technology solutions.
good,It is a nice place to work if you are used to working at client sites and are willing to move within the U.S. when each project changes. Most of the Co-workers are from  off-shore. It can be a challenge sometime with language and and  things like that. Overall a great place to work.
good,"Overall not excellent to work but good to work"
good,"Good company if anyone looking for onsite opportunities."
good,My Co Workers are very friendly and helpful.This is my first company and i learnt many things in the testing domain and i was lucky enough to travel to Near shore location i.e Manila during my 2 year itself.
good,"Comparatively good and will provide facilities for growing professionals"
good,"I had an excellent work experience and provided enough support to learn new things and explore. But I am not impressed with their appraisal and promotion cycle, it is very poor"
good,Cool organization apart from making employees disappointed during promotion cycles. Not interested to talk much about it.
good,"Have never seen a worse projects and resources management. Politics and Favouritism rampant."
good,"Routine Work. "
good,"It always is a busy day at the office. Learned a lot of things and made good friends. good co-workers."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"Training is very poor and management is more worried about numbers, than making sure that agents are properly trained."
good,"a fast moving environment, lot of new learning. "
good,Good company but people around will not give a chance to explore your skills and try to block your capabilities everywhere
good,"Overall strong Senior management. Benefits are not that great compared to other companies. Slow career growth"
good,A good place to start of career but needs to take care of employee and not take them for granted. Also should pay as per market standards at the junior levels. Onsite opportunity at Junior level is very less as compared to Senior level.Employees should be given salary and other benefits on the basis of expertise and skills rather than counting their number of experience for every case
good,"Total exp is 6 years and i have learned lot of things. Work culture is good as well as the people. However, becuase of salary issue, i am looking for change"
good,The work hour was 9 hours. I learnt a lot from this company like how to manage the work with a given time period and how to deal with the management. I got some real good friends here. The hardest part of my jog was the process change which happens any time due to process shutting down. The most enjoyable part was the work time since I love whatever I do.
good,Cognizant is a employee friendly company.I had a great experience working there.
good,"Worklife balance is good here.Management should be more strong and they should give more focus on employees engagements."
good,"good place to work "
good,"good work, good culture , nice team and very decent projects. "
good,"I have mixed experience with this company. Not a good company to start your career. The senior management cares only about profit and there is no work life balance for the employees."
good,It procured high production and it creates friendly environment for its fellow employee
good,"Learned team management, set-up activities. The most enjoyable part is the different activities, also have done client management."
good,"I had to manage a project that was new and exciting, not to mention outside of my area of experience to a large extent. The concept of marrying technology with clinical research with regulatory  element was challenging and interesting. Also, adding to this mix were great clients and the team, quick witted, solution driven and excited for the job."
good,A descent company for startup.Good job security but poor compensation and benefits.
good,Working in Cognizant is overall good experience. I would not say the best but its good. Cognizant need to improve its training policies and at least arrange few fruitful training sessions about new technologies.
good,"Delivery Management,Complex Program Management. Too many Administrative activities."
good,"A typical day of work include working closely with the clients. Proactively running projects by communicating well with sound technical knowledge."
good,"I leaned client related queries, very helpful team members, my co-workers are very helpful to me, timings are not comfortable that is the hardest job and there is no any enjoyment in company always only work"
good,"For long timers, growth will be there depending on the management"
good,I have enjoyed very much in cognizant with my co-workers. But the  management is not so good as expected from a MNC. There were huge of politics. At the end of my 1.8 year with Cognizant I am Little bit hurted as they are not treated their employee as good as expected from a MNC.
good,"Good environment to learn"
good,"Cognizant is my first work place to start my career.  It is a very good learning curve and a work experience with Cognizant. I have learned how to manage the co-workers, offshore counterparts, etc. Testing, Project Management, Process, Client interaction and Resource Management are the keys areas I explosured. "
good,"El lugar de trabajo es agradable, la gente es muy agradable, el management es muy cambiante lo que genera cierta incertidumbre. Eligen bien a la gente en cuanto a cualidades individuales y valores."
good,"Long working hours but also dependent on client."
good,Cognizant with LBG as client has provide lot of exposures and been almost in all the Roles from Test Analyst to a Test Manager/Defect Manager within a short span of time.
good,Cognizant has a lot of clients in US so job security is better than other outsourcing services companies. However the work / life balance is very poor as its completely up to the client in US. Cognizant does not have a standardized work hours for its employees and let the clients manage them.
good,CTS has a very highly charged work environment.
good,Its a good place to work and learn so many new things . There are some helpful coworkers with whom working is really fun.
good,The company appraisal process is not up to the mark And Infra work scope is not good. The promotion and skill update processes are not up to the mark. Less Onside opportunity
good,Cognizant used to be a great place but recent years organizational policies have brought them downhill with hardly any prospect of promotions or advancements in your career. All they care is whether each and every resource is billed by the client or not.
good,At cognizant overall work culture at cognizant is good. i have spent enough time in organization and experienced the changes throughout the this period.
good,"The management in my project did not understand that we translate and not marely transcribe what we hear. They were also unwilling to listen to our overall problems related to our TLs or TMs. The HR activities were very few and far in-between. Just because i had a good team, it was bearable. Also, we were rebatched from our old company to the new one, due to which we felt we were not treateed well."
good,"it is ok company to work, need to stretch hours most of times in order to meet the deliverables. Alway client focused.. not a great workplace culture."
good,"My rating says it all; mediocre management, bad company culture and mediocre benefits. Pros: Salary and knowledge/training. Cons: Bonus and corporate culture"
good,"Job is stable"
good,"Poor management and Not a company to stick for a long time.  Many practice work in silos, Not much collaboration.  They don't know how to communicate with their employees."
good,Cognizant Technology Solutions. company is good place to work but few places/projects  environment makes unhappy. Growing company many opportunities to grow but very slow
good,"Cognizant is in a reorganizing phase and have clear plans in place, benefits of this would be visible in an year. There is a lot of scope for improving employee experience though."
good,Its was quite good.if your work for some days it's good. Its purely mortgage  based company. Extending shift no life balance as per my opinion. Increament  was not good.
good,"Thank you! It is a great place to work, learn and grow. The management is very helpful and promote a culture of hard work, trust and mutual respect. Great experience so far :)"
good,Cognizant is Multinatioanl Service company with wide range of Clients across the globe. Projects differ from small scale to large scale. Onsite opportunities and US Visa processing were great. Now it became difficult for Indian nationals and many quitting Cognizant. The management often reorganizing But still not stable. Now it's more crowded and less chance for growing/promotions. Moving between vertical/horizontal is very difficult. Many managers here are playing political games and skilled employees often get impacted.
good,"Nothing much to say. from wikipedia: Cognizant is an American multinational corporation that provides IT services, including digital, technology, consulting, and operations services. It is headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey, United States. Cognizant is part of the NASDAQ-100 and trades under CTSH. It was founded as an in-house technology unit of Dun & Bradstreet in 1994, and started serving external clients in 1996."
good,"It was fun initially but now the senior management are not supportive to their own teams. Hence planning for a move. "
good,For career growth People have to wait for long cycles. Feed back will take some time will be pushed to yearly cycle. Some how will be 3 to 5 years for promotion.
good,"Average work life balance. Culture is good here. Management is not transparent in all aspects, they maintain secrecy in most of the company updates. Apart from work no other things are entertained here."
good,"Good to learn new Technology ."
good,"Normal learning curve, it depends on projects."
good,So much depressed with pay slabs  - same workload and same designation with different pay. That creates onflicts among the employees. Growth and development is fully depends on the Supervisors.
good,"This is your typical meat grinder, where the absolute bare minimum of staffing is maintained at all times, and high performers are rewarded with additional workload/responsibility at the same level of compensation. Management does its best at each level, but it's so stratified that nobody really understands what's actually going on beyond their immediate reporting structure. But if you need a place to earn some cash or cut your teeth on the workplace, this place will work out well, and the benefits package is top-notch. Compensation tends to be on the lower end of the spectrum, and workplace stress is very high."
good,Good Place to work if you want a Stable job.Not a very ambitious career. Mid Level Management is below par. Overall a decent company with good benefits
good,"Good to work"
good,"Cognizant has good work culture and you have all kind of benfits."
good,"A known company,  specifically the importance of this particular project, greatly outweighs also inhibits the enjoyment of working there due to the micromanagement as well as pay, which barely allows anyone to survive from week to week, for one person, let alone if they have a family causing many to have to get second jobs, to barely scrape by which leads to exhaustion; lack of production and enthusiasm in effect rendering an enormous revolving door, physical and mental health issues, additionally, discouraged and scared employees of losing their job. If they fixed this financial and job security issue, they would have a booming, happy company, because everything else is great."
good,"Working with cognizant was very interesting. However, they should have a little more security and cameras. Also, management HR etc should communicate a little more with the employees."
good,"you will need to be able to handle reviewing very graphic pics, videos and very racist texts. Free snacks, drinks, free dress code. very laid back when i started but they began to micromanage you at the end of my employment. many supervisors and works quit in a short time frame due to bad management."
good,"If you need a job take one here while applying somewhere else. They do pay decently, however, they treat you like a child due to the ridiculous promises they make to clients. They prioritize the clients over employees. Overtime is always needed when I was there. If you have kids and need to be able to reach them this isn't the job for you. Very strict on phones and break times"
good,People at same designation have approximately 20 -30 k salary difference but doing similar work . And yearly bonus also not good enough . But you will have decent work life balance depending on project.
good,"Good workplace culture, With respect to career development, it differs based on the particular department within finance. might have to improve on the software application used"
good,"Relentless focus on the bottom line vs employee welfare...and promotions are only for certain special people, and if you are not one of them then forget getting promoted..."
good,"1. Huge variable pay and hence impacted take home"
good,"good starting place, but there are great places out there. they work flexxible with me being remote but they expect you to work a lot and you'll have a lot of calls with offshore at night."
good,"I have learnt a lot here in digital operations but low compensation and lack upskilling is cause of dissatisfaction."
good,"CTS is a leading company."
good,"Good Work culture"
good,"Good company, however plenty of dirty politics. Some leaders are arrogant and don't value people, Cost cutting, high revenue pressure You are expected to be available 24X7."
good,"Cultural barriers and challenges make it hard to acclimate to some teams and leaders."
good,Great .awesome ..enjoyed working with cognizant.learned more modules. Got training provided to enhance the knowledge. Good place to work for the technical people who has great knowledge on technical
good,Sometime you will get no work and sometime you will be overloaded with it but again it's fine because it should be like that. Colleges are really awesome which anyone would love to work with. Only bitter truth is poor management. Apart from poor management/higher management I feels everything is good.
good,This was my first time doing a data entry job. Everyone was excited as this was a new account with a 5 year minimum contract. The client pulled many processes which left employees scrambling to learn other processes. Some of the clients were highly emotional to hold such a high position. Having to train on new material with people who spoke English as a second language over the phone was torturous on both sides.
good,"All depends on the account you are assigned to and if you have to support an offshore team -  This makes a huge difference."
good,"Salary and benefits are very good and satisfied when compared to other companies."
good,Company provides learning opportunity. No timing constraints so good balance between work and personal life. poor management. Also no salary benefits.
good,"Fairly lax management means you aren't grinding your teeth, but that accountability can sometimes seem to be lacking."
good,A good work place to start right after college. The hierarchy is too strong that it does not encourage cross communication across levels. Every promotion or improvement is FIFO basis.
good,Salary is quite low and there is hardly any increment after a year or 2. We need to wait for 4 years to get a promotion. Managers are mostly not friendly and they hardly have any stuff in them but they expect you to do all the work.
good,"At Cognizant, the people and the environment plays the best role. Everyone collaborate and is always willing to help each other achieve their goals, and this is the most enjoyable part. However, there is room for the company to invest and show they care for its employee's motivation and satisfaction in the workplace."
good,"Poor management"
good,"Best company to work as a fresher, employee friendly, gives maximum opportunity to employees. A company which always take initiatives in the industry."
good,"I get to Experience actually work in an Information Technology field,with a team that has good communication, the hours are good and the people are friendly."
good,"Cognizant was a good company to work for, but the company phased out this specific department. Long hours were needed for the position and this was a salaried position as well. This office has since closed its doors."
good,"Verry tight schedule"
good,The work place is really good.But the period of training is less.And they dont treats Arts students better compared to Other Engineering graduates.Work pressure is high but it actually depends upon the Project we get in and the team members.Failed to provide exact package told during campus interview.
good,"Massive regionalism and bad management. Not recommended for long term. Also, not recommended if you are goal oriented. For promotions, you need to be from either Andhra Pradesh or Tamil Nadu"
good,"Positives- work life balance because there is no/little work, chilled out environment, no pressure"
good,The leadership tells you to do so many things in terms of learning but they do not want to pay. for example they want us to get certification on cloud but do not want to pay for training
good,"It was amazing workplace, nice to growing your career, so I will recommend this company to freshers as well as the experience people. But here i will suggest management to take care of the employee's concerns."
good,"I have worked in the organisation for 4 years and 8months. During my tenure I have exposed to various software quality testing testing technologies. However, the salary hikes are not impressive and offered minimal work like balance"
good,"Good company to work and habe work life balance but dont expect much salaires/incentives/any other."
good,As a service company we can't expect to work on advanced technologies. Long working hours which affects the work life balance. But they offer good salary.
good,Trainers were awesome.  The processes were interesting and fast paced.  Co-workers for the most part make or break the workplace culture.Number of invoices worked pushed before quality of work.
good,"Depending on the project in hand, typical work varies from having almost nothing to do to having to sit late into the night to finish work."
good,"The company was good during early days, but now it has become employee unfriendly. Lot of unnecessary new hires adds up cost to company and puts pressure on the existing resources who have been there in the system for long, which is unfair to me."
good,I've worked with CTS in Chennai. Management is good at corporate level but otherwise similar to all other consultancy companies. Certainly better among their peers.
good,Good Place to Learn. Teams are good. Academia is pretty good. Good place to start careers. Office hours are traced.Cross location projects help you work with people of various geographies.
good,but no work/life balance    job culture is okay    job security is very bad overall mest for IT people not for core people.........................................
good,"Having good environment to develop ourself  by facing different needs of clinet. An good opportunities for fresher to develop his skills, And good infrastructure."
good,"Pros - "
good,My job can't be discussed due to a Non-disclosure signed by me to protect the company and their affiliates from being compromised. I wish that it was a job with weekends off due to the mental stress of the job
good,Good place to start if your computer science knowledge is below average. The knowledge towards the field will be increased slowly but staying longer is not worthy in my perspective due to lack of challenging and cutting edge  tasks.
good,"Apart from project delivery there is significant expectation to participate in sales activities such as proposals for prospective clients, competencies building etc."
good,"Stressful job that its difficult to balance life and job. "
good,Cognizant management is not good as it should be as a US company. Now it is full of politics. People is getting promotions and other benefits just because they are buttering their manager or senior. Which is not a good sign for a company.
good,It's a decent job for the fresher's coming out of college but not the best. I feel that the growth in cognizant has reached that saturated level where in from there now it's almost like a hefty task for people like 2 years experienced to take it forward. And also for someone like me who likes to be fast in adaptive to the changing market it's not going to suit me where I can place my trust of building a long term career.
good,Bit stress full. But good work culture and environment. Got chance to work in multiple technologies. Good manager. Good cafeteria. Good Manager and good team.
good,Got opportunity to learn new technology by working in different projects but my current work location is not feasible . That's why I am trying to switch.
good,Everyone was expected to be on call literally every day.  It was not uncommon to be on calls beginning at 7 am with the last one at midnight.  This led me to explore other opportunities.
good,"I have worked out of Chennai location for Cognizant and my first challenge was of the climate and then the language. People are so passionate about their language, that it made me choke initially. All the management meetings are in local language and had hard time dealing with it."
good,Its a very stressful working environment due to which sometimes work life balance becomes hampered. Work culture is little unprofessional and in most cases one man show.
good,"I worked here as a trainee and progressed as a programmer analyst and got to work on good tech stacks. Loved the experience. But again, micromanagement and work culture needs to be improved."
good,"Long hours, management wont respect for human values. No HR will hear your voice.Learned nothing.  no place to learn."
good,"average work culture.slow increment,poliTics in management level.salary and benefit not upto date.Low onsite opportunity.working hour average.job security is better than private company."
good,"no salary growth, no career growth,  if you stay for longer you may get onsite opportunity. nothing much to expect from higher management. work pressure is high."
good,"Projects Vary, Career Development is not a concern here. If you are looking for just a ""job"" this is a great place. If you want to go above and beyond to make something of yourself id advise to look elsewhere."
good,"the work culture is good however the pay structure needs to be reformed."
good,The only best part about my journey with CTS was the exposure to start up a project. Did that for 2 projects & transitioned them successfully. It would have helped if management was more open to hearing employee suggestion and was not gender biased.
good,"Always show a consistent and long term attachment with employers. Show my respect to my peers irrespective of there age and experience. "
good,"A typical day at cognizant involves only dealing with the client, you are not treated as an employee of the company, you're just a slave, there is no proper appreciation , no perks, no proper allowances, no proper bonuses, you're just expected to serve client, for the company ,client is god, and employee doesn't matter , there is no proper grievance redressal mechanism, managers don't respond to your queries properly,  teams within the company are also very disconnected, they don't have proper information on what is happening, why is it happening and so on, it's just a pure service delivery company with no regards to employee concerns."
good,"The Company offered a promising career eight years ago with a fantastic culture and work life balance. "
good,"Personally and professionally it's a good company but on long run salary hikes and work culture are not good."
good,"Working in Cognizant can get a bit dull and monotonous. Be ready for all work and no play situation. It is a fairly competitive workplace and being a service oriented company, customer always comes before you."
good,No signs of career progress despite working for many years. Senior management is unfocussed and not clear in business strategies. They are more worried about saving their jobs(despite all of them are non-billable) and expect wonders from billable resources including but not limited to growing business(their job) by pressurizing.
good,"-work culture is never in favor of resources."
good,"Okay Company with good employee benefits & great politics"
good,"Not an ideal place to work given H1 visa row, This company forces you out of job if you get out of project, so beware it is good as long as you are billable."
good,"Worked with Cognizant for more than7 years, The company does provide good benefits, bonuses, decent 401K when compared to its peers and it does provide a good learning experience."
good,"never go for this job. work culture is also worst. shifts are so unfriendly, worst management. cab service also not good. basically nothing is good, ruined my life."
good,"- We learned many things related to work"
good,"Earlier it was fun to work at cognizant no longer now, I learned a lot at cognizant a small part is organization culture, hire management is good of cognizant and the lower management keep torturing cognizant is good place to work the hardest part of job is process team work in process the most enjoyable part of job is you can have fun if you finish your day task, which never complete."
good,Good Work environment. But have to deal lot of politics. Management need to concentrate more on diversity in promotions. Middle management is the hardest part now. For job security the manager and above not allow the associates to grow and prove
good,"it was good experiences on corporate world as an carrier starter., workplace , Management  over all environment  is good."
good,Cognizant was performing good during the 2008 recession but could not survive the 2016's sluggish market. Employees were forced to compromise on incentives and hikes because of company's negative growth.
good,As an employee I felt the work environment was very bias towards own culture. Not much room for advancement unless you were part of the culture and favoritism environment.
good,Not so great.. good for freshers but dont feel good after a couple of years. Managers are biased and I have seen managers recruiting friends for personal benefits.
good,"Promotions are harder nowadays at onsite due to a large no of employees competing with each other. GC has been stopped which is a big drawback for many who want to work a little more than 6 years in H1B. They have introduced new methodology of appraisal which is very difficult for many to achieve because of the mandatory certifications which need to be completed."
good,"Incompetent middle management is ruining the company's reputation. Middle management must be held accountable for the decisions taken on particular candidate's rating, promotions and etc. Transparency must be brought in for their decisions."
good,Cognizant bids for projects keeping in mind that people will slog for too long. The usual expectation is that you will work long hours. They have all sorts of arbitrary performance metrics which is used to forcefully fit people into the bell curve.
good,Good salary and good atmosphere great colleagues. My all time favourite is cognizant technology solutions. Opportunity is given to equally to all employees.
good,"work culture at CTS is good but in my project as it was vertical driven, it wasn't good. Vertical management was treating us(horizontal teams) very badly. Partiality was happening in all perspective."
good,"Good at providing workplace environment.Hikes and Salaries can be differed and mostly wont be more. Employee friendly environment."
good,Everything was good .it's. A great experience in my life...first job carrier with Cts is suprb one...learned a lot.most hardest part is salary .but everything was good
good,"Growth depends on the Account(Client) you work for & relation with your manager. Higher Management(Directors) doesn't have visibility to lower level, they don't even listen to the person's reporting Manager feedback."
good,I am currently working here. It is a really good company with amazing work ethics and most of the people mind their own business. But the only negative point is the salary.
good,Good place to work long term. Not much career advancement . overall okayish. it was a good experience learned all that i know here. made good friends.
good,"Good but opportunities less."
good,Good place to work. Long working hours and travelling distance to workplace disrupts work-life balance. Too much status reporting across organisation.
good,Cognizant is a nice company to work at only if you know  whom to connect with for your career growth.
good,Very good workplace with good job culture. Learned much as was a part of two teams with different type of work. The only con was lot of workload and less pay. Employers were very nice and friendly.
good,It's very busy schedule when I start my day. My day starts with checking my mailbox and chat channels and responding to all urgent and important emails. It also requires me to investigate the issues and revert to the clients and internal counterparts in a timely fashion. Second half goes even busy as most of the European STOCK EXCHANGES have common closing time. My office got nice cafeteria which offers range of food from authentic local food to pizzas and burgers and so on.  Cognizant management is really driving the system efficiently and the best thing I like about is the quarterly promotion cycles. Company has very flexible transport policy where they allow the employees to get paid if they are using their own transportation and not using the company transport.
good,"Work Culture is nice ,  but you have complete 9 hours in office"
good,"I have joined cognizant in DOM product techno functional consulting. As per work experience this is good place work. I loved people around me or my manager. They help me a lot to improve my skill."
good,"This review is purely my experience for the project that I have been working with. Not sure how other projects are operating so, I am not rating the entire CTS but it is just the personal experience in current project. There is no collaborative approach, dictatorial management without looking at what exactly happens at the ground level. No use of flagging any upcoming situation. threatening approach."
good,i have learnt many things in cognizant. But the management have to be taken care of as i do not find any growth in my career and no scope of learning new things
good,"It pleasure to work at cognizant with good work life balance."
good,"Involves planning and responding to RFPs for MNCs and acting as the outsourcing unit for their creative ad requirements. "
good,"You can love and admire about this company, but you will realize it is not going to help you in anyway to your career growth. You will be used well and they will throw you away."
good,"Overall okay experience. But do not go for ITES jobs, makes no sense for an engineer.Communication skills are the only thing that is prioritized. Rest they ask about your final year project if you are a fresher., Technical knowledge is not at all required"
good,"learning is more."
good,nice people to work with.very supportive workplace but there is scarcity of good project in kolkata location and bench people are more here.Its better to work in other location than in kolkata
good,"I have learned many things here,as a fresher. i dont have any previous experience ,this place has taught me everything.now i have many skills,from technical to management i learned many things here.This place made me a professional and a team player.Here i observed many leaders how they handle the pressure, they helped me everytime when i need help my.I did so much fun here along with the deliverables.my seniors and my fellow team mates helped me so much to learn new skills."
good,I was able to process health insurance claims on a QicLink system remotely and was able to adapt to maintain a high level of accuracy when changing assignments on a frequent basis.
good,"Joined on august 2016. Good workplace if you are in right project."
good,Very Stressfull and the Work Life Balance is affected as we had to work long hours in the company. The Job security is also affected as there is an uncertainty in the work place now
good,"Its a good company for the freshers to start their career with. Provide good compensation and health benefits."
good,requirements review develop test scripts .attend meetings. Scripts amendments.learning new coaching's.doing certifications.attending interviews for new projects. Sending status and having calls with onsite partners
good,"Apart from the salary Hike, the management, the work culture, colleagues everything is fine."
good,"Good,less work pressure,sometimes hectic. No trasparency with the management. Bad HR. No official informations.Good incentives in alternative years.Nothing else. I liked the company vry much before.But as the time goes on it is getting worse"
good,"There will never be much pressure. People respect your timings, salary is very less at lower levels but casuals are allowed all the days which makes up to it a lot."
good,There are not many good opportunities for growth.Hiring is more than the requirement. Not good quality of projects. Appraisal system is confusing and unreliable.
good,"If You are on bench then there is no one to find projects. You have to use your contacts to find one."
good,"Good work environment, there are fun activities at work which makes sure that you don't have to slog all day"
good,"Workplace Culture is very good."
good,Its been 3 years working with cognizant. Life balance is good but promotions are not given on time. salary hikes are less.Management is not up to the mark. Job culture is good
good,"Good place to work."
good,"There was a good mix of fun days and hectic days. I learned some interesting technologies, working in a team, handling stress and meeting deadlines and also how an organisation functions. Management was quite fine but messy at times. Workplace Culture was good but they need to listen more to the employees and provide them more benefit. The hardest part was handling any internal politics going on while some of the peers formed the best part of being at work. I think what they need to do is encourage employee empowerment."
good,Typical work day is very busy.  Hardest part of the job is that managers do not realize what we do on a daily basis and give us more than we are able to handle.
good,"Work culture in Cognizant has become harder, off late, due to continous HR Policy changes, towards a more rigid and hierarchial structure. Thus the overall environment has made it stifling for employees in witnessing career growth."
good,Rapidly growing organization with a vision to grow manifold in next few years. Rewards hardworking employees however need to have a concentrated effort on work life balance as the roles and responsibilities assigned to individuals need to be well defined so that the employee can give his best and prove his talent
good,"It was good experience overall. campus was good. Learned quite a good things on the management front. Lots of fun activities done, 9 hours completing was a little bit more demanding."
good,The job is a call center job that can become boring at times.  The management may be knowledgeable about the product but are not good leaders of people with good communication skills or styles.  The company is very new so everything is being created on the fly and as a result there are no standards already set.
good,"This is a great company, started off as a start up job, needs improvement, but has been great for the most part. Management is awesome and very respectful and you can definitely count on them."
good,"Only work focussed environment with a bad appraisal system."
good,"Everything is India based and the company cares more about their Indian employees than their US employees, are out of touch with US working culture and make changes/promotions very difficult"
good,A nice environment overall to work but lack of knowledge gathering opportunities for freshers. Management is not up to the mark. Security is same like other IT firms.
good,They give good opportunity to freshers. Work culture in few projects is very good. The annual increment is good in initial stages. Lot of fun activities on the floor to keep employees engaged
good,Very less work to do. No advancement. Projects are not good. Mobility is going down. Too many resources and very less work . Appraisal is based on RAPORT with manager.
good,Cognizant technologies solutions india Pvt Ltd is a good place to work but they pay less. You never know when your project shuts down. Overall it's ok.
good,"good work culture in cognizant and also good work life balance( depends on project)"
good,"this firm has goo name and fame , but there a lot of insurance projects in this firm which are very borring, you will not supposed to leave early and not even take your leaves on time. always you have to compromise."
good,This has been my first company after graduation and it has taught me all the technical skills i do possess as of today and i owe all my gratitude to this company and the people i have worked with so far in my journey. However the changes to grow and chose what you want to do is limited as the structure of the organization limits itself.
good,Productivity is most important for a business also we can  create refreshment to allow some fun at workplace so fun at workplace also increase our productivity however when we use it to enhance our skill .
good,"Could be a great company, just needs improvement with HR and structure in operations, I'm working as a quality analyst but we report directly to operations instead of having our quality supervisor or a quality manager."
good,"great place to work with all the employees."
good,"Good place to start your career, growth as well is faster however salary benefits are not very encouraging. Opportunities are not transperant, Hike letters are delayed most of the times"
good,"no fun at work, just asked to work what ever client asked to work."
good,"- Compensation/Benefits are average when compared with market and good when compared to other IT organizations"
good,"Provides extensive training before induction into a project, Well established academies."
good,It is a good company to work for. Processes are good. Coworkers are good. The hardest part is the travel to New York. WFH is limited
good,It is often tough for a fresher to get his/her first project after the completion of training. 50% of them remain in bench for a long period of time which does not count to their professional experience much.
good,"Work Load"
good,There is a great scope for learning. It also pushes you very hard towards reaching your targets. One would definitely come out with new skills both at professional and personal level.
good,"Worked as data manager on different phases of the study.Performed discrepancy management,crf creation, screen testing,edit check creation,conducting huddles resource management"
good,"I've worked for Cognizant for roughly one year and I've never been anything more than a number to the company (literally, even my login to company tools is just a number.) I've worked as a contractor and I have been mistakenly dropped from projects or not added to new projects several times, necessitating intervention by my project manager that takes several weeks to clear up the issue. When my very first contract ended, I was not informed by my manager for a full week because the company ""didn't have my contact information."""
good,"I started working for Cognizant in January 2016 when they took over Google maps project."
good,"I have developed the ability to quickly adapt to the work methods and routines of my employers and developed a number of processes to manage my many work tasks. I absolutely enjoy dealing with a wide variety of people and take pride in being a receptionist. Patience and dedication are immeasurable qualities, which I have also gained while working in high-paced settings."
good,"CTS is a place where you will be given a lot of freedom to constructively work on your ideas if you have any apart from the normal as-is tasks job."
good,"Great work opportunities, many things to learn but has many managerial gaps"
good,Big organization having multiple partners working under different areas. Need to focus more on quality engagements.
good,"Completed almost 4 years and Salary and promotion need to review every year honestly."
good,"You will learn here based on the project.Blessed you are when you work in small project consisting of 10 members not more than that.You will learn at least in that small team.if you don bother about performance rating"
good,"am very fast learner and always willing to have fun at work place.."
good,"Nice place to work if your work is visible to your immediate manager , otherwise all your hard work will never be rewarded . be outspoken ."
good,"If you start your career here, better to get promotions quickly which is not possible. Hence, it would be better if you come from another company"
good,job security - descent appraisal - not enough oppurtunity to explore new technology - very much hierarchy structured  - less employee benefits
good,"- Friendly environment."
good,Cognizant offers a gamut of services to different business segment. Senior Management in Life Sciences practice is not focused and clueless too. Available talent is not properly utilised. Freedom to chose work is only on the surface.
good,"Focus of the business is install systems and place their staff at the client site for as long as possible."
good,"Work environment is good, but keep offshoring jobs. Management is good. Keep fluctuating people to different accounts on a dimes notice."
good,I like this concern there is lot of opportunity. They are taking more new freshers. I learned so many things in this concern.
good,"In my short tenure in this organization, I wasn't so attracted towards the way the things were managed. This was my first job and I was disappointed about the benefits given to the employees and the way they were treated. There wasn't any emphasis given for employees to learn in-depth about the process/work they were assigned."
good,"Poor work culture and improper work ethics by low level supervisors."
good,"My typical day at work was fine and was the same as when I was employed at this same job as an employee of the original company.  Even though the pay was excellent here, they communicated that they were a U.S. based company, however everyone's birthplace was India and not modifiable.  "
good,"Nice to be part of Cognizant, gave me an opportunity to explore new technology. Has technology gaints as clients and a place to learn new things."
good,"Cognizant is overall a good organization to work for. However it has its own cons:"
good,"The learning opportunities are quite ok here."
good,"Management does'nt give much opportunities for the talented people. "
good,"Big data center of excellence has a number of challenging projects. A lot to learn if you are alert , team mates are helpful , clients are helpful .At times it gets hectic but chilled out when no when deadlines ."
good,"The direct management was often unqualified, selected basically ay random.  The upper level management spent basically no time onshore, effectively leaving the entire US operations leaderless"
good,"Third Party Liability (TPL) Subject Matter Expert (SME) implementing state Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) Applications."
good,Typical Indian Company without proper hierrarchy and structure
good,This company is very good in terms of work environment. But promotion and salary hike benefits are very limited. Getting promotions are very tough here and middle level management will not have any answers.
good,The Management could learn to discover associate's talent and encourage them for the appropriate carrier opportunity
good,Ok company to work for. Job security is good.Compensation is average.
good,Salary and Benefits given was fine. Good Team work experience. Co-Worker are always helpful in the work.
good,"Team Handling and client Intercations"
good,"Nice Culture and Working Environment. "
good,Its a nice company with opportunities for everyone but some of the management are really totally ignored about an employee's professional needs
good,"Good management"
good,"The everyday responsibilities were challenging in learning the application and knowledge. "
good,"Buzy whole day at work"
good,"Working at client location."
good,A good place to work but need more compensation and benefits are very less and Management and job culture needs to improve much better
good,A day at Cognizant is a new day with everyday learning and new challenges. I have learned new technologies and eager to continue upgrade them. I blend with the team members as it gives me a chance to grow with the company. The hardest part of the job is to meet client expectations as they are very demanding. I enjoy leisure time playing table tennis or simply hangout in the cafeteria with My teammates.
good,"Focused and driven"
good,"Less technical"
good,This is a good company in doing projects for various accounts. The company has good process to do project. Good place to learn.
good,Very fun place and friendly environment.Team work and it was too gud.
good,IT is a good company to work with lots of onsite opportunities.
good,"I have worked at Cognizant for 6 years now. Over the years and so many changes it was needed to be open to the changing environment."
good,"Good"
good,"1. Project moves are going good."
good,"Friendly co workers except managers"
good,Nice company to start as your career. Hard to find an interest project to work on.
good,"Things i Learned"
good,The typical day was when there was an error occurred due to the third person and I was the person blamed.
good,i have a good experience in cognizant. it is good place to enjoy with work.i found good cowokers.
good,"Good company if you want to learn at fast space. But be ready to sacrifice no work life balance. Mngmt very demanding, I am also part of senior management and very well averse with kind of pressure we operate."
good,Cognizant doesnot give value its employee's personal life and preferences
good,"Depends on the team you work with. Initially the team was good. but since there is no career advancement, salary hike, teams change quickly and then it is all upto your luck to be in a good team."
good,"Excellent company to work with if you are joining as a fresher. Good workholic environment. However I feel management should me more friendly. Client is considered as a GOD. It is true at any BPO. As CTS is a third party, so its rules are some what different and difficult some times."
good,They don't take care of the existing employees but will hire someone from outside with the same skill set with large salary. Like any other workplace i have seen good and bad managers but lot of old timers on top management sitting there with monopoly which is not good for your growth.
good,I am looking for job advancement and have no opportunity for growth there.  Once you get to a certain position you are stuck. Management also does not take the time to help you with career succession
good,"Positives:"
good,"Nothing can be generalised about a company as vast as cognizant technology solutions. Ultimately, your experience at the company boils down to who your team lead or manager is. I considered myself unlucky initially as my team lead was a non-cooperative person who also did not show any interest in sharing what he knew from his roughly ten prior years in the industry, especially his technical expertise. However, my worst experience was during my third project in which my manager seemed to know nothing about coding and, therefore, I had to continue to break my head, even after having told him that I had run up a wall"
good,"It can be a great place if not for politics, bugged with politics and ego by seniors. Otherwise, the learning opportunities are tremendous. "
good,It is a nice place to learn and work but at the management side it's not well and good. As an initial level trainee cognizant is well and good but not good for career growth.
good,"I was a great working with Cognizant, working culture was great and we had great people around to lead the projects and they were all very helpful. it was a very good experience."
good,"Projects always not kind of your skills"
good,"Nice place to work love my co workers"
good,"Good company w.r.t work culture"
good,"Cognizant executes consulting and development projects across a very broad range of IT technologies with varying degree of complexities. This was extremely useful in staying ahead of the technology curve and constantly updating myself with different skills, in addition to evolving as a Go-To Person and competent Technology leader who can drive Digital Transformations.There was also great empowerment at an individual level, to voice our opinions, self-train and experiment with new ideas."
good,"Ability to understand client needs, their business and personal agenda and drive a consultative driven strategy and approach.  Lots of learning oppurtunities and roles within the organization"
good,Have to improve in Salary structure and recognition to deserve people. And Middle senior management has to be changed according to market standards. Finally no growth
good,Cognizant has not been doing good because of the environment it has in its work place. It needs strong vision and encouragement from the senior leadership. In most situation there seems to be a disconnect between the leadership and the people on the floor.
good,Nothing to share..i personal dont like the management and felt bad experience...No work life balance and No personal growth.And there will lot of layers in between
good,"Cognizant is an American multinational corporation that provides IT services, including digital, technology, consulting, and operations services. It is headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey, United States. Cognizant is part of the NASDAQ-100 and trades under CTSH. It was founded as an in-house technology unit of Dun & Bradstreet in 1994,[4] and started serving external clients in 1996.[4]"
good,"too many divisions, too many heads, its needs to be simplified. The sense of belonging is not there and its getting challenging given the disruption in industry, clients way of thinking, expectations of everyone seems to be going up but not enough skills enhancing opportunities"
good,"You might be expected to work on holidays and weekends for free."
good,It was long hours and production support. It was difficult to work with off-shore resources. There was no work/life balance and extended hours were the norm
good,"Depends on project, you will get opportunity to work, and the work culture also depends on that, so choose your project wisely it can affect your future."
good,"Stagnated career growth like government office.You still have lot of learning here."
good,"Cognizant T.S. works with big IT clients and offers a good working atmosphere. Despite holistic approach to the business, the projects are not managed with the right timeframe and a clear objective. I have been training for more than 16 weeks and be busy with endless assessments without a leadership and productivity in terms of revenue for the client."
good,"Cognizant est une entreprise globale très solide avec une vraie culture. "
good,Learned many things about the security and international job culture. Good to expect growth after two years in a project. Management staff was friendly but not all he time.
good,"This company does not have a flexible absence policy,  very disorganized training,  horrible with communication,  too much negativity and gossip.  "
good,"Learned a lot about testing, both in Agile and non-Agile environments. Work culture depends on the individual project and location that you're assigned to."
good,Working 5+ years in this company. When i am in offshore i got eveything but in onshore i didnt get anything what i expected. Less compensation and No promotion made me to starting looking for oppurtunity
good,"This job is both fun and frustrating. The job itself is fairly easy, but it's not for the faint of heart. The office environment is bright and fun, but unprofessional and distracting at times. The way the office is run and how the QA system is run can be too much at times. It's easy for the stress and frustrations related to the job to get out of hand. There are on-site counselors that walk the floor to help employees if they are having a hard time."
good,Exciting opportunities as long as you are ok with ambiguity and you can find a billable project and you don't require a lot of process or structure.  Work life balance always a challenge.  Career architecture and performance reviews are overly cumbersome and burdensome.  Boils down to who you know and your HR manager and mentor.
good,"Good career plan with good training plans to get updated with Industry requirement."
good,Falta de claridad para proyectos locales nuevos asi como proceso de promocion
good,It’s a good place to start your career. The atmosphere is very comfortable and open. The management is very supportive and friendly. The organisation as a whole is felxible.
good,"cut- throat, too much politics , preferential treatment given to people who are pet to senior manager. Promotions delayed and opportunities are limited"
good,I work at rotational shift. I learned a lot about medical devices and how complaint handling works. I use salesforce software to process the cases. Workplace culture is good. The hardest of the work is meet the target as volume is high.
good,"Salary benefits are ok.."
good,"Cognizant is still a better place to work because of its great work culture and environment, there are some challenges that i am facing which could be personal at some level and i am looking for the change for better carrier opportunities."
good,"Good benefits"
good,"Company has lot of clients and culture was good, but during last couple of years saw firing of employee and became insecure. Pay and tax saving was good."
good,One of the firms that hires candidates in bulk. It takes a while to for the management to notice leadership skills in young professionals. Salary benefits are much lower than the industry norm.
good,"Management is average"
good,"Cognizant is good from all prospective."
good,Cognizant Technology solution is a good employer to work for but Salary is average. benefits are good . Work life balance is poor due to offshore delivery model for most of the projects.
good,"Not much good for work but it's fine to its good for fresher to groom their self and get the best environment for them,work and life balance is good but that should be more effective"
good,"compensation is adequate"
good,Work culture all everything depends on project managers and colleagues.Salary benefits also fine when you joined the company. appraisal is not that much good.
good,Väldigt nytt företag som tog över  Data Management på Astra. Inte mkt tid att lära sig system. Man fick själv lära sig. Det underbara var kollegorna som ställde upp för varandra.
good,"Company is good but as long as your project is doing good you are safe, lot of cost cutting now days. More focus on profit than employee. Last 2 years no increment to anyone,"
good,Good company. Company gives freedom to employees.Projects are also good.Whereas some policies are not so good. Management is also quite not good.but all and all its a good company.
good,Typical day at work includes supporting offshore. Troubleshooting extremely basic issues with offshore. Then attending stakeholder meetings and explaining cloud roadmaps
good,A company where you can learn a lot as a fresher and has a positive vibrant. You have a friendly working environment. It has Flexible working hours. And Worklife Balance is well maintained.
good,Mentioned as per the rating given above. Company is Nice to work with as per our expectations. I am interested in working onsite opportunities which will drive me in good momentum.
good,"Being a Content Moderator is great, especially for this company. The guidelines are a lot to follow, you have to be quick, and get used to the word 'pivot' early on! If you're the bookish, detail-oriented type that thrived in college, you'll love it. For the rest, you'll feel like you're back at college with the laid back atmosphere. Kinda fun. The culture at Cognizant is great - you're always smiling, people are always looking out for one another, coworkers here genuinely care about each other, but with the nature of the reported content being insanely graphic, it sadly isn't the job for everyone. You can see people come in to work at the start of their shifts (which are conveniently flexible, FYI) and throughout the day you can see which person has seen something really dark. An EAP program is offered, but not for shifts that need it and get the worst of the content. The numerous broken promises, unfortunate shifts in management, and unsanitary working conditions (sickness was passed around so frequently it was like being trapped in an elementary school) were all hard to manage, and then when mass amounts of employees are suddenly just not coming into work anymore, the culture started to become more negative and depressed. Overall, the content is rough. You have to really be a team player, and you have to care about what you're doing. You have to stay positive and refuse to slack off. It's not a job that has a good work-home life balance."
good,"Daily Work: "
good,"Great benefits most positions are work from home. Hardest part of the job is sometime getting the support or training needed. Sometimes long hours, however unlimited sick time and start with two weeks of vacation."
good,"It is a nice place to work in but depending upon your position moving up the ladder rides on multiple factors. The adoption and training for new technologies is slow, and changing from one technology to another is difficult. Also, the salary structure is in need of a dire revision as the work to money ratio is paltry. But if job security and benefits interest you this is by far one of the best places to be in. Being a multinational company, it has offices spread all over the world - making it ideal for working in various technologies. If you think of a technology standard, pretty sure that this company has already delved in it."
good,"Cognizant provides very good academy  training to freshers."
good,"Fun to work."
good,"Use to be much more entrepreneurial."
good,"We have gone through 4 managers in the past 2.5 years.  The onsite technicians have no input on anything an no lead to contact regarding issues. We cannot get promoted until we finish RDP's but as a desktop technician, there is no time to perform these during the day.  The classes are offered off hours, but no pay to to stay and perform    Meanwhile the Service desk has full access, can train whenever they want."
good,"We can able to manage both Job work and Life balance."
good,It was a wonderful company to work with but nowadays there is no employee care and benefits. They are making employees to work hard not smart and opportunities are very less to explore yourself.
good,Difficult to guess how company will cope with digital transformation. Good for consultants with general programming skills. The culture in the US is mostly the culture of the client you are working for.
good,"During my time at Cognizant I found it hard to fit in culturally and projects did not fit my skillset with most assignments.  While Cognizant is well represented in the market, there are a number of concerns around growth and development, diversity and work life balance."
good,I loved the company but the ppl who worked there were unhappy and made sure they rained on your parade. They spoke sarcastic every chance they had and alot of ppl there were unfriendly.
good,"Its nice to work with Cognizant as a Service Provider Company Cognizant has a huge client base so has a lot of opportunities across USA. "
good,"decent  payout. decent hike. "
good,Lot of opportunities with existing and new clients if you are closer to the management. Always a pressure situation as you need to take care of both delivery and business
good,"I have earned good friends at Cognizant, especially I can able to find better work culture and the place where the hard work will be rewarded. I enjoy working with such a team at Cognizant."
good,Has highly skilled employees from all over INDIA. Its employee care is always stable. It has got a technology and medical security clearance limitation ignored by the board
good,"It is good to work with cognizant technology solutions, the most important thing is that the work environment is good. Culture is good. Scope for personal advancement."
good,Having great time in cognizant. It always helps me to grow in my career. Management listens to employees concern and they give proper guidance to improve in your career..
good,"No customer service, no phones, lack of communication amongst team leaders; management.   Slow progress, computers need more RAM memory and speed, I.T. unhelpful, no chance for progress nor advancement for me on this job; very repetitive work, love the work shifts"
good,"Though Cognizant is said to be fastest growing IT consultancy, ther personal career growth would be minimal. You'd be in a typical IT company with same boring management and same chores. A lot of projects are support projects which would destroy the career."
good,"I have learnt a lot of things from my current organization. I have spent the past 2 years as a PMO Analyst. I have enjoyed my work in Data Analysis, Invoicing for Fixed Bid and T&M Projects, Forecasting, Resource Management, Access Management etc. So I am looking to specialize in the employment area."
good,"The work place is governed by Client therefore not in control of Cognizant. However, Cognizant allows opportunity to learn and variety of projects. The job provides lot of leadership roles and contribute in companies 2020 vision."
good,"good and fine place to work with optimum salary  ,it is friendly in nature but very stressfua at times which will be difficult for other domain Engineers to overcome"
good,"Very less and Late hikes. "
good,Professional presence and cleanliness at job site needs much improvement.  My trainer bashed the other trainer who was actually 5 times better than she will ever hope to become as well as bashed other staff and employees. .
good,Typical day at work is not good. Work life balance is too bad. Working on weekends continuously and giving updates during out of office hours making things complicated
good,"Work life balance is good, most managers don't bug you after work hours."
good,"Good company to work during your developing years. "
good,"have worked for more than 8 years. Good place to work for. They have good projects like Implementation, Support projects. Get oppertunity to travell out side country."
good,"Cognizant as a company is pretty big and has a large amount of clients, across globe. So it is never challenging to find newer projects. At the same time, it is very difficult when it comes to career advancements, as margins are diminishing and cost cuttings."
good,"Place where we can learn new things both functionally and technically."
good,"Team Management, innovation and meeting different clients delivery across regions. Handling of various sub process which includes regulatory driven reporting, inventory, payments , reconciliation and allocation back to business"
good,"I learnt a lot at Cognizant, it gave me a lot of flexibility. I was given opportunities to learn different technologies"
good,"Job security and learning part is excellent. Implementation of initiative is the best part  to feel the  job satisfaction."
good,"To start with, cognizant has been a great choice. Got to learn a lot.  Good work culture.  Got a lot to learnt from it. Few accounts in cognizant are not good to work with otherwise it's a great company."
good,"offers a lot of online courses to further improve employee skills, there were a lot of accounts on the company, you can always move from one account to another."
good,Overall its awesome experience. Working in CTS is a life time experience. Awesome work culture and superb client management with more rewards and recognitions.
good,"Stop micro managing resources. Needs drastic change in management strategy for both in the middle and high up in the chain of command. "
good,"Working for an Australian Bank"
good,Standard decreased a lot. From last 2 years standard has changed and this lead to a lot escalations to the management. Escalations has not been resolved as well.
good,"fun and productive environment and have learned a lot in this year about API testing and different tools."
good,I have learned lot of new technology and i know our software development life cycle. How to interact with client?. Everything i learned for this company only.

good,"Great Teamwork  and committed individuals.Effective Agile environment where Scrum and SAFe are being practically implemented."
good,"It was a good company few years back.Now lot of micromanagement."
good,This is a great company with horrible people. I love the job it's self the management sucks however and the people only care about themselves  too much drama and conflicts of interest
good,"Previously Cognizant was a great place to work but now it has been changed. Employees were not given with proper benefits and so on."
good,"Every company has its own pros and cons. I'd say that it makes a great work place who does not mind sitting in front of a company for 9 hours and longer. "
good,"- Re-training and cross training employees which is benefiting both "
good,"The company was good initially but not now , they are behaving like more of a contracting and people management company than a tech company. The company is also suffering from the recent automation efforts in IT."
good,It's nice place if anyone wants to do only job and don't need to growth personally. But if you want some challenging role and enhancement in your professional carrier then I would like to say it's very static place to work. Cognizant provides very professional and practical edge of any training course which is appreciable.
good,"Workpressure is less and sometimes you tend to get a Good Manager. Learning and workplace is at not best but good. "
good,"Technical Growth is very less. Poor remuneration."
good,"Learning curve, career growth is entirely dependent on the project you are working in."
good,"Over 8 years of professional work experience with main exposure to hadoop and bigdata technologies."
good,"Pros:"
good,My greatest take away with this company is the fact that it gave me opportunity to work and research on video streaming technology and the use of video personalization to improve customer experience.

good,"Pros:"
good,"Good company  off late loosing it's DNA/ culture ,had been working for last 9  years and exposure to good project / experience, needs course correction"
good,I joined this company with higher expectations. But this time worst situation is going on management is not efficient and rate of job cutting is also very high.
good,"Great teammates. Work life balance is pretty bad. Good environment to work if you love the technology you are working on. Would be great if there is no multiple manual time tracking entry systems."
good,"I've only been with Cognizant a few months.  I was outsourced by the best company I've ever worked with so...some bitterness there."
good,"Management Structure is not maintained well. "
good,"Good company with lots of opportunity to learn and grow. Frequent opportunity to enroll in various ML and Analytics program."
good,"Great working experience."
good,"Good to work in client location"
good,"I am thankful to my previous one.i learned lot of things for my career growth,right now i have extraordinary skills that credits goes only my previous.i always thankful to my colleagues  and my superior."
good,"1. Good place to start one's career."
good,"Great opportunity and great people, adoption of FOW (Future of work place) is a good one. Work life balance is good, but salary and incentive are much less then other companies"
good,"1 - I like challenging environment so I never felt a typical day until now in cognizant."
good,"Good company to work for when you want to explore multiple flavor and keep learning. Lot of process, room for innovations and learning experiences. Work life balance ma not be great"
good,There's a lot to learn here.If one wants he can excel to a great extent.Amazing management available for you 24*7.The cafetaria is good.They have quality  trainer.
good,"Nice work place for beginners and intermediate level. Gets too political as you move up the ladder. Crazy working hours"
good,Cognizant Technology Solutions is a OK place to work for. The pay scale will be below par with other companies of its stature but it is a place with job security.
good,"When worked for Cognizant US is far better then its counterpart Cognizant India."
good,"Cognizant is a good place to start your career whether you are in Technology Consulting or Software Development. If you are in Mid-level and Senior-level, you will want to look for better avenues to start with."
good,Job work life is  little tough and frequent changes of worklocation is a constraint.Management changes happening recently is not at its best. Work in Onsite and Offshore mode.
good,"Hi,"
good,"Good place to work. You can work without any pressure."
good,"Good work life balance."
good,once we get into project we will get know manny things. we get to know the bussiness and working culture is different over here.not much of work pressure we get to experience.
good,"Job Work/Life Balance- Moderate"
good,"The amount of project Cognizant wins are very high , you will be spending lot of time in delivering work life balance is little low , However you will gain significant experience in work as you would be working with Tier 1 players."
good,"A day at work involved a daily client call, followed by a few hours of coding for app development"
good,"It is indeed a great place to start your career with but the kind of pay scale, incentives and hikes CTS has after all the work and effort employees put in is disappointing and below average. For the same work done there are so many firms which pay a lot more and value your services. So all and all the pay scale is a disappointment for sure in Cognizant."
good,"No cab facilities if you work on client side."
good,"Cognizant Technology solutions is very good company to work, however there is some problems regarding work, so I'm not happy with the work associated to me I'm looking for some more challenging work and which is relevant to me."
good,"Absolutely its right place to learn new technology and scale up yourself. But when comes to work life balnce,its very hard to find space for personal life."
good,Learned a lot about the recruitment industry. Many challenging position to be filled in which require niche tech skills. Good client interaction and exposure.
good,Food is a big problem in CRC. Small cafeteria for a huge crowd. Work politics is too much. As a fresher i found that so depressing. Most of the projects are of service oriented.
good,"Good allowances for weekend travel,food,lunch,dinner based on the project.Also the bonus is available if active on payroll provided the performance of individual and company"
good,"Have 7 years and 5 months of experience in Information Technology from September-2009 to March-2017 in Cognizant Technology Solution India Pvt Ltd (CTS). As part of assignments, I am involved in requirement analysis, module development and application maintenance. Have experience working in Agile & waterfall project execution model"
good,Good company and work culture is good.But the projects mostly with shift based so you might to come in shift mostly. They expect extended support with long hours. They expect the contributions from you apart from delivery.
good,"Some times cannot manage work life balance "
good,"Good experience with cognizant but i want to move on to SAP fico."
good,Really appreciate the team work with the overall operations and support provided by them to achieve the clients capability and target.Motivation factor among employees are really great and work culture with each and every employee is more friendly in nature and coworkers support each other during crisis situation.
good,It was a night shift. not that great environment to work. No proper management. just improved my communication skills.too much of work presure with more targets.
good,client oriented company. Does not take care of employee. working time is very bad. no motivations in the company. wont recommend to anyone. management is very poor.
good,"It's good to work here also i need some change also in some part of salary im disappointed , so i'm think of quiting. Now Timing is maintained for all Associates, it's not required."
good,"1.more politics in the team"
good,"Learnt a lot of things , multiple opportunities provided to learn and grow. "
good,"Day begins at 10 am in Cognizant and ends at 7 pm. Every day brings new adventure . regular routine - Come to office, go gym , do work and leave  ."
good,"Good Learning and growth but not good management at all."
good,Company is good. Work culture depends on the type of project we get tagged into. Mandatory 9 hours presence in the company is bit irritating and time wasting.
good,"Good company "
good,Cognizant technology solutions is a good company to work for. Though work/life balance is missing. The compensation could be better and the individuals can be empowered more.
good,Good Workplace for onsite opportunities. can learn about process and other things including technical stuff.internal training also conducted to improve skill set of employees
good,"Cognizant is too much process oriented & planning oriented."
good,"Decent place to work but a LARGE company, you need to work very hard to earn visibility across the company."
good,"Easy to access the jobs for fresher "
good,"Typical work timings are from 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM and also they are shift based for some project."
good,"Experience of working there was good."
good,"A typical IT company where you are required for stay backs and many times you are on bench. "
good,"Training provided was exemplary"
good,It's  a good and challenging company. Work culture is different. You have a chance to learn emerging technologies. You can build your career with cognizant. But it's much better for fresher's compared to experienced guy's.
good,"Cognizant is good company to work from Job security and compensation purpose, however, maintaining work life -Personal life balance is challenge in this work culture. There will be multiple opportunities to develop oneself,"
good,"I enjoy coming to office as i get to meet and interact with new people on a daily basis. My current role involves multiple Connects with associates to understand the floor pulse, rewards and recognition, performance management and all activities from start to end of an employee life cycle. "
good,"I have learned Management skills and DevOps based AGILE Methodology in this company."
good,"-Work stress will be there, but that helps to learn tecnologies such as HPQC, Clear quest, JIRA issue tracking tools"
good,"Communication, Problem Solving, Data Entry Skills, Listening, Phone Skills, Building Relationships, Multi-tasking"
good,"Empresa apresenta condições normais de trabalho. Nada demais para ser destacado na avaliação. Foco em prestação de serviços, exige que o funcionário mantenha-se alocado no cliente."
good,"Hearing the clicking sound of my keyboard and checking my emails while taking a sip of coffee from time to time is how I can describe my typical day at work. I'd get minimal phone calls but sometimes I barely spend a minute without talking on the phone but I am happy. Everyday I learn something new and the most fun part is you get to experience the best of both worlds.  It creates balance but it evolves. The mastered skills of customer service plus you get to educate end users about technology  and ensures efficient resolution with their IT related concerns which hungers me, so the next thing you know you are doing an extensive research about something to fully understand it and be able to pass that knowledge in a complex way that end users would understand. I guess that is just the hardest part. But the feeling is very rewarding of course. I always tell my end users that I don't know everything this world can offer but with reading you can be the best dictionary you can find. It's like travelling but you're not there physically. It's how we teach ourselves to think and explore. Find out what you are capable of and to never stop believing that everything can be achieved if you think of it that way."
good,Ok place to work.. Wierd policy sometimes which varies for person to person in accordance with what suits the management. Few good hard working people but not encouraged enough.
good,"Recommends"
good,"Cognizant is better than other Indian IT companies when it comes to benefits, compensation and employee friendliness. But managers have lot of power here. The promotion cycle is flawed and growth is very slow. Performance is not the factor for promotion. It is your relationship with managers. I would say company has been mismanaged in the recent years by Assoc Directors, Directors and Sr. Directors."
good,A typical day at work is simple. Trying to help our clients to resolve their issues on their password. Assisting them on how to be able to connect to their network. Every day I learn how to be more patient and cooperative with co workers. Our management provide support for the staff. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that you are able to help other people.
good,"Nice to work"
good,"A very good Company to work wit. Offshore teams are given opportunities but which are very few for development."
good,"There is not much growth in the company and after project ends the company will place you with any projects even if it has nothing to do with your skillsets. They spread you too thin if not too many projects available. Its a good place for starters, but for experienced developers ad consultants they will find themselves not getting too much growth or opportunities to explore. And lots of competition. Management isnt that supportive at all rather care how much money and long they can place you at the client and top of that travel expenses are almost not paid at all at most projects. and lots of relocation required with no expenses being paid."
good,"productive and transparent and always room for improvement is there for the employees,and the employee focused organization in all aspects"
good,"Management is not great. They work in a reactive mode."
good,"We get good exposure to multiple technologies. "
good,"It's challenging and rewarding at the same time.  My ability to balance multiple projects and manage resources has improved.  There are a lot of cross-functional dependencies.  The hardest part of my job is working under the pressure of a contract that is open ended and doesn't allow us to inforce scope control.  The most enjoyable part of my job is building a positive relationship between myself, my team and the client despite all the challenges we face.  We are able to walk away with more wins then loses because of this."
good,"Friendly, motivated and innovation driven environment. Associates are motivated for better work and innovations. every idea given by associates are captured."
good,"Good Organization under energetic young leadership. Covering all the major domain, doing well at the market. Better if Cognizant bags more development project on the latest trends and learning of the new technologies are minimal."
good,"This is an interesting place to work, however there are some downsides to this job. The management staff sometimes does not understand what there workers. There is little growth opportunities within this company."
good,"Managment is poor"
good,"Productive, good work atmosphere with mediocre salary benefits. I learned a lot of technical and managerial aspect of the job in my present role."
good,".Work culture is good. we feel good at work and every day is learning for all. Simultaneously team is engaged in other activities like fun,participating in Outreach activities."
good,"A good company for freshers. Depends for Laterals."
good,"Good for freshers"
good,Productive and Good Job culture.Always try to make difference from their counterpart and made their bench mark high.Excellent leadership team (SVP+). Culture of investing in market opportunities ahead of time.
good,"My present company is good, with flexible work environment. There is good relationship building among the coworkers and management. However the pace of growth rate is slow."
good,"Was a good experience overall learning curve was good with new skills on development and project management."
good,"Good Company to work but the compensation at onsite is very poor, and growth is also very less when compared to other companies."
good,It used to very hectic schedule from morning 9 to night 9 without any access to outside environment everyday though the shift being of 9 hours only.
good,"Can learn the Management activities, Leadership quality & learning the new modules. Salary benefits, weekend will be permanently off"
good,"Good for Beginners and can stay for 2-3 years to learn. After 3 years, progress will be really very slow. Giving importance to learn and that;s really good. Management at client place is really tough to handle as it revolves with the regional communities"
good,Good place to learn multiple technical and managerial things. Would shape up people mental and professional growth to a higher level since we are dealing with multiple teams and people and clients both directly and remotely. I would suggest everyone to come and work here to feel the pressure and stressful and stressfree situations simulateneously. Lucky to be a part of this to mould myself.
good,"Actually I joined in First Indian corporation  in June 8, 2009 after one year it was take over by Core Logic India and after two year it was take over again by Cognizant called our client as Cognizant Global Services Pvt. Ltd.,"
good,Working at Cognizant involves a lot of travel.  One gets to engage with colleagues on a variety of issues and there is always an opportunity to learn from others.  Management is focused on growing the company and transiting it from a purely technology company to a broader services oriented one.
good,"A Typical Day Starts with taking updates from Cognizant India Team."
good,Working at Cognizant and being an IT consulting company will mean that there will always be some work (unless the client you are assigned has budget cuts).
good,The working environment of the organization is good. Delivered individual module before deadline. Got appreciation from client side.
good,"Best place to work "
good,Good Environment to work on. Cannot learn beyond a limit. Have to stuck on a particular domain and portion to work on. No learning. Good place to work on. Nice atmosphere and doesn't have much work pressure. Shift timings are not normal for developers.
good,"Good start for freshers"
good,".."
good,"I joined the company as a trainee .I started off with learning my skills  as a developer and applied them in work . While at work,it was about problem solving and communication with the management and client.The entire job was learning experience . But to indeed learn in depth i am pursuing my graduate studies.Overall it helped me with enriching my skills ."
good,"Good working culture with flexibility."
good,"Pros:"

good,"My current job provide me an immense scope for growth and learning.  Its a fulfilling day of work that typically involves - "
good,"Good company to work with a great leadership team."
good,"A day starts with a daily status meeting followed with working on the assigned tasks like requirement analysis, designing tests, test team meetings as and when required. Some KT seesions and in the evening calls with onsite team - BAs, Client, onsite project team."
good,"Cognizant as a workplace is good and you get an authority to work and take decision on your own and have complete ownership on the work you have taken. An employee friendly organization, it gives flexibility to work provides job security"
good,Processing referrals on an ever changing quality standard. Gaining new responsibilities does not mean more pay until a brand new position is created but that doesn't happen until a company on the other side of the country says so.
good,"Learned about the Job."
good,"- Descent Pay"
good,Good work culture.People from practice will be there to help in projects.
good,"Well since its a new division of the company it has its own set of problems. But it is again one of the most relaxed places where you can learn new technologies on your own pace. "
good,Working for CTS has been a good & bad experience. The good part being that you get to learn new technology and enjoy working with co workers.
good,"1.Nice place to work"
good,"#Very challenging in learning new tools and technologies in various projects "
good,"* Diversity at workplace"
good,Good benefits. Good compensation. Will be better of higher education sponsor is available in US
good,"Issue Resolving "
good,ON employee welfare basis the company currently am working on is the best company.
good,"I started as a fresher and gained so much knowledge on the process on Vendor Management within first 3 months. The Knowledge Transfer was awesome and could independently work on the tasks assigned. Management prepared me to be client focused and prove to be a better service provider. Co-workers were so helpful when I turned to Purchasing & Accounts Payable Department, where I felt as I could indeed keep myself available for them too whenever they required."
good,"Less pressurized company"
good,"Learned many thins like client communication,Handling issues"
good,"I have learned many Datawarehousing technologies like DMExpress,Excelsius,and Infa"
good,"Nice company to work with ."
good,Fun environment.  Chances to learn and grow.  Work Life balance sometimes does take a hit
good,"Excellent opportunities for abroad."
good,Growing company providing good client exposure. Ample opportunities to move vertically and horizontally. Of late the company is mired with immigration relate trouble.
good,Quite good place to work and the day starts with getting some followup and ends with giving some followups.
good,Cognizant is a good compant for start . I learned testing from cognizant. Need to improve in management
good,Learned alot on Cognizant.
good,Average company. Not as good to employees in terms of salary and other benefits.
good,Cognizant is a growing company struggling to set its house in order
good,"In my Experience cognizant is good place where we can build up our career , I have enjoyed a lot and i learned almost technical stuff from there , It was my first MNC , But i worked as contractor so that i quite the job. if i can get a chance again in cognizant its a dream come true ."
good,Typical work on doing the policies on the US Workers Compensation.
good,"long working hours, learned new technologies, management it good, excellent work enviornment amongst co-workers."
good,"Cognizant is an up and coming company, however, it is so over-whelmed with growth, that it is falling behind on the employees that sustain the growth."
good,"Great place to work , Cognizant has too many clients and provides exposure with different set of Clients."
good,"The quality assurance field, in the insurance industry at least, was very monotonous and involved almost no teamwork. Technically you are in a team, but your work is almost entirely done alone. I can't speak for the other industries, but it was simply a small, repetitive, and isolated cubicle job. The pay is exceptional for entrance level jobs."
good,Extra hours put in by employees must be payed. Steps must be taken to reduce work pressure. Should implement better estimation techniques for calculating work hours in projects.
good,"Very competitive, For the past few years - Job security is in question @ CTS. Incentive & Salary Hike are not paid in proper interval of time.Good place for learning without expectation."
good,"Worked for more than 3 years as Test Analyst, you can learn new technology when your account has many projects. Overall it is good to work in cognizant"
good,Overall its place of work with productive and competitive environment where one can get to work under a professional and collaborative management.....
good,"good management"
good,"A good place to work at learned a lot, definitely would recommend for someone starting new or is a specialist at what they are. Overall it was a good experience."
good,I was promised for a designation and was rolled out in the offer letter with a designation lesser than what was promised. Salary received for the level of work experience I have is too less.
good,a good place to work and you can learn many new thing help to enhance your skill but the management is not that helpful and as per work life balance is consider it is good
good,It's good company for Freshers though is not the best paymaster .Your growth will totally depend on your project and technologies you are working with .
good,Large US based consultancy. Offers a wide range of roles in a variety of location around the world. Management consulting business is not growing and most resources have started moving out.
good,"Cognizant is an American multinational corporation that provides IT services, including digital, technology, consulting, and operations services. It is headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey, United States. Cognizant is part of the NASDAQ-100 and trades under CTSH."
good,Focused on client not on personal growth.  Typical day is meeting expectations of client.  There could be better cross sharing of skills.  Workplace culture is adaptable to client.
good,"Work culture & fun/enjoyment depends on Project and Management. But overall there are opportunities to work on new technologies."
good,I have been travelling with Cognizant quite a while and i feel it is good for people who wants to be less challenging and more in comfort zone from work and technology perspective
good,Kind of a good experience to start working there as a fresher but not recommended for the long run. Initial periods may be boring but once you go to a project time flies.
good,Location preference is not an option for freshers. Work culture depends solely on your manager. I have worked in projects in which office feels like home as well as in projects where even 11 hours of daily work isn't enough.
good,"Good place to work"
good,Good Company with work with.  One of the largest consulting org. with multiple projects across multiple domains.   Good Training with work life balance.
good,IT service company based on onsite offshore model mostly working on support projects. The workplace culture is male dominated . The company employees mostly Indians.
good,", good time nothing much to say . all well just filling this up to get it over with dont know why you are making this mandatory have relly no interest in filling this lets just get on with it"
good,learned many different software applications. Met many new people. Excellent medical benefits. Taught me how to work independently and without much training.
good,"Company with good benefits    "
good,Work culture at Cognizant is collaborative but slow paced and gradual growth in career. Salary pay also too less which is the biggest drawback of the company.
good,Cognizant is changing every year since I joined 5 years back.. The oldies sitting at higher posts and onsite are pushing everything on manager/Senior manager level at creating lot of stressful environment. No job security and always on the mercy of bosses
good,"Good company to work and learn new technologies."
good,"I am able to work 100% from home, which is great.  The type of work is interesting.  The disappointing aspect of Cognizant is the lack of management involvement - primarily around performance reviews, which leads me to believe there are no performance bonuses."
good,Good. For fresher's looking for testing opportunities not for developers . Training is not good. Hike is good . Promotion will take time  . employee friendly
good,"Cognizant is an outsourcing company so each project is a contract that they have with another company for us to do their work. So the pay is probably less than what you would earn if you work directly for the company that the contract is from. However, Cognizant is such a big company that there are global opportunities to transfer from locations. The work is very data related so, isn't tends to make employees feel like the work is more important than the employee. but I think that is also dependent on who the management is and where the work is being done. Some cognizant locations are very open and fun whereas others are very closed and production-oriented."
good,All is nice and only hikes issue. you can learn a lot of technologies internally. Good support from Managers to learn information. if you won't expect good hires you can continue in CTS.
good,"nice work culture, good to work with, "
good,"A good company to work. Have better employee benefits like paternity leave, Health care, 401K."
good,"Great learning experience , good knowledge about team and working with them. More opportunities needed for freshers in development. Rating is given by partiality."
good,"Got good exposure to work in different domains."
good,I am not getting any chance to learn something innovative and even i am not getting to Innovate. Salary is also not enough and there is no good hike in salary.
good,"over all is good working with cognizant. however few account are very good and few accounts are not good. its depend up on the account manager."
good,Good work culture - nice and cooperative colleagues helps build a good work culture in Cognizant. This in turn helps the new joiners to blend with the team easily.
good,"Very good company to start your career only if you get good technology and quality project to work in."
good,Especially I need to mention the working environment is really good. Pretty decent salary package.Outreach is the highlighted activity in cognizant we're in we will contributing some quality things to the society.
good,work environment is good. but hike is very less from last 3 years. Appraisal is not coming on time.  They are not Paying arrears in delay of appraisal.
good,"Typical day at work: Auditing the optimisations and recommendations, providing feedback to the agents, etc."
good,I am happy to work there and happy to plan my career to next level. Cognizant has given me and tuned me to face the business and life. It's first MNC company and I am proud to be an cognizian.
good,Wasn't happy with project technologies hence decided to leave. Also didn't like the way colleague was behaving with new team members. Management part was good.
good,"Good culture, good communication with employee between management. Good support from management. Over all good for working here at cognizant. So can refer to friends."
good,Less learning for new comer and also it's depends upon the project. They can put into any work profile regardless of training and area of interest. Many projects have onsite opportunities.
good,"Small company but good salary, everything is fine on this place. Stressful if its open enrollment but everything is fine. Highly recommended about the"
good,"Initially you start out feeling like the job will be easy."
good,It was good but nature of work is different.Salary is good but very less increment . I have leaned lot of new things and new technologies like Nagios and Splunk.
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Cognizant, but we probably grow too much too fast and added more people than we could promise advancement opportunities for. Lots of people with no idea where they go from here"
good,"Good environment, good culture, Salary hike is better ,Good training, professionalism, client handling is best ,people management is best , Improving skills"
good,A great place to work with different teams and explore new things. Place to showcase your technical talent and extracurricular activities. No work life balance and no job security
good,"Stressful atmosphere,Unprofessional approach towards work,No work life balance,most enjoyable part of job is being unproductive and directionless,Negative & uninspiring leadership."
good,Joined as a PAT and had a moderate learning and working experience. You need to know yourself what technologies you should gain knowledge and experience to progress in your career.
good,It's been a good experience working with Cognizant Technology Solutions. It got a chance to work for major banking and financial services across various domains and technologies.
good,Cognizant is a good company to work. It gives opportunity to learn new technology. Salary is average compared to other companies but still at par  with other IT vendors
good,Not very clear on what the company wants from management recruits as the job is highly clerical and does  not require intensive consultative skills. While we were recruited as consultants the job profile is highly IT oriented and does not need any of our management skills learned at Bschools
good,"Good place to work and balancing personal life.."
good,Your Growth is very much dependent on your manager and what he/she views as important. Hence move into teams where your manager is supportive of your growth.
good,"It is an American multinational corporation that provides IT services, including digital, technology, consulting, and operations services. It is headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey, United States. Good company to work."
good,it was fun working at cognizant which had numerous clients working in all domains and technologies. The manager i worked with was helpful and was keen on my interest of work
good,It is a good company for afresher. I AM telling you about this because I want to leave the company based on my way to leave.i don't know what you please send me
good,Good work environment but the management is not fair at times. One need to struggle hard to switch to other domains. HR and talent managers are always open to employees.
good,"Overall - good"
good,"I interned as a business associate in Cognizant Technology Solutions, India. My typical work everyday was to work on projects based on niche technologies like Python , AR / VR ; deal with bugs involved in a few of the production web apps , create flask apps to be be deployed into the production environment and present my insights and contribution to the Team LEAD. Overall It was a really good learning curve for somebody just migrating into the corporate world."
good,"Good Place to work and very good client and exposure to top notch technology and good people to work.Work place culture is good, hardest part of the job is we need to work in weekends once you hit the middle level management. rest things are good"
good,Good place to be if you want to hold a job as a fresher however to be in fileds like analytics one must try to be more inclined towards analytics and product based companies
good,"Pros"
good,"you are allowed to do work from home and it depends on the project that you are assigned to. "
good,Good work culture. Management is good.Work life balance is good. Benfits is kind of okay. Multitasking is one of hardest part. Lot of fun activties within company
good,"1. Nice organization to join in the beginning of one's career . "
good,"Good, quick growing ,people are good and friendly . Management will motivated associates for the growth of employee .Finally cognizant company is good to work"
good,My journey with Cognizant is amazing. Cognizant is fastest growing company becoz of which its very fast paced work. Allows you to take more challenging responsibility.
good,"Broken promises, Favoritism, Good because no weekends or Holidays. Way to much micro management. Coworkers were very nice, expectations sometimes could be overwhelming from management and people did not always do their jobs."
good,"This job is not a good fit for people that cannot handle seeing or hearing graphic content on the internet every day. Examples:(murders, suicides, pornography, and child abuse to name a few). And on top of that you are required to meet accuracy requirements, and complete in access of 300 jobs per day, then finally management is not honest, they are misleading and will literally have you believing your matrix is fine and you are a candidate for promotion when that is not the case. I do not recommend them to anyone."
good,Learning skills depends on the project you get. Mostly support projects. Cab and medical facility is good. Increments are not good. Worklife balance is fine.
good,Good Company to work for. They place you on diverse projects with people of all backgrounds. The on-hiring training program is good and helps employees better understand the company and the consulting side.
good,Cognizant is a growing company with growth lots of learning and enjoyed meeting new people and culture.  Learned how to interact more with clients and peers.  Understanding more of the outsourcing process and technology.
good,"My first company , will always remain close to my heart. I entered cognizant as a PAT , the associates and the work culture of the company was so inductive and nurturing that today as a professional I give full credit to CTS to help me grow and learn."
good,"Cognizant is a very well established organization providing a decent amount of job security.  Benefits are average, however PTO is limited and not very competitive."
good,"Project dependent on what you get- good policies for relocation"
good,"Nice company, but littlebit of mis management we lost the project and lots of people were release and sent to bench. Learning is another problem, there is RDP which is not that accessible"
good,Like most of the big organizations things happen in a fixed fashion leaving little to no room for any 'out-of-the-box' thinking. Routine job with no challenges to keep one at their feet burdened with bureaucracy and favoritism.
good,"Good company to work for. "
good,"- awesome culture"
good,"I have really enjoyed working for this company. What isn't great is that being on contract doesn't guarantee you are converted. I am a hard worker, top of my team and struggle with being on contract being that its hourly."
good,"Nice work culture, best organization to start your career. Loads of opportunity you will get here. Hike and management is bit concern in this organization"
good,Cognizant is a good place to work and lot opportunities to work onsite. It is  a fun place to work and the work culture is good and the team work is good.
good,"Cognizant is good company and having multiple job opportunities."
good,"I have a pleasure wroking with them. Nice teammates, good work culture, nice environment in office. Everything is good excepy the compensation is less."
good,If you are talented and looking to utilize your full talent then its' not your company. It is typical consultant company where not much of technical skill is respected.
good,"A normal day was usually mundane for me. Most of the time would be spent on answering emails and scrum calls regarding status updates of various tasks which have been handed over. Though I did not really have a chance to grow, I am happy that I happened to gain some leadership experience as the Release Management Lead."
good,"Great place to work for working with latest tools and technologies and apply them to real world problems across a wide range of domain. Also, good opportunities to build new skills"
good,"work culture is good, worked in Hyderabad and enjoyed working there. There is n time logging and is good work life balance with flexible working time."
good,I guess it's an ok job for starting out as a web developer. Problem is that you have to know an additional language to work in the Dublin team. I would suggest to stay there a max 6 months to a year and then go to something more complex.
good,"Cognizant is a constantly changing, growing, company.  Cognizant has a new CEO, and some changes have already occurred.  Quality and production goals are sometimes a bit above average.  Much of your experience depends on manager."
good,"All depends on project/management/environment of soundings.."
good,"compnay has a vision andkeeps changing strategy to adapt to the needs of the market palce. though it may not always bring the desired results, but atleast it is tryiung"
good,"na"
good,"CTS is a Good company to start with and helped me training with my first  project. They had fun activities every week.  But, the hardest part was working in the night shift."
good,It's a good place to work. Moderate Work life balance. Moderate salary. Good part is no variable pay. Everything is fixed. Work wise ok. As usual worst management.
good,"Good but its service industry."
good,"Average work culture and mostly management is least bothered about the colleagues."
good,As a company I would recommend and wish to continue but unfortunately I am unable to pick my right path or not seeking career growth personally due to management.
good,Little training with revolving clients expected to learn with no guidance or support the hardest part is working from home only corresponding via conference calls
good,"Your experience depends on your project and team. If both are ideal, you will get to learn a lot. If one of them is problematic, you might not be satisfied."
good,"Good workplace , flexible hours , supportive team and management "
good,Good place to work with. Infrastructure is good and there are lot many things to learn. But as a fresher i fell this is not the place to start  career with.
good,"top management decision for the organization is not proving so correct... need to rethink those again "
good,I have started my career with cognizant after my college. Their training to technology is not that good. After lot of struggle i have learned many UI technologies once i get in to the project. Management is not that good.
good,"I guess the shakeout at the top was long overdue."
good,"I started my career in Cognizant, I have learnt a lot here, very good company to with, good supporive management, good salary and work quality. I would highly recommend it."
good,"1. Day start is good."
good,"working with CTS, if your rating slips, then expect a pay cut straight away. type of a government company, can find lots of people with more than 10 years in the company."
good,Very good learning experience. Very nice work experience. Every latest technologies are used in this company. But appraisal is biased. For long term will be beneficial for career growth.
good,One of the worst consulting gigs compared to other similar companies but that mostly depends on what group you're in. People in other verticals may have different opinions
good,You need a network of know people else its going to be difficult to manage in teams. You will be working hard when u are in team and once u are in bench you get very less guidance to get into team again.
good,It was a cool work environment I wouldn’t say to say there longer than a year though. It’s a good job for someone going to school because they offer overnight shift
good,I have joined cognizant as a campus hire in 2016.I got chennai as my joining location.There was an extensive training program in Big data for 7 months.It was difficult to get into project initially and there was a long bench period.I took transfer to pune and got big data project.
good,Good to work but salary is less when compared with competitors. Work life balance is ok. Career growth is not that good. Good part is they sponsor Green card
good,"100% resource utilization, Fun Activities Indoor and Outdoor, Opportunities to showcase additional talents other than working. Different Volunteering Programs"
good,Onsite oppurtunities. Worldwide presence. God culture. Great people. Excellent learning division. Many top clients. Good benefits. Options to switch career paths
good,"I joined here as a fresher. Being a Fresher I was well trained in Java and Advanced Java. I got into a very good Technical stack Project. The Project didn't use Java intitially but as a Fresher I elarnt a lot... The seniors and managers were very nice and helpful."
good,"Projects with short life cycles"
good,"Good place to work. Most of the Leaders are friendly and create good environment. "
good,Needs organizational and cultural transformation. Lack of clear service lines leads to internal competition and inefficiency. Need additional priority on people development
good,"Good place to work and learn and apply the practical concepts."
good,"Was way good to employees few years back. and lots of employee benefits were given few years back.More onsite opportunities were provided."
good,"its ehhh. i like that they give you marketplace money every saturday."
good,"It's good overall if you are willing to do repetitive tasks with minimal analytical thinking."
good,"Cognizant was my first job . The technical aspects of data management was learnt at the cognizant . I learnt my 70% data management skills in cognizant."
good,Good in learning and growth.good opportunity in advance technologies.have to be good in salary improvemmets as well.learning wise very friendly colleagues and sta
good,It is a nice place to work but many a time the processes are too tedious to follow. HR is not very effective. The work force is very young and competitive. Lot of hierarchy and senior leadership keeps a distance from the younger workforce!
good,"I didn't like working there. It was boring and lacked efficient management and training.I went there in the rain and really applied myself as I was a little wet and wasn't hired even though I have the skills needed. They've wasted my time, one time too many!"
good,"Organization is overall good. However I never had great engagement during my stint. Centered around couple of VPs. Even though organization calls for open culture, micro management culture. Restriction to innovative ideas."
good,"The company was okay a bit unorganized when i was there.  The company doesn't allow room for growth, and people leave because of that. It's been a few years since i have been with  the company so I don't know what has changed."
good,I was part of support project. It was not much productive position. I was doing repetitive work everyday and my growth was stalled. One advantage was that I was working in agile environment.
good,"The company encourges us to work collabratively across verticals and horizontals. Apart from technical work, it also encourages to advance in career through technical and management programs."
good,"opportunities to learn diverse technologies and business"
good,"Good work life balance when you get a good management and client."
good,"A good company, but there are a lot of employees so promotions are scarce. Work life balance not very good, lots of long hours at client location. Not many PTO days."
good,"Excellent company.   "
good,"Good company. Good work ethic. Needs more employee integration in terms of superiors and fresh team members  not always being on the same page. Overall though, good place to work."
good,"A good company for freshers"
good,"Was Good Company but recently many changes happening.  No salary hike since last 2 year. Lots of reshuffling and attrition."
good,"have worked with CTS for about 10 months and i dont have much of impression about the company so far."
good,"It has good working environment and the managers are really encouraging, they provide medical insurance and ovarall takes good care of employees, but the salaries should be increased"
good,Good Company to work and  career advancement. But I have to engage in lot of profitability exercise and revenue target calls which are not related to Technical project work
good,"Productive Place, although high turnover Easy work, that's pretty straightforward. The management is pretty flexible allowing people to take off time as long as they make it up."
good,A large professional services organization with a strong reputation.  Very fast paced with the expectation of being available at all hours.  There is a lot you learn at this company.
good,Absolutely poor matrix organization with a lot of internal competion.  The old Cognizant culture has drastically been altered due to the empire building of mid managers
good,This is a goid place to work the training could be a little more intense but overall not a bad place to work other than contract work. I would hsve loved to continued employment but the contract was up.
good,"Just like any other company, it depends on the team your get and the managers you get."
good,"productive and fun place to work "
good,Good company which doesn't pay good salary. Good place to learn skills and move on to other companies for hike or to stay for the secured jobs. Decision is yours!
good,Very good company to start your journey after college or university. Good project opportunities. Very technology focused company. Management is not impressive.
good,Cognizant is a good company. I had good experience here. Learn new technology. I did few certification. Always I have completed my work on Time. Got a good review from my manager.
good,"Good company. Very bad paymasters. However, everything depends on the project you get and the manager you have. Very difficult to shift to new technologies."
good,"Ok place to work - most depends on your manager."
good,"Cognizant has a great teaching program/s for associates. "
good,"As far as i have known cognizant is for clans and hereditary. Every one has a God father who can help out. If the God father is out you are in deep trouble. Not sure if its the same in every location. I have been facing the same from every other locations and no changes anywhere. Work at cognizant is respectable, you can just hang on with the tide."
good,"Good company with good benefits."
good,An average service based company. No work life balance. Work from home options are minimal. Career growth is not given much importance. Less Salary Hike for experienced.
good,"I have more qualms with this company than appreciation. I was sorted into testing without having a choice and didn't move further up intellectually. The job was more about meeting deadlines and following repetitive steps rather than learning new things or being creative. But all said, the infrastructure and the experience of working at an MNC was substantial to my starting career."
good,"Cognizant is a multinational corporation that provides IT services, including digital, technology, consulting, and operations services. It is headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey, United States"
good,Cognizant Tecnology solutions is a service based company where the employees work for top clients. I used to be  a senior developer when i worked for Cognizant
good,Had a great time working in boston for CTS. Got good client exposure and support from management. I got to work on latest technologies.. Some days would be free lunches..
good,"It's a fun place to work but the culture is a bit different from other firms. The organization highly values internal talent, loyalty to the firm and new hires might take a long time to get used to the culture. People work very hard and stretch much beyond 9-5 work schedules and weekends."
good,"Work life is balanced. There is lot of learning opportunities, but you need to convince your manager for that. Management is very poor except at Director level folks. Workplace culture is okay. The hardest part of the job is you don't get what you desire and they management makes you do whatever they feel like. Flexibility is something which is enjoyable part of the job."
good,"I have learned the owasp and security techniques in the company because of completion of biometrics and cyber security in pg course at psg college, coimbatore."
good,Cognizant is a good company. The pros are the pay and promotions. The cons are that it is such a large company that sometimes it is hard to get things done.
good,"Not the best experience. Although work was good, middle management has no direction. They only want clients to be happy but give little to no respect for their employees (from what I've experienced)."
good,"Cognizant has many perks for working there, but I was part of a mass layoff after being there for a month. They pay well, but do not provide job security or longevity. I was in the top percentile during training as well as when I made my way to the floor after training and was still let go as part of a business need to let go of 400 employees. I have not been able to find decent work since. I turned down a great opportunity of obtaining my CDL based off of what I was told about this company through the interview process, which lasted over 2 months, believing it would help to change my financial position in life. I was emotionally and financially hurt when I was laid off. They did provide a severance package, but it simply was not enough"
good,"The culture was fantastic 4 years before. But recently it is getting worse by the day and work life balance is totally in ruins. Politics is unprecedented. Definitely not for smart workers. If you are ready to work hard and be the YES man to your boss, definitely the place to be in."
good,"Productive workplace, learning was always required, quality ratings, management could have been a little more approachable the hardest part was quality and there was a lot of great co workers"
good,"Environment of the workplace is highly influenced by the seniors and clients we work with."
good,Spent my days focusing on client needs. My typical day would be attending and leading meetings with the clients to determine the next steps to drive their CSP program.
good,"employees here are work friendly and cooperative ,and the office is "
good,"Not my ideal place to work, it was tedious and demanding. Had to account for every minute of work. Nice PTO benefits. Good training in house. Would never return to work there."
good,very large company they support many IT services around the world.  very large Indian presence which was different for me at first but i grown to like Indian people and they culture.  I have nothing but good things to say about this company.
good,Lots of opportunities for growth along with the exposure to a variety of clients across various domains/verticals. Training opportunities also provided
good,"very good and easy work learning environment,the staff there is very friendly and cooperative and moreover the location of the office is good to reach"
good,Okay overall. Specific experience comes with the immediate management you worked with. Had mixed feelings / experience ranging from good to bad. Benefits are average. Learning is average.
good,good workplace. nice benefits.the management find an account for the employees if the account does not renew its contract. HMO for the employee and 2 of his dependents
good,"Good Company to work for, some challenges are there like limited growth, work hours but overall good culture and job stability is there but compensation is less."
good,"It's the same in all cooperate companies, higher management just squeezes out all your potential and give you ratings when you obey their every silly thing."
good,had always fun to work and learn new things in a great  teams and  wonderful organisation. great place to improve skills and knowledge which helps ones career.
good,"I didn't quite work with Cognizant. I work with Anthem mostly. Most of my learnings were from the projects. Cognizant does not have any good training programs. You would most likely be place in a project and would learn on the job, Management puts more stress on dollar revenues and less worried about the employee development."
good,I was part of the Transition team that was kept on board when Cognizant took over at EmblemHealth. I work remote most days and am looking for something a little more long term that I can grow into.
good,"I enjoyed the Learning Curve within the Org. I have enabled with good tools and techniques to up-skill and cross-skill but at the cost of individual ability, availability based on the project deadlines as most times it will be so tight."
good,"Good work culture"
good,"Good work culture less hike, client facing, multiple locations in india and can easily recolate s and chennai headquaters and chennai based company an"
good,Lots of politics within the cognizant and to grow in cognizant you only need to have good relation with Manager. Your work doesn't matter at any level.
good,I started my career here. Its a good place to be at given the number of projects that it has accross various verticals and technologies.It provides good onsite opportunities.
good,"Company policies are either not intact or not in place at all. "
good,"It is a friendly workspace, feel a secure job. As see the salary for contractors are too low, can't be able to manage the life balance."
good,"Movement from one technology to another is next to impossible."
good,"Manager EDI"
good,"Recent organisational changes with resource segregation to Production support and Developers , creates a division and are separated to take up development work."
good,It will be good place for the beginners or entry level candidates. I had a very good experience with this company in terms of career and technology. You can definitely feel the work life balance in this company ...
good,"Cognizant is one of the world's leading professional services companies, transforming clients' business, operating and technology models for the digital era. Our unique industry-based, consultative approach helps clients envision, build and run more innovative and efficient businesses."
good,has lost employee focus after elliott's investment. good for general purpose programmers with intermediate coding skills.  cultuer is governed by the client you are working for.
good,"Extreme knowledge with regards to Medical Coding guidelines and coding techniques with ICD-9 CM, ICD-10 CM,CPT, Outpatient & Multi speciality Coding(Same Day Surgery & Observation, ED) , and Medical Terminology."
good,"good working place "
good,Need more teamwork with the business. People could of work together if there were some core requirement when it come to teamwork. team lead was at a different site and communication was on the phone.
good,"Expectation is to work numerous hours, including weekends.  No work/life balance.  Work hours are based on the client's expectations and managements lack of process improvement."
good,"- Good Place to work"
good,You got to do additional work along with your duties at client side. Over all you have to work more than you have to. It is a good place to work and learn.
good,"Nice Environment to work , people here are dedicated towards work."
good,"HR policies are very rigid and purely company-centric.Overall company is good to work. "
good,"The job involves being the person watching and reviewing posts on social media sites to see if they violate policy which isn’t that bad part. But they claim to always help you make your decision but it’s much more on your own figure it out, which ultimately hurts you in the end since how they review how well you’re doing is based on a slim amount of jobs you have done, and there is no consistency on how to decide on anything. There is no way to advance unless you play politics and get close to the higher management or those who recommend you, it’s not done based on reward and those who deserve it. "
good,"Cognizant is better place to work  they have good opportunists  and many projects. "
good,"This company is an outsourcing company. They were responsible for getting as much knowledge and training from senior management to perform the functions of those that were laid off or pending lay off from the company they contracted with."
good,I have worked on Cognizant contracts at different companies. Your day depends on the culture of the company your contract is with. The previous contract I had was extremely busy so there were lots of long days and nights. My current contract position is normally 8 hours days and overtime only when needed. As a Cognizant employee you are still require to participate in internal training an any training require by contracting company.
good,"Trainer did not have control of class;"
good,Job satisfaction and work life balance depends on the kind of project we end up .The first project was very laborious and was not doing great work .How ever the last
good,Outsourcing and IT consulting firm seeking to become a full service consultancy.  Historically very fast growing.  Strong relationships with client IT organizations.
good,"better work culture needed"
good,"The company has a good work culture and is doing a lot for improving the skill set of the employees, however needs to improve in employee recognition."
good,"It is alright but it is not a job where growth is guaranteed. Although, job security is given as long as your work is efficient. The team is decent and helpful and can be reliable."
good,This is a fine service company. The leadership is very focused on growing the company and become leader in IT service industry. Most of the time you are based out client location and has to adopt to client culture.
good,"Very good work cultureood work life balance maintained"" (in 2048 reviews)"
good,"Ok company.  Mostly consulting business.  Lot of fortune 500 customers.  Overall just ok. Nothing great. "
good,"Fine place to get expertise in various technologies."
good,The training sessions are the perfect bridge that is provided for new employees to get accustomed to the corporate world and ensure the employees maintain the highest level of professionalism throughout.
good,"Cognizant is a great place to work with employee centric policies but As a developer, I found that opportunities to learn new things and grow technically are very less."
good,"A fun team where you learn from everyone not just on the work front but on a personal level too. Being part of a team that is highly creative and comes up with most interesting ideas for not just deliverables but other activities makes the learning process holistic. "
good,"A great place to work, which balances the professional level and personal carrier as well."
good,Although it is nice company to work but it does not  provides enough recreational opportunity to relax or to develop yourself and to grow in the same field.
good,Hired in US and working on client side then no one will take care of you from the management. Managemnet never come and show off to understand the situation and your expectation.
good,"Learning was good, involved in working in various ETL tools like Ab initio, Data stage various versions and Talend. Involved in direct client interactions for requirements gathering."
good,What makes you stay with the company are your colleagues. HR who handles documents/requirements is careless. She losses important documents such employees transcript of records.
good,"A good place to work."
good,"Working with Cognizant was great except the compensation, it all depends on the Team we work in. My Team was great to work with and there was both learning and fun."
good,"Cognizant provides an excellent place for someone to hone their skills.   Although work life can sometimes be a bit stressful, the advantages of becoming thoroughly knowledgable are great"
good,"its routine job. Hard to change skill set."
good,"nice company, great people. one big drawback."
good,"Sit at computer. Learn policies that won't transfer to other employment. Management is vacant, although it is partially because of ramping up numerous employees."
good,Cognizant is good company and nice atmosphere and work location.Based on your Work performance you will get your promotion and also your salary hike..
good,"Better work-life management"
good,Sending jobs offshore. More and more jobs and support is being send to be done offshore employees. I dont feel comfortable there because every day I see that my friends are loosing jobs  because in order to save money support is being transfgerred offshore
good,"It once was a good company. They have grown huge and as a company they are doing better however for employees, they dont care much. Now everything is based on cost."
good,Its an environment where u can learn and share your knowledge with lot of SMEs performing IT IT'S flexible timing and other policies actually motivates one to work and brings out the best of ones capability
good,Great for learning skills at a challenging environment and dynamic projects. Learned both technical stuff and managing and training people who joined as freshers.
good,"Its a good place for starting your career but for people who do not like to be on bench, its a challenging situation. Good workplace & colleagues. thanks."
good,"Nice place to work. Got many new things to learn towards technology and management side as well."
good,Competitive place to work. Experienced and learnt the different work culture. Had a good work life balance. The hardest part of the job is when you were made to work on multiple projects and critical issue comes in all the projects at the same time.
good,"Cognizant does not have a lot of opportunities for US based employees.  In addition, there are a lack of training session available and not a lot of room for advancement."
good,"Everything is average here. Not paid as much as we work. Getting less visibility to the higher management, Poor people management. Very very less bonus and hike"
good,"Good Place to work with & has good knowledge base available for employees to up skill themselves on cutting edge technologies. So, I would prefer cognizant for people to upscale themselves as per industry trends."
good,I have good experience in Basic software skillset which i got in cognizant.But I was not given a opportunity to work on a desired and relevant platform.
good,"Started my career In Cognizant with great leaders, managers who helped, guided me through out my career here."
good,Its a nice exoeriemce to work with. Also best learning platform. Employee oriented Company. Friendky environment to work with. Employee benefits. Overall its good
good,"Great Place to work if you are a person who are excited about learning various healthcare processes. "
good,"Pro:"
good,"Good company for freshers and those looking for long term onsite, not good for experienced people looking  for career advancement and hikes. Middle management doesn't have managerial skills, company should invest on training them."
good,"have limited C++ technology "
good,"Lot of monotonous and repetitive work"
good,The workplace was a little boring because you were in a cubicle. But the environment was nice and they made sure the employees had all that they needed.
good,"Good place to learn things with very nice workplace culture. "
good,Good pace to work. Being at the thick of things helps. Given authority and responsibility. Salary Parity might be an issue. Line managers need to back their team better.
good,"This is where my worklife started. I had some good experiences. I was able to learn and deliver some challenging projects. Unfortunately, I had to leave the job as I wasn't assigned any projects after my first one got over. Had to advance my career."
good,"It's not so good company & lots of politics."
good,"I had worked with cognizant Technology Solution Bangalore Location INDIA."
good,"I am currently working at this company.  I view videos from a social media network.  (Having signed a Non-Disclosure agreement, I am unable to say which network it is).  After viewing the content, I make the decision whether to delete, mark as disturbing,escalate to authorities or let the video stay on the deck.  This is done by viewing 16 categories and the separate policies for each category."
good,"Very flexible,"
good,"It was a great experience in learning during my phase of training. Lots of technical gaining, and got to learn the typical corporate culture. Could be better in deploying projects to freshers."

good,"Pros : "
good,A good company to be with and lot of learning curves and good exposure to technical & functional domains by which we can grow as good professional in carrier.
good,"Pay is lesser. No work and personal life balance. Expected to work round the clock. The good part is, we have the separate horizontal business unit for ETL testing. Even if one of the ETL testing project gets completed, we will be assigned to another ETL testing project. It gives us chance to be a master of ETL testing."
good,"The work life balance is not very good. Benefits and compensation are average. The health insurance is good. Other insurance is optional. Other insurance is heavy on pocket for people with families."
good,"‘ Normal Day - 9 Hours Shifts, Blended process, calls & back office work"
good,"Friendly Working Environment,Green Card Option has been stopped which is making me to look for another option outside CTS.Cooperative Management,better Carrier growth"

good,"This company comparatively take care of its employees"
good,"Being the large organization it is, it has the typical ailments that bug organizations of this size. Recognition will be limited to the project/engagement/department you deal with. Company growth matches the industry growth. Nothing out of ordinary happens. Financial growth in an industry like this depends on how quickly you are able to switch from one company to other. Basic amenities are good. No freebies, no gifts make you feel left out."

good,"Operations Manager.  Good organization.  Work Culture is good balance.  Have more onsite opportunities and flexible working hours.  Good hike.  Employees are happy working,"
good,"A typical day starts with checking of emails, responding to emails if required, discussion call with team mates, go about the task for the day, evening calls with Onsite counter part/ Client and finally a status email at the end of the day. There was not much you could do to improve your knowledge as most of the tasks were simple and boring. Coming to the fun part it all depends on your supervisor. The most enjoyable part of the job is the work life balance."
good,During this job have learnt the team management and also facing the client and understand the requirements and completing the given task. Team here is very co-operative and understanding.

good,"There is good flexibility with work, but not much structure for entry level Associates. Communication of expectations and roles should be better explained by management, and new hires could be incorporated into the company culture better."
good,The company is ok over all . But they have very poor communication with the Staffing companies they use to hire people . The major issue I had with the company and staffing agency was the payroll
good,"Extracting more work in less time and money."
good,If you are not part of 10 % lucky guys then your job can be done a 10th class student with 6 months of training. If you do office politics and have good relation with managers it will be beneficial.
good,"Consultants are very good, Process Improvements needed, tools needed.  Oracle Solutions Practice where I worked is full of talented consultants.  Management should consider better strategies for business development."
good,"Working with them was good."
good,"Company have lots of opportunity to prove yourself, also have joyful working environment."
good,Cognizant once used to be a great IT giant now has fallen to bad times. The salary is not great and there are absolutely no perks. The COLA (Cost of living adjustments) provided for large cities is very low.
good,Good company to work with. The only problem is politics in higher level management which adversely affect the employee rating and promotions. The work and life balance is good.

good,"Due to personal reason quite job immediately. Nothing to say so much about this company."
good,"Cognizant has a good work culture. It is slow on recognizing employees for their contribution. Salary hikes, salary parity and promotions to deserving candidates is a big area for Cognizant to improve on."
good,"Good opportunities to groom oneself as a professional, climbing up the ladder is difficult and too much management dependent. Not much focus on employees at mid and lower level"
good,"Good company to work for had no issues in 7 years working with this company.Gave me good opportunities to grow in my work.Good work culture, but work life balance have to improve."
good,Good. Expecting more relevant jobs with location specific. Product based company openings post are appreciated. Getting minimal jobs with no response for applied one . I would expect to recieve responses from applied companies.

good,Productive and growth oriented. Has learnt new technologies and had opportunity to work in a wonderful work culture. Had opportunity to represent cognizant at client location outside india
good,"Productive, updating latest technologies to associates."
good,"Cognizant was very stable to Work for, but not anymore. Your ratings are in the hands of your manager and he can give you any rating as he wants. Performance does not matter here, if you have ever hurt your manager's ego, you are doomed to receive the lowest rating possible."
good,Good place to work but at the same time I need to explore more opportunities so that I can gain more diverse and extensive knowledge of OBIEE and learn any new technology or domain skill as well if got an opportuninty.

good,"Working at various client location changes and fairly get a chance for R&D and innovation at work."
good,"Good place to work at, good training provided. Work life balance though is sometimes hard to maintain. Managers and team leads are co operative. Overall, a good company to work for."
good,". Transparent Organization."
good,Got good leaders from whom I have learnt everything. It's a very secured company for lady associates. Explored many things through my job and gave my best.
good,Cognizant technology solutions is a great company to work with and has a fair work life balance. Just the mandatory work hours that is 9 hours daily seems like a drag when you do not have much work for a day.
good,"Good Company,Flexibility,"
good,"I am working here from the last year i have learnt a lot from this company , For Exposure it is very good, Management is good ,Work culture is nice . The hardest part of the job is shifts."

good,"Productive work place, most enjoyable part of the job is that i find time for gym to do my workouts"
good,this is a company which had risen very fast and was a good paymaster but seems the US government and the visa changes has forced it change its IT strategy. It wants to do away with the people in India as the cost gained is less and hiring more in USA. So the profit margin will now be much lesser and so the growth. will impact the employees accordingly
good,"here, I was worked one year,it is like a autonomous college, its very difficult working culture ,its very difficult to understand environment,here lots working pressure and tress,"
good,"In the 3 years that I have served in the organisation(starting as a trainee and till becoming an associate), I feel that I get to learn a lot of things."
good,Had issues with the performance rating that the management cannot explain. One factor that holds the employee to do his best is transparency from his/her superiors/leaders. This helps the employees to stay motivated.
good,"the chance to give something back, share my skills, learn new skills, share my knowledge and gain new experiences different from the ones i was familiar with"
good,"Good Place to work, however most of the projects works for 24/7 and hence we have to work around the time. good management and work culture. career growth"
good,we can learn a lot. management all are not alike but yeah many others to help. workplace culture surely not that good. may b transparency was less. most enjoyable part was training and weekends and challenges in day to day work.
good,"Much of work here, in what I've seen, has a lot of high pressure, low satisfaction, routine application maintenance projects. The innovation track has not much to offer, as investments in teams and ambience for creativity are sparse, naturally. Revenue focus where it shouldn't be the only or top priority, is an issue with many project teams. Change is flowing in, albeit very slowly. Regular income seekers who are looking for run-of-the-mill work would find them aplenty here. Folks passionate about software might find it tough to stay!"
good,"CTS is a good place to work at. There is sufficient work-life balance. Lots of fun activities to get involved in. Facilities like admin, security and transport provided are good."
good,It depends on project we are working with. There is no proper R & R define. Not sure about the Career growth. There no one on one meeting with Manager while appraisal.

good,"Good Place to work , lot of opportunity to explore new things carrier growth with learning opportunity as well as  ,work culture is good for freshers and experienced both."
good,"Cognizant is the most good company in the IT industry."
good,Good work place. But hinjewadi phase 3 is too far. People should be allowed to leave the work place if their work is completed in time. Otherwise its a good company
good,"It's really good experience working with them. Good work culture, good pay. Enjoyed my tenure with them. Workload is bit more as usual as other Indian companies"
good,got opportunity to work in agile projects.Learned testing methodologies.exposure to different technologies and frame works.The hardest part is prolonged work hours.The most enjoyable part was the team work.
good,"Good company "
good,Limited work. No challenging positions. Exposure to Management is more considered than exposure to Work. Managment won;t bothers about employee aspiration.
good,This organization will help to set my carrier growth and learning skill was excellent and the job professional was too good to work there. I feel satisfied in all the terms.
good,"There is lot of work pressure in Company and also culture is same as in other MNCs. I have learnt lot of new things in the company. Also, its a good company to work with."
good,"Company is good"
good,Warm atmosphere to work in. One navigates the clients needs and expectations with the software product being produced. An offshore presence is utilized to keep testing and development services to meet deadlines effectively. One manages the tasks to an offshore presence and presents results to the client.
good,Good place to learn and work.Learned a lot from the projects that i worked.Complete understanding from HLD document analysis till delivering the project.
good,"Good Place to start a career. Great Management. Exposure is great. Learn , grow and proceed environment . Next Gen technologies are being introduced . Nice remuneration offers"

good,"Good Company to start your career."
good,"Good company with good workplace and good opportunity to learn with good management."
good,"It works like a regular IT firm in India, nothing other than that. But the good thing is it is easy to get notified for your work. The teams are good to work with."
good,"work life balance will depend on which account they will assign you. there are toxic accounts and less toxic accounts. the only issue i had is the turnaround time when you resign, because it took them 3 months to process your final pay. which for me is way too long"
good,"Good place to work and explore. good work environment.     "
good,"Very Conventional , Non Flexible Organization with Inverted pyramid work hierarchy , work culture is good, Performance ratings are partial and unfair."
good,Expected more challenging role. Work culture is good. Learnt a lot. Upskilled myself on several aspects. Wish to work by taking up major leadership roles.
good,"Good Company,  best place to work,  best place to learn,  no dress code, good flexibility,  work life balance, cooperative manager flexible timing. This makes it good company."
good,Very strong intrapreunerial culture with end to end responsibility from Presales to BD to Delivery and Technical contribution. But no clear clarity in career growth for senior level folks
good,"I have been working at Cognizant Technology Solutions full-time (More than 2 years)"
good,"-flexible timings"
good,"Need more direction. "
good,"There are lots of opportunities in this organization as the project domains are vast. But being an organization with a huge workforce , career advancement is very slow. Once you land into the right project then there is no looking back."
good,"was a great company, but things are only going downwards. lately too many salary increase is minimum, and work pressure is increasing enormously.So i would say to find an alternative."
good,I have nothing to say about the company .it is a goo pplace to work.       Nothing to say abt the company. Company that pay the variable pay to.the employee s without out fail  '...........................................................................
good,There are not much projects in Cognizant at present as most of the projects went to their competitors. Difficult to get a project when on bench. mandatory 8-9 hours working
good,"Workplace is really useful to enhance our working skills , knowledge and very challenging. During my training period, HR was unable to provide time for proper training to complete the preliminary tests, So the trainee has to be careful in case of escalation."
good,"Good Culture"
good,"Good environment to Work"
good,Used to be a great company to work. Things changed with time. Not a best company to work for anymore. No work life balance in most of the projects. Skip this company.
good,"Management do not involve and support in team activity."
good,I start my day with data management work and allocate the work to my team members. I learned a lot in cognizant regarding data management. Cognizant is a good place to work and I enjoy a lot by doing my work.

good,"Stable place to work, good benefits as per increments and stability. Good onsite opportunities though varies from project to project. Easy policies for the employees to follow."
good,"work life balance and increments in salary in Wipro is far better than Cognizant. In wipro, timings are wrost. rest are fine. but ucf and trend next exams are not good. how can a company decide by just putting an exam and find the caliber of a resource."
good,Good working place. Smart dress code is really a good initiative. Have been working here for almost 5 years now so don't see any major issue or concern with the organisation.
good,"Good Job Work/Life Balance, Compensation/Benefits, Job Security/Advancement, Management and Job Culture. Over all a good company and good learning experience."
good,Working is ok in cognizant. Timing is constraint. Working is fine no issues. Able to learn more technical and nice workplace. Management skill is also established well.

good,"I got good IT experience in Cognizant Technology Solutions. But didn't get the expected post and suitable post for my career."
good,Good for an IT graduate but not so much for any senior developers. Mostly the managers are adamant and people who have been to CTS for so many years are promoted even when they don't have the required managerial skills.
good,"I was originally contracted to hire from a temp agency and signed for 6 months, then got another extension on the original contract.  Loved the schedule."

good,"this comopany is just like any other company"
good,"Organisation is good. Learning scope is there, one needs to show his/her interest in various fields and has to chase your managers overtime that you are seeking for learning new. Its just everyone leaves their managers not the organisation."
good,People who are beginning their IT life might find it really a good place to start with. Good thing about the company is that there is freedom to express your concerns to the superiors. It might or might not prove to be useful but at least you have the platform to express your thoughts.
good,"Good Company to work."
good,Many project opportunities here.  Workplace culture is laid back. I learned a lot about quality assurance and testing.  Everyone is very nice and friendly and willing to help you.
good,Good Environment for enhancing  our own skills.And also cooperation among all team mates with mutual harmony.And chance to grow in this company is more.

good,"Cognizant is no more employee friendly, as they have assigned so many assessments to employees."
good,It is a good workplace with lots of opportunities and worldwide market. Very much flexible towards employees. Lots of onsite opportunities and technical exposure.
good,No single supervisor making it difficult regarding expectation. No career growth opportunity as focus is on staff augmentation and not on skill. Very poor work/life balance
good,There is a lot of learning and growth but work life is not managed properly. Specially for people working in night shifts.
good,A typical work day would consist of testing an application/software and communicate with manager or other team members(BAs and other QA associates) on the testing results. Many things that I learned is automation testing and I did this through my good mentor and co-worker at my onsite project. My mentor expanded my mind on how to approach testing situations and how to approach automation. He also taught me or pushed me to start coding in C#.NET and using the automation tool selenium. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning something new that I would have never thought I would learn.
good,Good company policies but very bad management. The project management process totally destroyed my creativity. I do not have any work life balances and turned me a robot.
good,"Joined as a fresher in this company and learned a lot in my carrer and my co-workers guides me in all things."
good,"Overall a very good company...great job security, excellent flexibility, but everyone works hard. Compensation and advancement not great, esp in corporate functions, unless you are a management favorite"

good,Working in Cognizant is really good. I enjoyed every moment working there. Good place where everyone can have lot of opportunities for learning.
good,Regular consulting activities. Good place to work if one needs visa sponsorship. Growth oppurtunities are not good. Pay is moderate. Work-life balance depends on the project
good,Very aggressive and thinking ahead. Not a pay master for onsite employees. Company has been around 25 years in the industry and has grown tremendously outbeating competition
good,Was a decent experience. But not many growth opportunities . Depends on the team and project one lands up in. That makes a difference..There should be flexibility to move around within the company in terms of roles and locations.

good,"They do not pay their employees enough, they loose good talent because of this. Also there is to much red tape to be creative.. I do not really have anything else to say, that is why I am looking for another job."
good,"Workplace is very calm and all of the teammates are very friendly and cooperative.We are connecting with other teammates also.We have an option to work from home every 10days in a month."
good,"A typical working day starts from 10 am and may stretch about 10 pm ,maintaining 9 hours is a must everyday. Learned the ethics of a corporate world, the work culture, project works,working under tight schedules and deliver the requirements."

good,"hectic work "
good,"There was an issue on someone else's app and that was holding entire testing effort for 2 whole days.I volunteered to get involved and was able to resolve it with in few hrs."
good,"Work/Life balance is good."
good,Its Productive & had a lot of things to learn Professionally and Individually. Had a great experience as a fresher. Achieved appropriate technical and management skill.
good,"A good company to work , but with the minimal work -life balance. There is no much new technology learning available in the company"
good,Sales focused. Lot of politics. The yearly review process is a joke. Promotions are not based on it as both of them happen at different times of the year. Only employees that play cricket with the manager are considered for promotion.
good,Other than the poor time management of the company management the company is top notch. The perks are less than that of similar companies. The co-workers extremely competitive. The hardest part of the job was to wait for hours knowing the job won't arrive till the latter part of the day and complaining about there not being an evening shift as it suited the client best.
good,"Productive,good place to learn but Salary and Benefits are not up to the Industry standards."
good,"The hours are great, really relaxed environment."

good,This job had excellent benefits. My boss was great and I met some of my best friends here. The upper management didn't keep their promises and they didn't care if you were there or not. you were a number.
good,Cognizant is an ideal workplace for one to settle. The work environment and salaries are well structured and is inline with the market standards.
good,"Cognizant is one of the good place to work.You have many opportunities here.fun work place. "

good,"It is great place to work with a high ethical corporate culture. The day starts cool and enjoying with a good campus atmosphere and work environment.  Good opportunity to learn and grow with the company. I have been empowered to perform my job. The internal politics also a part of life at Cognizant. The work life balance is good at Cognizant. Most enjoying part is getting great opportunity to meet and work with different people from different region.  "
good,"Fun place to work with good environment. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company. Friendly environment but poor hikes and promotions."
good,"It was a fun work place Management was supportive Work culture was good, deliveries which we used to do were flexible and clients were also supportive"
good,I have learnt a lot from this company. I have gained expertise in technical domain and other skills also. This company is very good in terms of job security. This company trains their employees in a very well manner.
good,"The company is good but the coworkers are annoying. The company has a bell curve rating which means that you need to pull someone for you to come up. Learning and technology totally depends on the project that you are in. There are not many challenging projects. Job security is good. You need to pamper your boss always if you need promotion. Even if you don't work but just pamper your boss, you will get appreciations and promotions. That's the way the company works. HR blindly believes whatever the managers say is correct."
good,I really enjoy the work that I am doing but I work 100% remotely from my apartment and I miss the structure and interaction from a typical work environment.
good,Good HR policy but you can not easily grow with only your talent there are lots of politics and other things we need to take care.

good,"Overall good experiance "
good,"- focuses on employees growth and aspirations"
good,"Good place to work. they have lot of projects and clients. So your job is secured. But they will make you to work for more than 50 hours per week after certain level. They ask you to prepare several decks and process documents for every single stuff. At one point you will do more process work more than your project work."
good,"Great company to learn ..but difficult to grow up in the value chain. Vendor based company with a plethora of projects across various domains and technologies..."
good,"Cognizant functions more in an Indian government style. If you are a fresher it does not matter what skill set you have, even if you belong to top institutions. They will hire you because you have a specific skillset but in the end the Global Work Force Management team throws you wherever they can find an empty cabin."
good,"It depends on which account you are placed. Some accounts are great and you learn a lot, and other accounts they aren't as willing to help you."
good,"Nice place to work where one can learn alot."

good,This company is good to start your career but longer perspective it's not good as limited career growth.Middle management is not up to the mark to run this company.
good,"Being a consultant is a great opportunity starting out. You get to look at an industry objectively and meet a lot of new people and discover new places.The challenge I face is lack of management culture and no feeling of connectivity. Your work is so primarily focused on delivering what the client wants, that it detracts from your own personal and professional growth and goals. At times, you may feel like you are no longer employed by the consultant firm the gives you your pay checks. "
good,There is hardly any growth after you join this company. You need to make sure you get a good designation when you join. Benefits wise they are better than other Indian IT firms. Work-life balance is above average. It mainly depends on the project and your manager.
good,"Overall a good company to start with. However there is no ideal place  in this World so as applicable for Cognizant. But to move on, we have to change to shape up a good carrier with versatile experience."
good,A good company but the work quality is mostly location dependent. Even if you have the talent you need to be in either Chennai/Bangalore to get good oppurtunities.
good,"There is good job Security but management is not so good."
good,"Good place to work with if located in Pune and Chennai. The organisation has a good atmosphere and flexibility."
good,very nice environment to grow but you need to speak up for it. Good client list and most of the time employee's concerns are heard out.
good,"Well it's a good experience to be part of it. But to proceed my career need a strong platform."
good,"Can learn new and cutting edge technologies on job."
good,"Great place to learn and grow. Need not work hard to get move up the chain. If you know the right people, you can grow. Work life balance and benefits are not good."

good,"The place is good to start career in IT services. As a fresher one gets plenty of opportunities to learn cutting-edge technologies hands-on.Good open door culture. One can approach anyone for help, guidance and support."
good,"no motivation, no fun at work, no meetings regarding job satisfaction, employee needs, employee benefits, no appraisel, etc etc.."
good,"It is a good place to start and learn many things. Middle level management will ask lot of questions to sanction the paid vacation. There is no incentive for any over time, which was expected out of each employee. Appraisal process will be always one sided. I never heard anyone's appraisal rating got changed after a one-one meeting with their supervisor. Year on year compensation will grow under 5%, however their expectation out of employee will grow above 50%."
good,"Hectic work pressure, long s teaches and unmatched timings"
good,The company teached us most of systematic and Effective management skills.
good,"Since i joined company i have hectic schedule, didn't not get single moment free, but i get one benefit i have learned lot in this cmpany. my co-workers are supportive."
good,"Worked at three different location (Pune, Kolkata and Chennai) and enjoyed a lot. Cognizant has different work culture at all this three location. Most enjoyable part of the job is in Chennai during training."
good,Cognizant has provided me ample opportunity to work with emerging technologies in ETL like Syncsort DMExpress.
good,Excellent place to learn.Each and every day you get something new to learn.Perfect place for perfect experience.
good,Cognizant is one of the rapidly growing organizations and the effect of that is felt at all levels. The management is proactive is continuing this growth and identifying areas of improvement.Work culture is usually quite dynamic and requires lot of commitment to one's job.
good,Cognizant give us job security. Good exposure to work at client location. Helps to handle various client requirements. Opportunity to work with client team members. Hardest part of the job is tracking many things. Best enjoyable part is the next day of successful production release.
good,Good company to work for. expereince varies and mostly depends on the manager and project
good,"As our job is client specific, and the project I was working is in critical state so I didn't had good experience but co-workers and management was good."
good,It was a nice short term experience to work for CTS.
good,Very big company. It provides lots of facilities to the employees.
good,"Typical Service Company. Lot of focus on profitability, allocation etc. Limited focus on competency building. Employee is responsible for their own growth."
good,"I joined Cognizant as a Trainee, and have worked there for almost 3 years. It is a great place to learn technology and it helps you to understand how an organization works"
good,"I worked at Cognizant Technology Solutions full-time for more than 3 years"
good,"Nice place to work. Managers are great, colleagues are helpful and have good behavior. They tell you all the things thorougly. Work is stressful. Overall a nice to place to work."
good,"Well, it depends on the project for which you have been hired. Cognizant's culture is well balanced and comfortable. If you are hired for a Vendor based project and had to work at client's location then things might get difficult as you have to go under stress else, you can enjoy your job role."
good,Always changing and having to learn new things management is ran like high school. Place needs more improvement only good thing is the pay. No room for advancement.
good,Its a great organization to work with where you can increase your skills however there are some management issues which they need to work on. the work culture is nice and provide good facilities.
good,As a fresher you'll get to learn as they provide prior training. Nice company to start your career. Various projects are available so you get to learn different different technologies.
good,A very good place to start a career out of college. Depending on the Team & project everything can change but luckily I got the opportunity to work with some great folks who were not only supportive but helped in multiple fronts.
good,"Cognizant is a good company to work with, but your growth is restricted by client billing rates. I get to do good work and the benefits are industry competitive. I have very helpful colleagues."
good,"check if there any policy changes and learn the ways of the new policy changes to train others, conducted huddle to inform others, speak to management about ways to improve productive across the board"
good,"overall it is good, but salary and increments are not upto the mark. Need some improvement in terms of salary and there should be some employee benificials also."
good,"Company is good. Pay is good. However immediate managers make life difficult when they are biased. Favoritism exists. Till now the jobs were secure. But now, looking at the current scenario, Job security is the major concern."
good,"Overall good experience, "
good,"One of the largest mammoth organization which is still trying to remove the imbalances it has created over years of it's growth. "
good,They weren't clear on the job description and what would need to be done exactly. Getting on the floor for production was crazy and they claimed the new hires as priorities but in reality they don't get the help they need.
good,Company with good projects but need self learning is there. aim is toward company and project delivery only. Wide opportunities to learn and work. self motivation and relationship building is required
good,I believe working has taught me to look at the bigger picture. I love helping people making a difference in the lives of our customers and providers. The leadership team grooms you in order to make sure your staff can grow and become leaders and surpass their Team Leads.
good,good place to work. work life balace based on our approach. good place to technical people. many people without promotion for long time. some people are getting promotion as per their wish.
good,Some people work hard and others are only chilling. No work/ Life balance. 12 hours daily work is required .Also salary increment is not good. Only variable part is incrementing.
good,"It is a good place to work, but the company is not matching the employee's salary with the current market trend. It is always focusing on to satisfy their customers. So when we compare with employee welfare they are not the best."
good,Cognizant gives you enough options to explore your interest.
good,"After your UG CTS is the best place to start off your career. Although for progress you may have to jump within one year, Especially If you are in testing."
good,"1. Good personal life and work life balance"
good,Cognizant is a outsourcing company. They have many projects and probably  receive lots of money from company like Facebook and Google. But they paid a very low salary for their employees.
good,Level of management can be improved. Instead of cascading pressure from higher management to lower it could be handled in a smart way. Associates should be allowed to pursue their own technology aspirations and ambitions instead of forcing them to work under the horizontal/vertical they do not want to be part of.
good,We were acquired by CTS and we did not get the resources or management time needed to continue to build our company. We ended up being slowly dissolved. Poor IT infrastructure led to long lead times for new programming and poor response times. Clients became unhappy and work slowed.
good,"An usual IT company with no difference from other IT companies. Has its brand value in our country. Salary can be improved for the associates. Project managers and higher level people are still reluctant new technologies in my project, so for me it didn't seem nice :|"
good,"They will appreciate only that person who are there only for managers and not for your self."
good,"I worked in day shift here environment is good. "
good,"Slow promotions, office politics, fair compensation, lot of onsite opportunities, less hike, relocation allowance is good. Green card processing for all employees"
good,"This company is good for beginners as they encourage to upgrade your professional skill. Along with this, they are very much concern about security of female employee"
good,"Its a great company to work for if you wish to have a good work life balance. Regarding promotions, it entirely done on the basis of the period you have spent in the company and your relations with your manager. There is no place for exceptional talent to be praised at all."
good,"- Good work experience with the client, on technical and personal front."
good,"A well maintained job culture generally of 9 hrs."
good,"Needs to align payscale business wise"
good,"Lot of activities to participate in if you are really interested, such as technology innovation drives, volunteering, fitness competitions etc. Good and supportive management. Good cafeteria facility. But you will be part of the ocean so accept the difficulties that come with it,"
good,"On se croirait dans une grande boite américaine (ah oui on y est) avec son café gratuit, son baby-foot, ses bureaux rutilants..."
good,Delays the promotion for everyone. No job security. Give good money in all. You also have to maintain the total hours you work on daily basis(it was better before when no one use to care about hours and only focused on getting work done).
good,"Cognizant Solutions continues to grow rapidly and consistently globally."
good,"Great place to work, as per salary incentive are not much as expectations. Work culture is good and management help you to grow with upcoming technologies."
good,"Policies are good."
good,Good place to work provided you end up with the right project and right manager. Management is not that great but not the worst. Employee does get to opportunities to expand his career. Definitely not the worst place to work at.
good,"Cognizant is an ok company to work for, not enough leave is the biggest challenge and the soc is pretty imature in my opionoin.  Better onshore suppert would help"
good,"The environment you work in depends on the leadership that is in place. It's a good company but if your leaders are busy managing up, you'll have a hard time advancing. Not the worst experience, however, and I recommend people as everyone's experience is unique."
good,"Not a good place to begin your career with. There is a lot of politics in the company, work culture is not that good, you are judged based on the time you spend in office and not the quality of work."
good,"I have been there a little over a month and the work so far is good. Free snacks and drinks, the dress code is very relaxed, you can pretty much wear anything that is not too short or spaghetti strapped. It feels like high school or college atmosphere.  The co-workers are very nice and helpful to new workers. you will always need help from them around you when reviewing the work. you will review content from different social media sites. you will review graphic content so if you are very weak, do not apply.  They do have some great incentives if you make it past on the job training. You will not have any customer interactions which is great. you sit at a computer and just review info and makes a determination from there.  The schedule selections are not great. you will have from 3 to 5 different shifts to bid on and hope you get what you want. if not you get what you get. you will much likely not have the weekend off or a morning shift but you can always trade someone if possible. It seems to be a good place to work and get experience."
good,"Job is enjoyable but is also performance based, which creates a lot of stress. Constant changes and miscommunication create a lot of confusion among representatives. Very disorganized."
good,"Its was good working with the company. I have learnt many thing such as below:"
good,"Ensured that claims were keyed with accuracy and processed"
good,Since the company is a service based company you won't get to work on your coding skills though there are programs and training sessions on new tools and technologies but not enough code oriented projects for you to implement what you learn through these training programs.
good,"Just ok. Not highly focused on training and advancement of employee. "
good,Good for laterals to work. Learning will be good under a good mentor. Strictly you have to follow 9hr daily in office.Good pay scale for lateral entries .
good,Good place to work. Onsite opportunity are more compare to other companies. Very good learning development programs to build out skills but for resources which are onsite at customer location hardly get it.
good,I joined cognizant as a entry level trainee. Management asks to work for 10hrs a day and even on weekends with no appreciation. Overall average experience of working in cognizant.
good,"Most of your work goes unnoticed"
good,The Turnover rate is too high an they did not make you feel valued and needed . They Never offered FTE to any one in the class i started when we had a few people that needed the benefits for their homes and children .
good,"I do not enjoy working as a contractor.  This was a temporary assignment as a favor to my former employer.  A majority of the contractors that work for Cognizant are of foreign descent and sometimes hard to understand.  I often had to work remotely with off-shore developers, which was difficult at best. This is not the type of work for me.  I prefer a full-time position with benefits."
good,"Provides stable environment with lot of opportunities to take advantage of."
good,"I have around 8 years of IT experience and having primary skills as datastage, oracle, Unix and my secondary skills is informatica. I worked as a team lead and directly interact with customer on daily basis for requirement gathering."
good,"Pros"
good,Colleagues on assignment work as a true team. Hardest part of job as with all consultancies is balancing Client expectations and Consultancy expectations. Overall good place to learn and gain some essential training for future development.
good,"I worked for almost 5 years in CTS and it was pretty satisfactory for me as I got opportunity to work for various domains during my stint with the organization."
good,"Company is too good. Its one of the Top company i should say. Only drawback is the salary what they pay in the particular location. Cannot survive in that salary. Management is also a problem too much of favor-ism. Learnt a lot, Process, Strategy Planning.. Managing team in High cycle, Training juniors, communication etc. Environment and culture is also good."
good,"It's fast paced and never boring"
good,"Its  more than 13 years of association, learned different technologies, got opportunity to work with great leaders of different geographical locations."
good,Productive fun to work Good learning good exposure likely to recommend other Good work culture .Everyone at least need to work once in lifetime in this company
good,"We need to complete the work within the TAT , so we will work as the team to complete that task , it's like a race but we enjoy and work for it. But any thing is achievable with motivational and enthusiastic team."
good,"Nice place to work and easy to learn new skills,the environment of company is good.the management was work friendly .overall it is a good company to work"
good,"The organisation is doing good overall. The management in salesforce hyderabad practice is not so good, but you can really find few cool fellow associates to help you out when needed."
good,"work culture is good... If we are lucky enough to get a good manager, everything works out well..Otherwise it is a downhill from getting the most insignificant work and in the end no recognition.."
good,Over the years the company had grown into big corporation. Due to it s size all people may not get equal opportunity. Need to have some luck + skill to succeed.
good,"Been with cognizant from last 6 years  and enjoyed lot and it is great workplace to explore your opportunities "
good,"Cognizant Technology Solutions is a nice place to start with and learn. Newer responsibilities are given and awarded time to time."
good,"Work includes ETL development."
good,Higher management will sign the agreement with client saying my employees will support like slaves and 24*7 including weekdays from office. They don't agree to provide Laptop.
good,Cognizant's HQ is located in the US but the majority of delivery is offshore.  There is not a lot of focus on training for US employees or opportunities for advancement
good,"Strong financials, solid growth company. Excellent brain trust of knowledge. Very nice people. Good standing with clients. Perfect for an employee who is eager to move up the ladder."
good,"Not always work available"
good,"Good Company to work for but with limited growth at on shore."
good,"Typical day - routine work"
good,"Good company to work in relax mode but no career oppurtunity."
good,Overall Cognizant is a good organization. Job Security and job culture are few positive things. The compensation or benefits you get are somewhat less.
good,"The work culture is good and it depends upon the project you land, I have seen some worst and best projects."
good,"Work culture is not great and the pressure is quite high."
good,Huge client database. Decent work culture with good job security. Lack a bit in management. Need to improve on supporting the employees in certain issues.
good,Its been an amazing journey till now. Everyday learning new things and i feel job culture is excellent. People around you are friendly and co operative.
good,"Good To work with cognizant technology solutions. But career growth is important, no identity for the work done here in the projects By the management."
good,"I have been working with the Cognizant Technology Solutions as a full time employee."
good,"Good experience overall. It's learning track for everyone if it is anyone's first employer. Trustworthy entity."
good,"Work environment is good, people are approachable, get to learn things, many e-learnings and internal trainings are in place to learn new things, cafetaria is good, job safety, work-life balance depending on the project one is assigned to, work celebration, birthday events etc."
good,"Good for starting carrier as fresher, but very slow incremnet and some management guys are not good and professional, working environment is good, infra is good"
good,Good place to work with Nice benefits. All depends on your business account you work for. Challenging environment with lost of existing opportunities.
good,"Long hours, no work.life balance, overloaded work, good opportunity, onsite and etc.. management is good and can be better, resource needs to be treated and given good opportunity"
good,"i have worked on Ping Federate Sailpoint and Sun identity management. currently I am working on Ping Federate."
good,Overall its a ok ok company and didnt have higher expectations as joined as a fresher.When you join as fresher things are much simpler than experienced canditates
good,"Scope for learning is wide, huge breath of services"
good,Productive Workplace and Less RENUMERATION. Greater Learning Platform. Flexbile timings.Lot of redundant resources.hence visibility is very low.I would rate Cognizant for freshers.
good,"Cognizant has been a good and stable company for so many years."
good,A good workplace and one where oppurtunities galore. Need to get into the right project to get the right benefits.But very bad in bus transport management.
good,"Pros"
good,"If your new to the world of IT, this is a great job for you. The company gives you exposure and opportunities in all facets of the IT world. If you love new technology and want to be with a company on top of it, this is the job for you."
good,It's a great place to work for people who want to learn and advance in career in technical field. Though the management and client does not bother about the experience level of the resource and expect them to code as long as the resource can.
good,"Good place to kick start your career. Multiple domain within company to switch internally."
good,Work depends on your project. Everything is random for a fresher. Difficult to get a project of your choice. Domain of work is totally random for a fresher
good,"Career opportunity is very less with in the process."
good,"Identifying and undergoing required trainings to upskill oneself across issue classes to increase fundability"
good,"On a given day, during the early hours you will find me speaking to the clients, finding out – proactively – what their priorities are for the week, meeting with team for half hour to communicate the clients’ needs and organizing the team schedules around the client’s priorities."
good,"First of all, respect your freshers. Make the system little transparent. Apply some kind of meritocracy instead of random and haphazard process for the selection of freshers in the project."
good,Good company to work. Salary is normal. Incentives used to be high. But this year it's comparatively very low. Mandatory certifications need to be completed every year. No extra benefits other than the medical insurance
good,Moderate learning opputunities. Good work culture. Work - life balance depends on the client. Management is good. But cannot vouch on the job security. Satisfactory salary and other benefits.
good,Culture in Cognizant is very diverse. Individual is given full freedom for his work and not pressurized to work. Overall good place to work. Fun loving environment with very friendly top management. Individual is given rights to address any concerns regarding work or any personnel.
good,"Cognizant provides services in many domains and it provides facilities to the employees to learn and grow in the respective domains with the help of courses, trainings and learning materials. Processes and policies are alright, some good and some annoying."
good,It's a good company to build a good carrer. The Projects in kolkata are of a bit base level and development projects are rarely found.Internal Salary hike is not good.
good,"Cognizant is a good company, good work culture"
good,"Healthy Environment to grow.  "
good,"one of the world's leading professional services companies, transforming clients' business, operating and technology models for the digital era. Our unique industry-based, consultative approach helps clients envision, build and run more innovative and efficient businesses."
good,"working with Cognizant is agood experience for me."
good,Good place to work enjoyed a lot with pears had a good time working with the management changed company because of growth managment is good good culture
good,Its basically a good company but projects are pretty less especially in mobility. Bench strength is too high. Most people aren't billable. Job security is an issue. Apart from that existing projects are good with some big clients in their kitty.
good,"Good job for candidate with high interest in qualification"
good,The working hours are 9 hrs. Being a fresher I learned a lot in cognizant. We had a very enthusiastic team. Sometimes it was very hectic with lot of work loads.
good,"Ok company to work. Good work life balance. Job culture is manageable. "
good,"Job security is very high, lot of opportunities to learn . "
good,The facilities are good to begin in IT but the learning environment can be still be improved upon. There are opportunities for mobility and people are helpful though.
good,"You dont get to learn much here unless you find yourself in  challenging projects."
good,Great work culture. A fresher is not allowed to choose their career path and is forced to adapt to the company's needs. No career progression for freshers. Compensation is less compared to similar companies.
good,"The medical management department, is the most unorganized, unprofessional department. That I`ve ever worked in, immaturity from both management and staff. Makes a cake job somewhat difficult to work in."
good,My working experience in Cognizant has been pretty well. It is better than similar other Indian IT companies in terms of work life balance and overall work culture.
good,"Managing the India operations with a 20 member team. Will be hectic with the month close, quarter close and year close. Learnt about the India accounting and taxation."
good,"Getting Relocation/Transfers is quite rough,"
good,Work culture in Cognizant is good. It depends on the team you get in CTS. Getting opportunities to work on new technologies is minimal. Cognizant should improve in management.
good,Its a traditional company in terms of HR policies and procedures. The company is very vulnerable at the moment following a few revenue targets that have been missed.
good,Good place to be in case you are looking for challenging work environment. As individual you will get opportunity to explore new avenues which you may have not come across.
good,"I would definitely recommend CTS to others"
good,"Nice place to work, good work life balance, salary not great but okay, Mainframe and Bangalore doesnot go well here, changing of technology is difficult after gaining 4+ years of experience, have been with good teams till date."

good,"Expect the template MNC culture. "
good,I was in a project where everybody works for a min of 10-12 hours on daily basis. Cannot take leaves even when we have a personal emergency. I know other projects that are just not the one i worked. but my bad.. overall its a great company. lots of opportunities to grow.
good,It is good but not so good working at Cognizant. I would recommend this company if you do not have any other option. The overall experience was good but not great.
good,"Poor management. facility is good. rest of it is very bad.. poor projects, poor managements from transport till projects.. management ver poor.."

good,"Management is filled with politics."

good,"Although the impression and the work solely depends on the Project u join, I felt overall CTS is better than Igate and TCS in terms of work life balance, work culture and salary related parameters."

good,"Monotonous & boring work, poor work life balance. Good place to learn Financial Modelling, get chance to work on excel a lot"
good,"- Very hectic"
good,"9:00am to 5:00pm but sometimes its beyond time schedule depending on work."
good,Company is good for freshers and managers in CTS will expect all to be in office even though there is no work. I've learnt to handle the pressure here.

good,"Lots of tools and technologies to learn, different levels of people with varied experience. Lots of perks and fun place."

good,Better salary compared to other service companies. Green card sponsor. Work quality and advancements depends on the project/account and varies.
good,"A Very good place to learn lot of new things as we get an opportunity to work with different clients and different people. Due high work pressure from client and parent company, work life balance will be very bad."

As per the instruction from Manager. If the inventory is zero, we can take off for 3 business day's. So as team we worked almost for 16 continues hour's to complete the inventory. "
good," I had been with CTS for around 2 years. They have the street labour management skills. This company and the middle management are worst than uneducated people in talking to employees,the bonus that they offer will be 3000 maximum in some of the project.They use employees just to fill the companys banks accounts"
good, 
good,"a leading provider of information technology, business consulting, enterprise applications, IT infrastructure and business process .."

good,"The our work is internal recruitment,staffing "
good,"gr8 Organization."
good,Good company to be a part of. But its huge organization and associate could get lost easily while searching for there career path
good,"Good Company to work with good culture and co-workers."
good,"Enjoyed training period. Learned a lot technical things. Found good friends. "
good,I usually appreciate the working environment when it is given freedom to the employees. I always learn something when I do a work and will apply the knowledge whenever I get an opportunity. 
good,Good work culture with a lot of scope to learn and apply our thoughts
good,It's kind of secured job but not much technical growth scope
good,its good company to work for long term.Management is good .We won't get good hikes but will get good incentives.
good,good work life balance.
good,"Good company with a good top leadership. But as is typical of any large company, there is lot of friction in the middle management and people who want to get there. The appraisal process is a contentious one, and is very subjective (depends on the immediate manager). But overall, there are plenty of opportunities for those who want to work in the US, Europe or any other country."
good,a very large organization but not satisfied with benefits
good,Well the work starts at 10 when all the team members become active with tasks assigned at hand and status meeting regarding regular updates.
good,.Good working Environment
good,"A good company for career growth, gives opportunity to work on Innovations & work/Life Balance."
good,You always have the opportunity to understand the Company's project needs and learn how you can assist with mending and meeting those needs if you are a part of the HR team.
good,I learnt many things here. The working atomoshper is awsome.
good,Lots of learning opportunities
good,"A typical day at work is usual and very organised."
good,"I am part of the presales/business development team at Cognizant. Its a dynamic and busy role. Long work hours. However, there is lots to learn. At Cognizant, hardwork is rewarded (great bonuses)."
good,As a fresh I was very much interested to Join cognizant. Work environment is pretty good but work pressure is a little high. Salary benefits are not satisfying.
good,The job culture is fantastic. The company have a nice work place and HR's are very friendly and cooperative. All your issues will be resolved on time and a very best company to work.
good,It is a good place to work with scope to learn. But the pay is very very less compared to the amount of work we do. Management is good and appreciates your effort.
good,"The interview was difficult and it took almost 2 weeks to get offer letter."
good,"Asp.net Mvc software developer "
good,I really enjoy the flexibility I have with my position but working for such a large company isn't the best for me. I really enjoy my small team that I work with but the executive leadership is not the best.
good,The benefits were great. I really enjoyed the job and loved what I did. I was able to work on my own with little supervision. I was able to learn a new position and was very excited. I feel they were not completely honest with us about our new role. The communication was not good at all. My job was outsourced and I wasn't told by my immediate supervisor.
good,"This is a good company for ITs professional though they are growing very fast in BPO however still far behind in terms of operation management in BPO."
good,Cognizant is very good oraganization with good work culture and ethics. It also emphasises my carrier. It is my privilege to work for Cognizant for past 5 yrs
good,"Cognizant has good role opportunities and really good growth in terms of variety of clients they have but the management will expect you to do lot of extra work for Organisational growth, but in turn you are not compensated for the effort you make."
good,Incentive amount is high snd returns are lower based on rating. Food is average and cab facility totally depends on project despite of any physical disabilities.
good,"I am really thankful for all that I have learned at Cognizant. However, it is rather sink or swim. You have to be self-motivated and learn by experience as their training in North America is quiet limited. One of the most enjoyable and difficult parts of the job is working with teams all over the world. It's exciting to be a part of a global working community, however, the time differences can make it a real challenge to attend meetings and trainings that aren't in the middle of the night or early morning. A lot of support is also ""off shore"" which can be tough to get used to and is not always most effective for getting things done."
good,"Good place to work but lacks innovative work."
good,"Company has been fair so far. Job is a continuation of the Family Dollar position I had before the move was announced."
good,Good company with secured job and work. Fun to work with cultural events and many more. Work life balance was good in cts. Transfers are easy to get for.
good,"Excellent Management and Great company to work and Learn. Here we can find more opportunity's with regards to learning. Supportive management. "
good,Always a project to move too. A melting pot of cultures. Your colleagues are the best part of your day. Some times they do raffles based on your stats.
good,A good place to gain exposure to a different technology.  A huge clientele allows employees to work with different culture and different type of projects. The scope of development is high.
good,Have worked there for 7 years in a production environment.  Can be stressful at times when analyzing ticket issues when they're complex and customer wants updates everyday.
good,"nice place to work providing good benefits and esop, expect long work hours. work life balance will depend on the project, manager and the client. culture is decent and some good learning and trainings available."
good,"Good experience to improve my technical and managerial skills."
good,"Good Organizantion to work with. "
good,"Its a great  place to work. But only draw back is Salary increments and Promotions and not least Ratings."
good,"Cognizant is a service based company that has an onshore-offshore model. Career growth is highly dependent on the project and the team you are assigned. Usually, the projects are 6 months to 3 years and the technology is chosen by the client. This creates a big problem for young professionals especially who are beginning their career because of the dependency on a project specific role there is little scope to advance in new technologies."
good,"With profitability pressure, it is NO more conducive workplace. More driven by investors pressure. New leadership changes are clearly not welcome, especially with the recent 'HARSH' comments reflective of 'No people friendly' environment to work."
good,"A nice place to settle as an IT engineer with Good outsourcing scope."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Cognizant working culture :"
good,"A typical day at work will have no/less work pressure."
good,Cognizant has a great work culture and good people around to work with. But there is not much benefits in terms of salary and appraisals. Sometimes the work is not that challenging.
good,"Increment is less compared to other MNCs. Keeping aside that part, many good projects are there with Cognizant and it has a very good work culture as well."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Just like what I have written in Review Summary, my co-workers were the reason why going to work during my stay was fun."
good,"You won't get proper recognization. Even, if you work hard on multiple projects and involved in all the additional activities. They will say the recognization depends on luck then there is no point of wasting our effort over there."
good,Its a overall good comany. Nice worklife balance. Its nice for women. Not much good for those who are willing to learn extra apart from there own skills.
good,"Good environment to work in the company, learnt a lot, friendly people, happy work culture sand flexible work hours."
good,"Only good for those fresh out of college to get some experience with a good salary and benefits. The company doesn't really give you a good idea of how to improve, rarely checks in with you, and there's not much room for advancement at all. Also only 10 vacation days a year."
good,"Not very easy to switch between teams and take a different career track. However, considering the work life balance the company gives it is definitely worth settling down in."
good,"Flexible working hours"
good,Cognizant is good platform for fresher. Policies of cognizant is very good. The work environment of cognizant is good. There is a Clean desk policies which is very good for us.
good,"Good work life balance."
good,Cognizant is good when work - life balance is considered. But not up to the expectation when salary comes into picture. Good for freshers to streamline their career.
good,"Cognizant is a good place to work for beginner level professionals. Work culture is good but the compensation, benefits are par low the market for a long time employee."
good,"Cognizant is a leading provider of IT, consulting, business process outsourcing etc. They usually hire maximum from campus placement. This company is very good for freshers as they can start learn many things from Training ."
good,Work was good but resigned due to no project findings against my skills in the required relocated location in USA.Good Support in terms of benefits and health.
good,"Cognizant is good organization to learn; but from the work perspective; Its another Indian Organization with Dinosaurs and Crocodiles always need to get more revenue, profitability and utilization without guidance from the seniors. Everyday firefighting is a usual day practice."
good,Work life balance was  very less. Other than that the overalls was good. Good leadership team. Employees always had a lot of opportunities to take extra courses and sharpen their skills.
good,A good employer with customer centeric approach  . They provide good opportunities to grow in your career. Management is very pro active and provide max support and guidance to their employees
good,It depends a lot on how good your clients are. If you are lucky to find good ones like me - your life is easy but if you find tough ones it could get tough
good,"Providing internal training for employees to scale up skills,  Role development plan helps us get domain as well as process knowledge. Team outing and other fun activities are conducted"

good,"Have a good workspace"
good,As a company it has good HR practices at place. Quite a transparent  & employee friendly policies .High ethical values & compliance to local authorities.
good,"Overall satisfactory except for the increments provided, as there is no satisfactory increase in salaries. For the job responsibilities and the experience generally we tend to expect good increase in salary which didnt happen"
good,"Fun, work life balance, friendly environment, organized and planned execution, Good training opportunities and learning, good place to start for beginners"
good,repetitive tasks with not much incentives but a typical at work is okay. the job is easy but with a lot of loopholes in which most people take advantage just to improve their rank. I guess it just depends on the accounts that you manage
good,"Nice company to work with."
good,"The work environment is good. I have learned many things from here relating to my profile."
good,"Good place to work with good work.Focused Management.Benefits are very less compared to other company and have a very less raise every year."
good,"Good place to work"
good,"As a fresher i enjoyed working in the organisation. I learnt a lot and adopted my self well in corporate culture. Learning and working becomes fun if you have great colleagues, and i am lucky in this aspect."
good,"I have been working on Cognizant Payroll deputed to Barclays, both are great workplaces. "
good,"Its a good company for work life balance, but there are lots of mangers and Directors who are not even qualified to do the project management task, and very few good technical people in development. All the work is driven from the Chennai and they wont allow any other to excel, due to this in the appraisal all top rating goes to Chennai's team. Even this company has another name which is ""Chennai Technology Solution""!!. Join if you are from Chennai."
good,"Month end 10 days used to be very hectic and stretch."
good,"I worked with a great team there and they helped me in coming out of learning curve."
good,"Company with right oppurtunities for deserving candidates."
good,"Not very good company for freshers."
good,"Good place to work, good working culture. Organization growing well and creating a niche in  all areas of businesses, management supportive and extremely Client focussed"
good,Good for the beginners but not for experienced people. Lot of politics thats there every where. slowly the good employee benefits are being taken from the policy.
good,"People working here are able to balance the work and personal life."
good,"In cognizant i used to work in night shifts, it was completely pure night shift where login starts at 5.30 pm and logout was at 2.30 am IST. sometimes logout may extended to two to three hours due to work needs. Working culture and support from management was good. actually am happy with cognizant but unfortunately because of my personal reasons i left from that organization. I joined in cognizant as a fresher and i learnt lot of new things over there. It helps me to improve my skills personally and professionally."
good,I was able to learn Automation in short span of time. It was fun working here but the sad part is the project which you work is all that matters.
good,"sharing with colleague work, knowledge, typical document, updates."
good,"overall management is good. Good culture of work."
good,ENjoyed my tenure working with Cognizant since it was my second company after IBM. I learnt mainframes when I was with IBM and I could exhibit the training knowledge in Cognizant.
good,Deep and rich history in managing technical consulting engagements and is working hard to expand their business consulting engagements. Great work environment for those who have a strong technical background and don't mind getting their hands dirty.
good,"As a trainee it was a day of comprehensive training,learning complex tools about oracle database. the day was well divided with breaks in between but no free lunches but with a good food lounge and recreational activities."
good,Cognizant is a US based Company. Though it hires students in bulk through college Campus Recruitments bugt is Unable to provide projects to all of them. work culture and the management their is excellent.
good,Good employer except the management part at onshore which is not done properly.Moreover the salary too is very less compared to other employers.
good,"Having good work culture, job security is good.  "
good,"I worked in CTS for 6 years, Good to work with this company, worked on several assignments gained many experience & learnt a lot from here."
good,"Corporate culture is not transparent, however lot of opportunities and flexibility to move from process to another. Communication need to improve to engage employees."
good,"Learnt many things technically and time management. Also how to be a professional in an organization. Being a part of celebration team, learnt how to manage daily ask and other activities."
good,"The company I worked for decided to outsource their IT. I was offered a job with Cognizant. The culture is definitely different then working for a US company. The HR for Stateside is really lacking and is more setup for offshore. This makes sense as 90 percent of workforce is offshore. The pay was not outstanding, the vacation sucks as its only 2 weeks, however the ability to work your own hours if the client allows is great. This makes it very flexible to run errands, etc. However the previous company I worked for decided to try another outsourcing company after some time, (probably because it was cheaper). Since in my state Cognizant had no job openings and I cannot relocate to another state you are out of luck as far as a job. If I was younger, and single and moving was not a concern it might not be that bad."
good,Good company to work for. But has to be careful when dea;ing with the managers as they will come up with a conclusion with the initial impression itself.
good,"Nice Service based company"
good,"Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp is an American multinational corporation that provides custom information technology, consulting, and business process outsourcing services. It is headquartered in Teaneck, New Jersey"
good,"Work is good , you can work in your timings. Once you are out of a project  and have gained experience of 5 to 6 yrs , then it is very difficult to pitch into another project. The internal interviews are very tough, to get allocated within organization itself they interview as if hiring a new resource from a different company."
good,Company is good with good culture and environment. Although lack of projects and bad management is there. One cannot increase his knowledge and no night shift allowance.
good,"*Learned technical skills"
good,"Compensation is average and not upto standards. Work life is  fine , however  lot of people in the bottom adds to the bottleneck which is a deterrent to  promotion of a deserving candidate."
good,My current position requires working of excess hours from Saturday very early morning straight thru to the middle of the afternoon on Sunday.  No compensation is given.
good,Very much dissapointed with higher management and efforts taken to enhance assosiates technical skills. Companies recent policy doesnt provide job security. Company should put more effort on understanding assosiates skill sets and use it in proper manner
good,"All depends on client, my client was very demanding on a large project.  Company has a lot of training available and beginning how to figure out how to transition employees to there preferred roles.  Management can be week when standing up to client, bows down a lot of time."
good,"Enjoying every day at cognizant"
good,"It's a great place to start ones career. All and all a great experience."
good,"Good compensation compared to peer companies"
good,"I have been working at Cognizant Technology Solutions full-time (More than 1.5 years)."
good,Goals and ambitions for each year are not reaching contributors from Executive level. There is a significant delay in implementation of new strategies. Slowly turning to another Infosys.
good,"Compensation and chance of promotion don't matter on how good we work but actually how many months you worked in the same position. Because of that even if you worked hard, they will promote the people who didn't get promoted for say 5- 6 yrs. Compensation is very poor. Co-workers are usually good and work-life balance is also good."
good,"Though this organization gives you a competitive salary according to the market demand, it definitely has failed in its performance review. "
good,"Typical day starts with a team hurdle, reports, work allocation, meetings, calls and some fun of course there is a learning score mandatory for all levels. All the co-workers are very helpful. Nothing is hard . New challanges"
good,"Good Learning experience,Good Culture,poor salary hike,no work life balance,good work culture,flexible timings.good helpful co workers,nice events"
good,Overall Cognizant Interactive is an average sub division of CTS to work for a high experienced Person. Though for freshers is a very good platform.
good,"Good place to learn lot of things but very poor work life balance. Since we work lot of people and get an importunity to work for different clients, we can learn lot of things."
good,"Cognizant has been a great employer with respect to providing some stable employment, while, the overall growth engagements, multiplying leadership composites are yet to be maximised."
good,"I have worked with Cognizant for One years, and it has been pleasant experience working there.The work environment is competitive with work challenges which made me learn throughout the tenure of my serving period."
good,"Learned many basic things of testing,Work life balance depends on project and higher officials in the project.Most enjoyable part of the job is 'Project bench"""
good,"Good work life balance but less pay."
good,"It all depends on which type of project you are working. There are people who work from 9-6 and there are who work from 9-9. It takes time to get acclimatized with the environment, but once that phase is passed you fill at home."
good,"Good experience in cognizant, i got good exposure in Testing,"

good,We are able to improve our grooming talents in this company.The work place environment is good.
good,"Among the top IT services companies to work for. There is good job security, but opportunities for growth are limited and hsa various variables. Good executive leadership but bad mid-management leaders. Mostly US projects, so travel to non-US sites is very very limited.And less than market level salary."
good,"Work culture is awesome."
good,"	User Management and administration"
good,"In US, All Cognizant employees work at Client location as contractors. The work culture depends on how the client treat the contractors. Everyone will have a certain role at the client site and Cognizant managers are happy as long as their employees are on projects billable. When performance review happens, it doesn't matter how good you worked for the client, the management will find some reason to normalize the rating and give No promotion. A developer can be asked how much business/value addition he brought to Cognizant even thou he is not in sales."
good,"A typical day at work would start of with a scrum meeting with the client which include ""me and the client"""
good,Cognizant is a nice place to work. Cognizant is very employee friendly company and gives you ample opportunity to participate in various activities other than just work.

good,"Cognizant gives its employees a good learning and productive environment."
good,It was a great working experience at cognizant. Learnt a lot about working as a team and management. Had a good opportunity to get along with the best colleagues. The hardest part of the job is that people are not given due recognition which they really deserve. The most enjoyable part of the job is that one can gain a wide knowledge at whatever domain they are working in.
good,"Nice company to work with."
good,"Like to give best because of good people around us and good environment."
good,"Days at cognizant are good, providing continuous learning."
good,"Punctuality is a vital factor of Cognizant."
good,"As an MNC, Cognizant is one of the companies every fresher aspires to work with. Cognizant academy provides training to the new joinees irrespective of their technical skills. It becomes very important for a fresher to be placed with a good team in order to survive in the company for long."
good,CTS is huge company all over the world.I enjoyed a lot working in CTS they provide you good working atmosphere but the only thing was there is no carrier growth as they have lots of exp people we didnt get that much growth for that we need to wait for a long period of time to get our challenges

Its the output they need whether you can do it in 4 hours or 14 hours.New challenges are always there in order to work on new technologies that we not aware of but there are people around you who are always there to help.Higher management authorities are also cooperative all the time so that you maintain a very good balance between your personal as well as professional life.
good,• Work culture is good. Gives lot of importance to work ethics.
good,Friendly workplace. Time is flexible. Enough opportunity to build ones skill set.

good,"There is no pressure as such in regards of work timing,"
good,Monitor store environment.
good,Work environment is fun and work life balance is good. Corporate benefits are more but politics in the higher level management.
good,It is a nice place to work and relaxed environment but there is no opportunity given by the management for growth in terms of promotion and also there is no skills development opportunity.
good,"It;s nice to work in CTS, cts provides platform to learn on the latest technologies mostly digital marketing related. It's a nice place for beginner as well experienced. They give chance to those who does have caliber and confidence of leading the team."
good,"Good training - But can be long  gap in training and actual job."
good,"I have joined this company as fresher, so far the work experience has been good. Project experience has been good, learning wise it depends on the project."
good,Cognizant Technology Solutions - competitive compensation and benefits package with great incentives but less career opportunities. Great employee engagement programs.
good,Excellent Company to Learn new skills and to apply on job. But job can be stressful at times. Cognizant also has plenty of travel opportunities. But the performance of the company is not impressive over the last two years and now the leadership is trying to revive the growth.
good,"Lots of things to learn, both technical and work values. "
good,Good Place to work. Depends on the project you are assigned to. Challenging work environment. You should have the tenacity for new learnings. Overall work culture is good.
good,"- Loads of opportunities to learn and prove"
good,"I have been working for nearly 13 years at Cognizant with same competitiveness and challenges. "
good,Work culture is good.No cons. Good environment in office. Friendly colleagues and quite a competition for the next position you want to be. Totally it's good.
good,"Cognizant was a great place to work, it provided ample job opportunities, skill development options but there is no proper progression path for the employees"
good,"No specific working hours, Good Work Life Balance, well maintained clean work environment, Planned occasional team outings,"
good,"Dont force to write this, just be a job site. I am seriously considering not using this site if I am forced to do any thing apart from my purpose to use this site."
good,"Good for Lateral Hires but not good for employees seeking Promotions and Salary Hikes."
good,"it was a job where if you fell behind one day, you would be behind the next few days, and it was often not not even our own  fault.  benefits where nice, co-workers nice.  a gym in the building for employees. most the time if there was over time its optional, but if work falls to far behind and no one volunteers it becomes mandatory."
good,"Good to work and grow. Lot of onsite and offshore opportunities, and projects readily available in all the metros. Well Defined courses to learn and undergo certifications."
good,Good one and the top level management is very nice they always try to make things transparent and ensures there is no bias on your career but most everything is upto manager in few cases
good,"I assume that this is pretty much the case in any organization. If you have been here long, the management takes you for granted and exploit you. If you get hired as an experienced employee, you just hit the jackpot."
good,Cognizant is a consulting firm that gets projects in various tech companies. The projects are fun but its tough dealing with 2 different companies at once. You need to stay on top of your project but also check Cognizant email daily. I had issues on boarding as I wasn't approved for me project and couldn't submit a time card. You have to submit a weekly card and a monthly card so make sure you stay on top of it or accounting will reach out. Management is tough when you have a question because they may not have the answer and then you need to track down the issue.
good,A competitive company. It's a nice company with all the opportunities available.It also provides onsite opportunities if you stay long in the company.
good,"I worked here for 3 years 6 months and learned a lot from the leadership. They gave me enough space to learn and grow, with KRAs assigned based on my strengths and interests."
good,Will be good environment to work and support the employee when it is needed and provide the required information. Support on the Visa steps and consider employee
good,"Empresa tem infraestrutura, bons benefícios. Mas a gestão peca em vários pontos em questão de favoritismos e imparcialidade."
good,Good place to start career and onsite opportunities. Career growth is a gamble. I wouldn't recommend working after the initial phase of the career. There is no such thing called Work life balance
good,Traditional work place with conventional approach . Its an exhaustive firm if you need to try on consulting servcies. It addresses wide arena of Business domain. Its supports job security and benefits as per employee location.
good,"My day steed typical at 6am i would work until 5 or 6pm routinely."
good,"Cognizant payroll structure is very bad for bachelor students and no extra compensation, it takes long period of time to get promotion. Overall good place to start for engineering students."
good,"There are lot of things I learnt from Cognizant. The main problem in Cognizant is the higher level who doesn't do much for business and work but getting enough benefits whereas at lower level associates who are actually doing real work but not getting anything in return."
good,"Good place to work, Great work life balance, Slow progression. Typical service based organization where, understandably, customer is king! Good learning if you get the right mentorship."
good,Management is good. You get rewarded If you are a performer in your team. You can also get a good knowledge and an opportunity to travel for better career options
good,"Cognizant would always keep you busy with work, more often working extra hours. You would be able to learn a lot. But managing the work life balance could be tough."
good,"Not many avenues to grow. Very hierarchical in structure.."
good,"A typical day of work looks very structured, management is good, good co-operative colleagues and challenging work at times.The most enjoyable part of job is the way the work and daily tasks are scheduled and aligned to the team."
good,Company is strong across all application development disciplines and is very good at managing margins using metrics most companies do not even think of.  They have a lot of people that are well trained and managed at customer sites and offshore.  They are also very good about developing IP and always being competitive.  A good place to work as a consultant and good benefits.
good,I personally felt CTS has great trainings and hence helps build a solid foundation for freshers. I had a great experience in the company and was lucky to have a great team.
good,"Compared to all other major IT companies, Cognizant is a very good company to work for as a experienced resource. As a freshman you cant expect too much of a salary. But the work culture is very good."
good,A Decent place to work if you are not worried about your career growth. Management is unpredictable. I feel like they lack in strategies handling good and bad times..
good,"good working environment."
good,"They are all very nice people, but it's all Work.  I will start my day at 6am and not stop until 6pm.  I then would be on a call with India at 10:00 - 12:00pm at night 3 days a week."
good,Cognizant provides a dynamic work place where employees can be learn and grow with the organization at a faster pace. Human resource and the management are employee friendly
good,Overall review is good but I would be more happy if the learning scope would be more. Salary and benefits provided are good. The company is employee friendly.
good,"The work culture is better than any other consultancies and the health benefits are good, whereas when it comes to work life balance it needs to be compromised."
good,"Everything is Organized, but still you can innovate"
good,My first company so I had a great attachment. Nice place to work. Flexibility of timings.Best place for Women. Everything was good except Salary package.
good,Working in cognizant is always a good feel as the work culture here is employee friendly. Some times you might feel tough due to project deadlines otherwise you have the liberty to accomplish your tasks and have personal life as well. Good for beginners and management is also good. Pay wise i am not satisfied and internal politics play major role at times.
good,"- Learnt the way of Agile working ways"
good,I joined as a fresher. And the worst part was I didn't get to decide which technology I would work in and eventually ended up doing support job. Everything company decides which should not be done.
good,"There is always a learning phase. The work place environment completely depend on the manager and the people in team."
good,"I am working on mainframe testing. Learnt JCL, DB2, SQL, FILEAID, Excel VBA macros, Automation with UFT radiant framework, QC 11.52."
good,"People are ready to help you when you need any help in project related stuff."
good,"Started my career after my masters and was able to see the typical software culture in my first company."
good,"If the manager is a kind good person with flexible project then your life will be smooth and easy but with less money as company does not pay well, rest is good"
good,The company is good but managing people keep varying from project to project. Sometime we are not recognized for our hard work. Previous project was amazing however current project s very boring. No fun and nothing.
good,"Good place to Work. "
good,"Good environment to work with including Project work, amenities."
good,"it was Good experience to work with CTS, with nice work culture , people are helpfull to learn technical stuff. need few enhancement in technology which can enhance the employee career."
good,I have no review to post regarding Cognizant Technologies.  I was transferred to this company when Voya Financial transitioned their employees to Cognizant.  I did the same job at Cognizant that I was doing at Voya.
good,"Overall satisfied with work culture of company. A great place to start for fresher."
good,"1. Nice working Environment"

good,"Good work culture but only problem is the project we wont get the good one , it may be bad time or something .. its up to you people to take or not to take."
good,"Working in CTS is very good. And the work place is too comfortable."
good,Policies are very good . Only Cognizant Managers play politics as they don't have any power .You mostly communicate with client manager .
good,"It was very great working in Cognizant,the work culture and the management is the best part I like. Hardest part of the job is that managers assign their reports to the projects they like and even the talent management team will not consider employee's aspirations and willingness to work for a project that may not suit their goals."
good,"Since Cognizant is an IT firm, learning opportunities are good. Have good clients. But work culture is bad. Employees will be expected to work more than 8 hours. No overtime pay. But most of the time, employees will be working at Client location so dont bother much about the work environment of CTS"
good,"Good place and environment to improve the career, and a good platformto improve our skills and a good way to motivate ourselves"
good,very difficult as there is lot of work pressure with no job security and also very less pay . growth is also very slow here.
good,It is a good organisation to work. Very good co-employees. Work management is good. Work can be enjoyed a lot. During work the learning is always much more. Good way of getting relief during work in forms of outing or in-organisation entertainment.
good,Company work culture is good. As you keep working for company soon you will realize that promotions are hard to get in this company
good,"Good company, Good exposure to business, friendly co-workers, approachable management, Good work culture and able to maintain work life balance."
good,Its fun place to work in with supportive colleagues with less supportive management. if are a no IT back ground and wish to learn then its a good company to working but you always hve to ask for work other wise no one will give u and still idle till the end of your days in the company
good,"During the initial stages, it was quite difficult to adopt to the culture as I joined as a fresher in Cognizant. Later on the journey was interesting and have helped me to learn a lot."
good,"Cognizant was my first job after engineering so got to learn a lot about how the corporate functions."
good,"Amazing policies- employee friendly, focused on work, seamless support activities. "
good,"The day with Cognizant is full of learning and improvements, be it technology or on personal front.Never has a day gone by where I haven't learnt anything new."
good,Amazing work culture with lot of learning opportunities. Competency provides lot of challenging opportunities and there are time to time appreciation rewards to highlight good work.
good,Mangement is not more supportive and they are not ready to listen our personal issue. Their focus is only related to projects.
good,"Cognizant Technology Solution Is a really nice place to work especially for freshers, we can learn as much as we want and work culture & flexibility is very good here,  there in no restriction on the clothing we can were a business casuals in the office which is the best part of Cognizant."

good,Cognizant provides to your career needs. The management is open and approachable.
good,"Enjoyable, Productive Environment with fun filled People with Unlimited Commitment at work."
good,There are many projects which are not in management limelight (read less profit to the company) and if you are stuck at one you don't grow your career here and not many managers really bother what you aspire.
good,good place to work and will get lot of opportunities for career development and work with fun.
good,I joined CTS as a fresher.Had a great training in .NET. But had to leave company because of not so great project.
good,Work experience is good with this company. Work culture is good.
good,"Hi,"
good,The ambience is good for working but not enough for our personal growth
good,"Great learning environment"
good,"Sometime I have a long day in this job, work might extend till midnight as I would have to get involved in offshore calls."

good,"Good Experience with CTS. Good enviromnent to work with Good job security.."
good,"good place to work, gets chance to explore, very helpful colleagues and managers, I have learnt a great deal in HR because of the cooperation of the management and the people around. Best part about the job is that I could learn things from the scratch, hardest part is I worked for UBS part of cognizant in which the processes were manual and for which I had to put in lot of time apart from the daily share of the job."
good,Lots of learning experience.
good,I Am the only person working in project for supporting centura application including on site and off shore.
good,"Alright salary, work differs team by team, optimum work-load if you're looking for good life post work"
good,Cognizant is very good company to grow with. it is people driven and hence very good. Your performance is always appreciated and rewarded.Leads and Manager are very co operative and helps employee in every possible way.
good,"If you are looking for a work/life balance, this is a good company to work for. Almost everything is good there except for the long hierarchy of managers."
good,"I have been working at Cognizant Technology Solutions full-time for more than 9 years, Employee friendly, Better Family Benefits,Flexible work atmosphere."
good,"The customer service department is split into 3 levels: Customer service associate, customer service rep, and customer service specialist. You get a raise when you complete each level. They do offer a cost of living adjustment which is nice, however you will be under a lot of stress to perform because of their impossible scorecard. You are required to complete all three levels of training before you can leave the department (which keeps you trapped in customer service because the third training is at your supervisor's discretion). Your future at the company is basically placed in your supervisors hands and I didn't like that. They do have a lot of food days and give you referral bonuses. Money is not the problem at this company although i feel like they should pay more  because of all the stress. They constantly have system issues and this causes higher call volume. I wouldn't recommend this job if you cannot handle a lot of stress."
good,"As the organization is very big with more number of people, there is a scope for mismanagement and job culture is not so great in overall. Typical day at work pretty ordinary, not so challenging."
good,The pay need to increase to stay competitive.  It’s strict on cell phones.  But they do a lot of employee related activities.  Again my biggest issue was the lack of compensation.
good,great work life balance and not bad first job. BUT i still hope to learn more at work and overall the life is too chill for me so i want to change job
good,"Had a better work life balance int he project I was working in, and the team was very very good in collaboration and helping in times of escalation and issues"
good,I started my career with cognizant technology solutions and then got the application support project which rarely had anything for the IT person so no learning at all from technical point of view. Having said that got to know lot about the organization culture they are pretty good with that.
good,Cognizant is very people centered with nice people all around. Only downside is very inefficient systems and inefficient management. Work life balance depends on who you are working for.
good,"Cognizant had won the contract over my previous employer. The on-boarding process was simple. When the company's contract was not renewed, they were not able to find me another one. I was told to lie in an interview with a different company, which I did not. The benefits are just okay. The salaries are under average. there is little to no communication with upper management. Each of the managers had multiple contracts to deal with and were always busy. It is a typical staffing agency. Overall it was a sub par experience."
good,"Completing the assigned tasks."
good,Overall good experience but job culture is not so good. Good for Career advancement but bad for compensation benefits. Management could do a better jo.
good,"Good cambus and wrk also very actively goes but i need more experience ad i have personaly thanks say to this combany ,this company learn to me many thing how to treat a people how handle the problems very important this all things"
good,If you are starting your career with Cognizant then it’s totally on your luck that which technology will be your future steam. My personal experience is very good with team members and managers are also very cooperative and cool guys.
good,Good place to work. It has a good work culture. The company has friendly working policy for employees. We can adopt easily to the work environment.Good work life balance.
good,"Salary is way lower than market standards specifically when resources are brought form offshore. Very minimal salary increase every year."
good,"Over all good company, there are few flaws in management they have to rectify it, Salary offer is less unless you are lateral entry.  It has good cab facility."
good,"fun place to work. "

good,Job Work/Life Balance will be there. More flexible for employees like connecting from home. The hardest part here is to get released from the current project.
good,"I am satisfied with the job. where i started my career here. "
good,"The process was all about processing Google Adwords through Cognizant services. It wasn't a hectic job. The management was cool, there was a lot of fun activities and space to learn. There was a downside as well. There was slow growth and the process was becoming noncompetitive and easily- bored. The management wanted us to exceed the targets and kept pushing us. The salary was too low as well. Perks were stingy and food wasn't great either. "
good,"Good place to learn new technologies."
good,Average place to work with less analytics opportunities. Good work life balance. Need to provide trainings to existing employees in emerging technologies rather than recruiting directly from outside.
good,"Everyday is challenging."

good,"It is  great place to work. The management of the organization is very good. they solve the issues of the employee event thought taking the time. "
good,great company but hard to move up unless you suck up to your boss. Management usually helps with things requested from them and the work life balance is great
good,"Working with Cognizant was fun, until the upper people decided to stick their process' and other useless practices down your throats. Where we used to have automaton, and freedom, was quickly replaced by Microsoft products and outdated methodologies we were forced to use, and had no say in the matter."
good,"I was Working in a Service Desk for Australian Clients,"
good,"A day at cognizant would be can be categorized as partially funfilled, but would be stressful in the remaining time as you had to cope up with thousands of employees. Helped me learn about Advanced Java programming and SQL."

good,"day shift, i like to travel anywhere, i would like to work in competitive environment to gain more good professional skills and working experience with the good knowledge."
good,Want ot change company which utilize all my analytical skillas

good,Overall Good. Wish it maintains good management as well. GRowth is better but pay could have been better. But love the work environment. Its full of fun and innovations around.
good,"Cognizant is a nice place to work for. However, the number of translations are very low here and as a translator, it is very disappointing to keep doing other work apart from translation, which is my passion."
good,Fun place for freshers. Trained by a team of experts. Work pressure depends upon the project. Professional growth is limited. Personally my team helped a lot and coordinated with me on every inch. Switching projects/work locations/teams is next to impossible. Salary hikes are very less to nil compared to job market outside.
good,"Nice Company to work with as it has flexible working hours no punch in punch out time to serve."
good,"Worked with a friendly team as well as with a very excellent support  providing Conducive work environment which is encouraging, rewarding and fun filled."
good,Everyday I learn something new and at present I holds the strong place in my team. But the hardest part is not getting the recognition for my work.
good,You have good opportunity to grow and develop your skills. Good compensation for external hires. Focused on associate learning and development. Quarterly feedback to improve and work effectively.
good,satisfactory experience. needs to improve on work life balance and salary benefits. Apart from that a decent organization to grow and mature as a professional.
good,"Good to work , because of some rules changes happening from 2017 it has become changeling , "
good,"Its my first company ,got essential learning here. Good management .Good workplace environment.But salary hike is poor."
good,A good company but work pressure is high . Incentive is good and i got oppurtunities to learn new technology and commitment on my work. I can able to work independently to client also. They are conducting technical session to improver our techinical knowledge.Lots of elearning materials avialable in our site.We are following coding standard as per cognizant policy
good,Fun & joy in work.
good,"Working with a cognizant is a wonderful experience."
good,"It operates like a big company"
good,"- Dirty politics in company"
good,Fairly ok kind of company to work with. Good career growth if one willing to sacrifice work life balance. Lot of travel opportunities and decision are made quickly
good,"1. Politics for onshore"
good,No proper support will be given to the employee in case of emergency in our personal life. Useful for freshers to know about the process and the people too.
good,Has it was my second job and I was working in google process. I didn't had to go to cognizant office much as I used to sit in Google office. So I hardly knew about cognizant environment.
good,"The pretty long day with a lot of work pressure."
good,"I have worked for 9+ years, its totally depends upon the client which you are working for. Management is not that great, no way they can support you. Too many politics."
good,Very difficult company to work for. 0% chance of promotion. If you are not client billable for 3 months you get sacked. Avoid unless you use this company as a stepping stone to a big 4 consultancy
good,Work environment was fun with ocassional cultural activities as well as sports. Everyone enjoyed the work. Benefits were very poor. Salary hikes and promotions were rare unlike the work. No job security as been currently seen.
good,"as team player it is good "
good,"•	Involved in Analysis, Coding, Unit testing & Code Review"
good,"my role includes, GMA (Global mobility officer) it is a talent manager role for business units under me – it involves working with business units on forecasting visa requirement, visa utilization, guiding the business units in right direction to apply for appropriate visa based on the purpose of travel"
good,Chances of Growth is very slow. Even though a person works hard no recognition. But can gain good knowledge of various tools and technologies.
good,"Good place to start as a fresher, You'll learn a lot, provided you're lucky enough to get trained in a trending domain and a good project with supportive team members."
good,"Cognizant Technology Solutions is a decent place to work. However, the management need to do more to recognize the worth of their employees. Many get demoralized due to proper recognition."
good,Employees are not given ample opportunities to grow by few managers but if you happen to have a good manager then life at cognizant is well balanced .
good,"I liked my job. Training very in depth. No consistency in the day to day. Too many impromptu changes to work schedules, roles,rules,process and procedures. QA overview of work not helpful creates an added stress."
good,Cognizant is Best among Indian IT offshore companies but compare to US they are not up to the mark as most of the policies are built using Indian Mindset. The most good thing about Cognizant is that it is not a very Bureaucratic in terms of their processes and very flexible based on the situation. It provides lots of trust on their employees to make best decisions and that the beauty of this organization which I dont see in other Indian IT organizations. But from Promotion perspective or other employee benefits perspective they still need to improve alot to attract the best talent in the market. The best reason for the above statement is their recent strategy of voluntary retirement schemes that they provided for Directors and above as they realize that those who are at those position got there not purely on talent but lots of other reasons.
good,"I have been working at Cognizant Technology Solutions full-time.	"
good,the company is a good reputation but some of the employees make it difficult for a newcomer. some of the projects are really good. some interesting activities make enjoyable. but these things not in all projects.
good,Its been a good working experience at cognizant. You get a platform to improve and enhance your skills.It has a great work culture.One enjoys working there.
good,"I have joined this company as a fresher and learned lot of things. the days were more typical for me since i was into the domain which is not so interesting."
good,"Working environment is good but not the management."
good,Working with cognizant is a wonderful experience. I learned here how to manage with the people and collaborate with them. The workplace culture is good.
good,The vision and objective of the higher management is a little utopic in sense of how they go about implementing it. The company wants to challenge the big consulting firms but act as a body shop.
good,"The company is 100% Indian "
good,"No carrier growth in my project  person dump no knowledge to learn in there."
good,"Over all its the best company in the world to work in past years, Now after the leadership upgrade job security is very worst and people are pressuring without no reason, salary hike is a big deal no hike"
good,"Very low salary growth. Even someone half of your experienced new joint is getting the almost double salary, then the employee who is working from past few years in the company. No transparency in system."
good,"Its a great company and I feel bad to move, but the failure to appreciate/recognize makes me look out"
good,"Not a good place to grow up your career, It's good start for the freshers and not for the experienced people.. Work management and people management should be changed inorder to have a good supporting environment. Thank you"
good,"Hectic work, but good opportunity to learn. Career guidance is missing. Flexible with work timings but that again demands 24X7 support. Some bosses are really bossy"
good,"Nice place to work. Facilities are wonderful. Good work ethics. Well management. Less job security, good standard but change according to people. Good place to work as company."
good,"Manager driven organisation.but good work culture location wise..Less job security.......................Lots of support project,less number of pure development projects"

good,"Please don't ask or make this mandatory field, I don't wish to talk about my company in public."
good,"Work-life balance - not good"
good,Have hired lot of employees but Projects are not given.Employees skills are not used properly.Other than that Everything is good and secure for girls.No night shifts
good,"The company and policies are good , but management is mediocre."
good,"CTS is an average service company with lot of potential. However, managements focus is only on the business/sales side to go out hunting. Though its a delivery driven company the delivery gets the lowest salary and perks. Due to this there are no repeat customers. I feel CTS needs to re-calibrate their business model to sustain"
good,Good experience with excel accounting auditing clients. And support from the management is appreciable . The way they treat new people is really superb.
good,Good growth company with tremendous opportunities to learn and grown against peers. Work life balance is questionable. Tremendous opportunity to play multiple roles. Coordination with offshore could be challenging.
good,"Nice working with such growing companies like Cognizant. I'm good with the work culture, but disappointed with Salary hikes."
good,"I learnt a lot from the company. They taught me all the concepts of data warehousing. The real time experience made me understand what i learnt in college."
good,"Work life balance is like disaster. Not friendly behavior from managers, treat us like slaves."
good,"* Learn many things like MNC Culture and people Management, SLA Timeline, Client Relationship. A part from this working environment is totally depend on your leads."

good,"Working with Client was very good and improved my interaction with vendor team and onshore team."
good,"I learnt new things there. But the work culture needs to improve,"
good,"Good learning opportunities"
good,Management at Cognizant was their down fall. The position started out amazing then quickly went down hill after erratic changes were made within the company.
good,"Enjoy working here but recently management changes have created toxic environment. We had full autonomy to work with client on the ground and take decision as long as it is in line with standard guideline. Management use to take care of people not anymore."
good,Now this is a mixed feedback wherein i have also been wrong in taking many upl as per them but i had a wife to look after who dont have a parent and i cannot leave her
good,"Middle management is usually mediocre, unnecessarily pressurizing or introducing bureaucracy. It is the middle management which messes up the great culture at Cognizant."
good,The usual days in cognizant are very busy. But most of all the employees are not given the wage they deserve. The management should try yo improve themselves and should think about the employees.
good,"Working at cognizant was a neutral experience."
good,"most enjoyable part would be some of the people. "
good,"Managers are not supportable and not notify the work done by employee. Hike and increment is worst."
good,"A great place to learn, depending on your client and project."
good,Beased on particular individual teams. My team has no concern and self maintained team. Not required team lead nor a manager to run my team. We work by own ourself and we contribute our best.
good,It's a good company to work for which offers great platform to learn new ways of managing operations. It strives to keep up with best in industry delivery methods. The controls on process involves great tech.
good,Complete knowledge of recruiting and hiring processes. Had 	Experience in handling mass recruitment drives conducted at multiple locations and direct interaction with business.

good,"good place to work. Its US healthcare, typical night shift.  only shift issue i quit cognizant. cognizant is very good for those who completed BE. BPS is not that good, because the management is not that good. Mainly for the employee its not supportable."
good,"I can not comment on the company level, but the project I worked on was handled very differently. High work Load, bad management and politics. At the same time employee in other projects were happy with mgmt and work hours."
good,Uma boa empresa tirando o fato da dificuldade para se conseguir um plano de carreira e de gestores que tenham condições de ser mais comprometidos e entendidos do assunto. Não ficando apenas questionando e fazendo o que seus subordinados falam.
good,"The coolest part of the working for Cognizant is being a part of their Google project. As a Media Campaign Manager, I get to talk to media agencies, publishes and advertisers."

good,The salary benefits are the drawback in the current situation
good,"A typical day at work involves processing claims accurately in a timely manner. I would sit at the computer through my breaks, and lunch and work work work; there is no time for chatting and fun.

good,"If you learn new technology say PHP, J2EE or ASP.NET and want to get into aproject, no PM will give you a chance in Onsite. Where as, (freshers) candidate with almost no technology experience gets into High Tech jobs like SAP, SSIS, Oracle Warehouse in India."
good,Working for Cognizant has provided stability and security with learning more about companies needs and how to provide Tech support for new clients.I have learned how to assist with new clients and learn about management to assit the team and follow up with client request. How to handle escalations and provide the proper information for clients for technical issues.
good,It's a good place to learn new technologies for beginners.Work life balance depends on a project in which we are going to work.Salary increment will be less
good,"I have been working at Cognizant Technology Solutions full-time for more than 10 years"
good,As per Cognizant rules n regulations we get more deductions on benefits like PF n health insurance n all . Our take home salary will be too less .....

good,"We can learn more technologies and management is good if you are joining with cognizant with higher salary this is a great place to work."
good,"Work in cognizant is not the same for all associates at the same level. For few it is really hectic while others do not seem to have any work. If you are fortunate Cognizant will give many opportunities to learn and will help you in getting certified. But at the same time, might ruin your career by giving you the least in-demand skill and the location you least prefer. Despite spending years in cognizant it becomes difficult to get relocated. Some managers expect you to work for the entire night and at the end of the month, you receive such a low salary which becomes very disappointing. Management is worst in Cognizant and they are very self-centric. They sometimes do not care about employee needs and demands."
good,I was a Quality Analyst with Cognizant for about 1 year and 3 months. It was a great time with decent work culture and supportive colleagues. But the hiring managers and management staff was non supportive and brash.

good,Good place to work but this is an offshore company and you could loose your job at anytime.  The day is usually a productive one I have learned to prioritize and  manage the work flow assignment very well.  The workplace culture is good and the hardest part of my job  training someone to take my job offshore.  The most enjoyable part is I knew and love my so it was very easy to get up and go to work everyday
good,"i almost joined as a fresher, there are a lot of IT projects that you can explore in the company take free training and excel in your work, but work wise and growth its an OK company."

good,"it is like any other IT service company ,what makes cognizant different is that they have a flexible time policy. you can get in any time you want and go home once your task is completed."
good,"Good work culture and HR policies. But internal appraisal is not good. Dependent on project manager review. Onsite opportunities."
good,"Learnt a lot from my experienced colleagues, technical and otherwise."
good,Employees are forced to work over the weekends. very bad work life balance.
good,Nice team but not willing to appreciate and encourage the hard work .
good,"A nice place to start a work life with"

good,I just want to pursue new IT life from outside India. I have to learn more IT and cross culture. I have been 10 years with cognizant. I would like to go around seek new stuffs.
good,"it is very good company, the way of treating employees is very nice and good, but growth wise very low."
good,"The lack of training definitely needs addressed. Practical application with a kinesthetic approach should have been implemented a long time ago. The job was not stressful, but the constant changes were."
good,Only drawback is less competitive salary as compared to other MNCs
good,"Very difficult to get chance to work on your interest related   technologies ,you have to work for whatever the business requirement irrespective of your interests , else apart from this Cognizant is decent organization. "

good,"Work culture is excellent. But Cognizant doesn't care about the existing employees.Pay wise it is very low for the employees who serves the company for longer period."
good,Like any other company it also has good and bad points. Variable pay and appraisal is what I have found bad here in Cognizant. Also their way of assigning the projects irrespective of employees expertise is what I dislike about this firm
good,The definition of what the market is wanting was lacking. The IT staff was very competent but had very little real world use cases.  The lack of leadership was unbelievable.
good,"Review from FP&A team perspective."

good,"Cognizant is known for its employee friendly attitude and extending support at the time of need, by allowing people to work from different locations, or by taking care of immigration requirements."
good,"Cognizant employees are extremely loyal to clients.  Alliance roles are both exciting and challenging.   Success requires a very diverse set of skills in sales, marketing, legal negotiations, and operations to be successful.   I would say above all it is very important to be able to influence a diverse set of personalities and functional areas.   It is a good place to work with a lot of opportunities, particularly if you are located where there is a corporate office such as Tenack, New Jersey or Irving, Texas."
good,"great place to start not intending to stay"

good,"Learn while you do your work"

Cognizant specializes in systems automation and Technology Solutions.  As a Manager, I learned a great deal from Cognizant as far as created a streamlined approach to system automation which is different than manual enrollment processing.  The workplace culture is pretty good.  The hardest part of a managers work day is trying to manage all of the meetings with the operational needs of the Enrollment departments.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the high energy pace which is needed to support the various Medicare, Medicaid, or Commercial Heathcare clients needs."

good,Good but office politics is high and you are not judged only on your work. Salary is below par and too much dependence on your manager for promotion rather than work done. Bonus is good.

good,"Although its a nice company to start with your career, has a decent training period. Work life balance is ok. Salary is good for freshers, but getting a hike is tough nowadays. Work culture and pressure completely depends upon your manager and projects. Overall rating 3 out of 5."
good,Excellent place to work for the new joiners. Equal opportunities for employees. Excellent reward for the amount of hard work put in. Year-end appraisal are the ones that should reflect your performance

good,Performance oriented company. Provides opportunity for the development in field of your interest and other fields as well. Good work environment.
good,"The  positions I held were ""remote"" in that you are in a remote location fly in and fly out for weeks or months at a time. Though some work from home opportunities exist in this very large company, my role had me on the client site a majority of the time. The compensation was good and the benefits are good. The hours while on site are long often exceeding 8 or 10 hours. The consulting functions we did within my group are demanding and aligned with client satisfaction. Often contracts were written to win rather than perform the tasks that were committed to. This created many situations where the heroics of the team had to compensate for the gap created in delivery versus what was committed to in the contract. There are some very talented people employed with Cognizant. It was a pleasure working with most of them. I learned a great deal and had the privilege of working some amazing engagements."
good,"Cognizant is a global IT, business-process and strategic consulting business with more than 500+ clients, spanning five continents and every major industry"

good,"Good, stress-free environment, lots of learning opportunities, great team mates."
good,I have worked with Cognizant for 10 months now and never felt the need to leave the company. They provide great benefits and support their employees.

It mandates completing one technical course every quarter which in turn benefits the employee.
good,This is my first company as a fresher. Trained in a java and Oracle. Learnt a lot during my career. Had opportunity work with top retail  client like philips.Best place to work
good,Big name in the corporate industry. Good infrastructure. Friendly environment. Job security. They always ensure employees safety in a good manner. Cab facility is good.
good,A Good work place with job security. Work culture is mixed and depends on the team manager and the client. Work from home to be introduced officially.
good,"Work life balance depends on project, compensation is not as per market standard. Job security is good but not for higher level.onsite opportunity is good."
good,"Awesome"
good,"Better place "
good,Have a lot of opportunity to work on multiple technologies and across multiple verticals. opportunities for travel are minimal and growth is not consistent.
good,Productive and fun workplace but less job security. Also no cross skill training for career advancement. The management is a mix. Some managers are really supportive and some do not help at all.
good,We have no pressure while working in cognizant some processes are hard and that is there in every organizant but we have wonderful events as well at the same time pressure less work.
good,"A typical day at work includes stand-ups and meetings first thing in the morning, lunch at reasonable hours, work for 7-8 hours."
good,"Cognizant is a big company with more than 25000 employees across the globe. Many projects are really good and have lot of scope for a person who is keen on learning new technologies. Work life balance is ok, some projects do have hectic workloads."
good,"Good place for work-life balance"
good,Difficult to change technology stack once it is assigned. The process of project allocation could be more transparent. Good training program and work culture.
good,I joined the company as a fresher and I loved my time here. Really liked the way my career took shape and all the opportunities that are available to be grabbed.
good,"I worked in cognizant for one year, the project is long tram and we used to support for 5000 users across global wise and workspace is good, people are friendly"

good,"It is one of the biggest names in IT industry. It has numerous  facilities across the globe. In Kolkata, it has got 6 buildings, some are owned by them."
good,"Overall Work Culture is awesome.  It's make life easy while work.  Great Domain to upgrade my domain knowledge. There are many things that is unable to describe in words. Here are the key points. "
good,"It's the best place for beginners but for experienced there is no learning opportunities or challenging jobs available for them. "
good,Loved working for this company.  Kept us up to date with advancements in our company along with annaul reviews of the year and where we were headed in the future.  Just a shame they closed our office.
good,Its a fun place ro work and fast past the manage ment is great but firm. Great benifits no job advacement until permanent I dont think it is something to make a carrer out of. Great commute to work understanding for time off
good,The day starts with hustle and status call. You're supposed to satisfy your client where your requirements will be clear but you'll be expected to do something more than what you are supposed to do.
good,"I have been into 4 projects & all the projects have different equation in every aspect say work-life balance, work pressure."
good,"so many indian associates, not fair for other country when time for promotion. some stupid coworker is there. only talk and forward email, cannot complete one task himself"
good,My experience at Cognizant was certainly one of professional growth. I got to be a part of a contact center start up which was exreemely rewarding. I met some wonderful professionals who certainly contributed to the knowledge I acquire about the business. Throughout my tenure I was promoted to Quality Assurance Supervisor. Cognizant has helped me tremendously and I am now ready to move onto the next level in my career.
good,Very strict working hours where your swipe in and swipe out is recorded and observed.Eventhough you completes your task you need to record sharp nine hrs.
good,Work life balance is nil i this company. Rest all can be worked out and is dependent on your business unit’s bosses. Billing pressure is high and you can be asked to take up areas that are of no interest to you or relocate.
good,Good company to work for which provides valuable experience where Employees have a larger say in various decision making. Company has grown big now which definitely has created some wider fragments.
good,Good place to work with. You need to maintain strictly 9 hours each day as an average. Salary revision is delayed each year and there are no such arrears added after the revision. TDS for YTD Versus actual deduction might vary due to many reasons even though you had all proofs and investments declarations submitted.
good,"Cognizant was a great place to start my career. I was able to travel and had new projects and clients regularly so the job remained interesting. Unfortunately, the company is very large and it is sometimes difficult to really stand out or get recognition for successes at work and getting promoted seemed to be more of a political game than performance based."
good,It provides good learning experience once you come out of college. This is helpful to understand the real time scenarios in business units. One year of learning is a sufficient amount of time to learn new technologies.
good,"There is a lot of opportunities to learn, however there is limited bandwidth to execute any projects. There are many leadership training program conducted by the company."
good,I have got chance to learn so many things. Not only technical I have learn the leadership skill. There is always opportunity to improve the learning skill
good,"Nice company, gave good hikes this year. Timings are to be followed along with the learnings and exams for the year end appraisals. This is mandatory here."
good,"it is a good experience i had with cognizant team and their culture, I like to thanks my team they taught me nicely and friendly, good team, good culture"
good,"Office atmosphere was excellent."
good,"good company to work with, other than the work life balance and pay,Need more focus on the future , training associates with new technologies,and development methodologty"
good,"Good Company to start off with, you will learn a lot if you are willing to do the work."
good,"I got to learn many things there also i learnt nish Technologies like MDM, ETL also got good experience of leading team with technically strong background"
good,"Good company to work for expecially while on client site where the client rules prevails. However, I have not had the expirience of working in Cognizant's own environment."
good,"Company has good benefits and good training but expects experienced employees to do the same training as junior staff even if skills are already proven.  All reviews are done locally but then advancement is calculated at the corporate level where you are just a number.  Saw good, knowledgeable employees passed up for promotion because they were too valuable as workers to promote out of their position.  Company needs to let local staff and the customer determine technology path instead of some outside group swoop in and try to say what needs to be done even if it doesn't align with resources and requirements at the local office."
good,"You may not get rewarded at times and which will affect your growth in company. There will be less knowledge growth. "
good,"for one it takes forever to go from contractor to full-time. pay is competitive, but cost of living is high. my manager is great but others have been known to be more of a dictator / micro management.office and break room are nice as well as the landscape."
good,Good company with strong technical background and with large number of good clients. The work environment is good with skilled managers to guide us in the right path.
good,"Pro"
good,"Not a good place for career growth. I am working here for last 4 years "
good,"Cognizant is a good place to work. You can get numerous opportunities to enhance your skillset, gain good experience and travel. Good work environment."
good,Excellent place for the freshers to learn new technologies . some of the projects are hectic and some people are biased . overall its good place to work as a fresher
good,"- Day to day new technical challenges, exposure to new technology."
good,"Cognizant provides a breadth of exposure to anyone starting their career. However, individual career goals can and often are (presumably justifiably) set aside for more pressing billing concerns. The company could do well to have a more productive mentor - mentee model. I was fortunate to have found great mentors but I am not sure everyone is."
good,"I got into a nice project which helped me learn a lot and get into the 'corporate culture' and technology. "
good,Vast Learning opportunity within the company. Multiple verticals provide you with an opportunity to gain domain knowledge in more than one. Growth could be slow if you join at entry level.
good,"The resources given to departments are seemingly limitless. They have strategic direction, but don't expect easy aspects or processes from HR or IT or support services to move very quickly at all. Expect snail-pace."
good,Good company with good exposure to projects. The projects are big  enough to provide resources with good opportunities to enhance and implement the skillsets.
good,"Good place for all the experienced people. lot to learn as well, but the discrimination that company follows between IT and BPS sectors is definitely hurting. Need to improve on these aspects"
good,"1.Overall good but then the appraisal system is not meritorious."
good,Company is good. Infrastructure and policies are acceptable. Will like to come back again after switching the company. Incentives are good if company is not in loss.
good,"Good place to work, mostly depends on what project you get assigned to. I have learnt a lot in my tenure till now with CTS. It is very organized but it all boils down to the project you are working on. Many employees have been with the company for a long time so overall good place to be."
good,The scope of personal growth is less rest is fine. Initially learned a lot but later it was a bit stagnant. Moving to different teams/technology is difficult.
good,"Fairly good work environment in the initial days; certain pitfalls happened due to margin pressures, off late; otherwise, a very good firm to work in overall."
good,"Salary and benefits are less but work life balance is good as long as you are at the right place and project."
good,"The project I work for has a lot of learning scope. Since it is one of the large scale implementations of Guidewire Insurance suite, most of my work days would be on high octane mode. Nevertheless, I also always enjoy working in such a challenging environment because of the work culture we maintain."
good,"Cognizant is one of the better consulting firms to work for."
good,"We are never short of work, so assures job security and provides exposure if employee is ready to work and prove themselves. Great culture, where client comes first."
good,Good for experienced. Less pay scale for freshers compared to other companies. Flexible timings. Better job culture. Difficult to get onsite opportunities.
good,Worked across multiple clients and projects and enjoyed the time thoroughly.Typical day of work can vary from slow paced to very hectic depending on the project.
good,Had a great chance to learn abundant of new technologies with every new assignment. If we are competitive and need challenging environment definitely Cognizant has space to provide it.
good,"1st of all i feel happy to work with Cognizant so i learned many things which helps me in future. Like how management not suppose to be, work load is heavy, unbalanced personal and professional life"
good,"I had worked with Cognizant BPS for six months. If I have to say about the company, its a very good company in terms of employee friendliness , work culture and benefits. But yes everything depend upon the project and management. I have learned lot of things though that was not my domain but I have learned many day to day activities that have helped me in my current organization. Team leads are also very helpful and supportive only all team members need to be very productive. The project that I used to work, they only need productivity and work life balance was very poor. As they can call you on your fixed weekends. Though pay was there for that. But no one was able to plan anything prior due to this. No issues with pays and benefits. If one get a good project its a very good place to be in."
good,"Management was not good, job and package were ok. I really loved working in Cognizant. it was amazing to work with cognizant good workplace..........."
good,Work Life Balance is good at cognizant. I have got very good opportunity to improve my career and I am doing great at my career. My work environment is very good at cognizant. Top Management is very good at cognizant.
good,"Good service company with 9 hours compulsory work. Work life balance is not very good and benefits are an average."
good,Work here is entirely dependent upon the Account that you work for. My experience with Cognizant was satisfactory. I did not have the opportunity to work with new skills and technologies.
good,"If your role is in Middle Level or Joiners, I would trust it would best suited to your life balance, culture and onsite opportunities. However periodic updates in Technology, learning wont be good due to high volume staff"
good,"A typical work day in CTS is good.As CTS is my first working organisation, I have learned all the technical and management knowledge."
good,"Its always the project & not the company!"
good,"Opportunity to learn within the company"
good,Must improve the career options for the resources. Managment should act promptly on resource needs and help to improve the aspirations of the resource
good,"Better projects in Bangalore and Chennai than in Noida. "
good,The training given was very informative and the working atmosphere was friendly. A place were we can learn while being productive for the organisation.
good,Cognizant commits to deliver to client needs. Goals and objective driven organization to provide healthcare administration services with cutting edge technology.
good,A good work life culture. We get to learn a lot and explore all areas of technology. Employee freedom of work and space. No time restrictions in terms of clock in and out.
good,I liked thee projects I got in cognizant. Huge client base.Only thing missing is carrier growth as there are many people fighting for same positions. I would recommend Cognizant to anyone.
good,"Haven't heard too many people complaining about it but it suffers with the same slow paced , bureaucratic structure which stops innovation. "
good,"Work culture is good, but salary benefits not as expected."
good,Work life balance is poor when comes to employee satisfaction it is good as they provide right help at right time. Managers are helpful sometimes they were very friendly to talk about issues.
good,Good support from the management. Good place to work and learn about different communities. Salary is good and Highly recommend working here as it is a great source for networking and career growth both in India and outside of it.
good,"Working in an MNC may bring you up at your Home or within your family but you only knows where the magic happens."
good,Good working environment. Salary package can be increased. Working time is minimum 9 hours a day. Moderate team management. Not employee friendly. Improvement needed.
good,"1. Provide you the flexibility to work. "
good,"Work culture is good as you will get chance to learn different activities related to your process, company provides different learning activities so you can participate in as per your convince. No worry about your desk allocation as you do not need to share with other colleague. Annual party, quarterly feast, festival celebration will make your mind fresh."
good,"Had a good time working with the experienced professionals on different technologies like MongoDB and Spring Boot integrations."
good,The company gave a nice exposure to the people working. Got the opportunity to learn new technology and also the work was appreciated and as per that work was appointed as L3 in the team and also lead the offshore team.
good,"I was a fresher when I joined this company, so the salary was a concern."
good,Lively to work..experienced in mortgage process ..healthy to compete with colleagues.. Working in rotational shift is benefit and good to improve ourselves
good,"Very good place for freshers to learn and gain knowledge in their domain as Cognizant is a place where training are been given to make individual grow in their career."
good,"Excellent as they keep and try to make your job interesting an alive to shed off the stress level at office"
good,"Cognizant had the right mix of challenging yet relaxed all in the same week, specifically while learning Salesforce CRM, doing modules, and preparing for a new account."
good,"I loved my job , But a lot of the work was out sourced overseas. Fac paced envirnment with a mixed culture, Management worked together to resolve a majority of the issues"
good,It is good place to work as long as you get good manager. There is high scope for favoritism as the rating system is not very robust. It all depends on how is your relation with your manager.
good,i have learned a lot working in Cognizant.  constant team meetings will be conducted to monitor our levels which helps us identify where we are. its a nice place to work with.
good,"Workplace is good and encouraging."
good,"Working atmosphere is great in the company."
good,"The company provides immense opportunities for someone who is starting IT career with lot of learning programs. The leadership is also approachable."
good,"Large diverse client base"
good,If you want a good career platform to learn and understand on how a big Global Consulting giant operates then this is your platform. Jb stability is amazing.
good,"A good place to kick off your career with."
good,"Cognizant is an American multinational corporation that provides IT services, including digital, technology, consulting, and operations services. Good Company"
good,"Great, but it is totally depending upon your immediate leaders. Promotion is the issue, and salary they cant match. Its not the best company to stay long."
good,"I have had the opportunity work in exciting and challenging projects with some of the global automotive clients"
good,A very good Place to learn and explore all the best things to improve career wise and good place and friendly atmosphere and best place for beginners to start with.
good,"Good Working Culture. Management is motivating and helping."
good,Started my career From UBS which was then offshored to CTS and was part of CTS workforce. There is lot of scope to develope and emerge as a strong resource.
good,This is a great company to work for. They would work for their clients that need the right person to work for their clients. The clients are companies that would work with anyone.
good,"Learned a lot about managing clients because of client facing environment. "
good,Cognizant is a good company to work for. Benefits are good and work culture is dynamic. Of late though there have been extensive focus on billing and billable time utilization which is creating additional pressure on people.
good,"Work intensive culture with strong customer focus. Offers the chance to work with a large number of people, help sharpen your people management skills."
good,"About Company-"
good,"work is too hectic in some projects and no time limit for the employees to work. In India as all known all the outsourcing are done from different countries, work pressure is more than expected."
good,Cognizant technology solutions is not a bad place to work until you be polite with your higher officials as there is lot of politics involved in the higher management side.
good,Cognizant has very good work culture. Career growth opportunities are good. Management and colleague are good to work together. Great work and life balance.
good,A Good Company to start working up to mid level career. A growth will be paused/stopped at mid level. Need to wait for promotion for a decade (no sure)
good,"The workplace culture as well as management is not top class."
good,"I have learned a lot , very good salary scale. Good job culture.  All the employees are very helpful.  The only disadvantage is the office location bantola and long working hours."
good,"Mainframes "
good,"Good work enviornment,safety is good fir girls,get to learn a lot of new things.The timings become flexible as per your work.you have to work for minimum of 9 hours but the time can he extended"
good,"I have been working at Cognizant Technology Solutions full-time for around 6 years. "
good,"As this was my first company, I learnt all the corporate ethiquettes here. The learning curve here will be high. But, the biggest drawback is that they won't give us freedom in any sort. Be it location or the domain. I think it will be best suited for experienced people."
good,It's a good company to work with and you would get a chance to work with the best people. There is a lot to learn in consulting besides technical work and you would get a chance to work on interesting assignments with different clients.
good,Good company to start your careers. They have lot of project so you will be having more things to learn quickly. Hike is okay type on yearly basics...
good,Good place to work but slow growth. Secured job. Client centric. Management strategies are not that good. Not a very good place for Career aspirants who expects quick growth.
good,"Good Workplace, Good Facilities, fun at Work, Work is Time Consuming, Team is good, Good for Starting, Fast paced environment, Typical Culture is average"
good,Nice company to work.Typical work culture like service based companies which can be improved upon. My experience working here is good in onshore and India
good,"A good place to learn as a beginner and also to grow within. Salary Hikes are less and location constraint exists. "
good,"The company policies (for hike,onsite,band progression) are not very transparent and no scope to contact your HR.Your only hope is your People Manager"
good,"Scope to learn new technologies and attain business knowledge."
good,"Good work culture and customer focused deliveries. "
good,I felt very happy to start my carrier in this company as a Programmer Analyst Trainee on TM1.I learned many technical and non-technical skills in this organization.
good,Your hard work and performance is always appreciated and effectively rewarded. The variable pay and incentive program is very effective. Multiple opportunities for diversified career growth.
good,"A good start for freshers"
good,"I have been working at Cognizant Technology Solutions full-time (More than 2.5 years)"
good,"You need to be active everytime and thus the brainstorming is one thing that everyone requires. Getting ideas , thinking and working on them and making them happen is what we do here."
good,Good company  but currently lot of changes happening. Hence its not the right time to join this company. Appraisal process can be improved. Compensations and Cola can be incremented.
good,"My dream job"
good,"The work culture of cognizant is really good. Since it was my first company enjoyed working in the company."
good,"Competitive atmosphere"
good,"There is no pressure in work place."
good,Cognizant used to be a good company to work with. Management has made few new policies which are hard to understand and follow specially the 9 hours in office rule. Work culture is much better as compared to other competitors. Business casuals is the dress code being followed here.
good,Its good for a fresher to build there carrer and a good tech park with shuttle facilities and also cabs are provided and it is Productive and funworking place with good envoirnment.
good,"I worked for 7 years with Cognizant before i joined Tech M. I joined as fresher, learned and groomed myself working here and grew into a professional."
good,Good company with very bad management . Need to work on managers and I would say respect the employee. HR are good friends of managers so they will take action against you if you will raise your voice.
good,"Every then and now we use to get learn new things with respect to domain we are working on. Mostly on business side."
good,"Pros:"
good,"It is a good company to work with, if you are looking to enhance your knowledge you should join the salesforce project as it give immense opportunities to brush up basic & implement high end logic's."
good,"Good place to start carrier with.good place to learn.good worjing atmosphwre,no timing issues.aids knowledge gaining.not much of work pressure .balance of lyf is possible"
good,"Cognizant Technology Solutions is a progressive IT / ITeS company which has good clientèle in the Banking & Financial Services domain."
good,I have started my career  as a Fresher. Company has given me a lot of opportunities to grow technically and Communication wise. Left the company after three years as there was no viable growth trajectory.
good,"work environment was very good."
good,"Good job security, average work life balance, difficult to get transfer, average salary, good work culture, has lots of projects, opportunity to grow is high."
good,not enough job oppurtunities given for the skillset.Job security is very low and you can be thrown out o fthe company anytime and the salary and incentives are not what you expect from a MNC like cognizant.
good,"was able to balance work life and personal life, the project i worked was good with good team lead and members. day to day activities and adhoc tasks was part of my production support role."
good,"Good place to start off, learn quite a lot."
good,"Good interactive and supporting team always exists in Cognizant, The Organisation provides the best end product to the client, ensuring the work goes well even during rough days. However the communication does not flows easily between the offshore and onshore team , There is always a gap in delivery the right information to everyone in the project."
good,"Better company for freshers to start up their career "
good,Work Environment is good.Management is effective. Nice opportunities to learn new technologies and market trend. Great work life balance. Nice benefits for employees.
good,Gud company to start your career.  Work life balance / career development completely depends on project.  Nice benefits & onsite opportunities if you prove yourself.
good,Cognizant is good place to work. Work life balance is well balanced. The work culture is fine. People here are friendly. But  I opine their is a scope to improve the way the knowledge is shared in the work place.
good,"Great place to work with for the junior folks. Once you get to a level of Manager , then its hard to get back to the Technical track, bcos you will be made lose track of latest technology updates."
good,"Good place to work......can have fun and will have a balanced work life, friendly environment and good rappo with seniors and fellow beings....job security varies mainly on projects..Have no idea about it..."
good,Workload will be high; but depends on the project which you are working. You can learn so much latest technologies. Management is better than other companies I guess. Hard part of the job is you have to be on your toes when delivery approaching.
good,Its a nice place to work with. Policies are good. Management is friendly. You can easily upgrade your skills. Love to work with Cognizant technology Solutions.
good,Cts is becoming a tough place to work with the job slicing activities going on. Although wmployees get ample oppurtunities to enhance their technical knowledge.
good,Decent company to work in case you want work life balance. Limited analytical growth opportunities. Need to benchmark with good salary as per industry standards
good,"Joined as a fresher."
good,It's nice to be at cognizant and working there for 2 years . Good management and facilities were provided. But pay and growth will not be good when compared to current market trends.
good,A great place to learn and develop your potential so that you are ready for the next level. The colleagues and team members are excellent and very friendly and encouraging
good,"Cognizant is a good company in terms of work culture, onsite opportunities, employee benefits, individual growth and overall progress of career. However, a lot of the aforementioned good things depend on the technology one is into. Automation and Innovation is the key to success. If one happens to be in a project with limited scope of innovation for technological limits or time constraints, then the job to be in a successful or deserving position gets harder."
good,"Cognizant Technology provides diverse opportunities to the associates. They can get cross trained in various technologies and domains based on their career development plan."
good,The only issue with this company is you have to complete 9 hours every day.but overall nice work life balance and a great place to build your career .
good,"Work is Cognizant is wonderful. "
good,Good place to work. Good work life balance. Salary increment is less. Thats the only negative thing. Job security is there. Management is good. Job culture is also good.
good,Great Learning experience. Very Process oriented. Lots of learning curves to help us groom. Work life balance can be maintained. Opportunities to switch to different domain.
good,"Salary are not at extent as experience of employee"
good,"Flexible hours. Laid back atmosphere. Lots of job opportunities once you start with the company."
good,"I joined Cognizant Technology Solutions as a fresher. Company is good to start as a fresher. I had options to select my project, work type. Company management is good. Salary is not good."
good,"It was good working here, workplace culture is good and I leaned a lot of things. Had Fun."
good,"Productive and employee friendly,"
good,"Smooth work-life"
good,"Cognizant has hired lot of Infosys vetrans at mid and higher level.  All those who left or were thrown out because of leadership change there."
good,"Work life balance is good , Scope of learning is also there."

good,"From a trainee to a Lead role, I have worked in Cognizant for a decent tenure and had mixed experience.Typical to an Indian IT service company, the job can involve hectic working hours and almost nil work life balance.Growth prospects are also there but organizational politics may hinder it at times. Many times, you can feel the lack or transparency as against the publicized process-oriented culture. "

The thing is whoever selected not yet got offer so far even after one month. Also the interviewer is not having SCM and build & release knowledge. They simply take decision to select or reject based on current CTC. But consultancy people are used to call everyone whichever profiled matched for skill set. This is totally waste of candidate's effort and time."

The work / life balance purely depends on the manager and project that you get allotted to.

good,Cognizant Technologies provide excellent benefits and paid time off.  It is very quick paced and stressful.  Job security is always a concern.  Need to on your best game and confident in what you do.  Sales related position is paid well but you have to work hard to succeed and need to be a hunter.
good,Cognizant has a very encouraging environment for all its employees. I got a lot of opportunities to cross skill myself technically outside the project as well.
good,Leaned and grew from senior developer to architect. Got good support from management and project team. If you work smart and hard then you will be rewarded with possible available benefits and chances.

Management is not always on the same page so you have to be very flexible in all approaches. You get a bonus every year, fun and games throughout the year and plenty of food to go around."
good,Good Company for non techies since it is process based industry. No external trainings and no value for external certifications in most of the projects
good,"Cognizant the company treats it’s employees well, as with any company there are issues but they are working to correct them. Great benefits and not pricy with all sorts of discounts and incentives from phone bills to auto insurance to personal loans. I’m very glad to be apart of such a great company."
good,Work life balance is good only concern is the visbilty of the work is different if we are from horizontal and hence not expect any sort of recognition
good,Tough during production deployment times in the project. Depends on the type of the project and the manager you are falling under. Never take the team out with the reasons of work load and pressure.
good,"Overall rating 4.5/5"
good,Good company for who wants to stay long by doing repetitive work without any challenge and new learnings. It have good Compensation benefits covering Health to 401k.

good,"Good place......................."
good,"This is a company to build long-term careers or join early in your career to have an exposure to professional workplace practices"
good,A typical work day can vary from being very busy to being slow.  I learned a lot more about working with Microsoft products.  Management depends from person to person.  Work place culture is very easy-going in general.  The hardest part about working here is getting hired directly from the company in certain departments.  The most enjoyable part is being able to work as part of a team.
good,"A typical day starts with the the morning prayers (daily stand up meeting) and goes on doing RAID, WSRs and tacking all the issues. That is if you have a project.  The life is very project dependent.  One will start early to have some overlap with India delivery centers.  During the day, various client meetings take over the day."
good,Work life and personal life well balanced. Need to work hard for career growth and promotions. service based company so no job security. large layoffs during recession
good,"Huge organization"
good,Management treated all employees very well. There where days that where stressful -due to numbers that had to be met.But over all a nice place to work.

good,Work life balance is decent. Skill enhancement is encouraged. Very flexible working hours. Very helpful. Job is secured. Very bad paymaster. There are no stringent dress codes.
good,"Good work/life balance. I don't know what to add after this so I am typing this.:) "
good,"Cognizant provides all the necessities to its employees to deliver quality work. But, at the end of the day, one's experience in Cognizant is entirely subjected to the Project he/she is working in. In general, Management is good and one can have a work-life balance.

good,"Cognizant is a real good company to work for. Excellent benefits, compensation and opportunities in terms of promotions and onsite work. However, it is important you get into a good project because the team culture varies from project to project. Unfortunately, my project was a new inception with a new client. Great opportunity to learn new technology and work within a large team. However, project management was not employee friendly. There were politics and favouritism in the team. I remember people working for long hours, late night. Customer management was terrible. Also during the initial phases, employees were denied cabs especially female employee. Many of the people who worked with me have either changed the project or left CTS including people at senior management even directorial roles. There is a saying, one rotten mango can spoil the entire basket. Well there were many rotten ones there.."
good,"the company is trying to grow its digital marketing wing, so I must say good opportuni\ty for digital marketers to join in and grow."

good,"I learned management skills"
good,"Nice to work but not a good one for fresher to start his career."
good,"Cognizant is a very good place to work. Sure it depends on team by team basis (not even project by project) but I have had the opportunity to work with awesome people, highly motivated people. And people who love the company. Trust me, when one does that, the result shows in your work. I never had much trouble with work life balance as I only worked more when I felt like it, rather than someone telling me to do."
good,"One of the leaders in Indian space of IT. Had a great learning experience, had learnt a lot of my core programming skills in mainframe. Some projects had good opportunity to travel to other countries, you just have to be lucky."
good,"As a Senior Test Automation engineer, was responsible for:"
good,A great team in place to discuss with the objectives of the deliverables and how to proceed about them. The entire hierarchy is approachable with the right structures in place to help you streamline your career growth. You mayn't necessarily feel that you being duly compensated for the amount of work put in but the best part is it offers you the correct balance between professional and personal life.
good,"Very helpful training sessions which start off well for a career. Good work culture to learn new technologies."

good,"My main experience comes from working with the present team. I have had great support from my manager so far. CTS is one company with a good bonus payout option as well as good in terms of compensations. Though my present role requires a lot of stretching and additional work, but overall good experience."
good,"Self-Learning is the only thing that kept me in good progress.Few hardships.Learned lot of technical things including issue fixes."
good,"Good company to work for, lot to learn but management style is not that great.  Its a well paid organization.  But this company cannot be used for career growth."
good,"Healthy work culture and an aggressive sales and business development culture. Pay packages are not bad , but nothing spectacular."

good,"Cognizant Technology Solutions was my first job after college, and I don't regret working here one bit."
good,"Cognizant - Was a small niche initially and later grew as one of the biggest IT services giant."
good,"mostly the team assigned is fun and well professional work culture is maintained at work place. "
good,"A typical day at work is fun. Every call is a surprise, every call is challenging. Its fun because it is a non stop learning experience. Its fun because there is never a dull moment for each and every call. It taught me how to be more patient, understanding and sensitive to client's needs. Co-workers and management works really hard to meet the expectation for every employee. The hardest part of the job is working under pressure.

good,It is a good place to grow and learn but it is lacking in projects for freshers especially in iOS domain.

They're always looking to  build on the business and attack area of the market from an innovation standpoint. They are successful from that perspective. There are some shortcomings however. Placement dictates your experience quite a bit. If you are placed on a project in a favorable city then your experience is a lot more positive. Some coworkers that have been placed in unbearable situations experience burnout very quickly and end up moving on. Next most important aspect is the project that you get paired with. Some projects are more organized than others, thus you are paired with more capable management. My work environment has become less and less diverse. These days my coworkers are mostly if not all Indian. This is something that Cognizant could do better at.

good,"in cognizant solutions pvt Ltd  your job is more  secure than others companies "
good,"Good environment and relaxed working place."
good,It was an overall good experience to work at Cognizant Technology Solutions. The new management which has taken up is involved in cost cutting factors which has delayed the hikes and promotions for current year 2019
good,"This was my first company."
good,"Working with cognizant is very good experience, good work culture. Fun at work is best time. Awesome teammates who is very supportive. Involvement of HR gives"
good,Working at Cognizant was a great experience. I learnt a lot and people were very helpful and collaborative. I would definitely recommend this company to my friends.
good,"Cognizant is known for its work culture."
good,Good to start the career here. Great workplace and work culture. Recommend this company at any time in your career. Opportunity to learn New technology and good interactions with client.
good,Good company with benefits but work culture could have been better. If you looking for a startup company for your career then you can gather good knowledge from here.
good,"Lot of space to learn about work culture and management skills"
good,"Good Company, however not sure how it will be in the Cognizant campus, because we are based out on client location."
good,Better atmosphere with better teams working in a challenging environment will encourage new recruits to develop required skills in getting into the industry.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Cognizant, the people are wonderful my team welcomed me with great affection I learned a lot from the training they gave me. I was very sad when we finished our project. but I have great memories of the time I was at the company."
good,Good Place to Learn New Things. Has good  Work Life Balance. Salary is reasonable as per industry standards. Good Place to  work for laterals. Has to maintain an monthly average of 9 hr at work.
good,"A typical day at work was kind of need to be on your own in certain aspects. I learnt so much from the client I serviced for through Cognizant. Management was supportive, however, the change in management in later stages did not give me a chance to grow more and also . Hardest part of the job was when management decisions were not in line with the people's benefits as a whole group, however, they might have a different kind of approach towards attaining a common goal and to help achieve that , they might have had to take difficult decisions. Most enjoyable part of the job was to be on calls with the client and resolving problems together."
good,"Very good company in terms of process, job security. Salary might be less and work life balance could be a matter of concern but rest other process like apprisal, project assignment, project documentation, audit, escalation mechanisms are perfect."
good,I like to work in a well reputed organization.hence I chose cognizant for my career.i hope this was the only company I am looking for.basically  I am diligent person hence I believe that I can do my best by working in your company.
good,"Very informal work culture and this will surely bring the good results most of the time. However, this may lead to issues at times when there are no strict guidelines within the project or unit. Company offers good technical and non-technical trainings, but more focus towards only technical and not for soft skills when compared to other industry leaders. Being at a senior level, it was very difficult for me to understand who is the decision maker in the entire business unit. So, I would say less transparency when it comes to the management. Flexibility in moving to any verticals or horizontals, at least for the senior level employees is what I liked the most."
good,"Work life balance is good"
good,"Good workplace with proper employee benefits, job security aspect needs to be looked after, HR function needs a little improvement, great management staff and leaders"

good,I was a contract worker with Family Dollar thru Cognizant. Contract ended earlier than I thought it would but it was nice while it lasted. It was an interesting company to work for and I'm glad I had the opportunity.
good,Recent changes in organization at management level has created job insecurity for most of the higher management employees and highly experienced. This is place where you can learn lot.
good,Nice and stable company to work with and grow depending on the location and project depnds on manager whon you are working with and many other things but over all its good to be with a stable company
good,Lot of opportunity to grow as individual with deep technical knowledge. The learning curve is very steep and no boundaries to the goals of dream career.
good,"This company had different, and diverse areas where you can work. It depends on your skill set, management can be complicated due to teams that take place within the area your working. As an example during my first year I had been introduced to the VP of my region after that a few people took up that mantel. The dynamics are a bit fluid in this organization. Like many corporations you are affected by the winds of change."
good,"Cognizant has good working culture and would recommend my friends to work."
good,"1. Work culture is really good"

good,Good place to learn the basic workplace culture. I learnt most of the basic languages during my tenure. A typical day at work is 9 hours. Management within your project is better but not very effective with individual and HR.

good,"Good company to work "
good,"Cognizant has fair processes to identify talent and compensate them for the same. This place is certainly forward looking and tries best to stay in sync with the times."
good,"I feel my previlize to work CTS after 5 year of exp, as a lateral I have involved as lead with 34+ team members. "
good,A typical day is logging onto the phone and taking level one and level 2 calls until the end of shift. this company does everything in its power to invest in the organizational culture of the organization

good,"I have never been a contractor before and I do not like the idea that if they do not have a client for me, or an assignment, then they can easily discard me.  I believe in company loyalty as I have exhibited that by working 28 years and 16 years at my previous companies.  I only became a contractor by default as Family Dollar/DollarTree merged."
good,"Good place t start our professional life"
good,We are balancing our work and activities of fun which cannot show any impact on the productivity and equally balancing the family life as well. Company providing us all benefits how to lead the role in both ways by providing sessions

good,"Nice place to work with. you will be getting more learning options. promotions to next level will be based on the team you are working with. Even thought you work well, promotion will be based on the good revenue generating domain."
good,"If you have an encouraging team, your life is set at Cognizant else they probably will switch companies after a few months. Thats how unforgiving the company work nature is. I was blessed."
good,Cognizant is good in work life balancing and gave opportunity for me to learn both technical and managerial skills. the hardest part is 10 days of holiday per year and good part is job rotation policy which leads to learn more tools and technology. Learning and development in cognizant is a biggest asset.
good,Cognizant training is good. Needs to bring in work life balance. Management should be more focused on employee rather than company policies and benefits.
good,"The work life balance in Cognizant is awesome. A good place for people to think about working for a longer period of time."
good,A good place to start a career for a graduate straight out of college. Salary or compensation is on par with industry standards. one can find a lot of scope for multiple projects to work on. Cognizant has heavily invested in upskilling their employees and make them future ready.
good,For a fresher it is a good start to work. Although the salary and team werent a good experience for me on a personal front. Overall great push to a career start.
good,"Growth is restricted. Even with the highest rating and client appreciations, work may be appreciated"

good,I met a lot of new people who helped me and guided me throughout my career. I had organized many events and been a part of a better cause through the outreach program
good,"CTS is a multinational IT company and so the advancement in the career learnings and skill is slow."
good,"This is one of the good place to start your career with. Good amount of onsite opportunities are given here for the folks the who are interested in it. For those who prefer to stay at offshore you can see good growth as well. However as time passes, one has to move on instead of getting stuck in a comfortable zone."
good,"Cognizant is definitely a place to recommend because of nature of business, local spirit, projects they run, etc. The overall workplace culture is very good and the spirit with the colleagues is more than nice."

good,Worked with a diligent team who had given me a opportunity to learn and grow.Supportive seniors and team members motivated me to push myself hard and give my best to the project.
good,"Good company, some great opportunities, currently the initiatives are purely on training, learning and digital transformation. There are Managers and Senior Managers who always take the safe path and that can be good or bad for you. Good talent is recognized and rewarded. Better than 'just another service company'."
good,Good company. Need more transparency incase of opportunities. Culture is good. Good work life balance. Perfomance rating cycles have improved and becoming more effective
good,"They like to put the square peg in the round hole type of work, basically it will always work because we said it would. Really do not give enough value to experience."
good,"Nice workplace culture."
good,"The company is really good. Good leadership. One of the best in IT industry. They know where they are heading to and have a clear picture usually."
good,"This is a very good company to start working with, but not great to remain for longer durations. The compensation is very very low compared with industry standards."
good,"Overall experience is good.Based on your project or account , work life balance varies. The environment is productive and there is ample learning opportunities. However if you grow within the organization , salary increment is not much and you end up at a lower range when compared to folks who are joining as laterals."

good,Compensation might not be to the market level but work culture is good. Management is good and supportive. Benefits are good. Career aspects in onsite would be limited.
good,"Cognizant is a people friendly company wherein employees at all levels get equal opportunities to voice out their concerns and get their issues addressed on time. Learning platform and facilities are good. Work culture is flexible. A typical day of work is a combination of stress and benefits reaped out of efforts. Management at the higher end is very supportive, but middle level management can improve and focus more on recognizing and properly placing employees."
good,"Workplace is good. Facilities provided by the company is good."

good,"CTS has a great culture. It´s a fast growing company with emphasis on people. Even though you sometimes will be allocated in clients, it´s a policy not to forget you there."
good,"Productive and fun workplace. Great company to began your career."
good,"1.You can grow technically."
good,Pretty easy to survive if one knows to play with management and deal with them one step ahead. Those get promoted who ask for it basically open your mouth when something strikes wrong and company will listen to you. Redressal system is better than other Indian IT companies.
good,"Good exposure and visibility of your work."
good,The range of work and clients that I'm exposed to is stimulating and interesting. There are opportunity for me to be directly exposed to senior stakeholders to external clients which has allowed for my own personal development and expanded my professional network.

good,"Poor management"

I learned more than I was expecting, gained more experience with Microsoft office and different system used to full fill our tasks like the Avaya softwares and more. I was assigned in a voice-insurance account U.S based. Our typical work day starts 9PM.

good,"The work culture at cognizant was quite open and thus easy to work in environment. The dress code is semi formals thus easy going. "
good,"For my position there was nothing all that special about Cognizant besides the fact it was steady pay with benefits, the work was slow paced processing for an insurance client. I would recommend to anyone in need of a job though not a career."
good,"1. A stress day"
good,I have been working at Cognizant Technology Solutions full-time for more than 4 years. I joined as a fresher. It's a great company for learning. Work culture is amazing. Work and personal life balance is good. But then the salaries are not that great when joined as a fresher but is good for lateral entries.

good,"CTS is very good company in terms of Client relation ship, Learning, culture etc. Company is it does not let you  feel like you are a employee. It feels like a family. Work is good and great seniors to guide."
good,"Growth purely depends on the project / client / location / vertical / Horizontal and the time you joined the project. Depends on the aspiration one has for the growth in the company. Most of the managers are aligned to typical life to achieve more. More the money you bring is better the prospect for growth in the company. We can find wide variety of people around. Right from the people who say, I am good with the job I have and need nothing much to the people, who are found online for 22 hours in a day working. Company recognizes everyone based on the manager but not by the individual. Everyone speaks about work at most of the time. Even entertainment is seen as task to finish."

good,Client focused. Very Good growth opportunities. Positive outlook. Responsibilities given to those willing to do more. Great training programs. Great set of leaders.
good,Cognizant provides a good working place and a great learning environment. Company emphasises upon skill upscaling and continuous improvement. But salary structure needs to be revised as it is not at par with companies of same category.
good,"More enthusiastic and improving skills on my day to day work."
good,"A good company to work with."

Vacations and benefits are really commendable. Only thing is the year end appraisals and promotion cycles are not overwhelming for past few years which definitely need some improvements.
good,"Company is 1 of the big but something is not good with this like Week off is no fix first of all... Really hard work without any worth. "
good,Cognizant is a good company to work for if you are willing to relocate overseas.   They do provide good training for all jobs. They allow yoiu to take all the time you need for training and if you still have questions they provide team leader for your questions.
good,"Cognizant has been one of the premier organizations of recent times."
good,"Three to four hours of work per day"
good,Good organinazation. Management has to focus on employee engagment. Should understand that the team limitation and set targets accordingly. Have to improve fun at work place which is completely missing.
good,"The Company is nice,the people are friendly but the growth is very Minimal.its a nice place to work i am looking for some thing which is big.I want  to further advance my studies"

good,My typical day at work was checking emails if due dates are met. Checking if projects are delivered on time and without errors or missed. I have learned how to properly manage a project. The most enjoyable part is the job itself. Because we were able to deal with different kinds of people with different experiences too.
good,"In CTS, you will get very comfortable, friendly, and very productive work environment. "
good,"Respects diversity, secured job, process oriented. Higher management needs to work more on retaining talented resources. Office politics is ruing this great organization."
good,The company is undoubtedly good. The working environment is good and it depends from project to project. The project in which I worked had a good working culture and colleagues were like second family. I left the company only because the last project I worked in had a bad management with lack of appreciations
good,"High level of work satisfaction."
good,"learned many technological advancement."
good,Cognizant is a nice place to work and grow. One can gain good amount of knowledge. Management is good and I have quite a good experience working in here.
good,Company is very good however it depends upon the project which is allocated to individual. Overall company environment is good and management is supportive. Internal movements are easy comparing to other IT companies. A very good company for freshers as it gives individual lot of opportunity to learn and grow in different platforms.
