good,This is probably the most mature call centers that I have every worked.at  They want you to succeed.  They make sure you are ready to take your certification test and become a Technician.
good,"good place to work. has very friendly people, very easy task. Nothing to do really gets old after a while think its really for older people or high school students"
good,"Working for Walgreen's has been a rewarding experience. I have grown from the very bottom to Store Manager. I have had the opportunity to learn about different systems, how to engage with my employees and my peers."
good,I liked the workflow at Walgreens because every technician was assigned a task and every couple of hours we'd switch with each other so that one person is not stuck with the same task all day.
good,everyday it was something different never the same very good place to work if you like the customers job really good fro starting never to late to start with Walgreens
good,interesting company to work for worklife and home life balanced well training for all position is excellent and you learn all areas of store I would recommend Walgreens

good,Working here was fun. Staff was excellent. Customers' kept me going. I hate that I had to leave to stay at home with my son. Very flexible with working with my needs.
good,"My typical day at Walgreens was relaxing in the morning while doing maintenance on the machine. I learned that must customers enjoyed coming to the photo lab while waiting on their prescriptions. The management was ok, due to different attitudes on different shifts. The hardest part of the job was facing the freezer. The enjoyable part of the job was seeing customers smile."
good,"This company taught me almost everything I know as a pharmacy tech. I was able to get the feel of what it would be like. This company does not care about their employees. Maybe the management of the specific store you are at does, but the company, no."
good,Nice place to work because of the people I worked with and the sense of a team approach to getting daily tasks accomplished.  This was specifically due to the managers who were there when I was working for them.
good,It is an intense environment in retail and fast-paced. Along with that comes stress. It's typical. The best thing about working here is the relationships with your coworkers that are built.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people. You get to meet and make friendships with a lot of people who are really nice and that makes us enjoy our work more.
good,I have been a team member of Walgreens for 14 years. I have gained a lot of knowledge from the company. Walgreens has taught me how important our customers are and how to appreciate customers. Walgreens has give me the ability to adapt to change and new ideas. What I have learned at Walgreens I hope to take on my future adventures.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company. People were great. i was always busy. I loved everyone I worked with. It was like a small family. I would go back ,"
good,"Excellent benefits and good place to work. I moved out because I was looking for hospital experience, wish had stayed contingent due to benefits. Overall  good company to work for"
good,"great work experience, the management always made sure the workers knew they were appreciated and  if something were wrong they always tried to help get the situation was resolved"
good,Walgreens was a great place to work. Too bad I had to go through a mid-life crisis and screw this one up. Regular help not treated as well as any level management is only downfall.
good,Walgreens is no different from any retail store. Everyone is trying to make money so they push employees to go over and beyond to make a sale from every customer.
good,"A typical day at Walgreens is overseeing employees, making sure store meets standards, handle money and customers. I enjoy learning new pharmacy tech."
good,"was very busy day"
good,"I'm currently a pharmacy tech here. I love my job more than anything, but compensation for pharmacy tech work in general leaves much to be a desired. Love my team, my manager and staff pharmacist - we're all pretty close knit. Wish they would give us more hours so that we could function properly without feeling so stressed out all the time."
good,"would go back. Just to a different store location. Would go back but id prefer to be in the pharmacy area in stead of the retail side. Great benefits, smart & friendly pharmacists.. pharmacy manager is excellent..fair & strict... he wants the job done right & he corrects kindly but firmly... I have a couple of really good pharmacists who are really good at teaching.. I have been with Walgreens for almost two years and I truly have benefited from the experience but my goal is to work in a hospital. Retail ... sometimes it is very tough when the patients see you as just a cashier... working in a pharmacy is a tough but rewarding job and sometimes the patients don’t see what it takes to do that job."
good,"Work environment was very up beat, very prompt enjoyed working with staff and helping customers, nothing wrong with working there everyone was always friendly and kind."
good,"I loved working at Walgreens, it was probably one of my favorite jobs. The only reason that I left was because I found a job that paid more but I regretted it almost instantly. The staff that was there when I worked there was amazing and so were the managers. There are only one or two people left that worked there when I was there but if given the chance, I would go back."
good,"An interesting job, its definitely not a job for everyone. You need to be patient with customers and your coworkers. other than that a real simple straight forward job. Everything is common sense."
good,"Walgreens is a very great place to work. Management is very flexible with your schedule and understands that sometimes life happens, the pharmacy is always busy and sometimes it seems understaffed but that’s just because it is busy"
good,Se hace el 100% del tiempo mucho costumer service.
good,I have a work day of waiting on customers and filling inventory and working in the Pharmacy Department. Working at the store has been a good experience for me
good,"I had a excellent experience working at Walgreens. I worked out of the Grants Pass Oregon location and had an great store manager. Employees were helpful, friendly, and  hardworking."
good,"Easy work, good management, well trained, fun coworkers, perfect balance between busy and slow pace. Can advance when the positions come along. It's a decent job."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walgreens for the first year. It was fun, new and there was a lot to learn.If you work at least 32 hours in a 52 week period you are eligible for health insurance. This is a high turnover job so there are constantly new co workers and management too which can get very messy. "
good,It was a good place to work. Sometimes it was busy sometimes it wasn’t but there was always something to do. The only bad apart was the store is next to a school and students will come in and steal. There wasn’t much security
good,"Unfortunately, when I was employed by Walgreens, there were several customer complaints about management publicly yelling at and embarrassing employees and I was one of them. There was the occasional bad apple in the bunch but overall, the management was very kind, understanding, and professional. Coworkers were always very kind and great team players! Training new employees could have been a bit better but overall it is a great first time job."
good,I worked for walgreens as a manager for over 8 years and I would definitely do it all over again. As long as you are dirven you will succeed in this company.
good,I feel like it is a good place to work but there are not many opportunities to move up in the company. The management team does have their favorites and if you are not one of them then you're put on the back burner.
good,"Each day is similar to the day before, or week before.  Doing the same task over and over each week.  Employee's are ever changing, so there's a constant need to train new employee's"
good,If you want to succeed basically just work hard and show the right people you have what it takes to be great and soon enough you’ll be rewarded. Also try to move up in the company
good,I worked the overnight shift and enjoyed the autonomy the position allowed.  I had a great pharmacy manager as well as relief pharmacist.  Pay was exceptional and the benefits were as well.
good,"Upper management are trained in pharmacy "
good,I work at a great store with very nice customers. It gets stressful some days but i have always had great co workers to make it easier. Walgreens is a great company to work for and they have good benefits
good,"Working at Walgreens was a great fist job experience and I will forever be grateful for the opportunity to work there. A typical day would consist of stock inventory, customer service,  maintaining store cleanliness, and working the checkout line. The management team was great because each manager brought a different style of managing to the team. I enjoyed this because it taught me different ways to problem solve. The hardest part of the job was trying to talk down an angry customer and keeping calm. The most enjoyable part about working their was being able to help  people with whatever request they had. The joy of being able to help someone purchase exactly what they were looking for motivated me to keep working hard. Work place culture was very professional on and off the floor. Of course we joked and laughed together but when it was time to work, we knew how to put the jokes aside and complete the task at hand."
good,"It was my first job as a customer service associate."
good,"Good place to work, certifications, and education is re-embursed, raises are good. Benefits were great, as far as they go,  vacations, and sick days were covered. I liked participating in charity events like relay for life."
good,I worked in the 24 hour store and it is a very fast-pace store. That keeps the day moving. It's never a dull moment. I learned to have patience and to keep customers smiling. My specialty is diffusing difficult situations. Treat people the way you would like to be treated.
good,Great Place to work. They will work around your schedule but the scheduling is at times inconsistant. The people are great as well as management and you are given plenty of time to complete your tasks.
good,they help you get your pharmacy tech certification and they also help you keep it with classes! you can even learn to be a manager if you would like!!
good,Worked in high volume stores. Number of Pharmacist and techicians per shift was adequate and well designed. I enjoyed the workflow system. My  former boss is a great man. My own personal issues cost me that job.
good,"Fun"
good,Learn a lot in 8 years had the coaching from the Pharmacist in charge loved the environment of work and work hand by hand with my peers had good benefits
good,Everything the other reviews say about this company is true. Your Coworkers are awesome and the job is really not that bad. It is really all about upper management refusal to listen to their employees.
good,I love being a pharmacy technician but being a retail pharmacy tech takes a lot of patience especially when dealing with hundreds of people and their different personalities.
good,I got along with the management for the most part and after I put in time I was given opportunity to advance and was trained for multiple roles within the company.
good,Walgreens is a nice to place to work but you to need know a little knowledge about medical stuff such as certain types of medicine needed to be used for a certain issue.
good,It was great first job. I liked working there. I worked there for a little bit  while in high school part of a froster youth program class and it helped me understand work.
good,Walgreens was overall a very pleasant place to work. It is not at all very physical. The managers overall were very helpful and personal.  I learned a lot about customer service as well as sales. The only downfall is job advancement and pay was low. Great first job.
good,"It was a fast pace workplace. I worked a lot of hours during the week, sometimes around 60 hours during the holidays. I enjoyed my time working there."
good,I think Walgreen's is a wonderful place for someone with a very flexible schedule.  You can learn a lot about customer service an retail working at Walgreen's;.
good,"Working for Walgreens was very interesting. I met and bonded with many customers, because they new how much I care. We had food days, special Holidays, we received big discounts. If some days you couldn't work, others will change shifts with you. We dressed up for different Holidays. It was just fun a lot of times."
good,"Not a bad place to work at all, decent hours and decent pay for the job. Low stress environment (except on holidays) and overall very good management."
good,"Great place to work. Manager Leslie makes the store a great place to be. They give you the opportunity to make your schedule fit with your personal life. Everyone is very friendly, it feels like a family place when you are apart of the team."
good,Nice place to work everyone gets along nicely. If you want to be pharmacist great place to work as a teck and they pay for school. I would recommend to anyone.
good,This was a great place to work. As long as you're friendly and can keep pace you'll do fine at any Walgreens. They always stay up to date on ad-tags every Sunday.
good,Friendly atmosphere where work is done at a moderate pace.  Workers are treated with utmost respect. Company has an open door policy which gives the employees the opportunity to share their views and concerns with management.
good,"A very fast paced environment. You had to stand for 8 hours a day and help customers, build displays, and stage inventory. The supervisor at the time was great to work with and taught me a lot."
good,Hit or miss on what kind of manager you were assigned but overall it was a decent place to work. The only downsides were frequent team member call ins so you would be asked to come in or stay over when you were supposed to be off.
good,Throughout my career there I was able to become nationally certified. They gave me enough time to accomplish what I wanted. and also paid me time driven to go to class
good,"In my position traveling to different stores, I like the fact I get to meet new people, I'm in different environments and I see how each store is ran and how the employees are at each location."
good,Walgreens was a decent place to work. Good corporate and store management. The discount is nice and decent wage for assistant management. Would recommend work for anyone.
good,This was a pretty good place to work as a company but I didnt enjoy the team at my store. They resembled and acted like a group of teenagers in highschool. They acted like I was an outsider and not welcome. The techs in the pharmacy tried to get me fired multiple times and toyed with my mental health.
good,Walgreens is a great place to work for. Sometimes it's challenging but fun. I learned a lot from the three years I work there. Walgreens built my confidence in being a better manager.
good,"Started on cash and then was cross training in Photo and Beauty. "

good,Store was nice to work at.  The support staff and managers were helpful.  The managers always have way to show me how to do something.  I was always taught the correct way.  I learned a lot in my year there.
good,"in my opinion the hardest part of the job was figuring out the store by heart when i first was hired at Walgreens. Due to my role of facing & restocking the shelves,figuring out the store was an additional priority i had to master so that i can work at a quick pace.But other than that i enjoyed my summer youth experience."
good,"I enjoy working here, this company is very helpful with promotions. Employees go above and beyond to help one another. Great environment, faced paced environment"
good,I would stock new merchandise and would help any customer that would need help finding a new product. Let them know about new discounts. Nothing was hard. Sometimes boring.
good,we always work as a team when I worked at walgreens. our teammate always try to help each other in order to get our daily work done effectively so everyone in the team are friend either at work and off the clock.
good,"The management was horrible and had no form of power there. No matter what anyone would do, they would pretty much get away with it. But, the pay was great."
good,I've learned a lot about the Cosmetic Industry and sales as a whole. Walgreen's has equipped me with the knowledge and experience I needed to qualify me for a greater opportunity in the Beauty Industry.
good,"I learn how to do customer service, do the freight, how to do zoning and stock the merchandise. Do labels and other process for the weekly ads and how to exchange a product."
good,"Will recommend this work place.  Nice and beautiful."
good,The management at my location was very helpful and were able to help me set up/ assist me in any questions I had regarding any work relates issues. The 15% discount on items and 25% on Walgreens owned brands was very nice.
good,"A typical day at work is helping patrons with everyday and pharmaceutical needs. "
good,"The job is not hard but we're always work short staff the store manager is wonderful."
good,"This is not the Walgreens that it once was. I left becouse I was the wrutting on the wall as they say."
good,"Just like any retail job, you are going to be dealing with working crazy hours. Dealing with customers demands. Managers who have their favorites and employees who will do whatever is needed to get ahead"

good,I cherish the hard working pharmacists I was honored to work alongside everyday. I learned a lot about work ethic & commitment to excellence during my time there.
good,Working at walgreens would be so much better if the scheduling was more consistent and holidays the stores would at least close early. But you will get a lot of good life experiences. also there is allot of opportunities to move up in the company.
good,"great company to work for. i would gladly work for this company again if given the opportunity. good benefits,good wage.very good training.advancement opportunity"
good,Walgreens is a major corporation so at times it was difficult to be heard. They really do care about their employees and really do try to show it. They helped train me and get the education I needed to advance.
good,"meet new people and enjoy tending to the needs of returning patients, make sure their needs are met in a timely fashion, fix any issue with insurance preventing them from getting what they need when they need it"
good,Always opportunity for learning new things at Walgreens.  We do.m not have enough help for all things they want us to do. So we are stretched very thin.
good,"Arrive at scheduled time, clock in and go to work.  Process customer's purchases, straighten merchandise in designated area and stock merchandise with a pleasant proficient and courteous attitude."
good,I worked for Walgreens for over nine years. I found the work schedule allowed for great work-home life balance.  I also feel it was a positive work environment
good,Walgreens taught me valuable lessons of work ethic at a young age. Seeing workers who were older that worked quicker and more efficient instilled greater work ethic in me.
good,"You are constantly on your feet, always help people who need it, and always be welcoming to the customers. The boss will recognize your devotion and help you get spotted in different stores."
good,"If you don’t have a degree, but want to make good money, this is the place to be. Walgreens offers a lot of opportunities in growth and development. If you work hard, you move up quickly."
good,It's a job where if you take care of the people who take care of the customers you can be successful. As a Manager you can build a team and surround yourself with a team that can help you be successful and attain all of your goals.
good,One of my other joys in the workplace is dealing with customers in this industry and meeting new faces.  I like the fact that I had the opportunity learn the mindset of how marketing is done to sell their products and how to develop film as a photospecialist.
good,Hardest part allowing the customer to realize the company was there for needs. The work place culture always a safe environment. The most enjoyable part of the job the end result of an eight or ten hour day and meeting new customers.
good,"A typical day at work was cashiering, cleaning, restocking, and above all; great customer service. I learned time management, and spontaneity. Management was it or miss, as I've had experience at numerous stores. Hardest part; short staffed days. Enjoyable part; being good at what I did."
good,It’s a good job to work part time. It helped me during my down fall for a period of time I was in. I was an intern getting paid so I made my own hours but besides that it a good job
good,"The past job that I have had were both amazing experiences. I got to learn how to be patient, caring, outgoing. They taught me that not everyone is perfect people do make mistakes and we just have to learn from them and keeping moving forward."

good,"Customer service was great."
good,"Great amazing work experience wish there were more hours for employees. ..............................."
good,Right when i come in most the time my co-worker is at the register and i begin to face the shelves making sure tags match the product and what we need to stock. If were low of product on the floor and in the stockroom make sure we take note for inventory use. I have learned to remodel sections and reset areas asked of me in a good timely manner. Keep clean and always organized and make sure we have memorized the product and the isle it belongs on to assist customers in a fast and excellent manner. When new product comes in make sure you familiarize yourself with thdsfjljfdsljsdfl
good,"Very busy pharmacy, 24 hours open, lots of multi taking. Taking in prescriptions, answering phones, checking out customers, answering and solving complex questions regarding scripts and insurance. Providing excellent costumer service and making sure everything is done fully and accurately. Receiving and stocking pharmacy drug and supply orders. Keeping pharmacy records organized. Assisting with pharmacy employee scheduling and training all technicians. Hardest part is not having enough me's to fulfill everyone's needs and what I enjoy most is helping and teaching and my customers and building a relationship with them as well."
good,Working for Walgreens over the past five years has been an incredible experience. They offer many forms of ways to improve at work. A typical day varies depending on the volume the store does and the time of the year it is.
good,"As an extern, I was not allowed to use the register. I counted pills, fill prescriptions and did some Spanish translation. A few times I also handled the computer where you see the patient's prescriptions and print them out to label. There were two pharmacists at the location which allowed for more than 4 technicians, but we were all organized and if I had any questions, they would happily help and guide me through what I needed to do. I've also wanted a career in healthcare so working at a pharmacy and helping people with their medicines was a good experience. The toughest part was memorizing the names of the medication and where they were located, as they were place according to how much they were dispensed day to day. Overall, I enjoyed being there, I really wanted to become a full time pharmacy technician and maybe even study to become a  pharmacist. The only thing I would have liked to have have done was handle the cash register, which is a very important part of the job."
good,"Was able to do my job with little input from the actual manager, we had set tasks that needed to be completed each day. =Cut back on store openings forced me to look elsewhere for a job."
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for and the people their are always nice and kind. Very helpful whenever you need them to be, nothing really bad I can say about this job unless it has to do with raising hourly pay for pharmacy technicians."
good,wonderful place to work and use you skills. your mind id challenged everyday and the culture is balanced daily. the work that is one is the best  thing about this job.
good,I liked the job and the atmosphere. It just did not pay enough to meet my needs. I left for a job with more hours and higher pay. But I would go back. I love helping customers get the most for their money. I would advise of sales and of the rewards card they can sign up for.
good,great place to work. very busy always be able to get ovetime if you want. really enjoyed my team I worked with.Great supervisor and team leads. company cares about employees
good,"always having a good time "

good,Overall good company to work for had never had any complaints.  Will work with schedule for most part if needed.but you need pretty much open availability.
good,Most days are busy days at walgreens. Lack of team work due to lack of staff. Discounts are good. Too much work for the pay rate. Overall a decent job for starters.

good,Working at Walgreens made me overcome my P.T.S.D. that I got working at another job (mohegan sun.) They have helped decrease other anxiaty problems as well. This company really works well with disabled people.
good,good company with good benefits.  Strong management and good structure with decent work home life with the exception of sometimes having to work double shifts back to back.

Policies that dealt with customer service, Pharmacy, Photo, beauty and sales floor daily tasks that had to be done according to your position.There are daily  and weekly tasks. All tasks and duties were met on time. The most enjoying able part of the job is helping people. From helping customers treating an illness or injury.

Customer service is always at the top of the daily tasks. When you help better customers lives, you help better yourself and in turn help better Walgreens."

good,My typical day at Walgreens was being upfront as the main cashier. Best part is meeting new customers on a daily basis and most of all the returning ones who knows you by name.  Management team works with you and treat you like family.
good,"a day at work would usually start off slow but it would get busy throughout the day. i learned to be a team player and my co workers were great. hardest part of the job was when it would get really busy, but at the same time it is the most enjoyable part of the job because it isn't boring."
good,"The company is fair with the employees, there is some career advancement opportunities. The management is slid but not always on the same page with the employees and store managers"
good,"Walgreens has a quality of service that is a lot stronger than other companies, where they don't focus so much on the scores and metrics but on customer service and work ethic. They make work enjoyable and a place you want to come to every day."
good,"Good decent job. Advancement possible if you learn fast. Fair place to work hours are not so good. Not hard work  good staff and manangement,I would reccomend if you are into retail setting."
good,A typical day in the office of Walgreens Alliance is very laid back. Speaking with many different customers placing delivery. Pretty decent place to work
good,"Walgreens is a fast paced, high demand job. Work hard but benefits were worth it. The fellow employees are what made you want to come to work every day. Extremely hard work."
good,Great environment to constantly learn new things. Friendly and helpful staff. Benefits are good. Every day brings new challenges. You get to meet and help new people every day.
good,This job is fastpaced job. the hardest part of the job is truck day. you can take a 15 minute paid break. you can get a discount on the items there. great place to meet new people.
good,Always an opportunity for advancement if you show initiative and hard working skills with strong attention to details and professionalism. Never enough payroll hours to cover all the team members in order to have all the work done.
good,It’s a good company to work for there. They have on the job training that is nice. Plus you get to work with great group of people. There benefits are great also 401k stocks. Flexible hrs
good,"awesome people at my location and a great place to learn. I interned there through a school program for pharmacy tech and had an overall great experience, though I heard  it depends on were you're located."
good,"Great for getting experience in different areas such as stocking or customer service.Co-workers are very friendly and easy to get along with,Management is nice and easy to work with."
good,"I loved working at Walgreens but the reason I'm looking for another place to work is because the company doesn't pay well. I've been very loyal and after staying with the company 8 years, and starting at $8.00 I'm only making under $11.00, pretty pathetic."
good,I feel like this company cares more about bodies being present then the health or wellness of the employees. They shoukd take that into more consideration.
good,"I liked working for Walgreens. Once I transferred out of the area it was completely different.  The  one that I was at here, has no work flow, no one took responsibility."
good,A typical was informative. It taught what I needed to know about filling prescriptions and checking for insurance availability. The most enjoyable part of the Job was coming to work and being able to help people.
good,"To start getting your feet into the world, this is a good job to have.  I found the people I worked with were great, but it's not something you would want to have as something you do for a LIVING."
good,Walgreens is greats for a first job and to stick around for a bit but eventually you have to spread your wings and move on. (Something something filling in for minimum requirement)
good,Good workplace great for advancement great benefits. Pay is well. Needs better management in certain cases. Overall not a bad company to work for. Not much negative about it
good,Walgreens was a fun company to work for. However there was a lot of responsibilities for little pay. There wasn’t enough opportunities for pay advancement. Your raise depended on everyone’s work ethic
good,"Even though the hours were almost unreasonable and it was sometimes physically difficult to complete some jobs, it was a pretty good company to work for.  They are generally good people that want you to work towards the better you."
good,"I enjoyed working at the pharmacy. Interacting with people was the best part of my day. The environment was relaxed, co-workers were wonderful as well as the management staff. We all worked together as a team."
good,"The place is not a bad place to work, must be able to work in a fast pace environment and able to keep calm while being yelled at or talked rudely too.  Able to multi-task is very important"
good,"I basically made sure the shelves were stocked, ordered any product that needed to be replenished, assisted customer in locating products they were looking for or ordering them online if they were not carried in-store. I learned to have patience, not just with the customers but with my co-workers as well. Management worked hard to set a solid example of how an employee should act. We were polite, even when the customer was being less than gracious. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a positive attitude while being yelled at by a customer who was unfortunately being told that company policy would not allow what they were asking for to happen. The most enjoyable part was being able to work with some amazing people that I call friends."
good,Trained and paid for me to become a pharmacy technician. Flexible scheduling and good benefits including insurance and compensation. Offers on the job training.
good,There is always constant work that needs to be done. You self stock and inventory everything and help customers find items. Customer service is always 24/7 and management is very helpful. Co-workers are also helpful and fun to work with.

good,Fast-paced environment with continued on the job training. Crossed trained in all areas of the store including pharmacy. Flexible schedules and good benefits
good,"Good company to work for, great co-workers.  Fun work environment. At the time I had great healthcare benefits.  All in all a pretty good place to work."
good,The most enjoyable part about my job was able to help the customers with thier questions and their needs. There is no healthcare provided for the employer at the job.
good,My time with Walgreens Specialty Pharmacy was great and gave me huge insight into what Pharmacists deal with on daily basis.  Had a chance become a Phamcy Technician but that was not my road that was chosen for me.
good,"•	Assisted in interviewing potential candidates for hourly positions."
good,"I really enjoyed this job. It was busy, but not too busy. They followed the break and lunch times perfectly . The other employees and supervisors were very nice."
good,my typical day at walgreens could be hepling customers with theirs items of purchase or stocking or helping with the photo to help get the customer's film order filled and processed.
good,It was interesting to see all the different types of people Walgreens helps out daily. It was nice to see the different options as to what I could do in the store.
good,I enjoyed the opportunity given to advance my knowledge in all areas of the store. I learned from my coworkers and the true meaning of team work. I've worked in overnight stock and understand the importance of presentation to the customers. The day shifts made me strive to improve and provide their most pleasant shopping experience.
good,"Great Company. Short-term or long-term, you will find what you are looking for at Walgreens. Many employee resources, flexible hours, high management support, strong capacity to climb the corporate ladder."
good,"Cashier/ photo duty is self explanatory & easy"
good,"I loved this company and I worked here for five years. I love my managers, my coworkers and the enviorment all together. It felt like family and Im so happy I had the oppurtunity to work here."
good,"Store manager responsible for overall everyday  store operations, including; cash handling, inventory, ordering, point of sale,  pricing, resets and revisions, overall store and safety conditions, which  includes all corporate policies and procedures. Supervised employees,  including; hiring, training, scheduling, payroll, and job assignments.  Overseeing our pharmacy, in making sure that   "
good,"Working at Walgreens is fast paced. Taking care of customer needs while maintaining state, federal and corporate standards is the basic job description."
good,A typical day at work working with different and happy customers everyday wanting you to help them have a great experience and be  very knowledgeable in different products. and also staff members who are very proactive in the things they do. I've learned that the company is a great place to work and also to grow. What makes the company unique in everyday is that the company is so pro customers willing and eager to go that next level to love customers and to be very engaged in the work place. The hardest part is trying to satisfying  un happy customers . The most enjoyable part of the job was working with different people.
good,"a typical day involved processing transactions"
good,"Working here is good. The people are all driven, and the work environment is good. Overall a good place to work and grow as an individual. I learned a lot here."
good,"i love working at Walgreens, they provided me a great training in the pharmacy. I love how organized they were in the pharmacy. I highly recommended. they were very nice team work, and we always care about the customers."
good,I worked at Walgreens for several years. The store I worked in was a lively place with a very cooperative staff who cared about their work and our customers and patients.
good,I love working at walgreens. I  love the company this is one of the best place to work. And I referred this company to anyone that would like to work for this place.
good,"Customers can be amazing or terrible, that is part of retail pharmacy. Equipment was good, some of the staff was great. Understand that customer service is probably the biggest part of your job."
good,"I have worked for Walgreens for 13 years. I have done everything from customer service to now being a pharmacy tech. Have never had the chance to be in management. I have learned many things working for Walgreens. For example, customer service skills, making sure customers are satisfied with their shopping experiences, how to take in prescriptions, fill prescriptions, and to understand customers needs. The management changes from time to time, seems like they never stay in one store for a long period of time. The hardest part of the job is not having the hours that we are needed to get the jobs done nor the number of employees. Always short handed. I things i love about my job is that I get to see repeat customers that you have gotten to know and that you know you can always put a smile on someones face."
good,"Working in the pharmacy is very stressful but you are given the tools you need, most of the time. The tech training is very minimal so there are a lot of people who don't know what they are doing and it does take a while to learn, but once learned it's very easy. There are a lot of people in and out so the job is secure but there are budget cuts from time to time when hours get cut. They do have nice benefits and there is room to move up if you are ambitious."
good,"I enjoy working here. Although, not enough training to learn all you need to learn. There is not enough time in the day to do the training (PPLs) they do offer. "
good,Working for Walgreens was rewarding in the beginning. as time went on i started to learn that the specific location i was at did not carter to there employee's like stated in there mission. The job started to feel like i was just fillign a body in the seat. I didn't feel like the company as a whole valued the work and the situations the employees where put in there was a lack of empathy. The pay was very decent but that was compromised by the way people was being treated.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was making new friends with coworkers and customers. My Co-workers made my learning experience easier and fun to complete my job duties.
good,I loved Walgreens since the first day. Yeah it gets tough working in retail with rude customers but its part of the job and I learned to deal with it in the best manner and with a lot of patience. Working at Walgreens has been a great experience so far and I would recommend it to any anybody wanting a stable job and opportunity  to advance in life.
good,Great way to learn customer service skills... A lot of knowledgeable managers that encourage you and help you perform well. This company is big on advancing and reach different goals. I love that they reward staff members with certificates and gift cards when they’ve gotten good feedback from customers over the phone/ online.
good,"My job was customer services in all department's, especially in the hallmark department. Had to make displays for every holiday event that come's up. Making sure customer can find what they need. Helping my co-workers with up produce that comes in. Able to do reset's and revisions if need be."
good,"followed list of job requests, photo orders top priority, customer service even above photo orders.   I am in charge of making sure that photo orders are completed.   I am also in charge of making sure customer questions are answered and products are located for them, sometimes when they don't know exactly what they are looking for."
good,Working at Walgreens gave me more experience in the a/p department.  Being a temp employee was nice because the other employees made me feel like a member of the team.
good,"Management was fantastic, extremely friendly and approachable at any time. Worked with you and your schedule, and had no bad feelings towards it. Good opportunities for advancement if you put in the work."
good,"Walgreen's was a good employer and given the opportunity, would work for them again.Enjoyed working with my customers and watching them leave satisfied."
good,"Learned how to interact with customers on a day to day occasion, became a part of the Walgreens team, helped with customer questions. The best part of the job was working in the photo department,  I would build canvases, print posters and teach customers how to use our photo development software. The hardest part of the job was shoveling snow in the winter and salting the parking lot"
good,"Working at Walgreens was a great experience. Always busy ! I learned about stocking, inventory, different benefits. It was nice to work with customers as a beauty advisor."
good,"A good place to work with good benefits including medical, dental insurance, 401K, paid sick leave, etc. Only downside is there is lack of opportunities for growing."
good,Walgreens is a company that is dedicated to serving customers and employees with the care they need. The amount of work you put in determines your pay.
good,it's an ok job. the customers make the job ten times harder. your work is rarely appreciated. they expect you to be fine with changes that you weren't aware of.
good,"Walgreens is a very great place to work, I enjoyed working there and would work there again. The training program is very detailed and staff involvement is amazing."
good,"My company genuinely cares about the people who use our services and the staff who work hard to achieve great care and want the best experience for both. They are true to their values"
good,"over all not a bad place to work; I have been with the company for many years. store needs more help, good dependable help. although I don't think there is much room for advancement."
good,"it was an easy job and they work with you if you have anything going on in your persnal life, they also leet you choose when ou g on break and you get three of them so thats nice"
good,"Job Work/Life Balance: An adult looking for a good work/life balance will find it at Walgreens, however, scheduling can be difficult for students. "
good,"I really liked working for Walgreens and might apply again but I didn't like being stuck on the night shifts. I couldn't see my children. I had to stop working there even though I loved it, the people, staff due to not seeingy kids."
good,Attention to detail is very important. Redundant work. Must be capable of spending hours on your feet. Retail setting so the expected retail headache. Pleasant management.
good,"Slow or sometimes steady at work, you learn so much about the company and how things are done at Walgreen's. Customers are sometimes difficult to work with, however, as the employed you have to have the patient and respect the customers."
good,"I love my Job here it was just time for me to move alone in my career, Walgreens has been good to me and my family I really didn't want our time to end but it was beneficial to me.."
good,I worked at the front register and filled my free time restocking shelves and checking for outdated merchandise and resetting merchandise by using plan-o grams. .  It was not a difficult job.
good,I'd work here again. The hours and days are flexible. My managers worked with me to find a schedule to suit my needs. This would be a good place for college students to work.
good,The tasks you do depend on the position you are put at for the day. The front register isnt allowed to leave. The floor person is all about cleaning and stocking. Cosmetics was the most laid back place to work helping the customers. There is alot to learn in the photo department but its easy.  Walgreens is great on paper but it depending on the managers and your co-workers the environment can be chill or hostile. The job wasn't hard and the best part is probably making customers happy.
good,"while in the pharmacy, you get a mix of everything. good days, loud patients, phones never not ringing, projects started to be completed later either by you or another tech. Mostly it was like a college class that you had to do a group project on, but that project was everyday. You learned and were taught what was expected of you. Then were put in place and worked as a team.  As a team is the only way to make it through, this is not a one person show. I will miss my groups and helping out new and well known patients."
good,"I learned how to manage my time.  I loved working for my store manager then.  A regular day for me was I worked 3rd shift.  I would come in, take out the garbage, sweep the store, and straighten up the store."
good,"Working at walgreens was a great experience. I was able to meet new people and be helpful on a daily basis. I was given a list of jobs to complete each day, so that gave me lots of opportunities to learn new things."
good,"A typical day involved organizing workflow to meet customer demands, training or interviewing of new staff members or interns, maintaining pharmacy supplies and delegation of duties. I learned to mentor, monitor compliance with Company policies and workplace culture.I also learned to maintain and safeguard confidential information. The hardest part of my job is handling emergencies and accommodation of staff members needs. The most enjoyable part of the job are customer satisfaction and problem solving.."
good,"Walgreens is such a good place to work for, employees are always willing to help in any situation such as myself . Our customer service is always excellent ."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is interaction with customers and busy work flow.  .. the hardest part is standing on your feet for long hours. management is great!
good,"Associate managers were becoming less patient with cashiers. like myself, most times that were particularly faster paced than usual. The would ask for us to get people through the line quick as possible, and then push for getting things pushed to the front in the coolers, or take back boxes, perhaps forgetting to help out themselves."
good,It's a great entry level job with advancement opportunities and friendly co-workers. I think anyone out of high school or going through college should apply
good,Good place to work at. Having a great knowledgable staff helped me grow in the company. Great benefits for planing for the future and encourages a healthy work place.
good,"Working at Walgreens was very informative, fun and productive. Definitely one of the first jobs that actually turned co workers into family. Great place of work."
good,"It was, for the most part, a laid back job, as long as you followed instructions and got you work done in a timely manner. The shift leaders were all very friendly and helpful with assisting in day to day tasks, the assistant managers usually would come help out on the sales floor and in the stock room even if that wasn't their job, and most of the store managers are extremely knowledgeable on their potion and about the company and are great go-tos for any questions at all. We all treated each other like family, since it's a smaller work environment and for the most part all got along great. Daily jobs were, greeting and helping customers, helping unload delivery trucks in the morning and putting away the stock, keeping the sales floor and stockroom clean and organized, keeping out dates pulled, being crossed trained between the front register, photo, and sometimes pharmacy.  The hardest part of the job was all of the heavy lifting and climbing."
good,It's very slow  sometime it does get a little busy. It's a great place to work. Walgreens also have good sales prices . I hate when it's only one cashier and it's busy you will have a long line unless you can move quick.
good,You learn all different aspects of the retail pharmacy world. You get to be involved in team ideas on how to create a better place of business for you and your consumers. Hardest part of the job is working 5 and a half days a week every week and juggling at home work.
good,"IT was okay, the district manager could bne more fair with their decision making. The employees made the job more fun. Customers were also nice most of the time"
good,"As a store manager in Washington, DC, I was often confronted by officers from the DC Regulatory Committee for compliance with DC regulations.  Most of my employees were public transportation dependent.  The traffic to and from work was a major hassle. My shrink rate was extremely high (shoplifting). I learned a lot about city culture, management of people, pharmacy, and overall responsibilities of managing a retail pharmacy store."
good,good place to work for good environment will get promoted if you are a hard worker and not lazy they do promote within the company flexible hours  good pay.
good,"lovely place to work. good training and good hours, time off requests are fair. there is almost always an opportunity for moving up within the company."
good,"A decent place to work. Not enough help, we could use more employees, that would help decrease pharmacy errors. Would like to see management care a bit more."
good,My first job and i can't be more thankful to them for giving me a chance. Gained a lot of valuable experience and acquired excellent customer service skills.
good,"As my first job, Walgreens was a good choice. I enjoyed the relaxed nature of my job and didn't have any stress while working. If you're interested in being a cashier, I would recommend Walgreens."
good,"Walgreens has a job culture that helps you feel secure, happy, and wanting to work. I can't speak for all walgreens, but the ones I worked at were very accommodating and friendly."
good,"I have only been working 6 months, this is my first retail job. I am a shift leader, so that means I'm in-charge when there is no management. I learn something new everyday."
good,"Walgreens is full of new experiences and everyday brings something new. Whether it's pharmacy or front end, you'll always meet new people and learn new tasks. Pharmacy has been an experience for myself, however it can be a lot to handle at some times. Which is why I've been looking for new jobs. But Walgreens has helped me develop new skills within the 2 years I've worked here"
good,This is a great place to work toward individual life goals. I learned a lot about how important daily goals are as well as staying educated about products and tools.
good,"i an't say much about Walgreen, because i didn't really like my job at Walgreen. Walgreen was OK at some point. it was great with customer, but not with employees."
good,La empresa es muy competitiva y tiene buenos beneficios
good,"In my opinion this was a wonderful place to work. The commitment of the management was superb, and if you were ever having any sort of issues at work, or at home. The management will offer whatever help they can to make sure that you are taken care of."
good,"I was young at the time so I don't remember everything that has happened. It was not easy because different personalities were around as far as customers, although the customers are always right they didnt always have the right attitude."
good,very solid pharmacy company to work for. The staffing levels were always adequate and the management teams provided ample opportunities to grow and develop.
good,The overall environment is fun and upbeat. It is very competitive and time sensitive. corporate visits were always happening and we needed to ensure that we were on top of everything at all times
good,the job as a manger was fine for many years. i worked retail for many years before Walgreens. The reason i left was because of always working weekends and the mixed day and night schedule.
good,Each day offered a fast paced learning experience. Performed service duties at different locations in and outside of the city. Worked projects in groups and individually.
good,"It was pretty slow, but you get used to it. There's tons of people that helped me there as well. The employees there are super nice as well. The managers switched a lot as well but you can get used to each one."
good,Very busy work day from start to finish.More like a family place that welcomes everyone.Great boss and awesome co-workers.Absolutely love the customers they are what keeps the day interesting.
good,Company offers opportunity for growth from within and allows employees to  stay up to date with new advances in technology and practices. New material were implemented  in workplace and continual education were provided.
good,The company does what it can to provide all available resources to team members that need them. Encouragement of empowerment and ownership. This leaves you with a wonderful feeling of impacting team member lives. The only negative thing is goals for this company are hardly achievable with given policies and procedures and there is never consistency with the pharmacy budgets as far as actually running a pharmacy based business.
good,"It was a nice summer job. I got to unload the truck and Stock the shelfs. I got to work as a cashier for a little but that was only because the summer was coming to an end. I enjoyed the job, but I wish there was more times  were I could interact with people."
good,"great opportunity to grow and develop, really give you the opportunity to grow and develop. Is a good environment, and easy to learn. Even though its retail you can suceed."
good,It was a great company to work for. All the managers and employees were nice. They value your input and want to help you succeed. They offer great health benefits and a wonderful employee discount.
good,"My job at Walgreens is extremely fast-paced, due to the multiple duties that a worker at my position has. As an assistant store manager, I often find myself having to be at several departments in the store at once."
good,This is a great place to work for those who are trying to find their way. They are willing to work with your schedule and the work environment feels like family.
good,I would recommend employment from walgreens to anyone.The management is great and they give you full control of your space. They make sure that their employees are well taken care of.
good,This job was good but I had trouble getting day time shifts at my location because they were mainly already taken up. I think a pay raise was necessary for me.
good,It was unfortunate I had to leave this job because the travel between school and work became too stressful. I learned more about beauty products and how they work for each person.
good,I worked here part-time while in school and management was very helpful and cooperative.  It really depends on the location too.  Some do not offer the flexibility because it really depends on the manager you work with.
good,Learned how to deal with irate customers and descalate them . Learned how to assist the pharmacist . Learned how to identify patient’s needs . Practiced all laws and regulations .
good,In the beginning the company was great...I loved my job. Just things changed. We had disagreements and rules and people did not follow them.  Other than that the company is a great company.
good,"It's good to be in a company where you grow up. They recognized your hardworking and feel appreciated for upu effort and time. They careless, pushed up to be in a better position because you deserve it."
good,"Administered and handled exact amounts of money for various money transactions, and balanced cash inventory on a daily basis "
good,"Managers were alway very engaging and helpful, and overall fun to be around. Was very surprising to see how quickly everything movies, i.e seasonal products."
good,Stable yet flexible hours. Competitive pay. Good management team. Friendly staff. Good learning environment for personal and professional growth. Never have the same day twice.
good,This was my first job that I ever had. I was a customer service representative for the front of the store. My managers were always helpful in whatever aspect they interacted with me.
good,A typical day at Walgreens can see yourself doing different challenges whether it be in the photo lab department on the floor or up front on the register.
good,"Typical retail job, decent pay and hours. Most of the store management staff were fair to work with. You knew pretty much what you were going to do every day."
good,Walgreens as a company is a great place to work the different stores and their managers are what makes the job stressful over all i enjoyed my time at walgreens
good,"started off as a cashier and became a Store Team Lead all within 2 years.  "
good,I love this job just need better pay and better employee appreciation it’s very hard to be a single parent and only can work nights and get paid 9 hr and pay all the bills by myself .
good,I stepped down from management because the company felt they had over hired management. They offered some to step down and receive full benefits. I took the offer.
good,"This company provides advancements and are willing to help you reach your full potential.  Working for this company you get benefits such as 401K, exceptional health insurance, and much more."
good,It is a place to learn customer service and grow into a management position. You could make it to run your own store and have a crew that will learn from you.
good,I enjoyed my time at Walgreens and being a part of the family environment in every store they have. This is were I learned how to deal with customers on a 1 on 1 level and this contributed to me having A1 costumer service today.
good,"Was able to temporarily work at Walgreens on Staten Island for a summer. A very strong way to be introduced to the world of retail. Properly taught to interact with customers, handle money, and complete stock intakes."
good,"Hardest part of my job was unloading truck for stocking, busy always had things to do, had fun with the coworkers and the public, facing the store and putting up sales tages"
good,Walgreen's is a great company to work for I believe your work experience varies from store to store because of the various management styles and also where the store is located.
good,"It is a great place to work. Great benefits and competitive pay. Mangers are motivational and want others to succeed and be promoted. I really enjoy working here, but I’m relocating and there is no Walgreens near by."
good,"a typical work day at Walgreen's was customer service and stocking shelves checking for out dates on food products checking out customers at the register and directing customers to product"
good,"Nice peel, never got promoted. Easy job. decent pay in bowie area. I have only worked their for about two years and I like the work environment and it caused me no stress"
good,Walgreens was a great entry-level job for me as a student. The company is very flexible with their hours. I learned a lot of my communication skills from interacting with the different customers at Walgreens.
good,"Title cannot be longer than 50 characters"
good,"•	Communicated with healthcare providers, insurance companies, and patients in person,  via fax and telephone"
good,i have been at walgreens for over a year and some change and i can honestly say that walgreens has worked with me. when i started college my coworkers changed their schedule to accommodate my schooling.
good,typical day at work clock in do the chores that are provided if there is a truck put up stock if on register greet customer and check them out with a smile and thank you
good,I moved up very quickly within this business. It is a great chance to gain managerial experience and learn all the ins and outs of retail. It taught me a great deal of communication skills and problem solving techniques.
good,Summary basically explains it all. Decent place to work with decent wages. Schedule fluctuated constantly with little to no solid set schedule. Multiple breaks were good though.
good,"Most day's were simple and made it an amazing place to work, and the pay is great for the area. The only complaint is that it can sometimes get a bit boring. Otherwise it is great!"
good,Hardest part about this job was also trying to satisfy each customer. You have to do so to the best of your ability. Great way to mmet people if you had this specific position to further chances of continuing and or moving forward.
good,"A typical day is good"
good,"I learned a lot about self-management whenever I was tasked with something or put into a specific position in the store. I learned how to keep proper maintenance and inventory and organized order whenever I was told to do something and I performed to my bosses' liking practically every time. I became a quintessential part of the staff. "
good,"At that time, the company was a great place to work, atmosphere was nice, everybody got along with each other, the customer was friendly, manager tried to work with scheduling,"
good,"I really enjoy working for Walgreens its a great company .They have great benefits 401 k medical, dental, and vision at reasonable rates. It is very fast paced. The store is always busy and it is open all Holidays for the convenience of our customers. Overtime is always given during the Holiday seasons."
good,"day to day operations is assuring the customers and the agents are taken care of --- Walgreens, overall, is a good place to work, decent benefits, good people to work with"
good,I have made amazing friends through walgreens and that's all I could really ask for. Any job is barable if you have friends to back you up. The job it self can be difficult at times and things tend to go wrong fast if they do. However the management is always there to bail you out. I've worked here for 5 years and don't regret it.
good,"I been working for walgreens 3 years now, I like to work here. They have best computer system. They always focus on customer satisfaction and happiness."
good,This was my first job after I arrived to US. It was far away from where I lived. I used to take the bus or walk a lot due to my schedule to be out around midnight. Here I learned to deal with different kind of people as a customer service.
good,"It provided what it needed to, job security and benefits. The hourly rate was more than acceptable. The management could use a little tweaking but still and overall great place to work."
good,Walgreens is a good job to work for. They pay well for the positions. They have great growth opportunities for you to move up with the company. I would recommend Walgreens as a company to work for.
good,Great place to work easy to advance and many learning on the job opportunities. Very good benefits for employees after you have been there 90 days. Also very easy to transfer to another location if a person ever decides to move.
good,pay was good some bad store manager to much favoritism with in the managemeant staff towards employees they were always 900 pc. trucks so very busy days on truck days
good,"Most enjoyable time at work is when i   get to have come in contact with all the customers, also enjoy all the people i   work with, and my mangers too"
good,"Co-workers were family like, the word teamwork took in a major factor, over all very nice place to work at, sometimes feel underappreciated. Could use some work on management."
good,"Meeting customers needs on a daily basis.  Learned many skills.  Management helpful.   Meeting customers needs is hard at times, then quite rewarding."
good,They give you everything you need in order to succeed. Walgreens has great benefits that come along with the job. Also everyone is great to work with.
good,My time with Walgreens was also somewhat different and I while basically still in retail was a slightly different business but also very informational.
good,Working for Walgreens was a good experience. I met a lot of great people including customers. I enjoyed helping customers with their every day needs. I also like my work schedule.
good,This was the job I was able to keep the longest because the tasks required for the job were easy to do and coming into work every day didn't feel like a drag.
good,"The company provides on the job training and provides classes and learning materials available for technicians that are interested in becoming certified. Technicians are given multiple chances to pass exam, first try is paid for, second attempt will be reimbursed if passed."
good,"Customers were very sweet and kind. This job was also like a family atmosphere.small pay for a lot of work. Pay was not good.but job was fun,.Bose's were nice."
good,"With the merging of our Retail Pharmacy and Pharmacy Benefits Management businesses we have built an all encompassing business model.  Today we're the market leader in multiple categories and able to provide patients with solutions that no pharmacy retailer or pharmacy benefits manager on its own could offer.  For this reason, we are in a “category of one,” uniquely positioned to help people on their path to better health."
good,It was a very stressful job and the hours promised were not actually available.  was mostly just filing prescriptions and taking care of customers.  must be on feet all day
good,"I have spent over 18 years working for Walgreens in management, of which I was very dedicated to my responsibility and employer. But, positively it was time for me to change career"
good,"it is a good place for freshers but if you want to pursue a career it takes to long. On top of it they are cutting hours drastically and they do not pass the benefits to there staff who is there for a long period of time,"
good,"I loved working at Walgreens its a nice place to get some experience in the cashier, management, and pharmacy. However customers are really rude and usually mistreat the employees which results in lots of resigning. I've gone through it too but if you like your work and helping people it really isn't that bad. I believe its just short on staff what makes the job really difficult. If they hire more in the pharmacy things would be a lot better."
good,"pharamacy is fast paced, always busy sometimes low staff, management is always great, lacks full time hours, had to work at multiple stores to find hours"
good,"It was a good experience but all they had me do was fill prescriptions and pull expired stock and fill the waiting bin. I didn't get to learn insurance but I got to practice non-sterile compounding for pediatric oncology with the pharmacist supervising me, so I got lucky. Its more business but more friendly than CVS."
good,"Personally, for my first ever job it really did help me learn the basics of working (especially during school) and helped me get out of my comfort zone a bit:) However, I did not like that the job was not fast-paced and was more of me just standing around waiting for customers."
good,Walgreens offers a great experience for those looking to manage and have flexible hours. The company has a great business model and is a sure to be a staple for years to come.
good,The hours and time need off was easy.  The managers worked with their staff to insure they needs were met.  I would highly recommend the company.  I made several friends there
good,"I learn how to stock, Being on register. Pretty good with people. I learn from everyone at work. The main I think bout Walgreen it taught me.  Organize product together"
good,You will love working there. Everyone is very cordial. You will meet many nice people who are genuinely interested in your happiness. I  would recommend working at this Walgreen's to anybody.
good,Love working at Walgreens. Fellow employees are really nice. Customers are regular customers that I now know on first name basis. Great benefits. Management tries to be very fair
good,"Depending on the position you take on, Walgreens is a wonderful company for a starter job. Slow paced and not too difficult, it's a great place to work after school or to supplement another part time job."
good,"Most days were slow and work was repetitive; stocking,  cleaning,  helping customers, that sort of thing.  My managers were awesome,  the culture was welcoming."
good,"Very fast paced, customer satisfaction is most important....always have a smile....Advancement is highly supported with the management and is also recommended by the management team."
good,"Management was very helpful, and willing to train everyone to do better.  Promotions were there if you wanted them.  And they were flexible with working availability."
good,Loved the pharmacy. It was fast pace and you could connect with your customers.  I was nice to have the days goby quickly with always something to do .
good,"great place to work. environment was great, people were great, pay was okay. loved going into work everyday. learned a lot from managers. they were very willing to help with what needed to get done"
good,"Overall, working at Walgreens was a good experience. Being a designated hitter, a typical day can range from filling prescriptions in the pharmacy to managing the photo department to waiting on customers at the cash register. The customers we had tended to vary depending on the demographic, but there were always good and bad apples. There was no Walgreens I worked at where there was not someone trying to steal. Management was good for the most part. Chemistry with some was better than others and the same could be said for coworkers. Helping customers to the point of satisfaction was easily the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Overall I enjoy this job but I do not plan to stay here forever its not what I personally what I want to do. I never want to be a manager, so I'm limited. If i wanted to be a manager it would be a good place to stay and advance but without moving up in the later the pay doesn't get better which makes it hard to stay."
good,This was a good job. I enjoyed working there. You always met new people. It got kind of taxing at Rome’s because as seasons change the merchandise changes as well. This called for a constant change of the store.
good,working at Walgreen you have to be able to multitask. Help the customers and stock the floors as well as fix the shelves and build up the new signs for the promotions or special they have that week.
good,"I worked for this company as a floating pharmacist; I had a great district manager who offered support. The pharmacists in some areas were not good team players; however, it is a great company which offers opportunities to their employees."
good,"Walgreens is a strong Fortune 500 company, but they continue to pay minimum wage, so finding productive and happy employees that stick around can be a challenge."
good,"A customer service specialist is a person who represents a company while communicating with its customers, whether face-to-face, over the telephone, over the Internet or through another method. Also referred to as a customer service representative, this person might perform a broad range of tasks to meet the need of the company's clients. For example, he or she might provide support for the company's products and services, take order requests, answer questions, resolve complaints or even make sales. Customers often view customer service representatives as the eyes, ears, faces and voices of the company."
good,"It was fairly easy, a lot of shop lifting and no lost prevention :( For being a drug store, we sometimes got some cool (Exclusive) toys in. It is retail so good customer service is essential."
good,"Good management, the Structured work environment that rewards employees for hard work. Good development opportunities as Walgreens takes pride in developing their team."
good,First real job experience and it was good. I did well and did what had to be done. Since I was an intern I didn’t do much besides stock and costumer service which I was great at.
good,"One of my favorite jobs. The management was one of the best I have ever had, I was just offered another job that was better for me so took it and left there instead."
good,"The job is good, very easy, good workplace team member and good managers. A good place to work if you attend college they’re work with your time you can work."
good,I was an extern as a pharmacy technician and the pace was really fast and served as an eye-opener. You will be required to multi-task quite often and be of great service and accuracy.
good,"The customers are the very key to a pleasant work place."
good,"Was a fun and enjoyable place to do my externship at, employees were very friendly and very helpful throughout my whole time there. I learned a lot and would go there again."
good,"A typical day at work was very stressful because of the daily projects that had to be done on top of keeping track of the daily tasks that had to be finished before closing the store, including the procedures for closing the store. The hardest part of the job was the management who did not work as hard as the employees. The most enjoyable parts of the job were meeting new customers and working with them, and being able to give everyone a smile."
good,Always had fun working there. Great opportunities to moves up. You are able to learn many different things as long as you are willing. Managers were always awesome
good,provide great customer service ask about things if  i didnt know how to do something and learn quick easy job overall I am a quick learner so the stuff i had to learn was not that dificult just never had do done before and they did well with training me I enjoyed helping customers find what they were looking for.
good,"Was a fast paced corporate environment.  I learned to manage my time along with corporate expectations and to delegate job priorities to employees.  Management was tough but fair.  The hardest part of the job was being a Pharmacy Technician and dealing with unhappy customers and keeping a smile on my face and putting one on theirs."
good,Walgreens was a great first job for me. I was able to get acquainted with the customer service industry and how to work with other people. Walgreens has many opportunities for advancement through out your career.
good,"Usually on weekends the job is slow pased, but on weekdays it’s quick pased. There’s a lot of customers acting for your help all at once but you have to be quick and have good customer service at the same time."
good,"Good company to work for. Always room for improvement, and opportunities to promote into leadership or Rx. Offers job stability, insurance, 401k, and PTO."
good,"Opportunity for growth available, fast-paced environment. Team was very productive and management very friendly. Learned team-work and better people skills"
good,WORKing here has been a good and challenging experience. i have been able to grow and acquire more technical knowledge.i have had lots of positive experiences working here.
good,Walgreens is a retail pharmacy that takes pride in caring for their customers.  I believe that the work environment requires someone who is fun yet focused at the same time. I have been with Walgreens for almost 10 years and hope to be here for 10 more.
good,"a typical day starts by setting up your department for the day if opening, or tagging in for the opener in your department to leave. The rest of the day is making sure your area is clean, stocked, and labeled properly. The customer is most important."
good,Working at walgreens outlines the basis of working in retail. The speed can fluctuate from slow to fast and vice versa. Most importantly the job is easy and also gives you experience for your next journey in life.
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for. It is a very fast paced and demanding position but it does keep you busy and the day go by quickly. They also have paid training which is very helpful.
good,"Good place to work, but Manager did not adhere to hours worked requests, agreed to at interview."
good,"Good company to work for, lot of opportunity to grow in the company; lot of benefits and you get employee discount. Full time and part time jobs avaialbel"
good,A typical day at work can be slow but when it's busy with many task to do I enjoy it the most. The environment is very good that I feel like a valuable member of a team.
good,It was nice working here because I realized that pharmacy wasn't for me. You gain experience and it helps you know whether or not you want to go into that profession.
good,A good place to work and I like that the local stores are all Frontier. This helps keep the team engaged and working at a higher level. Employees usually tend to last for years.
good,"Most days my job on the night shift was simple.  Get caught up "
good,I enjoyed the pharmacy team and work so much and wished they had a place for me after my internship but the company was not hiring. The management was great and the scheduling was perfect too.
good,Worked here for two years and had great experiences with all of my co workers and managment. A lot of co workers were 16 and got their first job there and have been there for years now.
good,"fast paced most of the time.  store conditions were just okay. management was good, sometimes support staff was hard to find, long hours and double drive thru can be challenging at times. Otherwise a good company to work for."
good,"it is a job, but the people you work there is pleasant.  Man i dont want to type anymore...only 98 more characters to go.........so you will see alot of periods..........."
good,"No over time..new equipment and will maintained .."
good,"I cashiered and customer service, stocked shelves, the manager I had was very young, my knowledge I had in retail and business intimidated her. We did not get alone well after we got to know each other."
good,"Honestly Walgreens was a great first job for me, my boss was the best. Always there when you needed something. The job isn't hard and you have opportunities to move up in positions."
good,"In any retail setting it can be great, hectic, and horrible; I love working in retail, after 35 years it says alot about me and a person to deal with customers. As with every job you have good days and bad, Walgreens is a good company to work for I have no real complaints about them as a whole."
good,"Before you apply they do drug test, But other than that its a chilled work place. you are talking to customers all day every day and doing truck. Replacing items on shelfs, its pretty simple."
good,"Being in a busy location your day went fast. Learning the different insurances for prescription coverage and the writing practices of the physicians in the area was a challenge, but fun for me. We had our regular customers on a weekly basis who you got to know and that was very enjoyable for me."
good,"it was fantastic work culture, i would like to work again in Walgreen if i get chance to work. colleagues were so nice and so much helpful and my pharmacist was so nice, I learnt a lot from him"
good,Great for people looking to start off at a good company. You meet new people everyday and handle lots of customer transactions. Lots of stocking inventory and printing if you are in the photo department. Also ordering the inventory to keep up with stock.
good,Walgreens taught me a lot about custoner service and handling difficult situations. It taught me about handling money as well as a team. This was one of my first jobs.
good,"A typical day at work (in the Cosmetics Dept) would be to come in and do a once over in the department to make sure shelves were straightened.  Make counter displays, fill empty spaces on shelves with inventory, dust, sweep, and check overstock and fill shelves. Check with management to find out the plans for the day.  And of course the customers came 1st.  I learned a lot about inventory management and ordering.  Management was always on hand to help and guide.  The hardest part of the job was when the trucks came in weekly with our new inventory.  The merchandise was in totes that could be 50 or 60#. They would be stacked 5 or 6 high and we would have to load them on carts, to be put away within the store.  Sometimes we would have to handle each tote 2 to 3 times each and in my department, we generally received around 60 totes.  This amount would be dependent on what holidays were going on.  Sometimes during Christmas, Easter, or Halloween, we received closer to 75 totes.  The best part of the job would have to be working with our customers and our co-workers.  Most were incredible people and I looked forward to seeing them, sometimes daily. I made many new friends from customers to co-workers."
good,"a typical day at work is busy, stressful but I have a good team to work with. My pharmacy manager is very nice, knowledgable and helpful. Everyone in my store is supportive especially during rush hours"
good,"The work here is easy and fun. I work in a nice area so there are no shady customers. The manager is nice and accommodating.  Overall, good work environment and a nice place to be."
good,"I really enjoyed working at the Walgreens in Tooele, IT. All of the staff have wonderful personalities and the work environment was always pleasant even at our busiest and at times it got beyond busy. I highly recommend working at this location. If we hadn't moved out of state I would have never left!"
good,"I worked at various Walgreens for about ten years as a Pharmacy Tech. I very much enjoyed my job, my co workers and the customers! The reason I left was to start my new career in Medical Billing/Coding."
good,start shift with every day routine staff was fun and knowledgeable customers were regulars and friendly work was steady but the breaks make it better not over whelming but kept me on my toes
good,Was very challenging and fast paced i stayed very busy and i loved it. i also have very good time managemrnt and customer service skills including office and computer
good,it was hard physically and mentally. some of the management will us you if you are hard worker. they will leave the store to smoke out side with other employee and leave you to do all the work by yourself.
good,Walgreens Customer Care Center is a great place to work. In my 8 years there I learned so much and was able to advance into a management role where I thrived. The benefits and pay (depending on role) are very competitive for the job market in the area. The work environment can be stressful and sometimes very chaotic but for the most part it is a job that has stepping stones for a career with such a large company with a rich history in customer service.
good,"Walgreen requires diverse knowledge. From pharmacy, photo, beauty and grocery it challenges employees to expand their flexibility to work between several departments."
good,"There is a strong sense of camaraderie and cooperation, as you are all behind one large counter working on a single workflow. Each day is different as there are multiple stations to occupy. "
good,A great place to start a career with plenty of room for advancement in a fun and cooperative atmosphere. It feels like you are part of a family that looks pit for each other
good,I worked in the pharmacy so we were always busy.  I learned a lot about pharmacy and drugs in general and some in business. The management was in a constant change in the store and pharmacy at the time so it was a little bit unsettling.  I also had some friends there.  Waiting on all our great customers were the best part of the job.  Love to see the regulars come in.
good,Walgreens is a decent place to find work for anyone.The work can be challenging but with a good team it can be easy. I enjoyed the time and experience.
good,productive work place great management customers were always fun to interact with always someone new to talk with help was provided when needed at all times
good,Walgreens was sometimes a challenging job but it was fun. Liked the responsibilities that came with the job and the work load. Always had good employees.
good,"I enjoyed working here. The employees were great, and the work was very fast-paced. I would recommend working here to anyone, and I would work here again in the future."
good,"I was with the company since I was 16. I enjoyed it, employees treated like a family as well as customers. Working with Walgreens gave me an opportunity of Customer Service experience and other opportunities if there is an opportunity. It is competitive when others are applying, but rewarding. Unfortunately, there is a limit of what they can give in advancement."
good,Fast pace.....can be fun.....learn alot. Great pay and vacation time. And great discounts ...and stock options.health insurance is good and reasonable
good,No growth advancement .low salary .benefits are too expensive. No bonus for hourly employees. No assigned sick days or personal days only pto depending on accrual rate.
good,"Considering I was a pharmacy technician I'm not entirely sure how the other departments worked but altogether it was a friendly environment. I started off as an intern through a program at school, and once I graduated high school and turned 18 they hired me in full time. Unfortunately, I had to leave because I started my freshman year of college, but if I could go back I would because it was a great experience."
good,i like it...I grew with the company very quickly and they notice a very good worker...i got promoted 3 or 4 times in my two years there...great company great benefits
good,I love to take good care of every single customer by creating them with a chear welcome to the store. it was a plasure to help them to found wath they were locking for
good,Be careful because you might be hired for one position but end up in another. They like to send their employees to the Pharmacy and make them work back there full time. If you are a Designated Hitter or a manager you have to help back there. But it is fun because it is something different. 
good,I think Walgreens is a great place to work. I never had a problem with keeping busy; there is always something to do and work on. Their benefits are nice as well.
good,"It is a fast pace job. There is a lot to do, and you will never be bored. I had a blast working here and was promoted just over a year working there and it was a blessing."
good,I work 40 hrs a week. I have friends and they make work great. I have learned a lot of different skills. I have work day and night shifts. I am on day shift now and like where I'm at.
good,This was my first job ever and I loved I was 16 and I felt I got paid a lot at least for the time I love all the people I worked with and for all around great job
good,"On an average work day you will stock and assist with the registers. I did learn how to manage inventory, my own department, and the managers there took their time to explain how 401K works as well as the shares."
good,i loved working here the clients and employees where like family. there where regulars that always came in and talked to us to make the days go by faster.
good,Productive and fun work place with growth opportunities and learning outcomes for those who are interested through the Walgreen's University. Lots of discounts for employees
good,"its retail, has all the benefits of a relaxed fun and ever changing environment, but it all depends on the people who work there and the amount of effort each person is willing to give to the job"
good,walgreens was a good company to work for it has great customers and employees. The benefits was great and the pay rate I would recommend people to work here.
good,"Great place to learn new traits, hands on, multi tasking is a plus. Many opportunities to advance and grow with the company. Many great coworkers, very competitive at times."
good,Working at Walgreen's is a open place for growth. management gives you room to get a feel on how do an task your self. Working at Walgreen's can get busy during rush hour and holiday seasons.
good,This place can be very fast paced as a manager.  You have to handle a lot of different problems and accomplish many tasks at the same time.  Time management is a must.  The culture is very engaging for the team members.  
good,Plenty of ways to move up in the store and company with enough hard work. Paid fairly well for what you do. A good starting pay. Friendly people to work with.
good,A typical day would start off slow and would increase each hour. The job is all about team work and getting your daily assignments done. A lot of opportunities to become part of management.
good,I was a highschool/College student working part time here. Really am not able to grade this. I did enjoy this job at the time. Only had to work once/month to stay on payroll.
good,"Fill prescription, immunizations , contact doctors and insurance  to get prior authorizations claims approve. Medication therapy management, audits from insurance companies and Board o Pharmacy, resolve charge backs claims from insurance. Properly training staff , shortage. Patients interactions, positive outcomes of treatment and patient satisfaction with the service."
good,"Good job, Its a career job so you can move with the the company. Management is pretty laid back. No cell phones at all will be fire. Good hours 40 a week."
good,it was a nice place to work . the people were friendly . the hours were good .it was clean place to work at. the day started by picking items for future orders to be shipped to the stores  once the items were pick you put them on a conveyer to the shipping doors.there was 25 shipping doors going to different locations on the east coast. i believe you learn to work as a team
good,"Love the people, environment and great managers. This place i enjoyed working at and never complained to get up in the morning to go. I especially enjoyed working in the pharmacy."
good,When working for this department everyone involved felt appreciated for the job that we were doing.  The employees felt working hard was the best way to complete all projects.
good,"Great job and made lots of memories.  The pharmacy was very intimidating at first as the location I worked at was very busy.  But once you get your feet wet and give yourself a chance to work every workstation in the pharmacy, you'll discover what your good at."
good,Walgreens has many perks for its employees. The stock options that they had for their managers and full-time employees was great. It is a good solid company. The worst thing was that they were open on all the holidays while the pharmacy was closed.
good,"The store stopped being 24 hours now, so we are all losing hours, which may mess with my insurance. I need my insurance. I cannot afford to go back onto the Obamacare."
good,"This is overall a great place to work. It can be very fast paced depending on location, but customer experiences are very rewarding. The company offers great benefits and competitive wages. They are big on cultural beliefs and present themselves as caring about their employees. Overall they take care of their people, but when it comes down to extended circumstances they drop the ball. If you're an average person with few surprises arising in your life you'll be safe!"
good,"Walgreens has been a place that allows and encourages employees to thrive and learn. There are those that choose only to cashier, and those who opt for more operational knowledge of the store, and both are equally respected and rewarded accordingly. The culture of the store is fairness and team work. The company is generous in their benefit selections to most all employees. I am quite content working for Walgreens as I intend to continue my employment while adding a second part-time job from home in order to supplement my income."
good,I would go into work and i would check the aisles and see if they were stocked. If they were i would make sure everything looks good and make sure everything is in the right place. If the aisles were not stocked i would go to the back unload pallets and stock the shelves. As well as cash customers out.
good,"Fast paced work envirnoment with a lot of support as far as co workers, help was always around if needed. Lunch breaks were issued and you were able to check hours on a daily."
good,"Working as a Senior Pharmacy Technician at Walgreens provided a great experience of leadership, great communication skills, and teamwork in every task they assign."
good,"It was a fast-paced environment where patients would come and go.  Everything was systematic, and there was a flow to follow in order to keep everything stable."
good,"Walgreens was a fairly easy-going workplace. You're encouraged to do always do better. Overall I was quite satisfied with my time working there. The only real gripe I'd have would be with the people I occasionally had to work with, but that will likely always be a problem for everyone. The management did their best to keep my work preferences in mind. I was however occasionally asked to do things outside of what was expected of me, although I ultimately got them done and learned new skills in the process. The culture was very friendly and we were encouraged to make friends of our coworkers."
good,Lots of opportunity to learn and grow with the career the person is building. Ability to work with other Walgreens buildings was nice as well; communicable. 
good,"busy busy place, haven't worked there in a while. most friends I know don't like it but no idea of what to tell you as a review as it's been 10 years since I worked there"
good,"innovative place in retail pharmacy, started as intern and worked as staff Pharmacist as well as Pharmacy Manager, after working for 10 years i have to move to other retail pharmacy. "
good,"innovative place in retail pharmacy, started as intern and worked as staff Pharmacist as well as Pharmacy Manager, after working for 10 years i have to move to other retail pharmacy. "
good,Good place to work. Flexible hours  Easy going lifestyle have to deal with all kinds of customers some are happy others are difficult. Most of the time the Manages are around
good,"A typical day at work included restocking some products and making sure all the deals for some products were up to date. Also, helping customers to the best of my ability when asked to."
good,"Typically work the front line at the register in the pharmacy.  Hectic but enjoyable.  Learn a lot about medications, interactions and overall health."
good,I was hired as seasonal help. I worked on the register also took orders in the photo dept. also helped out in the pharmacy. I also helped unload and put the freight up.
good,"This is a wonderful place to work the space, people, all great."
good,"during the time I worked at Walgreens I enjoyed it very much, the people there were friendly and courteous, however after falling in some spilled water on the floor I felt things changed for me there at Walgreens. I enjoyed the work that i was assigned to and did it to the best of my ability."
good,Everything about Pharmacy i learned here. 
good,"Lots of traveling, meet new different people, hardest part of the job different attitudes throughout the day. Most enjoyable part for me was learning new things"
good,"Not much to say about this experience. Working at cash registers, dealing with large amount of customers, You wear a uniform to work of usually khaki pants and the shirt they give you to start."
good,Indeed I making me review this. Its a good place to work and it was ok for the time being. I wasn't really planning to make it my career and got away from it eventually.
good,"Overall rating*"
good,"I really had fun working with the customer that came in and the staff. Most of the time I would be schedules from 1-6 but would ask to stay to closing time, just to be around my customer."
good,"Productive work place. Face pace, multi task work environment."
good,I loved walgreens for the first 8 years that i worked there but my health got to bad and then i started to hate it there. I was asked to leave the company because of my health reasons and my leak of attendants
good,Its was a great company to work for I did hard work and did my best its just that they had cut hours and it was hard to go from store to store to get hours because I was trying to get 40 hours and they cut me to 15 hours
good,Learned a lot in a short period of time because this was a very very busy store. I liked the fast paced nature but we were not always staffed properly. I enjoyed my time there.
good,"I loved working there, I loved being surrounded by people I know and new people I got to greet every time they would walk in the door way. stocking shelves was fun"
good,"Worked as a Cashier, Sales Associate, stocking shelves, running the whole store alone at times.  I would win selling more items than other employees.  I am very friendly and helpful with customers looking for items in store that they can not find.  I am great at being very accurate working the cash register and answering multiple phone lines at the same time.  Enjoyed my team members at Walgreens.  Management worked my hours so I could attend Virginia College. I was very good at what I did at work and I was very dependable and worked for others when needed."
good,Great experience working at Walgreens as a pharmacy technician. I learned a ton about medications and insurance. Loved working with my pharmacists. Great experience.
good,"At  walgreens  at typical day at work busy day, I learn about medicines, diferent culture, the hardest part of the jobs was only 20 minutes for break,"
good,I have never worked for Walgreens and have no information as to how things work.  One thing I can say about Walgreens is that their stores are always clean and the staff is friendly.
good,a very fast paced and professional setting. Staff were very helpful and courteous. I learned a lot. Customer service was awesome and i enjoyed the interactions.
good,"Overall an enjoyable area to work with a management team that cares about their employees, the customer base is also really easy to get along and interact with."
good,I've had the pleasure to work at two different stores with wonderful people and some customers as well. I truly wish I didn't have to leave either store but I've made friends for life.
good,It was a great first job. I made new friends and learned new things.  Gained great experience in the customer service field to take into new job sceneries.
good,"Unlike my review of BBW, Walgreens was more agreeable in terms of hours. If you're scheduled til 11pm, you leave at 11. The work isn't hard to do either."
good,When i work for this company it was a good experience to me ...I learn a lot about beauty department when i was work there...i receive a lot a good comment about my job...
good,My typical day at work over all is pretty good. When I get there I already have in mind what all I need to do before my shift ends. Great job to have.
good,Enjoyed working there. People were friendly no matter what store I worked at. Hated the closing shift. Getting off at 1030 or 11pm and having to be back at 730 was wearing on me.
good,"Ive been in retail for 17 years, ready to find a job with more stability. Never had a set schedule and retail sometimes can be more than a little overwhelming which I am okay with, I have been doing it for years."
good,its not a bad place to work for. hours are good. and pay is good. working in pharmacy is very stressful though. takes a lot of patience and intelligence to work back there.
good,I had an awesome shift being on thirds having eight days on and then six days off. It was a vacation every two weeks giving enough time to go do something.
good,Relaxed and fun environment. The mangement is fair and they make you feel comfortable. I think they should train peope on the register for a little longer than they do because even for someone like me with a lot of experience with a register it is a lot different then the normal.
good,Walgreen store closed an was relocated also bad district mangers dealing with all store issues with bad solutions. Needed more experiecned district mangers with more people to people skills
good,"Great place to work, customers are super cool and the discounts were unheard of . The management team were always available to answer questions and to help out"
good,"Management is excellent with working around your schedule, awesome team to work with, willing to answer any question, I learned a lot about insurance and medications, the evening shift is the most challenging due to after work rushes and people being in a hurry."
good,Overall its a good place to work if your don't like set schedules. Everyone is very helpful and nice. There is always room for growth and improvements.
good,"How well you like the work environment is based on the location of the store. I worked at a store that was very collaborative and encouraged growth, development and advancement in the company and all of my coworkers including myself was promoted within the company or had the opportunity to do so. Not all stores are like this, and it stems from management. Beauty Consultants are trained in all things skincare and are given a lot of tools to aid their job function. Providing great customer service is the priority and is very easy depending on the store's location and preparedness. It is great for someone that loves makeup, skincare, and helping others."
good,"Working at Walgreens was a fun environment. I ended up leaving for a job more focused in my degree. The management, for the most part, was caring and great to get along with. There was one bad manager who was the bad egg that spoiled the basket. It is just the way you perceive things. I would recommend Walgreens overall."
good,Work was quite stressful and sometime hectic. The health insurance was the greatest benefit. The workplace drama was the hardest part of the job. Upper management was better than Pharmacy manager.
good,It was long ago that I worked there but i really enjoyed it. That I can remember my manager was very profesional. Hardest part of it was inventory. Keeping everythind stocked and presentable was challenging.
good,Anyone can adapt there. Ther are flexible in hours and most managers will work with you and be willing to teach you new things but there are always exceptions.
good,Walgreens was a good company to work for. I don't agree with their method of choosing employees for promotions due to it simply based on interview skills and not job performance.
good,"Walgreens Pharmacy is a quick-paced environment to work at. You are always on your toes, learning on the run, and adapting to situations as the arise. This was an excellent experience to gain the skill on how to adapt to new situations."
good,"great work hours, just wish the pay could be higher, they have you learn more than your position but you don't get compensated for it. long hours standing on your feet. and when someone calls in your stranded at work."
good,"Meet a lot of new people "
good,"I was pushed to be my very best, always keeping the best interest of the customer in mind. I took approximately 50-100 calls per day. I loved my team and team lead."
good,We opened started seeing patient right away on some day more than others. Learn to do POC testing on patients and did some office duties. But enjoyed working with great staff.
good,Walgreens has opportunities for advancement and appreciates its employees. I had the experience of starting as an assistant manger and being trained up.to running my own store.
good,"You are always helping customers while at Walgreens. You learn great customer service skills!  Management at my store is great! The managers are like your friends and you can talk to them about anything.The culture at my store is the drive to make ever customer have a great experience in our store. The hardest part of the job would probably the people who do become upset with us. The most enjoyable part of my job is that even if I have a bad day, I have coworkers that care and know how it get me back on my feet."
good,"Good customer service means having thorough knowledge of your inventory, experience with your products, and being able to help customers make the best choices for them."
good,Overall the environment is relaxed and the employees are quite encouraging. They train you first and properly to ensure you are ready and fully competent for the job. If you need more time they will work with you. Material is given to ensure you have the information needed to advance to the next step. Truly a rewarding place.
good,"day to day work is pretty much routine work. sometimes it can be monotonous, however, its NOT a bad company to work for. would have stayed longer if I didn't go back to my old career"
good,"I loved working at Walgreens as a Shift Lead Manager. Working as a shift lead I was able to get my hands in a little bit of everything: being a cashier, assisting filling prescriptions in pharmacy, running a cash register, etc. Definitely a good, fast-paced environment for someone who is available for open scheduling."
good,It's a good place to work there because you'll learn on how to interact with customers. It's a balanced work where you don't become stressed out easily.
good,"Had a arrest time working here however getting hours was an issue but not a major one. Customer service skills are key in this work environment, and one has to be able to adapt to various situations"

good,I enjoyed my time a walgreens especially management.  They treated their employees great.  They made sure that  task and policies were clear.  Team members were awesome as well.
good,"I enjoy working for my company, I am able to make decisions without having to be micromanaged. I always have a positive outlook and find solutions for both our team members and our customers."
good,"schedules are flexible, pay is fair, managers are great. Can't complain. The hardest part is to learn the pharmacy software. It takes a while to learn and if you get hired during flu season be prepared to feel stressed and useless if you are new to the system."
good,Managed new software system to pool all customer data. Very good environment to work. Very quiet ambiance. Work hard - get promoted. Holiday celebrations. Good team.
good,"Very cool job. My manager had a lot of sales management exsperiece so he was a great coach. I learned so much about sales marketing, product placement and the beautiful craziness of Christmas in a sales environment.  This was a great job to start management training."
good,A very good environment. They are very willing to work with a collage students busy schedule. The managers are very friendly. Everyone does their part here. The customers are all laid back too. Options to become a pharmacy tech are available.
good,"I was a cashier who then learned Photo development and went on to stock. Friendly people, steady customer base (for the most part) and the pay was great for the work I was doing. It just isn't challenging work or even really engaging after a while. If you're in school or need a second job, consider Walgreens."
good,Walgreen's is a great place to start your employment experience. You deal with customers on a daily basis and learn how to use different equipment for the job. Which would come in handy for lots of future jobs.
good,I learned how to take into consideration Patients health issues by providing them with excellent customer service for their healthcare needs.I also learned how to become a excellent customer service provider by assisting the RPH in a professional environment

good,Walgreens was my first job and it started as a part time job. Advancements are abundant as long as you are ambitious.  The job fell short after stores were understaffed and the company started implementing projects that only lead the customer dissatisfaction.
good,End of the day became a bad day with the night manager always being on my case and making it hard to recover store I was always busy and enjoying answering the customers questions about cosmetics and face care products I learned that Walgreen is a fun place to work for the most part the management was not always easy to work with and not always polite to the employees the workplace culture was always be polite to every customer the hardest part of the job was dealing with the night manager and recovering the store at the end of the day the most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers and running the register
good,"Consisting of a crew whose not afraid to work hard, Walgreens Hilo is a fast paced and awesome place to work. Always something to do and never a dull moment, it gives an individual an opportunity to learn so much in retail and customer service. You learn to become quick in resolving issues and motivated to accomplish daily tasks."

good,"Good place to work for, depending on the location, there is always something to do. Good culture and lots to learn. Easy to thrive and work as a team. Good skill builder."
good,A typical day on the job entails speaking with customers regarding their orders.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to satisfy the customers.

good,"Working as a pharmacy technician trainee, the work in the pharmacy is very fast paced and the work done must be efficiently with no major errors or mistakes quickly. Working here for a year has helped a lot with my communicational skills, speaking with patients and health care providers, learning how to speak clearly to where the other person i am trying to explain or speak to understands what i am saying. Working here has also helped me learn how to deal with upset customers and what to say without angering them any more. it was a great learning experience despite how busy and stressful it could be."

good,Walgreens pharmacy is a good place for pharmacists to work.  It is very fast pace and pharmacists always have to be on the feet.  Customer relation is very important because it is retail pharmacy.
good,"Walgreens is a nice place to work if you're looking to get in a couple of hours. The work is not too aggravating or stressful, however if the staff is low on a certain day, you have duties pile up on you. Overall, nice place to work, especially for students."

I learned that working above and beyond can never hurt and has great benefits. Management were opened minded and had a open ears which made communicating easier. Workplace culture was acceptable. The hardest part of the job was working an ever changing schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was the compliments I got from management and other coworkers on my work.
good,"Good first time job, good benefits for employees who work over 30 hours. 24 hour stores are super busy. Hardest part is time management , having great customer service while still getting all your task done, it is do able."

good,"The typical day consists of duties tendered towards the customers. However, still leaving chances for advancement and educational experiences. The culture is almost the same at each store but the routines of activity are interchangeable depending at what location you are in. For my location, it is a fast paced store and there is always something to handle or do within the store. This helps you stay busy but also gives numerous opportunities to learn from different interactions and processes completed daily. With the company being focused on the core values it makes the job easier to deal with and work for the company. There is nothing that I have encountered that can be distinguished as ""hard"". Sometimes it may be characterized as challenging at points, however by working together the problem is always resolved in quick manner."
good,"I think throughout my years at this job, I grew and learned a lot of what it took and takes to be a good manager. It was really hard juggling work and home..I hardly saw my kids, which was so sad. I was able to give them the things they deserved, but at the cost of never seeing them. I can't really say nothing bad we were a work family and I grew to love each and every person I worked with."

good,I worked for Walgreens in the pharmacy department throughout my entire college career (2 bachelors degrees).  It was an awesome place to work while in school.
good,"Fast paced, and can be stressful. You have to learn to catch on to things quickly. This is a retail pharmacy so you have to deal with people on a daily basis. Some patients that come in are good, some are not so good to you. You just have to give them the best customer service you can."
good,"Good,"

good,"As with any retail job you're hours or schedule on weekends and Weekdays. For those a little older than 25 years of age, this routine can become quite monotonous. I have learned it in Walgreens everything is political. It takes time to move up the chain of command. The workplace culture is what you would expect. For a Corporation. The hardest part of job is the scheduling the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that in the day you will at least be off by nine or 10 o'clock o'clock most locations."

good,"I really dont have any complaints about them. Everyone was really nice and the store was well run. If i had to work at a retail pharmacy, id probably choose walgreens."
good,"I worked the overnight pharmacist position at a 24 hour location.  My work station was primarily at the out-window/in window position where I took in rxs, scanned rxs, and sold rxs.  When I did not have someone at the register I would fill/verify rxs at verification work station.  The majority of the time I had no support staff.  I would walk in at 9pm and the pharmacist and tech would walk out, leaving me alone for 10 hours most nights."

However, some of the managers with which I worked did not have the well-being of his employees in mind.  Most of the managers were fair in their dealings.

good,"I love working at Walgreens.  There is always something to do when I'm on the floor, from setting up displays to filling stock to correcting prices to waiting on customers.  The store is the right size to get around.  Management tries to work with you on scheduling the hours you want.  Our particular store manager is easy going and understanding of issues, within reason, of course.  At this job, I learned how to perform operations on the store Telxon, with which you scan tags or product for various information and to make price tags.  Also, using the program to make the tags.

good,"I loved the fast pace nature of work, the variety of daily duties, and I learned something new almost every day.  I took on a leadership role early on in this position and earned the respect of my technicians, fellow employees and managers quickly. I had great supportive staff and my manager was always very willing to listen to suggestions or creative ideas to improve training and workflow for all members of our pharmacy staff. I enjoyed the relationships built with the hospital staff and the integration of our work to provide exceptional patient care. I came to work with a smile every single day and made it a personal goal to be a positive member of our pharmacy and promote a team-building environment."
good,"great company to work for, great benefits, room for carrier advancement. great employees, great managers, great bosses. Transfer process is easy. team work is a must"
good,"Walgreens wasn't my favorite place to be, but it was always a clean and well organized environment(mainly because the employees kept it that way). You never realize how rude adults can be until you get into retail. Now I was merely a high shcooler doing a required internship for a course I wanted so desperately to pass with an A, which made everything worse. Not only was I not getting a paycheck, I had to deal with rude, frustrated people every single day I worked.I would just like to commend the employees and management of Walgreens for being so polite and understanding. I've learned that the customer is always right and that it is my job to make them feel understood and comfortable. Great job Walgreens!"
good,The pharmacy technician job here is excellent just too fast paced for me. My co-workers were friendly and respectful. I had fun when I went to work but it was also stressful as is any pharmacy job.
good,"Management was very easy to work with.  They taught me how to perform assignments with a friendly atmosphere.  I learned other responsibilities beside my ""hired"" position. I worked in different departments and was requested to help out whenever there was a situation."
good,"Overall its a really good place to work if you are a high school student, or even if you are in your first years of college. The management is extremely flexible with scheduling and the coworkers are very nice and friendly."
good,Helping customers pay for their items. I learned to be patient while working in a fast paced environment. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with a long line of customers on your own.
good,"I was usually always busy everyday I worked but on slow days with nothing to do, you can still always be productive like organizing or stocking. Our shift leads were always cool. Working during any major holiday is always fun but very busy."
good,It's not for everyone because the company is looking for quick learners/ self starters and a lot to pick up on.  However; even at the entry level positions I managed to support a family of five. It's hard work but gainful employment and experience.
good,"- day was routine work completed daily"
good,"good place to work at"
good,Walgreens was/is a good place to work. I just found a higher paying job that didn't require me to relocate to get to the pay that I am currently at with the company I currently work for. I had opportunity to learn and was successfully mentored in many job positions and aspects of the retail/pharmacy this industry represents.
good,Working for Walgreens gave me an opportunity to grow and expand my knowledge in the work field. I was able to move up to a shift lead in a few months.
good,"Had certain days off and the times you liked. Busy doing something all day long. Great with customers, helping them find what they were looking for. Worked great with other employees."
good,"This is a fun place to work, and while every job has its stresses, you leave at the end of your shift without a care in the world. It can get a little boring, so sometimes you need to get yourself through it. The more you work, the more time off you earn. "
good,"10 hour work day"
good,I've worked for Walgreens for over 3 years. Walgreens is a great company to work for. The employees are always aware of how inportant we are to our compny. If we have any problems all we have to do is voice our concerns and they are eunderstood. I am very greatful to have worked for such a wonderful company.
good,Management was ok to work with but it was a dreary workplace kind of...people just wanted to come to work and just finish there 8 hours and go home!i overall it was an o.k place to work!!!
good,"I have enjoyed working for Walgreens. The company offer great benefits also provide the ability to grow within the company. "
good,Overall a great place to work with a lot of opportunity for growth in the company. I work with a great group of employees that are highly engaged making the customer experience one to remember.
good,all the pharmacists and pharm techs were super nice and taught me as many as possible. I liked the atmosphere that they worked so hard  and being nice each other.
good,It is a great place to gain expertise in retail sector. People are very good and helpful. I liked working there and I loved my team. Some times we need to extend ourselves to complete the work.
good,"I love working with Walgreens.  The pay is great, and they offer benefits for full-time employees.  There is never a boring moment, as each position is given multiple tasks throughout the shift to complete.  Management is more than happy to help the employees grow and become better.  All of my coworkers are helpful and work as a team, and are incredibly friendly."
good,"everyone here was always friendly, helping each other out.  it was a juggle with the shifts but we always figured it out. I enjoyed it here but things could always be better"
good,"Very stressful place to work.  They are constantly adding more work to be done and cutting back to hours for help.  Good computer system.  All day patient interactions through taking scripts, inputting patient information, and selling finished medications.  Constant changing of management and positions. Hardest part is working short handed and being on your feet all day."
good,"Liked working with the team. Always was helped with any question or problems I had. The managers were very kind and always kept the team laughing, I became good friends and still have lasting friendships even after no longer working there."
good,This place is a good place to work at if you are in school or a part time job. It is not a career lifestyle and is hard to work your way up in the company.
good,"In charge of the day to day operations for the front end, pharmacy and clinic. Very stressful environment but the pay was very good. They also have a good retirement program."
good,"The Walgreen's in Del City was great. The mangers and team leads were really nice. They were very fair about scheduling, and they never had to call other employees in because everyone showed up on time, and got their job done."
good,"Walgreen's is a fast pace job. I enjoyed interacting with the customers. You would see them so often you would remember their names and they would remember yours. That was my favorite, part the customers."
good,"1. Performed patient assessment "
good,Dealing with customers and handling their needs. I learned how to maximize my time during each shift.  The culture of the workplace was satisfying each customers needs.
good,"great place to work, I've learned a lot of things working here. I've been taught cash handling skills, ordering , micro management and pharmacy skills. Great place to work and grow."
good,Very competitive. Excellent growth opportunities. They have locations all over. They also have a Certification class that provided all the information you need to pass the state certification test
good,"A great atmosphere for any pharmacist that is willing to work retail. Daily patient interactions via patient counseling, immunization, and medication therapy management services. Have to be quick on your feet with discernments because it can get busy in certain stores, and as a pharmacist there are people relying on your decisive judgments such as pharmacy interns, and pharmacy technicians, and patients."
good,"Working for one of the busiest Walgreens and the 1hr photo can keep you busy the entire shift. Fun with a good pace balance between taking an order, customer service, developing, printing, refill ink cartridge and facing the department."
good,"I took orders for film developing.  I then had to process negatives and print photos.  This also included changing the photos paper to different sizes.  I worked with an older machine that would break down easily.  Our repair team started teaching me how to fix basic problems, which I loved.  On down times, we called customers to remind them to pick up their photo orders.  I handled customer complaints and for the most part was able to fix the problem to their satisfaction.  The hardest part was cleaning the machine and handling the chemicals.  It was a tight area to get to and you have to be extremely careful.  I developed many friendships with my regular customers and they loved when I had their orders ready as they approached my counter."
good,"Reasonable place to work, monotonous cafeteria food.  I worked through a system house so was insulated from the politics."
good,i havent worked there in a long time but it was great when i was there. i was there as a teenager in school and moved on when i finished college. i dont hear much of what is going on there now
good,"A typical day at walgreens is usually helping customers/ sales"
good,"A typical day at walgreens is usually helping customers/ sales"
good,"no breaks, no hour lunch, boss sometimes bought employee lunch, okay schedules, sometimes.  Pay was not good for doing what you do and I did not like working up front, preferred working on floor, stocking, changing prices, helping customers.  Employees were fun to work with and we could all get along well.  We all helped each other out as a team."
good,"Walgreens was a fun place to work at , managers were splendid and enjoyable to work with. They solve any problem you had at the moment , customers were great to interact with , and selling beauty products came with commission."
good,Walgreens have a good relationship with employers they provide excellent training for externship and give a lot opportunities to new employers the pharmacist  are very respectful
good,"This position was very demanding but also limited. Some days get really busy and considering i worked in a smaller pharmacy, there weren't many technicians available to work. The hardest part of the job was trying to engage with the elderly and understand their needs. I learned to be more patient and proactive. With all the time i spent in this pharmacy, i learned more about the medical field and and stress the medical professionals undergo trying to save lives."
good,"Great place to work overall"
good,This job is a pretty routine job. You will typically handle the same type of situations involving patients and their medications. Faster paced because of drive through but not insanely paced.
good,"My typical day consisted of stocking shelves, helping customers, and pushing sales in the beauty department. Walgreens could be very laid back and very stressful at different times depending on what inspections were required and how soon."
good,My experience at Walgreens was awesome. Leadership tought me how to do the things that needed to be done that I didn't know how they needed to be done. I was promoted within 6 months of working there. The work is simple and was very enjoyable as long as you work great with others.
good,"This company worries more about making their share and not to much on their employers. Starting pay is not very good, you do have the opportunity for advancement but the increase of pay doesn't seem much for all the responsibilities you take on. Shift hours change every week."
good,"Great opportunities to move up in the company, you'll find a great manager every now and again who encourages and pushes you to do just that. On the other hand some do not"
good,"I learned a lot working here and enjoyed being part of a great team. A typical day as an ASM involved communicating tasks and information, one-on-one training, supporting team members with tasks, assisting the pharmacy, and performance management."
good,"My Walgreens has a Great group of workers. I enjoy working with everyone there. The management is absolutely amazing. They aren't just strictly about work. They care about you outside of work and like to build a good relationship with you. They make things fun with activities and are totally understanding. If something were wrong, they really encourage us to talk to them and they will fix it right away."
good,I have obtained many skills and knowledge that I have been able to reflect/ relate to my own personal life.  Walgreens has always been a great place to work at and can teach people different points of views in the retail industry.  I love my job because I am able to fully communicate with other employees and customers to the level of being comfortable with each other.
good,coworkers were great management was very helpful workplace culture was awesome was able to have a flexible schedule that worked around going to school
good,Stocking shelves.  Typical day was usually the same. the hours were flexible which was great for a college student.   The management was ok alot of rules.
good,I completed my externship while going to school to be a pharmacy technician. I was a great experience. The team made sure to help me 100% while filling prescriptions while I was still learning.
good,"Good place to work ,the people very friendly,diferents culture, ,favoritism the hardest part when I worked  there was  that you have to fix 16 lasers gun during your shift otherwise you go out,"
good,"Great place to work, Management allows the individual to work and do their job. Great department meetings. Fun helpful co-works full of knowledge. M-F 8-5. On call during the evening and holidays."
good,"I never had a problem with working for them. It a great working environment with a lot of friendly people. Their always going be those customer that give you a hard time ,but just smile and killed them with kindness the most enjoyable part of the day were the customers and the most hardest part of the day are the customers"
good,Never had much grief good company  to work for. Would go back in a heartbeat. Management is professional and genuinely care about and stand behind their employees.
good,"Company treats employees well. Offers decent pay, good benefits and you accumulate time off. Very accommodating to my school schedule. Great employees, upbeat place to work."
good,"Dealing with cosmetics and customers was fun! I enjoyed the work environment, room for promotion, and scheduling. The manager was awesome and I hope that it is still the same as it was when I worked there."
good,"This place has to be my favorite retail experience. Management was great, customers were friendly, and you're allowed to be yourself, which is something a lot of employers try to cover up. I was allowed to joke with and get along with the vast majority of my customers, and most the regulars were the same way. Management worked with me on my schedule, and the pay was decent. Overall, great workplace."
good,walgreens is a great place to work. You will work hard but you will learn a lot in the process. Hours are okay. workplace culture is good. Nothing hard about job.
good,Overall a very good place to get your foot in the door for retail experience. Work very well with personal needs and try to accommodate them if possible.
good,Flexible hours fun place to work   Want you to do the work of two or three people can't be late stupid rules and policies I don't know what else to sat
good,"Walgreens helped me to give back in so many ways. I was able to help elders who needed help find products, and doing that made me happy every time and pushed me to do more."
good,"I enjoyed working for this company and would go back if a pharmacy technician job came available. Management was nice and friendly, and I enjoyed working with my co-workers."
good,"I liked working for Walgreens. They gave me adequate training. I only worked part-time, so I didn't have their benefits. But they were very willing to work with my school schedule each semester. If there weren't any customers, then there was always something else to do. I worked checkout and faced the merchandise in the front of the store, covered for the photo department and at times, helped with unloading the truck. I also stocked merchandise, emptied trashes, swept floor at end of night. Management was very nice and we had fun at times too. Hardest part of job was when it was constantly busy. I had to find a way to still get my facing and any other tasks completed in a timely manner even when I had lines of customers. Most enjoyable was when we received a truck of merchandise and were stocking the store. We would laugh and joke around and talk, all while getting our work done."
good,"Walgreen is a great place to advance in all angles of life, weather you want to be a cashier handle photos or work in beauty its defiantly a great place to work"
good,Walgreens was a very fast paced work environment. I learned a lot working at Walgreens. Walgreen's is a great place to work for. They are a very understanding company.
good,The management were always on top of things. Everything that needed to be done would always be accomplished in an efficient and timely matter. Each employee knew there responsibilities for the day/week and were always able to finish them.
good,"My typical day at work includes printing photos, ringing up customers, answering calls, counting drawers, cleaning and organizing, assisting with pharmacy duties when necessary. "
good,"This is a great company that has been around for a long time! Long hours and late night, but without them I wouldn't be where I am today! Discounts are a plus!"
good,"Great company with multiple programs to assist employees with education and advancement. Variable work hours, excellent insurance options,and extensive benefits package."
good,Great place to work. Easy advancement and great benefits. The culture is excellent. Walgreen's motto is One Team One Dream and helps deliver positive communication between employees.
good,"its a typical workplace, if you do what you need to do, you wont lose your job. the job roles are fairly easy, you get on the job training and your supervisors are typically well informed of the job roles that they need to teach you. If you want to advance in the company, you HAVE to speak up and show hard work and discipline in the workplace. Walgreens can be turned into a lifelong careers."
good,The Company is great to work for they will work with a school schedule if you have one. The have good benefits. Nice company to work for. The hardest part of my job was unloading truck when they came.
good,"The Usual day working at Walgreens seems to be decently relaxing due to the flow or customers and the ""regulars"" that come to visit us almost every day to every other day. But when inventory days come, stress levels of everyone begin to rise as everyone who should do their fair share of the job does not. Eventually the stock with be put on shelves and the hard times will pass. One of the main reasons why i work at Walgreens is definitely because of the family aspect that the employees and employers carry with everyone who works there. Depending on who is working, most of the time work is a very enjoyable place to be, since most employees get along with each other very well, and unfortunately sometimes not."
good,Working in a high stress high volume setting has prepared me for any task ahead. Stress levels and work environment provide a challenge to succeed and to preform at peak levels.
good,It might be a productive workplace but it does not values the worker's hard job sometimes. It's all about preferences. The workplace culture is good but could be better.
good,Faramacia Walgreens en new jersey una de las mejores farmacia en la que e trabajado. Excelentes compañeros de trabajo y su ambiente para mi fue muy agradable.
good,At Walgreens you have to be fast and flexible. You have to be able to multi task and learn quickly. I learned that there will be times where you will get frustrated but you can't let that show. The hardest part of the job would be the rude customers with all the coupons.
good,I enjoy the work load and the management. They work environment is easy going and satisfying. I have learned various departments and job responsibilities.
good,This is a good place to work in most locations. In the area in which I worked in the pharmacy there was a large volume of customers due to the pharmacy being located in a college town which is in a rural area.
good,"Walking into work here was always nice because I always knew what to expect. Management kept us informed well. I really did have what you've heard referred to as a ""work family"" here. Lovely people who always help each other out. Competitive profit sharing plans and health benefits with reasonably flexible scheduling. Felt a little under staffed at times especially during days we got deliveries, but it was manageable. Customers were loyal and we got to know them as well as we did each other."
good,"Its a great place to work , all of the employers there do their job "
good,This store is extremely busy constantly and it was great to be constantly moving. I learned something new everyday. typical days at work were always fast paced and overwhelming in a good way. The hardest part of any job is when someone calls in because the store was so busy that missing just one person made the day even more busy but we all worked together and finished the job at the end of the day. I also became close with the patients and was able to help anyone with any individual needs.
good,Decent work environment most customers are nice understanding manager not an easy job especially if you're a manager some customers will be difficult at times
good,"I love the Walgreens company, there is always room to grow and be better, every day is different than the last and is always very fun. The new Walgreens buyout made things very different than before and now its not about managements telling employees what to do but the bottom finding actual solutions to problems."
good,"Very organized and was able to learn new skills in the medical field."
good,"Everyone who is apart of the Walgreens team interact like family. Everyone knows each other on a personal level, and we all have become close friends. The work load is simple and easy to handle, and the management is very accommodating to everyones needs."
good,"learned a lot from dealing with costumers and handling cash."
good,"My time at Walgreens has been pleasant.  It is a great place to work, and allows individuals to move up quickly.  The staff and upper management are helpful, and trying working together to assist in reaching our goals.  Ive been at Walgreens since 2014, and have enjoyed my time there. We really do live by our motto, "" At the Corner of Happy and Healthy"".  The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers.  Interacting with the customers, and making them feel important, and special is our main goal.  Assisting with whatever is needed, or wanted is our goal.  The hardest part of the job is satisfying everyone.  Sometimes everyone is not going to be happy, or satisfied with your service. As long as you do your best to help, that is all that matters."
good,A job that requires lots of communication between co-workers and customers. Will have to deal with multiple responsibilities at once regardless of your position.
good,"Although it was a very busy store , it was very rewarding and the staff always tried not only to give great customer service , but help each other as well"
good,A place where helping patients is the focus. Rewarding to help patients that need help understanding information about insurance and medications. Management focused on improving the patients experience within the pharmacy. Learning different uses of medications and information about insurance.
good,"At Walgreens, the standard is clear. Make the customers happy and work efficiently. The management is effective and there are opportunities available to rank up."
good,Working there was the best place to start off and when i entered as a working  student I only had 100 hours and though the hours that i did everyone was respectful  and helpful
good,great place to work at it help me be organized it showed me work to work on a team it open my life to new opatuness help meet new people how to speck to certain people
good,I have no regrets or concerns with my career with Walgreens. I was able to move across country in the same position I started in South Florida. Met my best friend in my life through there along with working with my wife.
good,"Helped customers before anything, printed photos, reset merchandise on shelves, rang up customers at the front register, took in warehouse shipments, and other miscellaneous tasks."
good,Challenging in all areas good managers. I learned alot supervising getting things done in a timely manner. Supervised mutiable departments with a team 15 up 25 team members
good,Nice co-workers and managers. Good work environment. High rates expected. Must work nights and holidays. Friendly work environment. Dealing with angry customers can be stressful.
good,"My night started at 10 p.m. and ended at 8 a.m. I would get there and get the updates from the manager that was about to get off. I was in charge of three employees at night, a front cashier, a person who processed pictures and a pharmacist.  My job was to balance the books at midnight and make sure the shelves were stocked and the store was swept and mopped every night. I learned how to do the books and manage a store as well as work in the pharmacy. The hardest part of the job was dealing with problems that occurred during the day. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with."
good,"Don't really have much to say about working at Walgreen's. We have our good days and bad days. Great coworkers, great customers. All in all a great place to work."
good,I like the patient but some of them can be very rude. I anticipate to go to work each time because the work in itself is not difficult. the counting of pills and the settling of insurances adjudication
good,sweep and mop store before opens up get cash registers ready and prepared to start the day .. my managers were awesome by the way. the hardest part of the job is when that rush hour hits and you may have to be working the cash register an d stocking plus you jus may have to pick up that spill on isle 3
good,I've worked for Walgreens almost four years I've enjoyed my time there and I love the benefits. If your looking for a place to grow and learn Walgreens is the place for you
good,"I actually like it because I like the people I work with. Not really fond of the opportunities for advancement that are instilled, because there really isn't many."
good,I was on medical leave for 5 months and the store management was very kind as to doing paperwork and giving me what I needed to help maintain my employment while out.
good,"Company does a lot to advance employees, but some store managers can hinder your growth and evelopment. There is not enough support from the corporate office in holding store managers accountable for their failures at developing and retaining the talent."
good,"Some managers/employees can make it nice and others can crush your happiness. But if you have a positive attitude and work hard it will make an impact on everyone around you for the better. Ask questions! Get involved! And most of all, smile and have some fun."
good,high volume pharmacy with little help . work load is not always evenly distributed and some senior technician do not help or do duties their job title requires them to . management wont do anything about these issues either .
good,"A typical work day is routine maintenance."
good,"Heavy phone lines, very busy drive-thru, extremely  fast paced, but your day goes by very fast."
good,"You'll always be busy. It is a very easy going job, as long as you enjoy having constant work being thrown at you. I would've continued working here if personal issues didn't get in the way."
good,"Busy but manageable,  seeing a wide variety of both walk in and scheduled appointments. The hardest part is managing the waiting area, some walk in patients would get mad because scheduled patients will get seen first. They have a great management team and if there are computer problems the IT team is always available to fix problems along with wonderful co workers."
good,Overall the environment was great. My coworkers were very helpful and great to work with. My team always put the customers first and we all went out of our way to make sure our store was in exceptional condition and put much effort into making sure each customer had a great experience.
good,"While working at Walgreen's I found that the people working there were usually nice and approachable even if you have transferred from another store like I had. The work it self is can be monotonous since the job requires me to be on my feet for at least eight hours and require me to either restock shelves or stand for long periods behind a register. The main sources variety for each shift are the interaction between me and the customers, and the chats between co-works and managers.Please note, at the time of this review I am at an entry level position for the company and I do not view my stay there as a definite career path."
good,"Co-workers are very friendly, this place is usually busy. They do push a little to get tasks done. But overall this is a nice work environment, management is very understanding."
good,"I loved working in the beauty department I was able to see a lot of new products before anyone else did. I met a lot of my sales goals and even made it into the top 10% of my district one time."
good,I really enjoyed working for Walgreens until the end it was unfair on how they let me go from my job. I feel that they should go across the board with the same punishment to everyone not just selected some employees.
good,Walgreens offers a great place to work and build upon a career in the retail field. they offer competitive wages and allows for employees to grow in all departments
good,I learned a lot about management. I was able to learn about working in stores and the daily tasks that a manager would do. I also go to learn about merchandising.
good,"Enjoyable work environment, but can be very fast paced. Be able to make decisions on your own and not have to rely on co workers. Competitive pay for the area as well."
good,great job great benefits a nice clean work place management was good maybe wish i was still a employer of this company great pay fast paced friendly co workers
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced at my location but its good, it keeps you on your toes. I've learned many things from interacting with patients to a productive work ethic. meeting wants and needs from managers and customers."
good,"Walgreens is a productive and fun, yet serious workplace. The managers are all very nice and welcoming, as well as the staff. If someone has any questions about a task at hand, there is always a co worker offering to be of assistance. A typical day at Walgreens starts with a list of notes which needs to be completed in a timely manner, considering the fact you're only there for 8 hours of the day. While completing the notes, you are also required to assist customers finding items and check them out."
good,This is a very fast paced multi-cultural job that I enjoy. It can be stressful with the language barrier but it will help you to help others in your community and allows you to work with different people.
good,"My job in Walgreen is check-out. Working there gives me a good chance to touch a base with the local community in Kalamazoo, and also it is a great chance to develop my English. Most of the customers are super nice, supportive, Just show them a real smile and they will response in a better one. The only two things I don't like about working there is the long shift, 9.5 hours, and the low pay, 9.00 dollars per hour, other than this, things are great."
good,i did not work here long enough to reall have any input on the job. i was young and it was a paycheck. the pay wasnt very good but if you stick around and want to move up you can.
good,"stayed up front at the cash register and helped customers find what they needed. If I was placed on the floor, I would stock the shelves and do the truck."
good,Walgreens is a very good company and offers a lot of benefits and opportunities for its employees. Teamwork is key. If you stay with it Walgreens offers promotions and job opportunities.
good,"It is a good place to work, with flexible hours. Working here as a student has helped me further my education, knowing I have job security............"
good,I liked working overnight here because you work 7 days on and 7 days off. It's a little weird to adjust to at first but it worked well for me. Super easy job
good,"The job was enjoyable and easy-going. As a customer service representative, I was the first face to greet customers. The only hard part was dealing with management."
good,"The pace was slow, so it helped when I was exhausted from work. However, I would be left alone for some time while everyone else was who knows where. However, the store manager is great and really work with you. The employees are all friendly and inviting for the most part. There are two that like drama and to cause problems. There is technically always work to do but sometimes you aren't given the task until like mid-shift or even late shift. Couponers are the worst experience here."
good,"A typical day at work requires a pharmacy technician to handle inventory when the medications are shipped to the pharmacy. We must organize the medications, fill and sell prescriptions. We must also take medications over the phone and via fax."
good,Walgreen's was a good place to work at. The co-workers were very friendly and helpful. And along with that management set goals for its employees that they encouraged and knew the employees could achieve. The pay was just over minimum wage when I was working. Which was a down side but they did give there employees good hours.
good,"I enjoyed my experience and although it was a very long time ago, I pretty much enjoyed each location equally. They trained and paid for me to take the PTCB national test which was awesome."
good,This is my first job and it has teach me patience and respect and it has made in to more of an open person. Walgreens mangement is very in to their employees life and try to work around everyones hetic work schedule.
good,Walgreens is a fast paced productive retail environment. Good place to start if you wan to build a career in a retail environment. It's a fun fast paced work place.
good,Good people to work for but upper management likes to change things constantly. One week things are fine the next week there is an issue with things they agreed to and told you.
good,walgreens is a great place to work. the environment was the best friendly place to be a sfl which is a shift leader. I had opportunities to give my best customer service ever
good,I enjoy working for the company. Management needs a little work. I don't feel like a family. I feel like a worker. Hours were cut short and I have not had a chance to improve within the company. They is very little contact with upper management and never come around. Stores are consistent with policies and training method was terrible.
good,A Typical day at work i service the Walgreen healthcare clinics located within Walgreen stores. I help Nurse practitioners with there PC's and any other hardware/software problem they have to help them better service the patients they are seeing. I've learned people skills and how to deal with different personalities over the years and what i can and cannot say to different people. The direct management at the Walgreen's Service Desk is great always working with you and never against you.  The culture is very diverse within the service desk.The hardest part of my job is trying to get an overly frustrated customer to try and troubleshoot. The most enjoyable part of my job are the people i work with everyday and the friendships that I've formed while working here.
good,My time at Walgreens has had its ups and downs but overall Walgreens figures out ways to weed out the bad aspects of it. I worked with many great managers who are very helpful but then there are a few which were not to par but I worked around it.

good,"Walgreen is a great place to work. Its fast paced, never barring. I would recommencement Walgreen to anyone who is looking to work hard and move up in the company."
good,Stressful job at times due to the fact that you are almost always short handed and the work just seems to increase the longer you work at the company. More responsibilities with the same pay/incentive to increase production.
good,"Overall, I think Walgreens is a great company & I met some awesome people while there. I did not get to enjoy some of the benefits due to being only part time. I loved being a Beauty Advisor"
good,Worked with you when you had family issues to attend to.Gave you the ability to work on your own without having management over your shoulder at all times.
good,Started at Walgreen in high school.  I worked here for two years and enjoyed every moment of it. The superiors was friendly and  the atmosphere was great. Here i learned the importance of how deal with people and solve problems.
good,"They were a very welcoming staff, I was given little gifts when I first arrived. It's very family oriented, although it  sometimes is challenging because of how hard the higher ups are on us but even then we worked together to get the task done and inprove as a store."
good,"a typical day in the pharmacy consist of greeting patients, taking their prescriptions, selling prescriptions, updating their new info. restocking the shelf when the shipment of drugs come in throughout the week. "

Responsibilities such as filling medications, answering calls, checking in vendors, answering customers questions, and typing prescriptions are all part of the daily routine. It is a fast paced job never the less, it is a job you can enjoy and learn from. Learning about new medications and what they are used for would have to be the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of this job would have to be the lines we have constantly especially during season. Lines are non stop, customers in pain and needing their medications right away with 150 labels printed on the counter needing to be filled."
good,My experience at walgreens was amazing. Very fun and out going people. I'm also a people person so it was very easy for me to get along with others. The managers were very helpful to me explaining my job description and it felt like my second home.
good,"My Walgreens experience was that of a basic retail job: assisting customers, running a cash register, stocking shelves. There was both a necessity to work well with others, but also to be independent. The hardest part of the job was being on your feet constantly, as well as some bending and lifting. It could also get very busy in the tourist environment and good money management was a must.  I always felt supported and valued by the various levels of management. Each store contained about a dozen employees at a time, and everyone knew each other rather well. I was rewarded over the years for my hard work, both with special opportunities and pay raises. The company was very good to me, transferring me to different stores as my life situation warranted it. I would definitely recommend Walgreens for a basic retail job experience"

good,"Taught me everything i need to know as a pharmacy technician, overall great place to work, and awesome staff. Managers are friendly and great benefits"
good,Total turn over in staffing as of late.  Meaning that I can not truly rate the experience there for the short time that the change in management and staff for the short period.  Work place changed and it would not be fair for me to rate them at this stage.
good,"I worked in different areas of the store, but I mostly enjoyed working in the photo department. The hardest part of the job was not having merchandise for the customers when they needed it. I also enjoyed engaging with the customers."
good,"I worked as a Temp which was provided through my high school. I performed various things such as assisted customers in finding products, answered questions, and ensured all shelves were properly stocked and front faced.

good,"My typical day consists of monitoring drug and health condition interactions, consulting patients on prescriptions and OTC questions, checking in on patient adherence, and addressing third party issues.  I have learned how to properly balance doing more than one task at a time, and time management.  I have also learned how to oversee employees.  The hardest part of my job would definitely be my schedule.  I work every other weekend, and rotate through all holidays.  The most enjoyable part of my job would be seeing patients succeed and  get results with medication management."
good,"I greeted customers, I rang up there items, I stocked up the shelves, and made sure all the customers were happy and healthy. I helped open up the store and close the store. I made sure the customers knew about the sales that were happening."

good,This was my starting point and it was a great one. Without walgreens I wouldn't be so far in my career as I am. It was a great place to learn and begin something new.
good,Managing a Retail store is an experience I'll keep with me. Learned over 29yrs how to merchandise products and developed great customer service skills
good,"Retail at Walgreens is high energy and fast paced. The job keeps you on your toes. Your consultation skills are used on all levels, from just a recommendation for cough and cold to serious issues with all types of diseases states. Walgreens trains all Rph to become immunizers, therefore, you get to know your patients on a more personal level. You also utilize your clinical skills with medication therapy management. I would say the hardest part is being able to abruptly shift pace based on the demands of the day. The most enjoyable part about working in retail, is that you, the Rph,  are captain of the ship for your shift and if you have a strong team who gives it there all, you can do it all."
good,"It is a rewarding job, and will help you grow in life. The work environment is good and your co workers are like family, it feels good to be able to go to work."

good,I've had a very pleasant time working there. They help you build up and they help you just further your goals. I really enjoyed working there. I greatly appreciate everything the Walgreens company did for me
good,"Walgreens being a giant pharmacy corporation means there is little involvement of your superiors in your work environment. you are a number and the management team treats you as one. the health benefits and 401k were average, the hours were flexible but nights, weekends, and holidays are required."
good,Working at this company during my summer internship gave me experience in the retail management I was looking for. And when I left I was offer a fulltime Management Position. This was a job that I really enjoyed doing.
good,"•	Prepares prescriptions for dispensing by the pharmacist by retrieving, counting, pouring, weighing, and at times mixing medication "

good,Customer service and cashier is a must at Walgreens.  Customers are first and foremost. Printing photos can be fun sometimes and very important due to the fact that the photos belong to customers and you want to keep them happy.
good,i would come into work sometimes they would have me as a cashier or stocking shelves and the manager was a nice man.  The hardest part of the job is when you help a customer and we didn't have what the customer wanted and seeing them go away unhappy and also when you are trying to complete a task that your boss asked you to finish before you leave work and co-worker asked you to help them and you have to say no because your boss gave you a task to finish before you leave work today... The most enjoyable thing about this job always trying to make a customer happy
good,Very busy hours working for Walgreens. There is never a dull moment and always something to do. Walgreen is a great place to grow and build a career
good,I loved working at walgreens before I transferred to a new location. The first one i worked at held us at a high standard but they also rewarded our hardwork with praise and acknowledgment. The second location didn't care about stores appearance or the employees.

good,Walgreens gave me a great experience on the fundamentals of management. I was able to use what I learned in business school and apply it to the day to day challenges of my workplace. I was able to delagate and get tasks done in a timely manner. I handled and managed the cash reports daily. I worked as a part time pharmacy tech.
good,"At first it was difficult because whenever someone asked me where an item was, I would not be able to help them and they got frustrated. Towards the end I usually was able to help the customer, if not I had to find a manager. I usually kept to myself when working there because the other employees were over twice my age. When I worked I usually unloaded the truck on warehouse day and stocked the merchandise. I also hung up ad tags so the customers could know what was on sale. I learned how to communicate in this job and it helped me be less socially inept."
good,"i worked from the afternoon til closing.i learned how to work at a fast pace, management is good, most of my co-workers are great people, hardest part of the job is the holidays, everything was fun."
good,"So far I've  been with Walgreens Company for 1 year and 5 months and I can say that its a good company to work for, good benefits, great environment, and I get to work with many different people."
good,"My typical day would be greeting customers, checking them out, and asking how their shop was. I learned a lot about customer service and retail. The management was amazing.

Over time besides following standard operating procedures, I have developed my leadership skills to handle any situation and worked to develop teamwork, team engagement to make my store more successful.

The work place was still a very friendly and happy environment with a great crew who knew the difference between work time and joke time, it balanced out well. I learned how to multi-task and catch on to things fast like no employee ever before, since things were always changing. The hardest part of the job, at the time, was keeping up with the fast paced work-flow while trying to stay friendly at all times to customers (which wasn't hard for me since I am naturally a very friendly person."
good,A decent employer. Respects employees. Forgets about giving breaks sometimes. Always short staffed during peak hours.

good,Was at the register alot of the time. Store manager and assistacne managers are nice to talk to and understanding. Working there is like working with family. Everyone are very friendly. Made amaxing friends that i still talk to. Amazing work place.
good,I come in and have specific duties when I am not checking out customers. While working with customers I must keep a smile on my face as well as show excellent customer service and help customers with their needs and any questions they may have. I give them what they need and suggest sale items as well as give refunds or other options if needed.
good,Working here was fun and beneficial. I learned tons of information from management and my coworkers quickly became family.
good,Pretty stressful but paid employees well. Was great to mingle & manage new employees. Nice retirement plan. Retail work is always hit or miss.
good,"A day at Walgreens being the beauty Adviser, I would firstly make sure everything was stocked and organized for the day. I would then count inventory and order supplies needed for the following week. I did a lot of mark downs and pricing on items. I helped customers find beauty products. At the end of the day my whole team would help clean the store and I would go home. My coworkers were fantastic, usually we all got along and got things done efficiently and in a timely manner. I learned that people aren't always the nicest in a customer service environment, but to be professional, and productive no matter what the situation. The hardest part of my job at Walgreens was probably the end of my shift, the cleaning part. I was always so tired and ready to go home, but got it done regardless. The most enjoyable part of my time at Walgreens was meeting new people, even some life long friends, and receiving the experience in customer service."
good,Work load was bit heavy. Management is good. Lot of learning opportunities for freshers. Opportunity to gain good health care domain knowledge. Good freedom and great platform to improve the basic IT skills. Opportunity to get involved in organisational level activities too.
good,"While my position at walgreens wasn't always the most exciting, especially in a low traffic store, i did enjoy my time there. The management was helpful and professional, I was able to learn new positions as i became comfortable with the one i was first trained in, and the benefits were quite nice."
good,"typical work days are usually steady pace to busy which is a good thing keeps your eyes off the clock. great management and coworkers and flexible scheduling. The hardest part is dealing with upset customers, the best part about working here is the atmosphere meaning your management and coworkers. you can deal with an angry customer for about 10-15 minutes. you work with the same people your whole shift."
good,"A typical day can involve checking and dispensing medication, compounding medication, communicating with physicians, providing patients with pharmaceutical information, providing patients with health advice, explaining the proper use of medication, supervising staff/pharmacy technicians, etc."
good,It has got to be one of my favorite jobs I have worked at. It just sucked cuz after I had my son they wanted me to open my availability  but I really couldn't because of being a single mom it might be hard.
good,I started off as a sales associate and advanced to head photo specialist. Then i started working in the pharmacy as a pharmacy technician.
good,A typical day at work is stocking shelves helping customers and using the Point of Sale system. I've learned the different departments in the store and how to better approach customers. The management is helpful and friendly and will help whenever needed. My co-workers are a wonderful group of individuals we're like a family. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with such a diverse group of people and helping customers.
good,I was a pharmacy technician trainee and enjoyed my overall experience with the company.It was a great experience and i am grateful for the opportunity that was there.
good,"Great place to work and advance. Managers will vary I had 2 good ones and one bad one. Co-workers in my area were bad. Hardest part of job was receiving and unloading the warehouse trucks, after that it was a breeze."
good,I felt welcome and learned much during my time being there. I built relationships with my manager as well as my coworkers and despite only being there for a short time I felt comfortable.
good,"i had to transcribed doctor's notes, counted pills to put into capsules, and restocked medication as well as organizing medication."
good,"Working for Walgreens everything I did had become second nature because we followed the same routine every work day. Our day included filling prescriptions, data entry, insurance claims, and attending to the customers. I gained a lot of knowledge about insurance and medication during my time there. I got along well with my co workers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers, but the most enjoyable part was being able to deliver customers medications and building relationships with them."
good,"Although I was only here for less than 3 months, it was a very enjoyable experience. Everyone here is friendly and customer service is pushed."
good,"Working at Walgreens is a great thing to be apart of.  From the team members, to the managers, to the customers, everyone gets along well."
good,"Working at walgreens, I have some of the best coworkers around but the pay is not enough. If I got payed a little more it would the ideal place to work."
good,"I worked hard in a corporate culture seeking annual increases of `0% in prescription volume, sales, etc."
good,This is a great place to work. The work environment is well organized  and structured as far as policies and job requirements are concerned and the staff are very friendly. Hours here are also very flexible.
good,"Good Place to work "
good,"Bookeeping duties, working with customers, verification for insurance.  Loved my manager.  Moved into drugstores.  Learned many things about insurance and medical issues."
good,"Bookkeeping duties, assisting customers, insurance verification"
good,"Typical day at work is trouble-shooting customer and associate difficulties, while answering calls, maintaining working fund, and ensuring product placement. I learned a variety of complex retail systems and how to efficiently multitask."
good,I enjoyed working with the staff there and doing various tasks.  It has flexible hours  so I could attend college during the time there.
good,"Provided great customer service"
good,"I gained a lot of experience just by working in photo department, I had confidence on talking to other people and provide good customer service"
good,"I loved my co-workers, and maybe I was lucky at this particular location. The management team is very friendly, and almost everyone at work is a team player and willing to help out others. However, the corporate pay is unlivable. Even though I was a part-time employee, as I am a full time student and also avid athlete, I still managed to work about 20 hours a week, and with my paycheck bi-monthly, I would ""break even"" for my daily living expenses, making it impossible to save for college."
good,"It was great working at Walgreens.co, the opportunity to advance is all in how you work. Management at this job is very professional and allows you to feel comfortable at work"
good,Excitement every time I turn as there is always something going on.  A fast paced environment with everyone working well together which is overall enjoyable.
good,This is a solid company to work for if you are looking for a consistent paycheck. Walgreens has been around for well over 100 years and shows no signs of going anywhere.
good,Very friendly company with many opportunity to grow and expand from within. The greatest part of the job is helping people everyday.
good,Working for Walgreens was a great workplace and I wish I could have been there longer. it had great benefits and awesome retirement plan.
good,"The best part of Walgreens was personally my manager, since she was always working towards helping good employees move forward to better positions."
good,"I enjoyed my work at Walgreen's. I was a cashier and also a reliever which gave everyone their breaks so I worked the photo department and cosmetics along with the front register. I was a stocker on truck days. Having a different job every day was always keeping me on my toes and kept my job challenging. "
good,Very fast paced operation with multiple departments from inbound to outbound.  Keeping on pace so that all departments alien and stay on pace with each department.
good,"I started there when I was 18. This was a great job for a person fresh out of school. They are willing to train you and they don't mind if you don't have experience. I felt like my co-workers were my second family. I learned patience, about products, and management. You also get the chance to be around people from different cultures. All in all, once you step in the door you're working on different tasks. I was always learning something new. I got to deal with difficult customers and even got a chance to develop friendships. The hardest part about working at Walgreens is when the CEO or someone big is coming in. You have to do your daily tasks, as well make the whole store look great. Although it's tough, it means the world when the manager recognizes you and rewards you. Although it was a job, at no point did the manager make you feel like you're replaceable. He understood that the store was one unit and we all worked together to make sure the work day as easy as possible."
good,"From the moment you walk through the door until you leave you will be kept busy and on your toes.  Expect to be on the phone a lot.  Multitasking is definitely required.  Customers will be cranky regardless of your service because they are sick.  There is a lot to learn and you will continually learn through out your career.  It can be rewarding.  You are in close quarters with your coworkers, so getting along is key."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of setting goals for my self and my staff, pulling and ordering inventory, working side by side with customers. I delegated tasks as needed."
good,"The job was good, there wasn't much experience needed going into the job. Just as long as you listened to what the manager wanted of you, you could do the job with ease. the work environment was very friendly, you could go to work knowing there would be good people around you at all times."
good,"I really like working for the management that I work for. I just wish I could continue on with the company either as what I am now, or higher up. Unfortunately neither where I am or taking a step up the ladder will pay me enough to live a good life any time soon, and I can't afford to wait anymore."
good,did a lot of customer service and a lot of different projects. gained a lot of experience from the different managers i met here.
good,Arbeitskulture und Management und andere sachen alle sind gut und die firma TCS hat mir gefallt.
good,I enjoy working with the staff here at Walgreens. Everyone is so helpful and we work well as a team. We pull our reports and work them to complete the daily functions of the credit and debit account that are outstanding.
good,"Enjoyed working with customers.Always triple checked my work, assisted pharmacist with everything that was necessary.Answered phones and resolved all conflicts,(insurance conflicts,customer complaints)all day long."
good,"The main objective at this job is ECC (Extraordinary Customer Service) at all times. There's a pretty straight-forward system. As a cashier your duties are to ring up customers and in straighten up anything out of place in between. As a photo technician the priorities are the same, just with the photo implications such as printing out orders, sending out orders and assisting customers using the kiosk."
good,Walgreen was a awesome experience for me I learn so much the staff was great and very helpful and teach me all what I needed to know to preform my duties. we were a awesome team and the Manager was very happen with our work performance.
good,"it was great working with everyone, management was awesome and the shift i worked was great i worked 7 days on 7 days off i miss that."
good,"As store Leader need priority focus customer service and make every single customer effort able essentially and satisfy and happy."
good,"Pharmacy Technician in Knoxville, TN "
good,i really learned better communication skills working here and the my coworkers are cool we all get along very well the hardest part of the job would be dealing with disgruntled customers from time to time
good,"Close knit group. Very welcoming as long as you are a good worker. "
good,"Its a very nice environment to work in ! Good company and mostly everyone I work is very friendly, I would recommend to anyone whose need experience and is a beginner."
good,A typical day at work would require scanning in prescriptions and filling those prescriptions. Addressing the customers as they came to the counter to pick up their prescription. I have learned a lot at this company. I have learned the process that it takes to fill a prescription for a patient. The hardest part of the job is not having a prescription go through the insurance and having to call the insurance and find out why and fix it to the best of my ability. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with the customers and filling their needs.
good,i only worked at walgreen as a termporary worker for a little less than 2 months. i was hired through the SYEP program. co-workers are nice and friendly. working environment is very relax.
good,"There is never a typical day at work when being a Pharmacy Technician, you never really know what to expect and always learn something new, I've learned how to balance customer service and completing task to safely dispense medication at the same time. The hardest part of the job would be many people do not understand the procedures we have to abide by when completing the filling process and expect it to be done a lot quicker than possible in order to safely complete the process. The thing I enjoy most about my job that there is never a dull day and I am always finding a way to challenge myself and learn something new,"
good,The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job is the same- dealing with customers. Customers can be very kind yet very hard on customer service associates. Another hard part of the job is being on your feet the entire shift.
good,A typical day at work consists of customer service first and foremost. I would scan my department to make sure our on hands for products are correct. Pull my overstock to make sure things are out on the sales floor that need to be.
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers feel better and working with a great group of co-workers that really makes it a great place to work at
good,The hardest part of the job in the beginning was learning all the specialty drugs and I have acquired a great bit of knowledge from this company which I will take with me into my future endeavors. The co-workers were amazing and I couldn't have worked with a better group of people. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the Synagis baby's and knowing that what I did everyday made a difference in someone's life. I am actually sad to be leaving the company but I have to find a company that has room for me to grow. I feel that there is no advancement opportunity and I am not challenged enough in my current role based on my past experiences.
good,This company is one that does value their workers which is hard to find nowadays. They provide great benefits and ample amount of training available to allow you to become very experienced and well versed in whatever position you have with them.
good,Working in the pharmacy wasn't too much of a difference from being on the floor customer service wise..only complaint I have is about the management.
good,I was completely responsible for all sales floor operations. I learned to work hand in hand with the Pharmacy manager to reach company sales goals and complete company initiatives. I learned how to balance a great customer experience and maintain a high team morale.
good,Walgreen's is a great company with a good continuing education programs.  Is good providing full time opportunity for Certified Pharmacy Technicians
good,"A typical day at Walgreen's Pharmacy is very fast paced, filling around 400+ prescriptions per day. All the staff is very caring and supportive, but some days there will be grumpy customers."
good,I worked as a sales associate to earn some extra money in the summer. Work was standard for the position. I would help customers and stock shelves on a normal day. I would also run the cash register and manage inventory resets once a week. Fun atmosphere as long as you did what you were told. Overall it was a good experience
good,"great workplace, excellent team work, safe environment, lean culture, great management, long hours, turn over , fast pace environment, grow opportunity"
good,"Walgreens is only as good as its management. I feel as if you have to really work hard as you would at any job, to advance in this place of employment. If you want to move up in the company, you have to show initiative that you are willing to do so. The most enjoyable part of this job would be the co-workers and some of the friendly customers."
good,Walgreens was a fun and exciting workplace it had an amazing work place moral and great place for career advancement. the company gives great benefits and truly care about there employees
good,I was only here for a few months for internship. The staff was very helpful. They had a lot of order which was very nice. Typical day was kinda busy but it seemed like a steady pace. The pharmacist was actually hands on instead of just standing there doing nothing while the techs do it all.
good,"Allowed me the flexibility to study for the Australian Boards"
good,"On any given day I have many duties to perform which change depending on the shift I have for that day. As an opener I am responsible for the safe's accuracy, reconcile the previous day's total profits, count merchandise, and motivate employees in their duties. As a closer I am responsible for the counting of all tills, readying the store for the next day, and setting the alarm and locking the doors. The people I work with are varied in personalities and idiosyncrasies so there is never a dull moment. They are fun to be around and I can call them friends; this makes my day very enjoyable. A day can be challenging due to the lack of available employees or when machinery fails.  I have learned that in the retail business flexibility and humor are two of the best things to have when dealing with employees and customers."
good,"Employees bring different skill sets that enhances the job performance. Great team to work with, full of friendly personalities."
good,"This is a fast paced work environment where it is important to know how to multi-task.  It can get highly stressful, so you must be able to work well under pressure.  I was taught a lot of numerous things while I have worked there, and continue to learn new things.  My co-workers have been the most enjoyable thing about this job, as we are around one another quite frequently, that has been important to me.  The worst thing about this job was not being scheduled full time hours when I was hired as a full time employee, therefore making me lose my healthcare benefits because of this."
good,"My day at walgreens consisted of stocking shelves, helping customers locating items, completing photo orders, maintaining photo lab equipment, and assisted customers with checkout. I learned how to comfortably start conversations with customers to increase their experience. I also gained troubleshooting experience because as a photo technician you need to make sure that all of the machines are running smoothly and how to fix them quickly if something were to happen. If the problem was more technical than I could handle I had to go through the proper channels to schedule a technician to come and see it.One of the best parts of my job is that I work with great co-workers. We have great teamwork together and it helps so that we can give all of our customers the best service that we can. Management is excellent; they always make sure everyone has something to do, very helpful when we (the employees) are unsure in how to help a customer, and they will always let you know when there is room for advancement. The hardest part of the job is when during the holidays we are extremely busy and customers need more supervision (i.e help working the photo kiosks, price checking, checking the stock of an item, completing photo orders for waiting customers, etc.) and we don't always have enough time to give to each one of them."
good,The job was very rewarding financially It took a toll on your body over time. Especially when lifting boxes. Always wear comfortable shoes.
good,"Throughout a typical day, you learn how to manage a variety of clients and job task, so the expression of working a typical day is never applicable. This makes the job enjoyable along with the different backgrounds of upper management. The hardest part of the job is handling multiple clients and enduring the lag-time of insurance inquires. Having co-workers that have a can-do and will-do attitude helps tremendously and helps me to be patient and continue to go the extra mile for our clients."
good,"Walgreens was a great job with a lot of responsibilities. At first, I was a checker with not much customer service experience but I got use to that quickly being that I'm a people person. I really enjoyed getting to know my customers by name and vice versa because it made the job more like a community instead of just a fluorescent jungle. I quickly wanted to move up from being a checker though, because I felt that I could handle more responsibilities. I eventually was promoted to Beauty Adviser, and that was when I was able to blossom. I had to typically come up with sales strategies for our beauty department in order to reach sales goals, and we would always love to compete against other stores. What I loved doing the most though, was suggesting items for people with specific needs. I was able to remember what chemicals and compounds were used in products and correctly recommend them to the customer, often up-selling with intent and even sometimes without."
good,"lots of room for advancement promotion from within to other departments, Each position and department I worked was fullfilling and I enjoyed the work.  I worked in the Packaging Dept.and as a Dispenser, then in the Registration and Refill Dept. and finished as a PBM."
good,"Balance and calculate incoming cash flow"
good,I travel from state to state in charge of setting up Walgreens Stores (merchandiser). I was an assistant manager also. I was senior beauty advisor.  I tear down and rebuilt the cosmetic wall.   The list goes on.
good,Great compensation. Managers are rude and they do not have an idea of management/administration a pharmacy. A real chaos with the lunches schedule for the pharmacy technicians. Need to paid more for the all work pharmacy technicians are doing inside the pharmacy department when indeed are pharmacists on the phone in personal calls all shift.
good,"A typical day consist of managing my employees, filing prescriptions answering customer questions, answering medical staff questions, insurance profile"
good,"Same thing every week, not a hard job, promotions come by often. Experience depends on position and you usually have to push for things if you want to move to a different position."
good,Walgreens is a good job to have if you don't have bills and are looking for extra on hand cash. They did very well at scheduling and working with you but they don't give you a lot of hours and the environment is very relaxed and easy going.
good,Working in the pharmacy setting we really had to pay attention to what we were doing just like with any job but we just had to be careful because we were dealing with medication
good,I worked as a certified photo specialist for Walgreens and it was one of the best jobs I've ever had.  I loved being able to experience the world through my customers' photos they shared with me.  The company was great.
good,"Working as an intern, Walgreens did a great job introducing me to the world of retail pharmacy and how things generally work. I was able to have a solid idea of what to expect before graduating into the working force as a retail pharmacist."
good,"Fast pace work environment, had to be able to work as a team.  Management was very supportive, Walgreens is a big corporation and could get busy at any hour of the day."
good,"I loved working at Walgreens. The work area was vey clean, the customers were very respectful and nice. The employees were like family and treated each other as such."
good,"Good company to work for. Good benefits, discounts. Worked with a nice group of employees. Customers, for the most part were very nice."
good,I enjoyed my pharmacy technician experience because it was something I went to school and worked hard for. I also learned a lot about different medicines. It was a slow work site but I was around good people who worked hard.
good,"Ideal for an internship within the pharmacy. Flexible hours available, knowledgeable staff, friendly customers, and a great management team."
good,Working at Walgreens was a pretty good experience..  Always dealt with happy costumers.  I was able to pick up on the training very fast.
good,"Walgreen's is the largest retailer in the United States with stores in the Caribbean.  However, the company is closing stores in several states and has purchased Rite-Aid.  Management is changing at this time."
good,"I enjoyed the work atmosphere and the coworkers here. They were friendly and helpful, but there were times it was a lot of work."
good,Fun work place with supportive management.  Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop.  Decent amount of red tape and politics but this is expected of a big company.  Overall enjoyable work environment
good,I was the beauty adviser and I helped all of my customers find everything they were looking for. I had customers coming and asking for me by name. I was also in charge of cashiering and stocking merchandise.
good,"As soon as you walk into the slide door of Walgreens, an instant greeting from all the co-workers including the manager."
good,"It is almost impossible to express the daily environment and the amount of change from hour to hour or minute to minute within the work environment at this company.  Customer service is more of a state of mind over a job function, along the lines of a servant mindset with the skills of a technician.  Each day would bring surprise and memory to hone the skills of the customer service specialist.  Being able to perceive the customer expectations can be a daunting task, yet being capable to provide to the customer a product and service that goes above their expectations is to strive for.  This position is about building a relationship with the community! Building trust and respect with society and their employees."
good,Walgreen's has given me a in depth look at the retail pharmacy industry. This job has been a very fulfilling college job and an experience I wouldn't trade.
good,"When the job market crashed in 08 rules started changing in 09 on a to frequent basis.  The job was alright, but the employees had a lack of respect for management."
good,enjoyed meeting a diverse customer base. Rewarding to have them get their automotive issues addressed and remedied.Garage environment could be very dirty.
good,"Title says it all. It was my true first time Job. I had so much fun, great customers, awesome co-workers, fun bosses, and just pure fun. I would be tired by the end of the day but, I loved my Job. The only reason for my leaving this job was due to our Store Manager leaving for personal reasons and our team did not wish to cooperate with the new store manager. This caused an unhealthy work environment and unnecessary stress."
good,"Decent part time job. A typical day of work for me included running a cash register, stocking items, and developing photos. Customers have questions concerning how to develop photos. Training is paid, and I never felt like I couldn't answer a customers question. If I didn't know the answer to a question from a customer (typical questions concerning photography were easily answered by staff) someone on the roster did. (Team work a must)"
good,Management and other employees are easy to work with. Everyone is willing to teach and help out. Hours are flexible.  There are opportunities to move up with the company and work in different areas.
good,"Nice working environment, provide both business and technical professional trainings; Good medical and vision insurance benefit; Good work/life balance."
good,I liked working with the night crew there. I didn't like the fact that it was by a bar and drunk people came in all the time. My management team did everything they could to protect me.
good,"It had great salary, great benefits and a 401k program. Advancement to next pay level was good. The leads were all nice and tried to help you get your numbers. It seemed to be more younger people working there then older."
good,"I have worked for Walgreens for a longtime. I started as an intern while I was in college and worked my way up to Store Manager. Walgreens has lots of opportunities for growth, it all depends how hard you work to move up the ladder. I love working with the diversity of people whether as peers or customers. The company has now gone global and they continue to evolve in the health and beauty sector of the business. I enjoy working for this company."
good,Great experience if you enjoy meeting new people everyday. Helpful management. Good advancement Opportunities. Creative project Management opportunities.
good,I loved working for this company. When it comes to working at a pharmacy in the retail setting it really comes down to the store you work at. I was lucky in the sense that the store I worked at was awesome; the staff was great and a pleasure to work with. The customers could be a little demanding at times but nothing too crazy. This is a great company to work for.
good,"I enjoyed a lot working here, healthy environment make to work comfortable.  Hardest part of the job is manager is not having a good relation with the employees."
good,"I start my day by greeting my co-workers and getting a general idea what kind of climate I'm dealing with that day, because some days are slow and steady with not a lot of out of the ordinary activity then Flu season hits over night and we are dealing with a whole lot of miserable folks."
good,Walgreen is an amazing family-oriented company that is great for college and high school students. It provides a wonderful balance between school and family life. A typical day working at Walgreens consists of a mixture of many tasks to keep things moving at work. The co-workers and environment play the most important part. They determine whether you will enjoy your job or not so if you have a great team to work with you will absolutely love this job! My co-workers were a joy most of the time. The closer you are with your team the better you all are at managing the store without supervision.
good,"while working at Walgreen i have developed the ability to work effectively in a team environment, organizational skills and ability to multitask of which assisted me in performing my work duties effectively. Besides, I also have learned ability to perform my daily task and other assistant functions in a timely and efficient manner."
good,"I always go to work with a positive attitude and try to make it a good day no matter how much work I have ahead of me. When I go in with a positive attitude makes my day go by faster and I have a good time at work. I always go in with a smile in my face and i try to motive my co-workers.  I am in-charge of my shift and responsible for all the task in the list to get completed. I have to be supervise the employees to make sure they are working on their assigned tasks. The hardest part of this job is that i have to be handling all them money functions at the same time taking phone calls of customers and making sure that employees are doing their job, but if know how to manage my sift right everything turns out to be good."
good,Fun place to work with supportive supervisors. They always acknowledged your work and where very supportive. If you where having a problem or needed more training they where always there to help you.
good,"Walgreens is a great place to learn many different jobs all in one, and move up quickly by doing so.  No matter if you are in the pharmacy or on the floor, there's lots of room to grow and learn!  They promote from within and care about their team members."
good,I've worked at walgreens since 2008 and I have done nothing but moved up in the company. Plenty of opportunities and most of the time friendly staff
good,Walgreens was a very fun well mannered place to work at. Management was very excellent and my co wo workers were great people to work and associate. Great customer service was a must and what made it easier were the great customers that would come on a daily.
good,"I worked at Walgreens for many years. It was a good place to work, I thought I was going to retire from there. Walgreens shut down their warehouse and laid everybody off."
good,A typical day working at walgreens was very productive and exciting.  I worked with many great people and met new ones. I learned how to cope with different situations and work on customer service skills. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers..
good,"I enjoyed working and establishing relationships with the clients, doctors and nurses. I enjoyed learning what each medication was and how it works."
good,I experience was very favorable as a contractor. I cannot speak to issues that would apply to an FTE (Full Time Employee) such as benefits. I was hired for 6 mths and was extended to 1 year. My only real disappointment was that it came to an end.
good,"600  rxs  per  day,  learned to  multitask  ,  co-workers  were  the best, hardest part was  leaving,  most enjoyable  was  knowing my  patients!!"
good,I like the way Walgreens was in dealing with great customer service.    The management staff I worked with were a great team .
good,"I was pretty easy-going,very cooperative,never said ""NO"" to any of my co-workers when asked to start and finish a project at my workability 1 program offered for I.E.P. students currently attending High School.For example, an incident that took place during a ""typical day"" at work was when I was unpacking a large racket of soda and/or similar types of beverages and setting them back to the fridges or where they need to be,afterwards;a lady asked me to get a specific flavor of that.Apparently when I came back at my first attempt,I actually realized she was mad at me for the wrong one so I kept calm and corrected my mistake with full amount of respect back to her."
good,"Customer service play an important place in every company. I am a people person so in very natural for me to  accomplish that important part of the work.I learned how to filled the store, be cashier and serve people."
good,"I worked at Walgreens to gain work experience with Iowa Vocational Rehabilitation Services for two weeks. I stocked shelved, faced products, and assisted customers. I learned how to face the products and make the shelves look appealing to customers. I got along with the managers and they were accommodating and professional. I also got along with my coworkers and they helped me when I needed it. I believe the hardest part about working at Walgreens, was finding the products that customers needed if I didnt know where it was.  I enjoyed helping the customers and conversation with them about their shopping experience."
good,I have been with Walgreens for 14 years and have been promoted 4 times. I have gained a great deal of knowledge within the Retail industry and enjoyed the knowledge gained. The hardest part of my job is working evenings. The most enjoyable part of my job is dealing with people.
good,"Entering, filling, and selling prescriptions, checking escribes and faxes, handling patient phone calls and contact doctors and insurance companies to obtain proper authorizations, maintain pharmacy inventory by ordering, checking, and storing drug shipments, returning outdated or overstocked merchandise, answering questions on location of over the counter items and selling them if patient wishes to purchase item."
good,A typical day at work involves doing the daily morning tasks that every section has and then going into the core activities set out to do at work. At Walgreen's I have learned a lot. I picked up a great work ethic and it became an enjoyable job. My co-workers are the easiest to work with and make doing group tasks easier. The hardest part of working at Walgreen's would have to be management. Sometimes they are really hard to work with. I love my co-workers. They are an awesome bunch.
good,This is a good place to work just need to do a good days work along with needing to be dependable and accurate.  Hard work and sometimes long days.
good,"enjoyed my work, meet a lot of people, liked to keep busy."
good,"very organized so you knew the game plan so we were productive it was never a panic mode if somebody was coming in town it was business as usual not going help a slacker do his job,"
good,"The Walgreens employees were amazing. They were always smiling are are willing to help others. They were very welcoming and although i was a trainee, I felt very welcomed and as if i was a part of the team."
good,"A good place to work,  the co-workers was helpful and friendly.   I really enjoyed getting the work experience to move towards other things I can do also.  Thanks Walgreens."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens was great it always felt good to make customer's day.  I have learned how to listen before speaking and that everyone is different. Managing was great because I love motivating, and teaching others.  My co-workers and I always respected each other and I always encouraged communication. I had not experienced a hard part of working at Walgreens I enjoyed my job. the most enjoyable times was the team work, it was like we all were family and everyone did our job and more."
good,"A fun place to work with a welcoming feeling. The manager was very helpful and supportive of what was needed to be thought and learned. The co-works went above and beyond to help teach as much as they could, even things that will not be used until a career is started for me.There was things that needed to be done at all times, filling prescriptions, rotating stock, putting in refills from an Rx number or an auto refill. Looking up patients is a very import part to make sure you have the right person and right medication as well of any interactions a new drug may have on another drug."
good,"Enjoyed helping customers print photos and stocking, was not as much a fan of not having a regular work schedule. Stocking can get monotonous but it is not a very large store so even with the few people on staff we get done pretty quickly."
good,"I learn everything I know like a cashier,buyer,and warehousing skills.This job is like a school in my live and appreciated everything a learn . My co-workers are friendly, the company was change and close jobs ."
good,"I love the job, the shift position requires that I receive and weekly shipment from the warehouse even though I have help it is becoming two much to handle we receive totes with inventory in them and a small shipment is at least 300 totes, not including full case products.  If I could take away that part I would not be looking for another job.  I mostly enjoy the interaction with the customer being able to help them it makes my day.  Management is fair and expects you to do your job easy."
good,"It's a great place to work, the employees and management are a great team to work with. The pay may be low depending on where you work in the company and what is your preference. There is variety in what I do each day, but there is also downtimes where it doesn't get busy at all which may cause the day to drag. But besides that it is not a bad place to work at all."
good,Walgreens was a very hands on job! Working the registers and stacking candy all in the same time frame. Good staff would always help you when needed!
good,"I love my job at Walgreens. I get to meet new people everyday. Also, i get to assist people in all there needs. Some of the things i do at work is to supervise the employees, make sure the store stays clean and presentable, and give excellent customer service."
good,"Working at Walgreens was very eye opening for me. The location I worked was a very busy store whenever it came to rush hour at around 5pm where people will be coming back from work and wanting to get their medications. All in all it is a good place to work if you want to learn how to be very good with time and learn how to portray good customer service skills even when things may not be going well as planned. It is also a place to see where teamwork comes into play and how if there is a break or someone does not want to play in a team environment, the workflow comes apart."
good,"A typical day at my Walgreen's starts with me coming in and pulling all the expired food off the shelves, not a big deal.  The remainder of the day is spent doing any tasks assigned to me by my manager and store manager.  It's rarely anything too bad but some days there are times where the work is so hectic, running back and forth between photo, the floor, and the front register to help people out that I have to stop and really think about what I was previously doing.  It can get crazy but most days are rather easy-going."
good,"A typical day in this position your focus is on customer service, from the front of the store to the pharmacy, all customers should leave happy and satisfied. Another priority is being sure you and your employees are keeping the shelves full and the store clean, neat, and organized. "
good,"Typical work day is very steady. Team is awesome and does the best to provide excellent services. We care for our customers like family and help them live, stay and be well."
good,I enjoyed the time I worked at Walgreens. I got to meet and work with a great group of people over the years.  I learned many good things and gained a lot of great life experience while employed with this company.
good,"I had to ensure the shelves were properly stocked, assisted the customers to locate the products. Most rewarding part of the job was to see the smiles on the customers' faces after they received great service."
good,"Walgreens is a very laid back, fun atmosphere. I learned a lot about products and people. There is a lot to do and learn. Very fast paced work place, and dealing with everyday health and life issues."
good,Walgreens Inc. was a great place to work and i had awesome co-workers and friends that help when i needed it. The management team were were very understanding and hands on with me and my fellow co-workers
good,"I liked Walgreens is a good company to work for.  I have been full time for 3 years.  Some of the benefits is that I feel that I am making an impact on patients health and well being.  I go above and beyond my daily tasks to make sure the our patients are getting the proper care, and medication in a efficient ant timely manner.  Some of my daily tasks include:"
good,"It's a pretty standard retail job that has around medium demand. A great way to start off. I wouldn't consider this a career building job, but it can open a lot of doors if you buckle down."
good,"it was a temporary job provided by my former high school."
good,"The co-workers were very welcoming and lend a helping hand when needed. I learned how to organize, separate, and document all medications. The hardest part of the job was understanding the computer system and all the short cuts. The most enjoyable part of the job was when i got to show off my skills at filling and took on stacks of medications at once and got them done in a timely matter."
good,Walgreen's is a good place to work. They have a friendly staff and you learn a bunch of valuable skills. They work with your schedule.
good,"The Walgreens in Kings Highway has many friendly, vibrant workers, who all try their best to provide 100% customer satisfaction. Working alongside them, I learned many tips and advice about being a sales clerk, and also was able to rely on them when I was in a tight situation. The only real drawback about this job, in my opinion, was that it was too slow for me, because sometimes there are few customers, and I had to be 2 places at once in some occasions, due to the store being short on workers. Other than that, Walgreens isn't a bad place to work. Just watch out for any rude customers, because one will be bound to meet one."
good,its fun working at walgreens.its a bit demanding sometimes because my store is a 24hr store so you have to be on your toe all day to ensure proper consumer satisfaction
good,"This is a good company to work for. I learn how to manage and market a company. I also learn the importance of time management, revision and resets, customer service, and multi-tasking."
good,good social enviorment and gives a great base for customer service. if you work hard you will not go unnoticed. more than one are to learn and gain experience as a sales rep.
good,they train you and pay for your sate lic. many  stores you can work at in the untied states  pay is well above min wage in the pharmacy
good,"Esthetics| Skin Care          "
good,Learned a lot from every day work from learning about picture and quality to some levels of management. Coworkers are great and very friendly. the hardest part was probably putting up truck because it takes my whole shift away from me. Not to mention takes away time from customers that need help in photo.
good,"Walgreen's Pharmacy was a great place to work and I learned limitless amounts about myself and business practices during my 15 year tenure there.   The most enjoyable part of the job, was the relationships you have the opportunity to build during your time there.   May those relationships be with valued customers or loyal employees, there is a sense of family with in this organization."
good,"learned at Walgreens pharmacy system and controls on the products, to work behind a cash register and share with a multicultural population. I love to learn every day to grow personally."
good,"My typical day at work is busy, however, I enjoy being busy.  Customers can be challenging.  At Walgreens, I learned to collaborate well in a team.  I served as a senior technician for couple of years, which taught me to be a good team leader.  The hardest part of the job is to deal with insurance companies.  The most enjoyable part of the job is creating a relationship with the customers that I see often."
good,"Every day its different there's always something new to learn, co-workers are cooperative and team players. Management are very professional and helpful"
good,"Walgreens, is a great place to work the employees always have a smile on their face and are always out to help the customers."
good,"Clock in and its straight to work, do not get to leave the front counter as much to face because customers are always ready to check out soon as I leave my station. I've learned to talk louder, start conversations with customers as well as work on a new register. My managers all have different personalities which helps the day go by smoother. Some of my co-workers are fun to be around and easy to work with others I'm just ready for the day to be over with but I get along with everyone there. The hardest part is dealing with the rude customers without getting my manager called. I enjoy the nice elderly customers that  always have different stories every time they come in  the store as well as be able to help them find what their looking for."
good,is great company to work for enjoyed my time there learned a lot about retail enjoyed  the day to day duties and responsibilities great management

good,I was able to advance quickly with this company.  I started off as a cashier but within 3 months I was a pharmacy Technician. My hours were just not consistent.
good,The overall atmosphere and growth you may experience with this company is an everyday event. Here you will learn great work ethics as well as the fundamentals of team work and the feeling of belonging.
good,This is a good company to work for. They offer great benefits and there are oppertunities for advancement. You meet a variety of friendly people. My coworkers are hard working people.
good,"Very friendly customers and staff. Always enjoyed going to work. Even though the stores are open 365, they always had a volunteer sign up sheet to work on holidays and you could pick your shifts. Plus paid time and a half on holidays."
good,I enjoyed putting what I learned in school to good use. It was fun and exciting working in a pharmacy. I enjoyed dealing with the patients and being a part of there lives. My co-workers really work as a amazing team.
good,"I was able to help customers with specific needs. I enjoyed the back office aspects of this job, and learned a lot more about the behind the scenes aspects to drive sales and further assist customers."
good,Overall a very fun and exciting workplace. I enjoyed being a part in helping customers catch and  hold onto their memories with their photos. Also like seeing and meeting all the customers.  Their was never a dull moment while working their.

good,I like the people I work with. Very fast paced busy environment to work in so you definitely need to stay focused. Management is somewhat supportive. Overall it is a decent place to work.
good,Working at Walgreens was good. Loved all my co workers. The work load was not hard at all. Pay was okay to say I was a minor. the Hours were decent also.
good,Busy pharmacy. High volume store. Good management. Good staff. I enjoyed working with the entire team. Getting to know the regular customers was interesting and fun.
good,Lots of fun and help. Communicates well with other co workers and customers. Feels so greatly appreciated. I have learned how to adapt well with different backgrounds. The hardest part of my job is trying to help the customers understand the exact product that is being advertised for the sale. The most enjoyable part is learning about different types of merchandise that's being sold.
good,work was always the same. I did not like that my work day was never  scheduled for a definitive quit time. I did enjoy my coworkers and my shift leaders overall a great place to work.
good,"Sales in cosmetics, customer service, covering breaks, IC3s, Propane exchanges,ss retail, and merchandising.  When working at nights you do all above plus some resets, sweep the whole store floor, clean all bathrooms and if someone got sick even in the day they think that that the cos girls are responsible to clean, they have to do all trash in the store except the front reg. and photos.  We use to only have to face aisles 1 thru 3 now they make us do aisles 1 thru 10 plus back wall.   Our store manager who was moved recently was outstanding until he became a Community Leader then it seemed to go downhill from there.  We hardly ever saw him, we really missed him a great deal. The new co-workers are young and seem to leave as quickly as they start, they feel overwhelmed by all the work they have to do.   The shift leads are very hard working and some pretty wonderful.   The hardest part of the job was the crazy hours, the need for security and more people during holidays.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and selling cosmetics,  I loved that.   I learned a great deal with Walgreens and appreciate everything they taught me but they need to remember when you take away you lose good workers and good customer service.  Since you have implemented your changes our store is now a swinging door we can't get people to stay especially in cosmetics as they feel like janitors instead of beauty consultants. Please really consider the employees, it will not hurt Walgreens to invest in us a little more like they use to you will see better customer service, less sick days"
good,"I really like working for this company, they do charity events and try to come up with fun things the employees can do together. I spend my day at my desk typing while listening to music. The management is wonderful and will always work with me when I have questions or issues. I have learned to not only decipher other people's handwriting but also the use of many drugs. The hardest part of my job would have to be translating handwriting and the most enjoyable part is helping out with events that we have sometimes."
good,I enjoyed my time interning at Walgreens.  I really got to see how it is to be a pharmacy tech. really hands on. co workers were nice.
good,Walgreens has allowed to be grow tremendously in my time working with them. They always presented me with opportunities to better myself and move forward with the company. My management teams have always been flexible and caring.
good,"Working for Walgreen was not only a lot of fun, but the management and co-workers made employment there worth while.  I learned a lot about setting up certain sections of the store as well as accepting the weekly truck loads.  Stocking shelves was a nice break from the every day task of being head cashier for 4 years.  Although that was my favorite thing to do because I was dealing directly with the public."
good,"bad management, not good hours, I would answer customer questions, provide a optimistic attitude, tag items,suggestive sell items, give a report of my sell activity to my managers"
good,"A good Company to work for. Great compensation, the photo lad equipment didn't work well. Not a lot of room for advancement. Company going thru lots of changes at this time,some benefits are being taken away."
good,"cash handling on a daily basis, stocked shelves, assisted in training new employees, completed my alcohol certification class ( expires 08/2017)"
good,"On a typical at work, I go and count the safe and then I'm responsible for providing the registers with enough change and also do money pickups. At this job I have learned to handle with big amounts of money and keep track of it. I have obtained better managing skills and also work skills such as using the technological tools that we have."
good,"It's a great company to work for, if employeed with this company you may transfer your position anywhere in the US thats willing to tak your transfer. Offers position advancement while on the job traing."
good,I have learned throughout my time at Walgreens how to deal with patients when they are not feeling well and also how to build rapport with customers.
good,I loved it and the staff and the patients . Very fast paced enviroment and lots to learn. Learned everyday a new task thanks to the Pharmacist in Charge P.I.C. She came from San Antonio to help straighten out the store and help the staff understand alot of new things. The hardest part of this kind of job is having to inform the patients that they have a huge decutible and then in turn that makes them not able to get their medication or the antibiotic because they could be on a fixed income or they just can not afford it at the time for what ever reason. But one of the more rewarding things is helping them figure out their insurace issues and then they are able to afford their matienace medication or that important eye ointment or flu medication.
good,"Had a nice time working, I showed up to work on time, assisted customers with locating and/or choosing merchandise, stock shelves,assisted with merchandise display, facing merchandise, clean the store"
good,The pharmacy managers and leads are very nice. They'll give you anytime you want to work. Majority of the time there is not busy.You can learn a lot about drugs there.
good,"The job is okay for a student.  It is pretty fun getting move around alternating between photo department, stocker, cashier.  Though I'm hired as a Pharmacy Technician, I guess they like the way I work when I was training as a cashier."
good,"this is my first job, my first experience working, customer service. learning for good way. manager very supportive for all employee. enjoying helping customer what they need. learning a lot of thing on retail,."
good,Spend my day working with a young team of associates who are ready to help out our loyal customers with whatever they need.
good,Came in at midnight to bake bread. Listening to personal music to make work enviornment more relaxed. Got to make bread from the begining. We got to make bread look perfect so it makes customers buy. The pay was very good and management was okay as well.
good,Walgreens is a very stable place to work.  The people are nice and the company overall is great.  This company provides a friendly environment for customers and employees.
good,"I learned a number of things working at Walgreens. I became very efficient with customer service, and dealing with a very diverse range of customers. I did inventory, and stocking almost daily. If you do not start the job with a good work ethnic you will definitely leave with one. The management was wonderful. Everyone was so helpful and willing to help you learn something new or reteach you something. I enjoyed the environment I worked in, it was always good energy."
good,"Typically I'd work one on one with patients, fill prescriptions, sell prescriptions, and deal with insurance companies."
good,"Great Company and can teach you the skills to manage others, good work and life balance ,can prepare you for other management jobs  dealing with retail."
good,"I loved this job. Very orderly, yet elbow room to have fun with it. Daily we would have our tasks. Depending on the department were in. The things we learned were beyond what I could explain but to sum it up. I learned how to utilize the AS400, run several departments and each department was very different form the next. I think that's why this was such a great job. you didn't have the same routine. Though, it did have order. There is a very specific way to do each job.  Management, everyone has there own ways I don't have any judgment on management. Yes, I had moments that I wish certain moments could have been different, but its not the end of the world to me. I respect all decisions from my management. They are exactly who I want to appease. I know that there is a lot of training time and dedication that goes into getting into that position. The hardest part of my job was moving up. It was easy to move departments but to become a lead was not much of a priority for me at that time. I did though find that those who did want to move up had a bit of a hard time doing so. I did enjoy so much of my job. It pretty much came down to people. I love working with people."
good,The company has a lot of areas of greatness. The reason for me saying it is because they helped me understand the true quality of team work and discipline.
good,"A typical day is me walking into the store usually around 1:30 in the afternoon to start closing duties for the store. I meet up with my assistant manager in the back office and we discuss what needs to be done during my shift. We also trade jokes and stories. I also get to meet my colleagues who are there to help me out during the shift. I have learned to be self-reliant , independent  and strong. I have learnt to run a walgreens store which is one of the busiest stores in the districts on my own with no supervision . I have also learnt that I am good with customers and that I can lift objects twice as heavy as me. I have also learnt to take care of my shift members and be the mediator between them and the customers. My co-workers lean on me for guidance and support and we are always exchanging stories and laughs. But my job is a very tough one physically and when I am sick, I can feel the strain. But i will always enjoy the humility, common-sense and lack of prejudice that I value from my co-workers. It is like we are both part of this big game we call life ."
good,"Open and close the store"
good,"Great company, job keeps you busy at all times, a great place to learn something new about pharmacy, and a great place to gain experience"
good,I made a lot of great friends while employed at Walgreens and continue those friendships to this day. We all were a great team and family at the job.
good,"Good starting job, with awesome benefits! Always meeting new people and the usually crowd. Easy going atmosphere! Discount on everything you buy!"
good,"Great company, but is declining, corporate down sizing and reconstruction of management positions renders the company weaker. Company will compensate but hiring lower level shift leaders to replace management."
good,"I work in the pharmacy, I take care of patients with filling the prescriptions, helping them with insurance issues, i work with with great team. We work as a team. The pharmacy manager is very helpful when you need help with something. i also work the drive thru and out window."
good,Working for Walgreens you stay busy with customers and your own task days can seem long but its all worth it at the end. You have your better days and then theres those bad ones.
good,"Given the opportunity to advance in the company, learn tasks with higher responsibility, and have fun while doing it. A typical work day includes stocking merchandise, merchandising products, and excellent customer care."
good,I have learned how pharmacy works. Dealing with different customers and medications. Learning to find and fill prescription. The co-workers are helpful and nice. The hardest part of the job would be filling a large amount of medication. The most enjoyable part of the job is filling medications and working at a fast paste.
good,"loved the environment, and the customers were always fun to help. I was always busy and the management was appreciative of my production."
good,"demanding. Very political company. everything has to be done 100% by the books. Good paying, fun environment. managers are nice. great customers"
good,"Very busy filling prescriptions, taking phone calls taking care of patients medical needs. I learned a lot about drugs, and also that patients need a lot of help about instruction for taking their medications. Worked well with coworkers. The  management concerned with providing great customer service. The hardest part of the job on standing for a long period of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is that it was all in a days work."
good,"Patients are scheduled in such a way as to keep the day flowing.  See one pt then off to the next.  At end of patient visit, labs are dropped off, go home, complete time/mileage sheets, call in report and fax report and time sheet.  Time management and documentation was improved during my time with Synergy.  When ever I had doubts or questions about a drug, procedure, patient etc. I always had great support from my co-workers and supervisor.   This made the job enjoyable and rather easy.  The hardest part of the job for myself was making sure ALL the paper work was correct and filled out to its' entirety.  I truly enjoyed the position.  Working hand in hand with pharmacists, pharmacy techs, administrative personnel, Dr.'s, and lab corp gave me the ""big picture.""   It reinforced the importance of communication.  I was able to see how each of us was needed in order for the process to run smoothly.  Not only for Synergy but most of all for our patients."
good,"Process Canvases, Photos, Calendars etc.. Management was fair with scheduling time and building moral. Loved working with the co-workers. There wasn't anything that stood out to be a hard part of the job as it was flexible. The most enjoyable moments is the built rapport with the local customers."
good,"My typical day is cashiering at the pharmacy counter. When no customers present, I enter in prescriptions and fill medications. I restock vials and take out the garbage. I learned how to multitask due to the busy environment thus I am always aware. My co-workers all help each other and we make sure to work as a team. The hardest part about my job is not having the hours for a full staff thus one has to ask other stores to see if they need help so one can work."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens consists of helping customers in finding products that they are searching for and helping customers use the photo kiosks. Next, we are expected to review our work list for that specific day. Tasks often put on the work list include pulling bays and filling empty product on the shelf, pulling outdated merchandise, cleaning, and doing resets and revisions throughout the store. I've learned that working as a team is the best and only way to ensure the store runs most effective. Also, I have learned to multi task in order to be efficient. Management at Walgreens is always changing so I have had the privilege of seeing some very effective management styles to go along with some very poor management styles. Most of my co-workers have been great to work with and are willing to listen and work as a team with me. However, the few challenging co-workers I have dealt with have helped me develop the skills to not panic and to problem solve to figure out what I need to do to fix issues that may arise and not be communicated. The most difficult part of working at Walgreens is having to work holidays and not having a set schedule. The most enjoyable part of working at Walgreens has definitely been getting to work with so many amazing people."
good,the day start off really good i lean how to stock and cods and the management was fine the co-worker were great and there was no hard part about it i enjoy everything
good,Working at Walgreens has taught me a lot as a pharmacy technician.  I learn something new everyday and the people that I work with are great.
good,"A typical day at work is greeting the customers. Putting up merchandise and organazing products. Maintaining sales and helping customers finding products. My co workers are great we do are job, we learn from each other and we help each other get the job done."
good,This place has taught me a wide variety of skills that will be useful to me in any location.  I have been in management since the beginning and love all the challenges that come with it.
good,"A typical day at work consists of receiving prescriptions, scanning them in, typing them, filling them, and then selling them out to the customers. On top of that we have to deal with insurance, comply with customers when they want refills on their medicine, check in the order, order medicine for the next day, do call lists like new to therapy calls and late to refill calls. On top of that we have to answer phones every time we hear it ringing. Through the process of working at Walgreens i have learned to use critical thinking skills in the most stressful of situations; especially in our busiest hours. The management is very friendly and easy to get along with, they can answer any questions you have usually. The only problem i have with management is when we call for help in the pharmacy because we are busy, a lot of the time no one comes down to help us catch up in the pharmacy when we need them most. For the most part we have very friendly co-workers. Unfortunately there is one senior technician that brags on themselves but does miniscule work. She'll do very little to get everyone caught up while claiming to have done something important that is irrelevant to the moment( We're all about getting medicine out to the customers quickly right?). The hardest part of the job would have to be how busy we are and how understaffed we are. Some nights its just two techs and a pharmacist. To put that to scale, we have a drive through and a front counter in which the customers never stop coming. While two technicians are stuck cashiering the pharmacist is stuck  doing all the work typing,"
good,"I work with the public on a daily basis which can be challenging at times. I've learned how to run a team and how to manage conflict better. I work with a great group of people. The hardest part of the job is having to work nights, weekends and holidays."
good,"Working remote has been challenging, but fortunate to have great support from co-workers throughout the company.   Flexibility has been an added bonus."
good,This was my first job in high school. With hat being said it open my eyes up to the working environment Overall it was a pleasant job opportunity.
good,"assisted in customer relations, filled prescriptions for daily pickup and also assisted in inventory management. Also, insisted in inputting prescriptions to be filled into computer system."
good,"I begun my management career at Walgreen's right after I got out of business school. I learned many essential managerial skills while I worked there. The upper management was very strong and the company had a very clear vision for success. Unfortunately when I moved from Michigan to Colorado the economy was in full recession mode and Walgreen's had stopped building as many new stores as they had previously planned. This left me unable to transfer, and that is where my Walgreen's career ended."
good,very busy store. 1st rotation; they mainly just wanted me to work in back verifying Rxs & preparing Rxs.  Best part= coworkers.
good,This place was fun to work. I enjoyed working with the pharmacist and all the customers. I learned and enjoyed going to different places for training. I would go back to Walgreens
good,"overall great if you can handle it. But it will get crazy and you have to keep it calm. you will be running photo, helping in pharmacy,trying to work on truck, making sure the store is perfect."
good,Worked for Walgreens for 4 years and was happy with all the work experience. Management came and went a few times but other than that great people and friendly customers. Was very happy there.
good,"A typical day as a customer service associate/cashier includes keeping your work area well-organized and clean. Greeting customers as they come in, checking out, price checking, answering customers questions, answering the phone, etc,... Very Typical cashier work. The only negative expect is other employees being rude to other employees. The best way to handle the situation is by speaking directly to other employees. Team work is essential for any business. They have this survey that customers call or go online and do. If they mention your name and give you a ""9"" (the highest number), you get a bonuses to your check. I get bonuses every week!"
good,"Entering sales on the cash register and customer service"
good,"Easy job once you learn what needs to be done. Alot of hard work when it comes down to stocking due to heavy packages. Co-workers are delightful to work and get along with. Do not plan to have much of a life outside of work, because you will get scheduled crazy hours. Management does have their picks and chooses when it comes to employees. Hardest part of job is truck day, boxes can sometimes be very heavy. Enjoyable part of job is being able to satisfy another customer."
good,"Fun exciting, and always goals to achieve. Cares about the customer. Co-Workers work in a team environment. Most enjoyable is able to help customers happy."
good,"it was good working at walgreens, and would defintely recommand someone who is trying to get into pharmacy field of study."
good,"Home infusion services. A lot of driving but compensation good. very professional. only left because i am moving and no office in area i will be living,"
good,In a typical work day I either open or close the store. In both the opening or closing shift I am required to manage the money from the registers and the safe. We have a daily task list that is required to be done on every shift. I am required to make sure that all of the employees are getting their jobs done as well as making sure I get mine done as well. The hardest part of the job sometimes is finding the time to get everything done in the store especially when we are busy but in those situations we have to do the things on the list that are most important first and finish the rest the next day. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my team. We all have different qualities that we bring to the table.
good,The management was easy to go to with your problems and concerns. The typical day would start out with an list of tasks to do within the time limit. One thing I have learned is to say a few words in Arabic. The management was easy to go to with questions and concerns about the tasks during the shift. My co-workers were easy to get along with. One of the harder tasks was learning how to use the poster printer. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find their products.
good,"OK job, nice place to work and staff are amazing. opportunities are there where you can be promoted regularly. pay is not so great but that's up to you if u want to stick around or not"
good,worked here as a manager it was a good company. loved shoes and being able to help people find the items they need was great
good,"Walgreens is a retail drug store chain that primarily sells prescriptive medication.  The management team is supportive and flexible with work hours.  An enjoyable aspect of the job is the constant learning of new tools that not only equip employees with knowledge, but opportunities for advancement. The management team and employees really capture the spirit of team work by accomplishing projects and reaching deadlines as a team.  The shared responsibility among the team makes the job less arduous."
good,"A typical day at work involved achieving my sales goals, facing my area, helping guests choose the right products for them, and ringing them up on my register. I learned excellent organizational skills, and how to work as a team with many different departments. I enjoyed the close interaction I was able to have with customers. The store was very small, so every person received undivided attention. It really taught me the importance of customer service."
good,"Always busy."
good,No two days are alike but we do our best to keep our customers well. The staff is very diverse and so are our customers. In order to succeed in this company you have to be able to work during various holidays and also willing to have a flexible schedule.
good,I enjoyed the department i worked in. i liked my coworkers made a lot of new friends over the years there.  The hours where the hardest part of the job.
good,"i enjoyed working with the customers.i enjoyed the fact that it was a fast pace with work to be done and no time to rest ,where the customers are involved,i enjoyed making a good experience with and for the customers."
good,"The people are so professional and always on top of what needs to be done. The pharmacists are always willing to help when needed and give advice."
good,"Again, I was a retail pharmacist (mgr) for many years. I worked with people in the store, customers, physicians, nurses and any other tasks involved. Computers, printers, staplers, cash registers, whatever it took to get the job done..I enjoyed what I did. Helping people get and remain well is very rewarding."
good,"Operations Production Supervisor "
good,I would only be there for a couple of hours because it was an internship through my high school. Typical day I helped box orders up in shipping.
good,"working for Walgreens was great. Fast pace and always busy, so that means your shift goes by very fast. Loved my managers and teammates. I learned many new skills and appreciate the opportunity."
good,"I would clock in at my assigned time and receive my assignments from my manager that was on duty. After receiving my assignments and learning the proper instruction, I would then work on the floor until it was time for me to go work on the front register. I interacted with several customers daily until it was time for me to do my daily cleaning. It wasn't a hard job, but you do have to be dedicated. "
good,"fun. fast paced. I enjoyed my co-workers and managers were fair."
good,"Walgreens was like a family place to hang out, We were team player company and everybody got along."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of maintaining the front end of the store, assisting customers, ringing up sales on the register and keeping an eye out for possible thefts that may occur. I learned how to be patient with understanding customers who either did not speak English, spoke broken English or had heavy accents. Management was very encouraging and gave constructive criticism when needed but also let you know when you were doing a good job. My co-workers were very helpful and patient, the hardest part of the job was keeping an eye out for those who would try and steal while focusing on helping other customers because the store had heavy traffic of people coming and going. What I most enjoyed about the job was the interactions with regular customers who you could address by name and kind of get to know their routine when they came into the store."
good,The employees are always nice and caring. I am greeted by my name.I almost always have a good time working with this company.
good,"The most difficult part of being a tech here was that there were quite a few younger technicians who spent much of their time (on the clock) doing school work instead of their pharmacy responsibilities and the pharmacists were too busy to realize what was going on."
good,typically at a days work there... I would start going to my station and start processing my orders making sure that everything matches up to get the medications set to deliver to the patients.. and also what I have learned there is to show up for work everyday and learned how to process medication which I found very interesting.. and also as for my co-workers they were all helpful and enjoyed working with them
good,"great place to work, good management good pay"
good,Overall this was a good place to work. The management have to put in a lot of hours but the pay is pretty good.
good,"Get initial culture but now they are trying to be to ""big box""."
good,"Gained an understanding of the inner workings of a major retail company. Walgreens had an excellent job culture, and employees were rewarded for their hard work. This rewarding atmosphere encouraged employees to always work hard."
good,A typical day at work involves Customers that's our number one focus!  Cleaning is a big part of keeping happy customers as well. Taking care of the daily moves and changes for the store to keep up with changing times and events and such going on.
good,"My typical day at work is usually a happy one because I love my customers and my co-workers are fun and pleasant to work with. My belief is that you treat all people the way you would like to be treated.  Unfortunately, the pay and hours are not enough for me to survive on."
good,"Great place to work, great place to start in retail, great benefits and competitive pay. you have oppurtunity for advancement in different departments, and also any stores, flexible schedules, fun enviroment"
good,walgreens was my 2nd  job i love it. The only down fall was time  that i had to be at work @9am  i was not a morning person but later a got use to it. i was a full time employee complete my work task everyday. i had a small issue with one of the photo ladies she act as if she did not like me but i looked over that but she did things like always rolled her eyes acted like i dint know what i had to do on when my job duties were the same everyday I knew why she was made her in this other young lady had been working there for like 2 years or so and still wasnt  full time or neither did they get employee of the month well me i was there in 3 to 4 months nd i was full time n had employee of the month 2times so i thinking thats y  thoses two young ladies were mad.
good,"As I walk into the front door to begin my day, I worked as a cashier in the alcohol department, so I would start my day by counting my till, then help customers and stock shelves."
good,"A typical day as a Walgreens employee depends on the shift you work. There were 3 sets of work shifts which included the morning, mid-afternoon and evening. I learned every section of the store including pharmacy, which I received my pharmacy license, and also the bookkeeping for the store account receivable/payable and employee payroll. Some of the management were awesome to work with and then there were some managers that were there to make your life difficult. The hardest part of the job was attention to details when it came to sales and planograms. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers who frequent the store often and learning different aspects of the job in its entirety."
good,"Enjoyed working with customers and fellow co-workers. Management was a little unreasonable when it came to putting up the sale tags (could only start at a certain time and 1,500+ tags needed to be up in 3 hours)."
good,Fulfilling sells orders to ensure deadlines were met. Assisting field sells
good,I enjoy seeing customers and seeing them happy makes me motivated because of the extraordinary customer service that I am proving.
good,"enjoyed the job, enjoyed the ppl both co-workers and management other than the company closing this distribution center, I have nothing negative to comment. Had weekends off, overtime was offered on a seniority basis, we received employee discounts, health benefits were good, along with 401 K benefits"
good,"typical day at walgreens pretty much relaxing if you werent assigned to anything. or if you were the person that came in before you already did it. i learned a lot  if you put your mind to do better for the company. management was pretty cool, if you wanted to leave 30  minutes early before your shift ended then they would pretty much let you, but you didnt take a lunch if you only worked for 6 hours. co-workers were pretty nice and made you feel welcomed. hardest part of the job was unloading the truck and restocking and using fifo cause if you didnt then you would mess up the system by having out of date on the shelves in the back and the new items in the front and you would get in trouble if you didnt have the new items in the back, and check any out of dates every 30 days or 90 days depending on the product."
good,"I enjoy working there , I learn a lot on how to treat the employees that work under my department."
good,Working in Walgreen was definitely an amazing experience as a first job. I worked the photo and cosmetics department. I had great co-workers and managers who became more like family. It taught me responsibility and time management since I would always arrive late. (I was a 17 year old senior in high school) I definitely enjoyed helping the customers and would always get complimented for knowing the entire store!
good,"On a typical day I would arrive at approximately 4pm, the work days focused more on weekends when there was more customers in the store. I stood by the front entrance and greeted all customers and at the same time access the individual . I was always able to immediately recognize if the person was planning to shoplift. There are several things that a person does that I was able to determine and recognize without a doubt ,that they were guilty before their actions in attempting to shoplift. The co-workers played a important role in alerting me to potential shoplifters. Approaching a shoplifter never determined what actions they would take,when instructing them to accompany you to the office to contact the police .  The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the regular customers and make their shopping experience one to remember."
good,"I am thankful for a career and to be employed..."
good,I loved this fast pace environment specially at busy time like holiday season. Sales was my number one focus and my store was #1 in our district for the past year that i was there. Hard work will always pay off.
good,"In my short time at Walgreens, I made many friends, worked several positions, and still managed to go to school."
good,"A typical day involed printing patient leaflets and labels, typing in multiple script either e-scribe or had written. Filling those orders. Taking care of patient needs and any concerns that may arise. Handling insurance claims and trying to resolve any issues in a timely matter. Contacting doctors to either verify a script or just to get a new script for the patients medication therapy. Being able to work in a close working environment and working as a team. Helping each other out to fulfill the daily goals that have been set. The hardest part of the job is sometimes being able to read doctors handwriting and trying to keep all patients happy. The best part about the job is getting to know the patients and making them feel like they are part of my family."
good,The work place was very fast pace. My co-workers were very helpful in me learning new material. I enjoyed the fast pace environment at my work place. Walgreen's was a great experience for me because I enjoyed learning new medication and knowing how they worked.
good,"Able to work any shift within the store 24 hours of operations."
good,"i loved to interact with customers,paid hoildays,learned to use a scanner cash register"
good,my first real job as a pharmacy  technician and i learned all about retail pharmacy
good,"* Try to help customers as needed."
good,"A typical day was getting right to business.  You are just replacing the next person and handling customers, prescriptions, register, filling, answering phones. "
good,"The culture was fun and loving, everyone got along with each other. The pay was $14 and you were basically the manager. You had the keys and ran the store."
good,great place to learn; solving different issues; talking with different people
good,"- A typical day at work is busy and fast."
good,"i am on time to my jobs ,learn how to set up displays , how to keep track of money in my deparnt , how to make s"
good,Due to company cut backs i can not give Walgreens 5 stars. It use to be a great place to work until they made all managers except $14.25 an hour or Leave. They got rid of the photo Lab. So I had to Leave and move to California to seek better employment.
good,Working with Walgreens as an intern allowed a lot of opportunity for growth. Friendly and helpful staff always lent a helping hand.
good,Great place to work with helpful co workers. Provides great work life balance. Managers encourage career growth and support necessary training.
good,"Though the compensation for services is perhaps a bit lackluster (as compared to managers at other stores), the workers, benefits, and upper managers are the things which makes this worth working for. Company profit sharing and medical benefits are an exceptional perk for working regular retail hours (which unfortunately includes holidays)."
good,"Our stores are the face of our business and offer numerous and varied career opportunities: everything from store management to photofinishing to our new LOOK Boutique – where licensed estheticians, makeup artists and nail technicians show off their expert beauty knowledge. These positions represent an incredibly diverse array of talent, working together to create a consistently positive customer experience"
good,"This job is good constant moving, learning something new everyday, always using your brain. Building a good relationship with co-workers is very rare. Helping customers to the max."
good,"No complaints, good place to work for. People are nice and friendly."
good,"I loved this company when I started working, the people were amazing and the job was easy to learn and keep up with the same routines. Learning and keeping up was a huge must in this work field."
good,"a typical day at work includes: greeting customers, directing customers to specific aisles of the store for prompt purchases, keeping my workplace clean and enjoyable,"
good,The common drug store. Helping customers on daily basis. Fun environment. Strict management. Usually flexible with life duties.
good,"Assisting customers is your number one priority along with being able to maintain the store by restocking, cleaning, and organizing it. Great environment for the workplace and coworkers along with management treat each other with great respect and hold a good standard to the company. Dealing with customers all day, especially angry ones can be a bit difficult and frustrating at times but it teaches you to enhance your communication skills and allow you to find solutions for those customers."
good,Had a great management team at Walgreens. I love working with medication. I love to help service others when they are in need.
good,"I spent my days working with some of them most amazing people I have ever met in my life.  The managers I worked with were always very willing to learn and take direction (for the most part).  In addition, my supervisors and managers were bright, intelligent, and experienced people that I was able to learn so much from, that I am truly thankful for the opportunity to have worked with them.  The people that I had the privilege to work with taught me so much, that I would not change my experience with Walgreens for anything in the world."
good,My detailed job description is in the resume.  Coworkers changed since I floated a lot but every employee I did work with were always professional and well trained.
good,"Walgreens is a company where you can get to know your customers.They value your help and any assistance that you offer. We strive on extraordinary customer care and customer service comes first. I've learned from Walgreens that people do actually appreciate  the customer care we provide. The fast, easy and friendly experience we have to offer. Management at my current store is different from what I was taught from Walgreens in general. I feel at this store everyone is right and there is no room for change or improvement because others feel they don't need to improve. My old store that I spent most of my management career at was a totally different story. Everyone appreciated everything and you were told when you are doing an excellent job and when you needed to improve on things. The hardest part of my job is not being understood by customers lets say like when we have certain policies that we go by and they simply refuse to agree with it or don't even care about policies. The easiest part of my job would simply be, putting a smile on customers faces. Knowing they were happy and had a good experience with me. I Love being able to help people in any way possible. Yes it is just retail but people feel appreciated when we can provide them with a good quality visit and help them with any thing they may need."
good,Didn't have a full time position open and need more hours. Also needed better pay.
good,"When I work in the morning the first thing I would do is the smart count. The smart count is checking the inventory of medications that is not counted for. Once that is done I would do the Third Party Rejects and Refills To Soon and help customer's as they walk up to the counter. I would also check in the order that's delivered in the morning, as I'm checking in the order I would be filling prescriptions while my second tech is helping customer's. Before my shift ends I would do the order for the next day."
good,Walgreens is a very nice place to work. The customers are always fiendly.
good,"I have got good experience in the Retail and Health care domain,Learned good knowledge about US health care pharmacy applications"
good,"Work environment can be hit or miss depending on each store management. I was fortunate enough to have an outstanding Store Manager. Her ""can do"" attitude led to a great place to work where everyone is similar to a family."
good,From the start of the internship I was provided with a lot of guidance and opportunities. I got the chance to shadow a lot of executive level directors. In addition I got to work on different personalized projects within different HR departments within the organization. This internship allowed me to see and understand the structure of the HR department within a large corporation.
good,I enjoyed my time here at walgreens. Learned at lot of knowledgeable this there. The crew was very friendly and made sure they taught me all that I needed to know for the work place. This location is very busy so I worked at a fast pace. Accuracy was required. I learned something new everyday. Overall this was a productive experience.
good,the company needs to be more professional in their every day work flow
good,The most enjoyable part is meeting new people. Co-workers were great group of people . the harest part was not have a set schedule.
good,I enjoyed making people smile by providing them with the best customer service
good,The hardest part of the day was closing during seasonal hours.
good,I loved working for Walgreens I started off as a service clerk. After about a year and a half I was promoted to the cosmetics department where I shortly became the supervisory over that department. I ran that department with great success for four years. Before leaving Walgreens to focus on my growing family I was a Pharmacy Technician. Though out my years at Walgreens is where I learned all of my customer service skills. I learned how to keep records of inventory. Pushing sales was a skill I learned all will motivating a crew of 5-7 people. Working for Walgreens also gave me my first hand managerial experience.
good,"Entered new patient profiles and prescriptions into medication input software system"
good,walgreens has many diffrent area from the photo lab to the pharmacy enjoy the cycle of managering diffrent area.
good,"- Greeting, organizing, upkeep suggestive sales, and dusting."
good,"good working hours , learn how to all types of forklift, co-workers were good to work with"
good,I enjoyed working there. My favorite is the Liquor sore manager.
good,I loved my boss at Walgreens. This was not a career by far but it put food on the table.
good,ok place to work. have had lots of negatives and positives with this company
good,"Holiday schedule is not great due to retail aspect. Company recognizes employees for good merit. Most management easy to work with."
good,"Enjoyable place to work, you meet alot of people, flexible work hours, lots of locations to choose to work at, profit sharing,  401k, medical ins., family oriented company, annual raises with annual review, great opportunity for advancement. (It was along time ago not sure of any changes in benefits). I really enjoyed working here."
good,I loved what I did it was my first job and it was my own money I was making a spending trying to show responsible
good,"we work together team work is big way to get a lot done. I have a checklist get that done, and as the day go by I will help with customers and solve their problems or answer any concerns. I love when I have someone thanks me for the help and comes back because of our service. The hardest is truck putting up over a thousand at times in two days."
good,"A day at work is fixing any problems that are brought to our attention. such as down servers,switches or phones."
good,"How to work with large printers and problems that came upi in a timely manner.  I learned to drive industrial pickers."
good,"My typical day at work consists of filling the cooler, running the photo lab, having to help cashier when the line gets long, work on resets, help out in the pharmacy when someone calls in or when it gets busy. I have learned how to do everything in the store except the cash part that the managers do. For the most part the management does a good job. Every few months lately we have had a different assistant manager. I enjoy seeing some of the same customers everyday and getting to talk to them. One of the hardest things about what I do is constantly not being able to get certain things done because of a few of my coworkers. One of the managers is constantly changing their mind on what really needs to get done first and assigns new things all the time."
good,"A typical day at work would be taking care of the customers who come into the pharmacy at seven am. This store is non stop, and rated ElPaso's busiest pharmacy . The pharmacy manager is a good person"
good,"I loved my job at walgreens. I did everything from picking to unloading trucks. Pallitizing totes and staging them in another area. Loading trailers,and also full case pick."
good,"it was ok, pay isn't that great if you not management, but that wasn't the direction i was going in, while employed there"
good,"Receiving prescriptions from customers, entering prescriptions into records system, filling medication with correct drug, assisting healthcare providers and patients with questions and concerns, referring inquiries to the pharmacist."
good,Every location varies but in my experience my coworkers were all dedicated to doing a good job. Management was very understanding and patient.
good,"Doing Photo orders, cash handling, customer assistance, stocking, merchandising and inventory control."
good,"I was originally hired on at Express Pharmacy. Two months later, the owner decided to retire and sold his business to Walgreen's. At first the transition was a struggle, trying to learn new systems and different operations. This was my first pharmacy Technician job. I have learned a lot from this company such as billing, basic filling of prescriptions, what to say on phones, and how to please every customer. I really enjoyed this job. Management, coworkers, work flow were all great. Hardest part of the job is when I voluntarily resigned for family reasons. Most enjoyable part was the coworkers and customers."
good,"typical day at work would be calm rush hours once in a while "
good,"Great company, great people! It is hard to get to for someone that lives in the city.  I would have definitely stayed in the commute was more convenient."
good,Enjoyed working there learned a lot of new things throughout the years of employment.
good,no room for a raise or a higher position the people are nice and the company under pays you but expects you to work harder than what they pay you.
good,It's a very fast pace job you have to very detailed and alert to make sure you help everyone accordingly. Management work with my schedule during the time of me going to school.

good,"A typical day at work would be customers coming in and asking questions about products that they needed. Counting registers to make sure that all was even, and everything was accounted for.

good,great for hours that need to be worked. when people call off is the hardest part.

good,"I really enjoy working at Walgreens. I've learned how to deal with the different attitudes of the customers, how to handle stressful situations, and how to work as a team.  I've worked with quite a few different managers, and everyone of them were easy to get along with and working with them enjoyable. The others were hard to deal with, because of their attitudes ."

good,"It's definitely hard to stand for long periods of time, but once you get everything down you love you atmosphere. You team sticks together and you may have a time where you may have disagreements, but they all are resolvable. I enjoyed my co-workers and store manager. if I could I would def, work there again. I wish I could have talked to customers longer about certain products and give them complete understanding about everything asked of me to explain."
good,Served as a supervisor for the work at home division. Focused on employee training and staff schedules. Good environment.
good,While working with Walgreens I was mostly working as a cashier. I was able to experience the beauty advisor position in which I was in charge of introducing a new product each Saturday of the month. I really enjoyed my co-workers and management. They made the atmosphere so friendly and fun. The least part about my job was the hours. I was not able to get as much as I needed.
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for...if you are a Pharmacist or in management. Other than that, there is really no room to move and advance in the company."
good,A typical day would be challenging yet rewarding as you met new faces.
good,"I highly enjoyed my time at Walgreens.  I like getting to know the customers, helping them with their needs, and making their day a little easier.  I thrive in a customer service setting and this was a great place to be."
good,"Room for advancement, enjoyed the photo lab the most, but worked in all departments of the store."
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for at the time that I worked for them. The pay was a little low but benefits where great !
good,I learned that you can get along with anyone/everyone as long as you treat them like an equal.
good,"I worked in several high volume Walgreens stores therefore, the amount of work required to successfully run the store was great. However, this resulted in a great deal of knowledge regarding day to day operations and more being obtained."
good,"Great place to work at,learned a lot from my managers and from co workers.The hardest part of the job was shipping and receiving because we had to lift heavy boxes.The most enjoyable part of the job was to work with other people and enjoy talking to customers and giving them satisfaction."

good,"Keeping current on all KPI's"
good,"Walgreens is a nice place to work, and everyone employed at Walgreens is very nice, and works together good. A typical day at Walgreens would include greeting customers, helping customers find items, answering phone calls, ringing customers items up, and handling money."
good,"A typical day at work depends on what time my shift is. The shifts I enjoy the most are mornings. There are a lot of responsibilities during this shift that makes the day go by quick. I am able to stay busy the moment I walk in the door. Taking in our daily order, check off we received everything and start filling the prescriptions located in our out of stock or partial fills. I power fill as much as I can before doctors offices open. Next I'll go into unresolved exceptions in the queue involving having to call insurances, doctors or patients. Requesting refill authorizations and contacting prescribers are also important first thing in the morning."
good,Throughout my years at Walgreens I can say there are moments that are good and bad. One good thing about working at Walgreens I can truly say that when you get the trust of your co-workers they are willing to help you in almost any situation. One bad thing I do not like how college workers within the company are treated. Meaning if a worker their is a college student and they do not continue to work at least once a month to stay on Walgreens payroll they will considered that as you (the worker) quit. In which you did not quit and once you go back there to work again you get paid at the minimum wage instead of the pay rate you had at the time. I can say that I learned how to definitely multi-task when it comes to working covering a co-workers break or down a individual for a shift. The hardest part of working at Walgreens is trying to communicate with other co-workers when you are trying to pass on a task you were in the middle of doing. As for the most enjoyable part of working at Walgreens I can say is having the bond with certain customers and knowing that they actually care about you.
good,"A typical day at work required me to have knowledge about company product, location of the product, and to handle money transactions."
good,"A cmpany with many opportunities, and management is very helpful"
good,"A typical day at work is either helping with customers on a daily interaction with them. Also, putting out intventory that comes on trucks 2-3 days out of the week."
good,i learned several stuff including data entry because if someone was out i was able to fill in for them
good,We were always busy and had stuff to be doing. My co workers were always there to lead a helping hand we worked together as a team
good,my experience with  walgreens has been very good and they have give me a lot of skill I need to be successful
good,"I really enjoyed working here,. I was sad to see it close down"
good,"Customer Service, time management, organizational skills, cleanliness, safety"
good,"my typical day at my job is a busy day but it makes me feel like am worth something, what I learn when some customers are out of the country and I see interesting people everyday, management help my guilds me through really hard stuff cause every day u lean something new it helps me grow into a better person. the most I enjoy about my job is that am always busy I don't like to sit around I like to work and keep my self busy at all times am the other reason I I enjoy my job is I make people laugh and my co workers laugh."
good,Working here was a great experience You got to be up close with the patients and everyone was very helpful. Team work was number 1.
good,"A typical day at work for me would include printing photo orders from the computer and filing them in the correct places, doing smart counts with the Telxon, printing price changes from the AS 400, ordering merchandise, and putting out inventory, completing resets and revisions, which was probably my favorite part of the job, running the cash register and answering and transferring calls. I learned so much from my time with this company. I learned how to use the AS 400 computer system along with the photo printers that I had to work with. I learned how to order inventory and scan out returned or broken item."
good,"Pros: Make long term friends with co-workers and managers, great benefits (Healthcare, PTO, paid sick days), can be promoted easily, many hours, works around days off needed."

good,I enjoy working with the customers.  Great company to work for.
good,"Workday begins with a start-up meeting during which team members are giving their daily assignments and plans for the day.  Atmosphere is friendly and promotes team work. "
good,"A day consists of answering phones, spending most of your day as a cashier, and giving excellent customer service. I've worked at two different 24hour stores and had great pharmacy managers each time. When beginning this job, you will have PLENTY of training, even though it's sitting in front of a computer screen that teaches you how to use intercom plus, it is very specific and a big advantage when getting behind the counter. Although there is no shift consistency and no bonuses and only yearly races of 15 cents, this is a very secure job with opportunities to become a senior pharmacy tech and even move the corporate level."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed this job. It was a fulfilling to be able to interact with customers and answer their questions. I also enjoyed learning the different aspects of each department. I learned how to process photos, and was also given the opportunity to work in the pharmacy on many occasions. It was rewarding to be treated as a competent employee who could handle all the new tasks thrown my way."
good,"I learn how to take care of customer, and i learn how to use the cashier. I learn how to put bar code on product when stocking is being done."
good,Great company with good pay and benefits. Great hours and schedule. Very demanding job with long hours.Keep the employee in very good shape.
good,"Most of the time I was working at my own pace, but on weekends things would get busy and i had to rush something but I always re checked my work on free times just so I don't give my self and my co workers more work."
good,"I love my job but feel I am stuck in my position and paygrade. In bigger cities if a position opens up at another store locally, you have a chance to advance .With only two local stores and all upper positions secured, I feel I may not advance.But Walgreens and management are really great!"
good,"I loved the job itself, you have a set schedule it never changes. The job duties for every night was the same so once you get into that rhythm the job becomes second nature. The Walgreens I worked at though, had poor management. The shift leads were awesome but the management was terrible. I worked over nights from 10-8am for almost a year and they were unable to work with me and put me back on days after asking for 3 months. I don't miss the job that much but the customers were awesome."
good,"Busy day pulling old prescriptions and rx inventory. Between working with customers and answering the phones I posted and put away orders."
good,"One would mostly work as a cashier however sometimes you worked in every area of the store.  You check out the customers,sign up customers for the company rewards program as well as up sale a item at the register. I would also have to train all new hires onto the cash register.  Management would set goals for the up sale and would assign other tasks like stocking,cleaning or doing resets or remodels.  Co workers would help you in your daily tasks or give you input. We would all do the stocking of the store and work in each other departments.  The hardest part of my job was not meeting the high expectations set for the up sales by management.  If one did not meet the unrealistic goal of selling said item 100 per shift then management would be tough on you with verbal coaching.  "
good,"A Typical day at Walgreens included stocking shelves, ringing up customers, cleaning around the store and assisting and greeting customers. I Learned a lot with this being my first job. I learned discipline, time management, and about customer service. I had great co-workers and supervisors. The hardest part was in the beginning when everything was new to me. However, after the first few weeks I was very comfortable here. Overall, the thing i enjoyed most about Walgreens was meeting new people every single day."
good,filling hundreds of scripts daily and multitasking.  I learned to multi-task.  Management was very nice.  Some coworkers were nice to be around.  Hardest part was to deal with rude costumers.  Most enjoyable part was working the drop off window.
good,I learned alot about leadership. The most challenging part of the job was motivating employees to put 100% into their work although they were paid minimum wage.
good,"This job is not for everyone. I worked there for over 6 yrs and for the most part it's a great company to work for.  If you like holidays off and a set schedule look somewhere besides retail.  If you don't mind rotating shifts and like the hustle and bustle of the holidays then retail possibly is fir you. There are a lot of whiners on here, pay is great for management, and not bad for hourly employees. Yes some days you feel under paid and other days you wonder why they pay you to do so little. I gained so much experience from Walgreens and it has helped me in my career since. I have often considered going back."
good,"I would greet the customers. handle cash."
good,"-A typical day at work is I would go clock in and proceed to the register where I help customers that know me and enjoy sharing with me their daily life stories.  Sometimes I am asked to stock merchandise or put up sale price signs."
good,I enjoy photography and working at the photo lab at Walgreens was a pleasure.  I was able to transfer from NC to NJ which was a great opportunity to relocate and stay with the company.
good,Walgreens was truly a great place to work while in high school and college. I was close with co-workers as well as the assistant managers. I gained respect for the assistant managers and enjoyed working for them and assisting them with their tasks. They would also return the favor and would assist me with my daily tasks if needed.
good,"offered a lot of incentives for the employees, not very flexible with the schedules, a lot of room for advancements and offered bonuses"
good,"A typical day at work is helping our guests to live well, be well and stay well. It is all about taking care of the guest and that is what I enjoy most about this job.  I love people and I love to make them happy."
good,"I have over 10 years of extensive bilingual customer service experience both in retail and in the pharmacy department. I am currently the Sr. Pharmacy Technician at Walgreens. I deal with customers, vendors, medical insurance, and doctors on a regular basis. The most enjoyable part of my job is the every day interaction with my customers, especially those who I can help by obtaining their medication at a minimal expense."
good,"working as a 1 hr photo specialist. and being a cashier when need it. "
good,"On a typical day I would clock in, and go to station either being the front cashier or in the beauty section. In the front we mainly would focus on customers and during free time making sure everything was organized up front such as cigarettes and displays. The front was my favorite part of the job. I like interaction with people and seeing people smile. Even if someone was in a bad mood I could always make their day and change their mood. "
good,"Stable work environment "
good,"After working at 3 different stores, each one was like working with a 2nd family. Had its ups and downs, but we were always a team and made work a happy environment."
good,"A typical Day at Walgreens consist of having a 5 minute meeting and catching up on current events in the Walgreens world. I have been with Walgreens going on 7 years this year and there has been many changes throughout the years that I have worked there. I have learned many new policies and procedures such as cash handling, working on the sales floor, the cash register, the pharmacy. This company stays up with technology and how to be competitive with their competition when it comes to sales and the pharmacy. The management staff is very helpful and they are always  willing to train the employees to be a better employee. The hardest part of the job is the physical work, such as lifting and climbing. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and helping them with their needs. Walgreens encourages all of their employees to have excellent customer service so that we can continue to have repeat customers and so the customers feel welcomed when they walk into Walgreens."
good,I have gain a ton of experience working for Walgreens. It has taught me how to manage employees and how to manage a store successfully.

good,"Great place to work to build experience,Top products,Really good first job to have,Management is top notch highley recommended."
good,"Days we received warehouse was a busy day. With taking care of customer's needs and stocking my days went by fast. There were times when I had to help in the pharmacy. Other days we had other tasks to take care of suck as: resets, changing endcaps and side panels, setting the promo aisle. I learned a lot fairly fast in a short three years I met my goal of being an assistant store manager. Things from basic cashier transactions to resets and revisions to assigning tasks to employees, working out warehouse in a productive manner, making work schedules for team members. I enjoyed everything about my job especially the people I got to work with.  The hardest part was keeping difficult employees on task."
good,Cleaning and maintenance towards each machine and processing photos.
good,"Enter prescriptions into the computer, fill medications, and sell medications to patients. Daily insurance calls, and daily inventory"
good,The associate were so supportive and helpful. It was an wonderful experience.
good,"In the pharmacy we have a work rotation so your not in the same spot all day we rotate every 2 hours cause it can get very stressful. I usually start out at the out window which include ringing patients up and taking in prescriptions, next is the drive-thur which includes the same job duties.We also fill and type prescriptions. I learned a lot working in the pharmacy everyday. We had to learn medical terms, billing and coding, drug names and uses. I didn't have much interaction with the managers they would stop back and check on us occasionally. Working in a small area I was very close with my co-workers not only were they my friends but they became my second family. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult patients. Most patients are sick and not feeling well so when a problem arises they are not always understanding. The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with patients and knowing that you made a difference in their lives."
good,"The work is challenging and has excellent benefits."
good,The job of a retail pharmacy tech is fast paced and challenging. The amount of skills necessary to perform the job functions are diverse. One must be able to recall large amounts of information about medications as well as state and federal laws regarding legal dispensing of controlled and non-controlled medications. Patience and compassion along with high customer service is of utmost importance.
good,"Working at Walgreens, I learned a great deal about developing photos and providing excellent customer service. "
good,typical retail setting. while filling prescriptions and filing insurance claims
good,Overall Walgreens is a great place to work. Over the past 5 years this company has helped me grow as an individual and learn new things about myself. Management has been very helpful and has worked with my availability which has allowed me to finish school. Everyone is great to work with and we all have become a family in a sense.
good,all i can really say about this place is that i wish it wasnt just for my externship. i really enjoyed all things here.
good,"Customer service, cash handling, filling prescriptions, telephone communication with insurance companies and doctors."
good,Walgreens is a great company going through many changes both good and bad. It is hard to move up in the company.
good,"It was a good pace no matter the job I did a great one, loved to continue challenges and helping whoever and whatever comes my way"
good,A great job to have if your a single guy and have no prorities such as a child since working football and other events takes time.
good,I really enjoyed working for Walgreens however I wanted full time hours and never got them.  I also didn't like the hours of working late in the night then have to turn around and go back to work right at the opening shift.  I really enjoyed the staff.  I felt appreciated by management was always praised.  I learned how to be a great pharmacy technician by working with experienced Pharmacist.
good,"Its a challenge having to deal with some customers, but overall its a good place to work. The management is not bad at all, I guess once you do what you suppose to do its not a problem."
good,fast paced retail environment was a lot of fun. lots of room for advancement. excellent managers

good,"Great place great management and professional atmosphere, I ejoy working with the public"
good,"I've started working for walgreens about 4 years ago come february however due to new changes in management and pay and benefits...it may not be for much sooner. As many people should know,retail right now stinks...there are too many things they are changing to make you work more for less and less pay and sometimes make you feel like what are you working here for however the management does recognise and the company tries to when it does. Overall work day depends on who your working with and the dept. your in.The front can tend to ether be very busy....or very boring...this also depends if your in a 24 hour store or open/close mainly because there is a lot more to do in an open and close due to the fact that there is no overnight help and a lot of the cleanup is on you for your alse and what not. cosmetics is really just there for sales and help with ic3's (aka:more than three customers/cutting down the line) but this may change from store to store depending on how things run,but basically its just stocking and sales of cosmetic and keeping your aisles tidey,for open and close you MAY have to clean bathrooms...where i live most do but again depends on the store sometimes.Photo is where most people enjoy working as do I.A photo techs normal duties are to fill the coolers of course check and print photo's as well as offer assistances for photo related or MINOR electronic help (were not best buy even though im told we should be with some of the things we help with) and do what managers assign you with like filling or creating displays and generally being on the floor helping customers"
good,"Stock shelf's, help customers, unpack, unload."
good,"I enjoy my job, I enjoy my co-workers and my customers make coming to work all worth it. I love what I do and it always helps coming to work when you actually enjoy what you do."
good,"a typical day at work steady pace. learned a lot with pharmacy and handling with customers. management are great workers who help out with personal and work related issues. hardest part about the job is trying to help a customer while in a very upsetting position. most enjoyable is helping the customers as much as I can to get a good rate for there medication, helping look for an item, getting their meds in a reasonable timely manner."
good,My typical work day varies from day to day. On the busier days the main focus was making sure the customers were satisfied. On the days when we were busy our focus was to make improvements around the store to make it a better environment for our customers. I learned many of things from working at Walgreens but the one I value most is how to work in the pharmacy. I was able to get very familiar in the pharmacy and now I can take my skills and experience further. My co workers and managers were all very hard workers and we all worked together as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was making the customers happy.
good,"A typical day of work. Helping prepare food, clean and prepare tables, customer service. I learned how to talk to customer and provide great customer service. The hardest part of my job working late hours. I enjoyed been in a friendly environment with great co-workers."

good,"Excellent place to manage . Having the right attitude and putting a smile on your face is a daily task. Empowering, trusting and leading people is the most effective thing I did as a manager ."
good,Walgreens is a good place to work is you are single or have no kids because the schedule varies nights and days. And you never have a set schedule...I learned a lot of things at walgreens and i loved the co workers i had. Management was awesome at my store. Hardest part of the job for me was working nights a LOT because I am a mother of 3 and married...Enjoyable part of the job was the customers and the regulars at the store.

good,Working at Walgreen's I have learned many tasks to help me expand my career in any way I choose to go. Management can be worked on in the 17 years I have been employed. My co-workers are good with help each other out when needed. The hardest part of the job I would say is been cursed out by a customer when you are doing everything above and beyond to help them. The most enjoyable part of my day is the customers. Helping them and assisting them in their needs I love to see the smile on their faces when their happy!
good,I had a great time working here and have a continued friendship with a girl who I worked with there who still works there.  Everyone there were professional and a joy to work with.

good,"The staff is friendly and very helpful to the new employees"
good,"A typical day at work was busy, productive, challenging, & enjoying."
good,"I stated here as a front end clerk as I started college and worked my way up into management. Retail management comes with a lot of sacrifice. Weekends, holidays, nights are all a part of the job. When people need to shop, we are there for them. Walgreens is open 7 days a week 365 days a year. "
good,It wasnt the right place for me. I got bored easily especially when it is slow. Mangement team was great!
good,In a typical day I am responsible for all departments and management of staff to assure a productive and friendly working environment. The most challenging aspect of my job is knowing which call to answer first when several are created at the same time and handling them quickly and proficiently. I enjoy my daily customer interactions the most and helping each person as a unique individual have a memorable and enjoyable experience in Walgreens.
good,"A typically day at work would be very busy, but also mad it fun."
good,"a typical day at work would be  greeting customers as you enter the store making sure they're doing well also speaking to all of your employees working with you that day. Going through out the store making sure the crew from last nite has all there duties completed. Working at walgreens had prepared me for real world management style that I could us any where in the world...customer service job 1, record keeping, balancing time between home and work. Hardest part of that job was changing over to a 24 hour store but change was good, being adaptable to change help me in my career as a executive assistant store mgr."
good,"Depending on whether or not your working in a 24 hour store or not and the amount of revenue your pharmacy produces is a big factor in working for this company. Fairly relaxed job with always something to do, the most enjoyable part for me would be the ability to always put a smile on a customers face"
good,"Came in and turned on photo machines so that they could warm up. Went and got my drawer and counted it down.

good,"A normal day for me is coming to work about 30 mins before I am schedule. Getting ready, mentally, for work.

Working at the register, I greet every customer with a smile and ""Hello, how are you today?"" I check out customers, and ask if they have our rewards program and if not, ask if they want to sign up for the free program. While I do not have any customers I tend to my other duties, such as organizing and facing the items in my department, processing film orders when I am working in the photo lab, and helping out customer who are shopping, giving them input on some items I have used or know about. The management here is good. There are 2 management, shift leads, that I really enjoy talking to. They don't take advantage of me. The store manager is one of the nicest managers I have ever had. She understanding and if I can't do something she helps me out. My co-works, on the other hand, are awesome. There are about 4-5 co-workers I can really trust. I can tell them anything from stuff about work to some things that are going on in my life. Those co-worker, when working with them, really help make the day go by faster and less stressful. They help each other out with everything. The hardest part of my job, is the customers. Most of my customers are the nicest and sweetest people, but I have some that are just rude and they make my job harder. Couponers are ones that cause a lot of the issues. But with having a good management at work, it helps take the most of the stress."

Learning to 'close' a conversation, after the question had been addressed, and adapting to verbiage required for conversations was difficult.

good,Relieve 2nd shift pharmacy. All the usual accoutrements of retail pharmacy practice. Management were good people as were my co-workers.

I also train all new people who come to Walgreens to work, I am responsible for cash and handling cash accurately. I also can check in vendors, and many other management functions. I believe that I work really well with my co-workers on any task that they may have to help them complete it, or simply direct them with any questions that they may have. I help them create a better display, by helping them market their products more appropriately to get the best customer response, and sales.

good,Walgreens was my externship site once I completed my course training. I completed 200 hrs.
good,We worked towards company goals by meeting company quota or aht ( average handled time ) and error rate. We were challenged by our manager to see if we could make the goal. That was the hardest part because we had to type accurately and with low error rate. My co-workers made the work environment fun to work because we could talk about what we learned and help each other with or aht and error rate. I also enjoyed listening to music on my iPod which made the day go by a lot smoother.
good,"I've worked for Walgreens since ''05'' and there always seems to be some type of change each week. Not saying that change isn't good, but too much change can be a headache at times. Everyday I go to work and there's a new program they're trying. What has me upset enough to write this review is, they say they want you to advance in the company, but every time I've tried its something new. Now reguardless of how long you've worked for the company, they have it to where you can only make up to a certain amount depending on your job title. They say this is to encourage employees to advance in the company. How are we going to advance when they change the job titles and eliminated management positions one week and next week have a freeze on positions? I work hard when i'm at work and don't appreciate a limit being put on my wages when i've committed myself to this company for soo long. It's soo frustrating. I've had recommendations from my store managers, but it's always something when it come to taking my advancement a step forward. I don't think they considered the employees who have families like myself and can only work certain schedules and therefore don't have the flexibility to be in a higher position. Why take their hard work and then put a limit to how much they can make to support their families? There are committed employees who's worked for 20 years as a cashier and thats just fine for them, because thats what works for them."
good,"Walgreen's is a place where customer service is priority number one. They pride themselves on, short check-out lines, and a more personal feel to the drug store experience.

good,Always exciting to work along side of the pharmacist and learn new things everyday. Enjoy working with my coworkers and the customers as well. We are very detailed oriented and work our hardest to satifsy our customers.
good,"I am choosing to write about the hardest part of the job, as that is the topic that I can write the most about. The worst part of the job is the bad people that you will encounter. All of the other tasks are almost fun, but negotiating with an upset patient is really a trying part of the job. The patients who are upset, or plain rude, really make you feel terrible about your job; If you can get past that, and have faith that youre doing your best, you can disregard those bad experiences and continue to be productive. In other words, dont let them get to you! Other than those intermittent ""arguments"", the position is really fulfilling!"

Members of management and co-workers help me see how my jobs fit in with theirs for the whole picture. The hardest part of the job is lifting and moving heavy items such as cases of drinks. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the customers and trying to meet the needs of the projects they are working on.

good,"I worked in a cubicle answering phones and filling out the data on the computer. We were a mail order company for Walgreens where the customers filled prescriptions 3 months at a time. I filled prescriptions for existing customers and took complaints from the ones who hadn't received there medications or something had been wrong with the order. I made an issue for each complaint and followed through until the issue was resolved. My co-workers and I got along great, there was a lot of down time on slow days so we got to know each other. The managers were also our friends, it was a nice workplace. The hardest part of my job was talking to sick people and people who were dying, it was hard not to take the thoughts home with me. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers out and of course, having conversations with them. What I learned from this job was empathy , the experience taught me a lot about human nature."
good,Customer facing and developing memories! Photos make people smile! Great team! The hardest part was machine maintenance! Enjoyable part was enjoying the smiles on the customers faces

good,"I have worked for Walgreens in four different states: Texas, Ohio, New York, and California. Each store is different and has a different atmosphere depending on management style but the one objective that is always number one is customer service. For the most part you have co-workers who work and give their all, which makes the job easier when everyone is doing their job. The hardest part of the job is when someone is slacking off or does not do there part, that leaves more for everyone. Customers are the most enjoyable part of the job, because they are thankful and appreciative of the help and service you give them."
good,"In working with the members of Walgreen's pharmacy and its immediate public, I was able to develop important time management skills that have continued to benefit my personal life. On a daily basis, patients/customers would need prescriptions in a timely fashion. However, several variables (Doctor's offices/ Third Party Agencies/Pharmacy Inventory) existed that would sometimes present problems for the patient. As a Certified Pharmacy Technician, it was my responsibility to successfully solve these issues and in a timely manner. A great learning experience."
good,"i start my day putting the machines together and then start the orders that came down over night. i learn something every day i work here weather its in photo or about the store and sometimes the customers. For the most part my coworkers are pleasant to work with but some of them do not pull their weight. The hardest part is doing my job on top of others, as well as dealing with certain managers that give no respect to me or other coworkers . my most enjoyable moments are when i am able to finish a big project and having good conversations with guest."

good,"A typical day a work included having exceptional customer service skills, being productive and reliable, getting the job at hand done and going on to finish other jobs, there is always something else that needs to get done. I learned many things while working for Walgreen's one of the biggest things was becoming a team player and learning to adapt to the ever changing adjustments that have taken place over the almost six years I have been with the company. Management was great, always willing to offer assistance when needed. The hardest part of my job was dealing with upset customers. The most enjoyable part of my day was getting to know the customers and their wants and needs as well as getting to do something a little different everyday."

good,Fun place to work for with many opportunities to grow within the company. Nice place to meet customers to help find products for their personal needs and provide information for quality customer care. Love working with the vendors and staff at the store.
good,Walgreens affords me the opportunity to learn good customer relationship.
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work they are flexible with hours and great job stability. A typical day would involve doing deletions making dr calls, typing filing and sellijng prescriptions. I have learned how to handle customers in any situation, my co workers are generally ok to work with but they gossip a little to much but I tend to overlook that."
good,"sale,cashier,cust.service,bookkeeping,receiving,shipping"
good,"It is a typical retail job, with plenty of work to be done during the day. It can get rather slow during the morning and evening."
good,"I was with Walgreens, approximately 2 years. It was a great place to work, back in the day. I have to be honest, I have not been there in many years, so I cannot speak, on how it is to work there now."
good,Managers let you know what needs to be done & you go and do it.
good,I worked here while in college. The staff was great and scheduling was very flexible. I advanced my position quite a bit while working here. Management was great!
good,"The management is fair and helpful, there is room for advancement."
good,I enjoyed helping customers with their medical and beauty products.I got to meet a lot of new people in my neighborhood.
good,"I had a great time there, it was fun, and was hard work. I liked the people and the customers. The only problem I had was during my first day the employee had to stay with me for an hour, which was fine, ( since I had mild Autism ) But they didn't even do that. So I was just there, basically not doing anything, until someone came."
good,"Pros - try to get you moved up quickly"
good,We always had a great time but when it was time to work it was time to work. This environment was serious. I learn a lot and I'm very grateful for the ones I met along the way.
good,For me a typical day at work is Stocking the items we need or organizing items making things look neat help the customers out and if your finished what your doing early u clean like garbage or sweeping
good,"Walgreens puts their customer's above all, but not always their employees. They don't focus on valuing their employees. They have a high turnover rate and don't fight to keep long term employees and refuse to pay those long term employees more, while they have a competitive pay to new hires, willing to pay up to 2$ an hour more over minimum wage for entry level jobs, like a cashier. "
good,The coworkers were nice and management was good.  I really liked working here. I moved up fast and there were a lot of opportunities to do so. I definitely recommend working here.
good,The workplace was always friendly and prioritized the customer. The hardest part of the job was guiding customers to their correct desired product if they didn't know the name of it. I've learned to be very patient and attentive when speaking with customers.
good,I worked in 3 different Walgreens positions and by far they we’re all unique and good and bad in their own ways I worked there as an overnight shift leader but I started off as a cashier.
good,"First job, pays well compared to area. Job can be monotonous at times, but cross training into other departments breaks up work. Very hard to move into management or back into pharmacy based on age and convenience if under 21. Mandatory holidays maintaining regular store hours 365 days a year can be frustrating and lack of family time. Plenty of hours available throughout day."
good,"Great place to work with nice advancement opportunities. Decent work pace and hours, with great benefits. Great people to work with. Only Negative is that they are open 365 days a year, so you make work on Christmas day."
good,"Time here was exactly what I anticipated. High volumed, fast paced pharmacy location. Everyone there was respectful to me and the experience there made me learned about being more collaborative with other co-workers."
good,The company is a good company with great benefits. I have seen them grow tremendously over the years. Walgreens offers good job stability but the pay could be better.
good,This is a great first job and also a steady job as well. They tried to work with my schedule as a college student. The co-workers were cool and and the management was cool. It was a great first job and I can always go back when I need a job.
good,"Nice work atmosphere,detailed position.The company rules and regulations was simple and easy to follow.The manager was flexible with me with my work schedule."
good,"When I was working there I had people assist me willingly when I needed help. I also had fun while getting my work done and on time, the pay was also very suitable for the work being done."
good,This was a great place to really get out there and start working. I loved the people I worked with and how flexible my boss was with me on hours. And it was close to my house and wast to commute.
good,The job is very easy the pay is very low. The managers are very nice and understanding but when it comes to a pay raise it’s nothing they can fix. Understandable
good,never a moment where there's not something to do. There is room for advancement with this company. they encourage furthering your education. a lot of different tasks to learn
good,Walgreens pharmacy is perfect environment workplace. Customer services is on the top of other competitors. Technology associated with pharmacy system is accurate and easy to use.
good,"12 -20 patients per day, Generally liked the limited scope of practice. The staff I work with are great.  The services we provide for same day clinic appointments is great for working families to have evening  hours to be seen for an acute illness"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the day is the knowledge that I am helping patients to live and stay healthy, by making adherence calls and new to therapy calls. The most important thing I have learned is that we are there for the patient, they come to us when they are at their worst, I treat them with exvellent respect and admiration"
good,I don’t have to talk to patients. I’m able to wear my headstand listen to music. Leadership is welcoming and caring. Healthcare plan needs work. Could also pay more
good,"Easy and flexible hours, strong team and management, caring team members and comfortable work environment. This company has a good striving goal to help customers in the best of their ability and it really shows."
good,I was working there for a few months then I got hit by a car so I had to put in a leave on my leave my manager didn’t want to keep paying me for disability so let me go even tho I was injured and was unable to work and I had papers from my doctors saying I was unable to work
good,"I start the day by registering customers up front for an hour or two and then I'm free to go out on the floor. I check cooler temperatures, stock shelves, and pull expired items to be thrown out. I like to organize things mostly and I've learned to identify scams to help customers better."
good,"At Least at my location coworkers are very nice, don’t really have a problem yet. I worked at another store in a different state and I had a great  experience at that store as well"
good,It was a good job because it enhances me to do better every day because it’s a hardworking company. It was a great experience and I would recommend anyone to work there
good,"It's a great place to work, managers care about you. Nothing crazy. Have worked here for 4 years. It would be great i think with a business degree if you were going for a store manager position."
good,"walgreens is a great place to work with immeasurable opportunity for growth, corporate strives to keep their employees engaged and fully supported in every area of your life. The power has truly been placed in the hands of its team members as far as if there are any barriers to success, we ask our team since they are the ones who see what the real barriers are and what their opinions are as far as how to address and overcome them"
good,"Fast paced, cashier, pharmacy a busy one. Especially after holiday, front store busy everyday, always, fun place to work, together with co workers. Try this one"
good,Walgreens is a great place to work. I due feel they can train the staff better then what they do and instead of over looking some of the mature workers. Some workers only train for a one or two days and expect them to no everything
good,"Pay is fair, benefits are good. A lot of hands on experience learning to supervise a team. Learn to collaborate on a team and develop communication skills. Overall, a really nice place to work"
good,"I really enjoyed the 15 months I spent writing copy for Walgreens e-commerce in their downtown chicago office. The page was quick but very even; there were not a lot of ""fires"" and i was afforded the opportunity to pitch new ideas and work on a UX project that ended up winning an award. The team was very driven but not competitive...it really was an open and enjoyable place to work, with team members supporting each other and stepping up when time was tight. I would recommend to anyone in the creative field who is looking for a ""light"" place to work."
good,Things can get pretty crazy but the people you work with make it easy because they’re good at heart the days go by pretty fast.. There’s always something to do...
good,"Good hours,ok pay,whenever you have school or another job they are willing to work around your schedule. You can request days off in advance and you can be eligible to receive health benefits."
good,"Walgreens was a wonderful company to work for.I learned  a lot about merchandising,inventory, stocking  shelves and handled larfr6 amount of cash. Also deligate tasks to other emoyees."
good,"Pay is good"
good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreens. I worked my way up to Assistant Manager. Learned my customer service skills, management skills, positive culture experience making,  Hardest part was having to run it with little help."
good,Great Company to work for and you get promoted quick hard work does pay off. Management was great I worked with several new store manager's out of 5 all the guys were great then a female came along she was not friendly at all after she got there after a month few people found other jobs and left. Overall great place to work Great Benefits great discount.
good,"Really is a nice job to work at; great benefit, lovely coworkers, nice environment. I would recommend working here to others. Also have ample opportunities for growth."
good,"Great place to start if your wanting to go into the medical field, it definitely will give you a great eye view of the in's and it's of small encounters that make a big difference in the long run"
good,I learned a lot and I’m  grateful for the experience. I’m looking for a more paying job and to learn more everyday! I learned to have patience with consumers and help them with everything they needed so they can have a great experience and return again.
good,"I love working at Walgreens. The team gets along well, management has just changed so it's hard to say how things are going to go. We just lost the key shift lead as well since she transferred to a store close to home"
good,"a typical work day at walgreens would consist of mostly stocking and facing. things i learned were how to find were produces , how to face , how to think on quickly, how to ask for help. my most enjoyed part of work would be stocking. i really liked my managers they were very helpful when i needed help and just fun to talk to."
good,The company has treated me well throughout the years. There are plenty of advancement oppurtunities as well as learning oppurtunities.  There is a great mix of cultures within Walgreens which is refreshing.
good,"Working at a cash register, stocking the floor, running the photo desk were typical things at the job and help people get better at social skills in the workplace that will make better workers."
good,Walgreens overall is a wonderful place to grow and thrive. They allow to take classes to pharmacy technician. Management will show how to do things if you don't how to do it.
good,It’s good to have while going to school. It’s a little stressful and it’s a lot of tasks to complete. Managers are okay. I would like to see a little more improvement.
good,I loved working at Walgreens. So far it's the best job I've had. The managers were nice. If you needed help you just asked them and they would gladly help.
good,Patience is need due to all the children that come in after school turn the store upside down. Weekends or evenings on weekdays it becomes slow and average
good,"I have worked for Walgreens for 8+ years, 5 as a Store Manager. I’m currently on leave after having my son. I’m taking a full year off, which is really nice. I’m only researching other places to work bc working for Walgreens, for me, made work-life balance very hard. You better be prepared to drink the “koolaid” if you want to do well. I found it hard to relax st home. I was always in work mode or stressing about something work-related. Store Manager is the only salaried position in the store, so you can imagine how stressful that is- especially when they allow such little payroll hours to operate with. Overall, good company to work for, but be prepared to work your rear off regularly. Also, you’ll work 5-6 days/week as a Store Manager- typically 730am-5pm and 8am-12pm Saturdays."
good,Walgreens offers great benefits within the company and are usually very understanding when it comes to not only the customers but their employees too !
good,Walgreen's is a wonderful .company that allows you to gain alot of experience but needs to improve on the required breaks. So staff can stay focus. Workflow is Everyone business so we need all employees to be team players
good,I have no major complaints. It's your typical job. We just received a new pharmacy manager and I don't know what's to be expected with the change. Other than that I enjoy working at Walgreens.
good,"I lovedworking there but even working full time I couldn't make ends meet. I looked for a second job and found one working overnight. The new job meant that my availability at Walgreens would go from 7am-10pm to 9am-9pm. Walgreens managers would not let me change my availability and the new job was offering me more hours and better pay. I felt I had no choice, financially but to leave Walgreens."
good,"Walgreen as a great environment to work in. everyone is professional, team-oriented, and hardworking individuals. they offer a great benefit to the staff."
good,"As with any company Walgreens is profit driven. Changes to objectives come often but if you are willing to get on board with change at a moments notice, the company will notice. If you are a hard working employee with a happy attitude, a good manager will go to bat for you at all costs! Walgreens has always been very team oriented in my eyes."
good,"I like to stay busy so it's easy to have something to do. Stocking shelves, resetting an aisle, customer service, just to name a few. At Walgreens you get paid vacation which is amazing. Plus there's always room to grow."
good,"I was a customer service associate . I work where ever they needed me , but mostly a cashier. I loved working here . If I had a chance to go back and work for them I will."
good,"Overall, the Walgreens company has been an amazing opportunity for myself to grow and strive as a young, black female currently enrolled in college. Already having customer service experience from my previous job, definitely helped me fit in with the status quo of Walgreens and eventually led me to becoming a Certified Pharmacy technician as well. I got to experience the behind-the-scenes look of the pharmacy and insurance world. A journey I thought would never happen a few years ago. However, instead of turning down the position, I took the leap of faith to venture into a new field and learn and adapt that knowledge to what I already know and hope to accomplish as a future accountant."
good,"There is always something to do, and it's never too much or too hard. Easy to learn and enjoy your day, and shifts often go by very quickly.The only hard part would be dealing with difficult customers, but even then it is still all really easy as long as you follow training. It is always fun to interact with customers and peers."
good,"This was my first real job in college, and I would definitely recommend it. I was well trained, and given a consistent schedule based on my availability. The managers were understanding about my needs, especially when it came to school. Most time off was approved. Managers were very understanding and gracious to all the employees. Mandatory 15 min break for every 4 hours worked, and 1/2 hour lunch for every 6 hours worked. The break schedule was strictly adhered to. Opportunity to make overtime and small bonuses were provided every month. I was put on graveyard shifts almost immediately, since in New York, an employee has to be over 18 to work after midnight. The pros to this were that it worked out well with maximizing my hours at work and still being able to attend school 4 days a week, and it came with a small pay increase. The con was that the shift from day half the week to nights the other half started to negatively impact my health."
good,"I started working as a front end cashier a few years ago, started training in the pharmacy as a DH a bit over a year after, and because a pharmacy tech almost two years after I was hired. I love it in the pharmacy, I love the pharmacy management, and most importantly I love building a relationship with the patients that I've had the pleasure of interacting with over the last few years. Walgreens has adapted to my school and internship schedule, being very supportive of my future and I am very grateful for that. I will definitely be sad to leave."
good,I loved this job. The management and staff made it so easy to relate to them & talk. I knew exactly what was expected of me daily and what task I had to be focused on. This was an amazing job to have.
good,"Providing excellent customer service.  "
good,Calls are back to back with short breaks and lunch. I got free lunch for employee of the month & insurance is good. Left due to finishing school but I would recommend this job to anyone who can deal with angry customers. Overtime is available sometimes. You have to meet certain requirements to be a good tech.
good,"Coming to work on time"
good,"I was a trainee at walgreens. From what i know you have to be willing to learn and adjust to any job the employer ad manager gives you. You get one break and lunch a day so use them wisely. Dont steal anything, fight with anyone, or disagree with a fellow employee."
good,It was a fast paced but educating environment. You always where learning something new. The job always kept you busy and on your feet. I loved the talking to the customers and learning about their lives.
good,"The days are usually fast paced and hectic. Good team work and communicating with your co-workers is important to keep the work flow productive. "
good,I loved being a beauty adviser and helping women feel better about themselves and working with the general public is always interesting and I really enjoy it
good,"They were a decent company to work with and were flexible with scheduling, they also had a break room and gave a ten percent discount, very friendly team to work with"
good,New Walgreens policies regarding more numbers than the customer. Management does listen and take notice if you have issues.  You can work at any store since they are all on the same network and all stores are the same.
good,Community store that offers excellent service team member care about the well being of all customers everyone works hard and maintain Good store condition store recognize birthdays and anniversary
good,"I enjoyed working with not only my co-workers , but also with our customers. I enjoy helping in every way i can. Job could be hectic and tiring at times, but that is what i enjoyed the most, always something to do. Iv learned to be more patient and how to be sufficient and quick on my task, at the same time doing my job right, and giving customers 100% every time."
good,"Very nice place to work, not a lot of career advancement right now but company does believe in its employees and treats them right. A lot of employee empowerment"
good,"Coordinate, record, and process UPS service/replacements by scheduling orders, communicating information to the store managers regarding shipments and assessing supply needs.

Prepared and maintained detailed reports in Microsoft Excel and Word."
good,"Retail job so not family friendly. Advancement was good but starting pay was horrible, especially for an adult with great work experience. Turnover was high!"
good,"Productive"
good,"This job was to help me understand the job of a pharmacist better by working as a pharmacy intern. I got to carry out all the jobs of a registered pharmacist, with supervision and approval of course"
good,Nice people who are there to help you learn and have lots of resources to get advancement if you are willing to go to different stores. Nice management
good,Every one there is always there to help each other & well for the customers. Management is always there to back you up. There always encouragement to go forward in new positions.
good,Walgreens really believes in helping each and every customer. They're vast array of products makes it a simple one stop shop for most people. They’re pharmacists use all the knowledge they’ve learned in school to better help customers with they’re medical needs. Treating each customer uniquely based on their medical history.
good,Walgreens is a great place to work. I guess it matters what department you are in. Overall it is a great company to work for. The benefits are awesome.
good,Best part was working with all the TM's including the maintenance team production staff and managers. Different daily challenges and group projects kept the teams working together. I started out as tech in this facility and was given the opportunity to advance first as a Lead and then  into a management role.
good,"I’ll have to say I had a fun time working for Walgreens over the period of 1 year I spent there and customers were also very friendly and funny, I would recommend anyone that’s thinking of applying for a job there should give it a try and wouldn’t regret it."
good,Worked there for many years and was able to move my way up to management.  Only reason I left was due to co-workers and I wanted a Monday through Friday job.
good,Walgreens is a great place to work they do have a lot of thieves an they can be very aggressive some of the managers are cool there is a lot of favoritism in the work environment
good,Float position was very good. I worked with great teams. The management and scheduler was very good. Sometimes would have to stay past scheduled work time to catch up.
good,Great place to work if you are looking to have a job after school or are in need of flexible work days. Benefits are great for those who work over 30 hours.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walgreens. The stores really build a good sense of community and you meet a lot of lifelong friends there. It's typically an easygoing job. You can take things at your own pace, most of the time."

good,Opening and closing the store. Making sure all employees are working accordingly. Balancing and counting money everyday. Addressing customers and customers complaints.
good,"I have obtained multiple skills throughout my career at Walgreens. Everyday, you are expected to give the best customer service possible and go above and beyond for each customer. We were taught how to handle difficult situations and tackle obstacles as a team."
good,A typical work day includes coming in and asking the manager what the plan is for the evening. We usually have a task sheet that has our plan for the night on it. The goal is to complete all tasks and if we do not make sure we have a reason as to why we did. The most basic task we have nightly is to make sure that the product on the shelves are full. Other tasks will include make sure the floor gets cleaned in certain parts of the store. Check the dates on the products and other smaller tasks. One of the most enjoyable part of the job is the other employees. I get along with anyone I work with and that makes the shift go smoother. One of the harder parts of the job is trying to maintain 100% customer satisfaction at times. The store could be busy in multiple areas and during the evening the staff is stretched pretty thin and are not able to help every person in all parts of the store. We do our best to help every customer and we do and make sure we are professional about everything we do.
good,It was a great opportunity to work at Walgreens. I learned  a lot of things and it made me come out of comfort zone and get comfortable meeting new people.
good,Working in the pharmacy is a lot of stress. It is rewarding when you can help patients in any way you can. It is very interesting work and the people you work with are usually a pleasure to be around.
good,Enjoyed my time working @ Walgreen's my Mangers were fair  and helpful.Customer service is # 1 . Walgreen's is very friendly and helpful place to work and shop.
good,I enjoyed my time there and the people I was on shift with and most of all my customers who I got to know a lot of. I would of liked to have continued there only due to illness couldn't. but I got to like the rapport I had with my customers and most of the staff I worked with
good,"Walgreens is great, but as a pharmacy manager it can be stressful.  The staffing is not adequate at some locations for the workload.  Upper management is great to work with, but the company has to cut back because of poor reimbursement."
good,"Would recommend if you are looking for an entry level job with okay pay."
good,I didn't have any sort of high expectations for Walgreen's. I was hoping to find a more career based job but Walgreen's was my fallback option. The company was more than willing to work around my school schedule and still give me full time hours! I was more than happy to stay there and make myself comfortable at that job. I had a very nice experience and would highly recommend the company itself!
good,was part of a ready program. at walgreens. it was ok the people there where fun to work with. but over all it felt like more of a after school jop that a place to work. keep in mind i was not behind the counter in pharmacy. but most out on the foole
good,"- Nice work days."
good,"Being with Walgreens for two years has taught me a lot. For starters, it has taught me not to take anything personal especially working in the pharmacy. You honestly never know what you are going to deal with each day coming into work sometimes. Walgreens has also taught me patients is key, if you do not understand something it's okay to ask as many questions as  you need too. A huge lesson i had to learn is how to deal with change in the work place. Over the two years of me working at Walgreens, I had two store managers, 5 assistant store mangers and 3 pharmacy managers. Each one was different, so i had to learn how they worked and how to adapt to that change. It has made me a better person over time and i am so grateful for everything it has offered me."
good,"A very safe clean and structured company with many rules to abide by but you will be happy if you do your job which isn't very hard, they try to keep things simple and easy and Walgreens is always updating and keeping up with their business so a very good company to be with."
good,"My experience with Walgreens was an awesome chance. I worked for 10+ years with the company. I applied for a simple cashier job and was offered a chance to work in the pharmacy. The Pharmacy was like my family, they made it comfortable to work. the opportunities to advance was offered and as I embarked to move up the staff pushed and supported."
good,"This job was great, it gave employees chances to advance. It paid excellent for retail pay and I was able to afford taking of myself and have extra money for personal time. The hardest part of the job was drama between employees, and having more than one manager. The thing I enjoy the most was flexible hours and pay."
good,"Working for Walgreens was intense, but in a mindless way once you were familiar with the way they run their business.  Once you're there, you're expected to work through the day, though you're given two 15 minute breaks and a 30-minute lunch break."
good,"Overall I loved the job, its was a fast paced job. I got the chance to learn what it was like helping other people that was the most enjoyable part. The hardest part of the job was on my first day I had to help customers and I was unsure of where the items were, but I got the hang of it and was gladly helping customers the following week. It was one of the best jobs I ever had."
good,"Charge the merchandise, fix the isles, sweep and mop, do the films, help customers, stock up merchandise , pick up carts outside. Making sure everything is clean"
good,"The job consisted of mostly moving boxes,stocking,handling cash,cleaning restroom,helping customers,making sure every thing is straight in neat.the best apart of the job was the great mangers and co-workers I learned how to talk to people and communicate."
good,"The typical day at work is greeting the customers, cashing them out, receiving prescriptions from customer and collecting correct data, entering data into computer, answering phones, counting medication, housekeeping, stocking supplies.  "
good,Constantly meeting and making friends with customers that come in on a daily or weekly basis. Feels wonderful when you are able to help  out when needed.
good,"Walgreens is great. The people who work there are some of the best people I have ever had the pleasure of getting to know. The management truly cares for their employees, and have created a wonderful work environment."
good,A typical day is spent checking out customers and stocking. The customers are great. I also work with a good crew of co-workers. The hardest part of my day is when it is so busy that I feel like I can not fully help every customer that needs my attention. The best part of my day is when a customer has difficulty finding a product and I'm able to assist them. Also bringing a smile to a customers face.
good,"Its a fast paced job that almost anyone can do. I work with wonderful people. I have gained lots of great work experience here. I am trained to work in the photo department, in cosmetics ect."
good,"Walgreens is a very open company, willing to train and produce able and smart employees that tend to the customers' needs. Management works very hard to build a bridge between employees and upper-management. Looking for ways to improve and new ways to make the company more efficient and to overall bring a satisfactory experience, not just for the customers but for the employees as well."
good,"There is always room for advancement and support in promotions, it is a lot of hard work and it takes a lot of dedication to get there."
good,"It is a good place to work, it has the benefits for each employee. Your schedules are adjusted to your needs as a person. They give you recognitions, annual evaluations to raise your salary, and constant training."
good,This is a great company to work for.  Flexible working schedule with several different shifts available for those that have second jobs or school.  Can quickly become promoted with right mindset.
good,"I was a contractor but was treated as part of the team. They allow work from home options, team outings, and flexible hours. It appears to be difficult to advance to another department. Overall, it's a good company to work at."
good,"good place to start at, but not stay at.  benefits are average. depending on your store manager and assistant managers, can be a great place.  I would recommend this place as a supplemental income job."
good,"It's a multi-tasking job from being front cashier to stocking candies, doing temp checks on coolers/freezer, and taking outdated items, but I learned to be more systematic in accomplishing my task. We have regular e-learnings that help us understand our work better and how to be on the lookout for untoward incidents like robberies and safety precautions at work. Management updates us on our daily sales through 5-minute meetings. We have pot lucks in every occasion, and we have pulse meetings to know where we're at and what we can do to improve our sales. The hardest part is when I'm stocking up candies on the shelves or checking on outdates, and a customer is ready to checkout, so I'll have to be always aware and check the front from time to time."
good,"Typical day at work as a technician depends on whether your are opening, or closing for the day. When scheduled to open in the morning, make sure everything from overnight is prioritized, set up the pharmacy for smooth operation. When closing, leave the pharmacy as neat as possible, every trash is being taken out."
good,"Busy, fast pace , fun, prescription,  Inputting, insurance claims, inventory, filling machines, customer service , drive up, phone calls, filling, cleaning"
good,Started in 2004 as a cashier clerk and worked my way into pharmacy as a pharmacy tech and doing customer service. Got sent to Rutgers university on Walgreens behalf which they covered for Pharmacy training for 6 months and received my certification at district office.
good,You will get a lot of income calls. Supervisors will be nice to you if you are being fast with the calls and 95 percent of your shift you are on the phone.
good,"Management is one of the key factors of me staying on so long with Walgreens.  They have really reshaped their culture so we have more support from management and our ideas are really heard.  We come up with our own solutions to problems and we really work as a team here.  Coming to work sometimes feels like you're just hanging out with your friends.  It is also very busy, so you must be able to keep up with demand and be productive.  Customer service is a big deal here."
good,"Great people to work with who teach very well. However, the place is very fast pace and does not allow for very long lunch breaks. I was able to learn alot."
good,My experience with walgreens has been exceedingly positive. I'm currrently in a position where my main objective is to learn and the management is always open to helping me do that. There are a couple experiences I want to learn that aren't practiced on a daily basis at my pharmacy but the pharmacists are open to talking about them and how they would handle certain situations.
good,"I have the best, most concerned and understanding, laid back pharmacy manager ever. He's great with all the customers and employees. I couldn't ask for a better manager!"
good,Walgreens provided me the opportunity to learn and improve as well as provided encouragement for growth in my career. It is very hectic and fast paced.
good,"typical day at work is data entry, filling prescriptions, billing insurance, answering phone calls and making sure our customers are satisfied at the end of the day."
good,"I enjoy working as a pharmacy tech.  You get holidays off and are paid more than the people up front.  I like management at the store I'm at.  At a pharmacy, as a tech, you can't really go any higher.  You get 10-25 cents wage increase every few months.  You can also get certified and get paid more.  You can become a senior tech and probably get paid more.  Overall it's a nice place to work."
good,"Walgreens provided great job security, but with many job challenges. Working in a retail setting is a great mix of  fun customer interaction and frustrated or mad customers.  Their frustration is frequently with other facets of the business or their own doctors or insurance, but as the visible face of health care at that moment you've got to deal with it. Over the many years that Walgreens employed me I saw many changes in the business model. We were provided with the best working computer system in the industry, but it was offset by the ever mounting demands on our time thru emails requiring attention from upper management."
good,"Everyday there was always something to do."
good,"depending on the location, this place can be busy. its not a bad place for a 1st job. i learned a lot in my younger years about punctuality, communication, tidiness and how to be professional. i also had the opportunity to work for one of the best managers I've ever encountered in my entire working life."
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for. When I first started with Walgreens, I considered it to be a dream job. My schedule was very flexible and balanced well with family life. As time went on and management kept changing, my schedule began to fluctuate and became more challenging. But I was still comfortable and happy. "
good,"I had this job while I was in high school and college. The hours were flexible, and the people that I worked with were kind. I would highly recommend this job to anyone who needs their foot in the door."
good,I quit Walgreens to go back to school and received my certification as a phlebotomy technician. My schedule for school didn't fit Walgreens schedule that's why I decided to leave Walgreens.
good,"I worked at Walgreens for 10 years. I thought it was only to be my summer job but ended up really liking the experience and stayed for a decade. They have small pros and cons like every business does, so it's up to the individual to decide if they like the environment. There's a lot of room for career advancement and the company for the most part does care a lot about their employees."
good,"My day is never the same, it is always something different. From resolving patient and client issues daily, working with our legal department to ensure contracts are in the company's favor and lastly working with the team to make sure we understand goals and what the targets are for the day. The most challenging part of my job would be making sure I keep my clients and patient happy. In the 11 years I have been with my current company, I have learned to always stay organized, take charge, and it best to collaborate to get the job done. The culture is much like a family. We work well with each other to complete daily task."
good,Usually very busy with calling patients and insurance. I did learn a lot about insurance and how they work when it comes to prescriptions and vaccines.  The hardest part was not being able to get chargebacks completed. The most enjoyable part was the people I worked with.
good,"Great job for kids in high school. Does allow for growth if you are a good worker and are willing to stay around long enough. I'm not sure about management now, but when I was there, management was friendly and helpful. They were a bit demanding with the expectation to greet every customer while checking out customers simultaneously"
good,A typical day at work is customer service. Making sure everybody's experience is a great one. That would be the best & hardest part of my day also. I believe there always room for growth in any job you do even if you are self employed.
good,"learn alot on the job. hardest tasks are the customers. good pace to work with, depending on the location. everyone is like family. if you do your tasks you can get through each day not being bored.  you pretty much know what you should do everyday"
good,"Either stocking to working the register, to cleaning the floors/ restrooms. to also working i there photo lab. wasn't really hard to work in any of the positions just never got help if i needed anything to help with customers."
good,it’s family oriented I love it everyone I work with is good people. Friendly place to work at too. We have a lot of returning customers. I love that fact that Walgreens does a lot for the community
good,Worked at a distribution center that was closed due to age. The facility was ran efficiently and was in an area that the workers and management engaged with each other both at and outside of work.
good,"Very Tight Knit Workplace. Everyone Is Welcoming & Great At Working Together. When You Find A Rhythm, It Makes The Days Go By Faster & You Can Get A Lot Done. "
good,"A typical day at walgreens would depend on where I was placed. On the days I worked on register I greeted customers, helped them locate items, scanned their items and bagged them. I also assisted with emptying the trash bins outside the store, vacuuming the front of the store, making sure all 13 carts were inside, wiping the counters, and facing the shelves to make the products look neat. When I was on the floor I helped with deliveries by unloading the truck, scanning the items in, and stocking them onto the shelves or in the stock room. When I was on floor I also swept and mopped the floor, assisted customers in finding what they needed, and counting the register drawers after the store closed."
good,"start at 6 am, open the store, places the drowse each one in the right place, received each order for each distributions, help in the pharmacy if the need help, I'm Certified Pharmacy Technician. Reset the section for different departments, cosmetic, candy, OTC medications. Pet, follow the book for more knowledge, learn every day different challenger, take care complaints for the customers,"
good,"The work is face paced, so you have to really be able to multi task. You learn the most through your customers. Overall, you have more good days then bad days."
good,"I arrive to my work in Photo Department and"
good,"Working at Walgreen's was a uplifting experience that could help almost anyone figure out what they want to do with their lives. Walgreen's gives you different options, stations and task to do almost each day you work there. ex. Cashier, Stocking, Photo department, Cosmetic department and Pharmacy."
good,I had a great experience working at Walgreens. As a whole its like working with family and friends. there is a lot of opportunity to move up in the company with a lot of hard work and dedication.
good,"Can switch to different store to pick up hours "
good,"Daily work as a member of management has its pros and cons like just about any other job. No job is perfect and while Walgreens offers many benefits, there are some negatives as well. As a manager one must confront many situations and scenarios team members will look up to you for. Customer complaints, resolutions, fair treatment, expectations, and even answering simple to complex questions are only a portion of what working as a manager truly is."
good,"I absolutely loved working for Walgreens. unfortunately, there is very little room for advancement within the retail world. had to move on to non-retail in order to find this."
good,"Worked for Walgreens for 30 years.  Held positions as Pharmacy Manager, Staff Pharmacist and Floater Pharmacist.  Relocated to Florida for my Wife's cancer treatments at the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa. FL"
good,"Good benefits, low pay, but overall good starter job. Good environment to work in. Great team work efforts. Good training in different departments which influenced a steady work atmosphere."
good,"It is a very demanding job and it is very fast paced. However, it is cool to learn the different drugs and some interesting facts. The only problem were the amount of time I spent in Walgreen's."
good,"Productive and fun stressful fast pacing. Time would go fast. Lots of computers work, working with  customers insurance, cashiers, counting medication, working with doctors on the phone. Customer service."
good,"unless you are a salaried ASM or Store manager the pay is not good.  you work a lot of bad hours, and weekends and every holiday cause they are open 365 days a year"
good,"Work can be very stressful, especially during flu season and at the beginning of the new year when the new insurance kicks in. You and all fellow technicians must do their job to keep the pharmacy running smoothly and providing the best customer service while following rules and regulations for pharmacy."
good,I worked at the number one store for 2 years so we were probably a lot more fast paced than most locations. Work was fun. Co-workers were great. Walgreens has clear advancement procedures. If you want to done into a different aspect of the business in my experience it was literally a matter of asking.
good,The managers work very hard and set a good example that trickles down and shows itself through all of the Associates.They care much about customers and keep the experience positive for customers as well as workers. They provide a good experience for first-time employees.
good,"we rotate positions frequently can be stressful at times but overall good place to work."
good,"The managers would bend over backwards for you; I was pregnant and just trying to get through and they made sure I always could get to work and get home; I didn't get over stressed or over worked.  Because it was a temp job thru an agency, they had the decision not to hire me after the 8 weeks were up."
good,Spent 15 years with the Walgreen company the last 12 as a store manager. Company is fair with wages and benefits. Most enjoyable part of my job was working and developing my fellow team members.
good,"I enjoy working for Walgreens overall, but I would not like to work for them long-term due to my personal career aspirations. If you are in high school or college, then this is the part-time job for you because there is a lot of room for advancement once you graduate. Hard work is rewarded within the company. It has been exciting to gain management experience."
good,Amazing work place easy work habitate enjoyable place to work loved the co workers certain management were cool others were just racist great work environment
good,At walgreens. we have no downtime. We are constantly busy. My manager is the best person to work for ever! She understands management and has brought our store all the way up to one of the top stores in the district. She understands her staff and makes it a good place to work and be happy.
good,"I currently work for Walgreens but I won't be for much longer. The pay is poor but they do give raises yearly and provide some decent career advancements, through pharmacy or management. There's a variety of tasks which keeps the day interesting for me. I honestly have enjoyed my time here, and I would stay if I could. If you can afford to take minimum wage for a year or so, the higher positions will open periodically and you will be handed an opportunity at some point."
good,Overall a good company. Fast paced and ever changing to meet the communities and companies needs. Opportunities to advance within and always looking for new faces. Willing to train those who want to move up and offer educational options for those who want to work pharmacy. Great team environment and family infrastructure.
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens. Everyone was like family and got a long pretty well for the most part. I hated to leave but needed to for health reasons. I would definitely go back there if I had a chance.
good,I was only there for 3 months due my internship program so I really get to experience a lot but it definitely somewhere I wouldn't mind working for in the future.
good,"Walgreens was a paced but easy job to do. Until my accident which caused my extreme sciatica pain, all duties were pretty easy. This job has a nice atmosphere, with easy daily task that can be done within the work shift."
good,"Walgreens makes alot of money. i think they should start the initial pay higher than what they offer. Other than that its a great company to work for, plenty of opportunity to grow."
good,"Days are fast-paced at my location, making the time fly by."
good,"The Walgreens I worked for was not open overnight but was an extremely busy store due to its location with a high volume sales environment.  The clientele was diverse: we helped many differing peoples based on race, economic situations, gender, orientation, political affiliations, special needs -- disability or other hardships, etc.  Basically, and this is a plus, our store was a melting pot of culture."
good,"Wallgreens is a great place to work. You are always busy and interacting with customers. The work schedule are very flexible, and if you want to learn more about the business you can."
good,Work hard and you’ll get far. Learn as much as you can because it’ll make your job easier no matter if your a cashier or within management. They also have great benefits and 401k which is a plus.
good,The most enjoyable part of my experience was the customer building long life customerd it was competitive which i love it had some great employees it also had great benefits for a company
good,This is a great place to work management is very helpful. Was able to learn The hardest part of the job is dealing with many insurances but it gets easier with time. Overall its a great environment to work in.
good,"I honestly liked working at Walgreens, my coworkers were friendly and my boss was awesome. It was one of the few retail places that said their employees come first and actually meant it. They know that life happens and my managers always worked with us to create the best work schedules possible for everybody."
good,"Spent a year here and it was fun, of course it depends on your team but still. Down side is the fact that Walgreen is open during holidays so that kinda sucked, but eh its a good job if you can look past that."
good,"A Walgreens manager is a very hands on role. The managers and leaders must be team players with excellent communication and leadership skills, A good manager can really make a huge difference in the culture, engagement, and service levels of their subordinates."
good,I applied for the position because of my experience in cosmetology. I love the team I worked with. The management was fair and forgiving. I never felt threatened or hostility in the work space.
good,"Always was great about working around my schedule. Boss was awesome to work for, but it was mediocre pay rate. As a pharmacy technician, it was a fast paced working environment, but the time went by quickly with work days like that."
good,A typical day at workI would get my money drawer then I would clean my work space Answer phones help stock. Ring up customers. The hardest part was when it is slow.
good,"Walgreens was by far the best company I have ever worked for, I was with them for 9 years and did not want to leave. Unfortunately like many other companies they go through change and the work environment changed drastically. This is probably the biggest reason for me leaving, they also eliminated positions and forced many people to get demoted. The work is so easy and easy to understand, anyone can learn the work they train you to do. Their is always room for advancements and they promote you very fast if you work hard and learn quickly. I really would recommend this company to anyone who is looking to make good money and learn in the process."
good,"Working here is wonderful. The managers are super attentive and always do their best not only for the company but for the workers as well. Benefits come once you have been full time for at least 13 weeks. "
good,The work environment at Walgreens is really wonderful. I really love our store managers and all the people I get to work with. The benefits are great and I feel that it is a good place to work for people of any age.
good,The store i worked at was extremely fast paced. There was only time for our lunch break and no other ones. It seemed like there was drama and back stabbing among the techs. We lost a few techs in a short amount of time and having to work short staffed became a new norm. The awesome Pharmacists made the work enjoyable but the constant fast paced environment and the drama was the hard part.
good,I loved working for this company. But lately they have slowly been taking away from the employees   It used to be great with incentives but over the years they have taken them away. Even certain positions along with the pay for that position
good,"Typical day at work: Review kronos, compass, emails, ledgers, train and develop employees, resolve customer issues, pharmacy operations as far as insurance issues,medicare processes,helping process flu immunization paperwork,  loss prevention and payroll."
good,"Customer Service, Merchandising, Inventory, leadership, good co workers. Customers is the most important focus. No customer gets by you without you saying hello."
good,"In a typical day, we filled about 500 prescriptions, which lead to a very fast-paced environment. Breaks were short, if you got one at all and usually lunches were eaten bite by bite as I went from the pharmacy counter to the back. However, I enjoyed this fast-paced environment. The days went by quickly and my team was fantastic."
good,Walgreens trained me and certified me for PTCB. great place to start off if you are looking to get into the pharmacy industry. Being a retail chain there are many locations so transferring is easy
good,"My work week is structured ,,   I have a weekly routine that helps me get my work done every week .. I have a great staff of Associates that are willing to do the tasks that are given to them"
good,"Walgreens is a great company, with great values that believe in extreme team work! They believe in investing in team members and really take interest in helping them advance."
good,If you like working in retail this is the job for you.  If you like working with the public.  This is also for you.  It has career opportunities for you.  It has benefits.
good,Walgreens is very strict when it comes to coupons. If you don't know your coupons then I suggest you not get a job there. Other than that it was a fantastic company to work for. I enjoyed working with the people that I did.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walgreens, but after a few years of being there they decoupled the company.  All the employees in the Danville Accounting Office were outsourced."
good,"The old Walgreens was a great company to work for."
good,"Working in my position at Walgreens, I felt appreciated and a part of a team. Each day I felt motivated to help my fellow co-workers and ensure quality customer service on top of my other duties."
good,Corporate environment and personnel strong.  Corporate culture remains current and focused on employee satisfaction.  Continues to evolve with the industry changes and remains proactive
good,Walgreens was my first job at a young age and is a good and flexible job for people in school. Good job to keep up the pace and keep you busy. learn allot of social skills and customer service.
good,I really enjoyed working part time as a pharmacy tech for walgreens while I was is high school. Management was always willing to work with my schedule and make sure that I was doing well in the work place.
good,"I like working here, just wish they paid more. Paid time off is great, you can always build up your time off. Some people could be more polite with their words. Like the people I work with."
good,"the only negative thing is they want managers to work more will less hours and employees. they keep adding on task and things to do with less time, I think we do so much with out recognition  or better pay."
good,Great place to work and especially if you’re new to retail. You learn as you go and it was never a day where I couldn’t handle the pressure. Definitely would recommend to anyone for a first job.
good,Working with and helping people is fun and rewarding for me. The management  there is well trained and friendly. Overall being part of the team was a very positive experience.
good,"Overall, I was grateful for the opportunity to advance in a company while finishing my degree requirements. The business of the store varied, but was consistent enough that the hours didn't drag. There was always something to do and I like to keep busy. My manager at the last store I worked at saw potential in me and fed that potential to where I could become an assistant manager. He had us work as a team, which was unique to all other jobs I have had."
good,"Good company to work for. Employees get along with each other, management is great, and the job is challenging. However, sometimes I think corporate only sees me as a number and recognition is hard to get."
good,"Walgreens is fast paced and crazy with the customer, but you meet some of the nicest elderly and some totally rotten elderly or customers that like to steal on a constant basis."
good,Everyone works as a team to get all tasks done and everyone has fun doing it. Excellent place to learn team building skills that will benefit your future.
good,A typical day at work I would learn something new about people and how to interact with the customers and satisfy them with the best of my ability while also maintaining an efficient work environment.
good,"I loved the employees I worked with, but the head manager was a bully and made everyone extremely nervous. I had flexible hours and time off. I still miss some of my coworkers."
good,"If you and your team communicate and/or work together the job is made easier. Management is part of your team as well, work with them and they will work with you. Communication is key here."
good,I've worked for Walgreens for 7 years. My advancement to Shift Supervisor was rather quick. But advancing above that has been a struggle due to constant changes and requirements. The area manager requires certifications that the company does not require to be considered for promotion to Assistant Store Manager. I feel as if cashiers and floor staff are overpaid and management is underpaid.
good,"The store that i am currently at could use better head management but overall great company. "
good,"A typical day can be very productive or lacking depending on what day it is and the amount  of customers enter. For the most part it's buzzing with an influx of people who are usually ""regulars"", how you approach them not only affects your day but theirs, and when they leave happy they usally tell others! you usually have a list of tasks to complete."
good,"You get to learn everything there is to learn about the profession in this place. Great teamwork experience and great resources to work with. However, budget available working hours should be re-evaluated."
good,"very fast paced, lots of metrics to meet, great computer system, great benefits, often expected to work short handed, for the most part an enjoyable place to work"
good,Working at Walgreens is a balanced environment. Like every workplace sometimes it gets stressful and sometimes its relaxed. Its main focus is great customer service and always going above and beyond to satisfy our customers.
good,"Everyone worked together. Great team work. Usually got regulars come in and were very friendly. The hardest part of the job, would be shoplifters.Over I loved working there."
good,"I learned the flow of what a pharmacy Tech does throughout the day. You're never not busy while on the clock. A typical day would include counting hundreds of pills, labeling bottles, and stocking inventory."
good,"Retail is retail, but being able to work alongside excellent coworkers and management makes the daily work day that much easier and enjoyable. Daily duties aren't unbearable with plenty of teamwork to go around."
good,I liked it here it was a little busy but I liked it. also when.  Not home. Walgreen's helped me push ahead.  I liked Walgreen's because it was joyful.
good,A typical day at work was normally fun and busy. I learned to manage a small group of employees. Management was pretty good. We had a good work environment. Everyone normally worked as a team. There really was not a hard part of this job. I loved  my customers and made friends with lots of them. I had a good relationship with all my employees also.
good,"Awesome.job to work for I loved it very fast paced which I enjoyed, also great learning experience in many aspects of work, I enjoy yes working with many different people"
good,Good management personalities. Directors and House Supervisors are pleasant. Co workers try to help each other and work well together on my home floor and others
good,One of the best places to work they know how to treat there employees. I would love to go back trust me but you do get sick of the customer service stuff after awhile
good,I've worked here for close to 3 years and have enjoyed everyone I've worked with.  They company treats you great and has good benefits. I started out in photo and worked up to the pharmacy and learned more about health care than I could have ever imagined.
good,"With many years with Walgreens, I learnt a lot from it, such as how to check availability of merchandise, receiving, and periodic counts merchandise with Telxon, an electronic device to aid my job. Maintenance of my departments to ensure no outs or lows. I also  learnt how to do photos, such as processing various types of photos orders. It is a fun job, you may never have a dull moment in the store,  every day is a new learning experience for me!"
good,"Customer Service"
good,"As an employer, they're pretty good. A lot of people start of as a temporary job, part time and make careers out of it. There is a lot of opportunities to move up in position as well."
good,"Working at Walgreens as a pharmacy technician has been a stepping stone towards gaining experience and moving on with the company. I have been with Walgreens for seven months now and the Rx staff have been very patient and helpful towards my advancement. "
good,"walgreens was a great place to work you learned something new everyday."
good,"This is a very fast paced environment with little to no downtime.  I've learned so much about customer service and thousands of medications and what they are used for, as well as safety measures of many.  I love working with the customers, that is my VERY favorite part of this job.  The management team is better than most places, not much to complain about for sure.  The hardest part of this job is being on my feet for 8-9 hours non-stop except my 30 minute break.  I love customer relations, and I try very hard to keep things filed and I am also very interested in cost savings opportunities etc."
good,"In a typical day of work, you are greeting and seeing a lot of faces and a lot of people. Over time you begin to learn your regular customers and what they usually purchase. You also learn how to talk to certain people. Some customers are easy to talk to and you don't have to be so formal but other aren't. By working at Walgreens I have learned that the Walgreens company wants to see you grow and they want to help you better yourself. for the most part the management at my store was very laid back but they still wanted you to get the job done, they put trust in you expecting you to do your job without them having to watch over your shoulder all the time. The work culture at my store was very laid back and fun but as any job we did have our problems. I think that Walgreens is a great first job and more people should apply for that company."
good,Working at Walgreens is a safe and fun employment that empowers you to better yourself in customer service and many different fields.You get customer interaction throughout the day and you build a familiar workplace environment with your fellow coworkers.
good,"After four years, I've never dreaded going into work. The store works well as a team, and allows for everyone to be included. The manager above the floor team members if very approachable, and listens to help with problems. The store manager sees the store employees as a family, and even has pictures of community activities the team has done together on his desk."
good,"I liked most of the staff I worked with. I did not like that this company was not family oriented. At the time I was a single mom and did not have the help I needed when I worked. I had no one to watch my kids when they were sick and it caused problems with my schedule. This job is great for people who want to keep busy though. Lots of things to do, between truck and stocking and helping customers."
good,I worked there for many years because of the employee treatment. Was always treated fairly and with respect. Was able to be cross trained on many things.
good,"Most days, loved the job.    Drove from store to store and everyone in every store was usually happy to see me walk in the door because I was the ""fix it"" man.  The oncall rotation was a drag though.  Had to constantly carry a large two way radio/phone.  Could get paged any time of day or night because there are some 24 hour stores."
good,This is a good company to work for.  I didn't like managers or supervisors to push an individual for more work while others were slacking.  The benefits are great.  I was there for quite awhile and watched the company go from family oriented to just business.  Lots of room for growth in this company and travel if you choose.  They did start giving incentives.
good,"company is good to work for, some employees are not good with customer service. managment is awesome.  the job title is very clean and easy to understand as well as directions."
good,"Working as an extern, I had a great mentor help me with my learning experience. Although a high volume pharmacy, the work culture was very relaxed and an absolute pleasure to work with"
good,Normal retail Walgreens. I was located at a Walgreens that was the busiest one within 50sq miles. Filling was nonstop and so were the customers until the later evening hours. We also had a automated dispensing machine that broke down on us and we had to manual fill all the backed up patients when it happened.
good,The work environment at Walgreens is friendly; co-workers are always willing to guide and offer assistance.   Tasks are diversified.  Daily duties are clearly communicated.
good,"A typical day at work from 8-4 consist of a slow morning from 8-10. At 10 a.m. it's when it usually picks up until about 8 in the evening. The things I've learned include Filling Prescriptions, putting in patient information, adding insurance information, managing inventory. I believe the hardest part of the job was handling insurance if they refused to help pay for a patient's prescription. The most enjoyable part was the other workers whom I had the pleasure of interacting with, especially with the Pharmacists."
good,WALGREEN'S is a great place to work and you can also move up in the company pretty fast it really nice environment and you get a chance to meet so many people
good,"My co-workers and myself work really hard to make sure our task and duties are done efficient and properly, but we do it as a team. That's what makes my job easier and keeps everyone in good spirits."
good,Great job part time job for students. Decent pay and teaches you how to be great at customer service which is needed in most jobs. Easy to move to management level in as little as a 1 year.
good,"Amazing coworkers who pushed each other to do better at the job every day."
good,its a fun place to work but the actual Walgreen's management are very rude some of them are racist and speak to people any way that they please. they give the shifts to the people that they like and will force people they don't like to close every night even though they have a family
good,fun place to work at. decent staff and customer but can get a little busy during certain times of the day. very helpful staff and sometimes difficult customers
good,Working as a customer service associate in Union Square you would see something new everyday. There would be no typical workday because everyday it was new customers with new experiences which made me learn how to handle different situations.
good,Very good place to work..it is busy all the time and never a dull moment. Employee discount is awesome and it is a very friendly place for workers and customers!
good,"Like most of the corporate world, this chain has been subject to many changes over the past few years. I think that, depending on the management team, and willingness to accept change that the staff displayed, it could be a blessing or a disaster. I often floated between stores, and some stores adapted seamlessly, while others are still struggling."
good,I have fun working and enjoy helping customers with their needs.  The staff are such a wonderful joy to work with.  I have learned so much about retail while at this job.
good,"As a full-time college student, Walgreens was a great workplace that provided a flexible work schedule. I was always able to receive time off when I needed it."
good,I think it treats its employees better than CVS. I liked the environment better.  It over works their people also but they staff better.  It also rotates its staff so you get to use all your skills.
good,"Completed service calls at stores, installs and upgrades,"
good,"the Walgreens i worked in was very organized, management was kind and always tried their best to keep their employees content, and being that at the time i was going to school, they were very flexible with my schedule."
good,"fun and busy place to work"
good,Co workers are great to work with and the daily tasks are manageable. I learned the skills necessary to advance in my future career and experienced many challenges that taught me how to react in certain situations.
good,"I do cashier and I do trucks and clean the bathrooms. I help customers with anything that they need and I also pick up phone calls and try to satisfy the customers on what they are asking for. "
good,"Management can be pushy but overall tolerable and welcomed. Great advancement opportunities, culture is friendly. Hardest part was dealing with anxious customers. Most enjoyable was you weren't alone. Teamwork was great."
good,This is a great company to work for. I worked here while in college and management was very flexible whir my availability. The atmosphere was fun and we always worked as a team.
good,"I like working at Walgreens, have been in retail most of my life, and enjoy the work, but am not to crazy about the corporate side of it. Politics have become a big part of the overall picture.   I have a lot of regular customers I've come to know personally, and for the most part enjoy my fellow employees. A typical day consists of doing all end of day reports and preparing the deposit. The rest of my shift is about the running of the store and getting it back in shape for next workday. This includes stocking, straightening, unloading warehouse trucks, and cleaning. Merchandising is my favorite thing to do. I very much enjoy resetting seasonal aisles, and doing new plan o grams. I feel that communication is one of the most important things, and don't always feel upper management does a very good job of this. I have to figure out a lot on my own, and would like a little more direction at times. I also like that not every day is the same. I'm always meeting new challenges, and am fortunate to be able to work in all areas of the store, including spending a good part of my time in the pharmacy. Customer service is also a key part of my job."
good,"Very friendly coworkers. My biggest complaint is that the job can get quite boring at times. If you want a job where you are busy, search somewhere else."
good,Great opportunity for advancement. I moved from cashier to management in less than 9 months. It is a very stressful work environment. Walgreens is very community oriented.
good,"The job is fine, you get long hours it's fun you do get a rush but you will be fine long you know how to have a steady pace. You will have fun. The management team is okay."
good,It's a good place to work. They have good management. It is very focus on team work and leadership. Everyone is very friendly. The hardest part is dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of Walgreens is working with a great team.
good,Scheduling is good but there may be some long hours.  Great ability to learn retail industry.  Your job consistently changes daily.  Unfortunately the company consistently wants you to do more with less resources and personnel.
good,"You work very hard, but compensation & benefits are actually quite outstanding.  Yes, I DO recommend this company.  Management (corporate) actually care about their employees.  Extremely solid financially.  Most of the big shots are pharmacists."
good,walgreens is a great place to work and staff are great . I leraned everything in a 3 day period . so that should tell u a lot ...................................................
good,I learned a lot about customer service and the importance of providing the customer what he/ she needs. I leaned how to work well with coworkers and how to communicate effectively.
good,"Walgreens has been an awesome place to work for almost 27 yrs...I have enjoyed the game of retail... I have learned so much about retail in my 27 yrs with Walgreens, from merchandising, hiring, evaluating talent, running the business and inspiring others to care for each other and win together..I believe at this time I am ready for an exciting change..."
good,"Compared to many other jobs that I have worked, Walgreens was a piece of cake! Working there included a friendly environment with endless opportunities to meet people with different backgrounds and opportunities to progress with the company. For example, lets say you started off as a sales associate, you could always cross train to become a pharmacy technician (paid for by the company), work there for a couple of years and secure a shift lead position and continue to work your way up the ladder."
good,"It seem overwhelm on your first day, but you will  get the routine by restock merchandise, helping customers, ring up customer's items. The management is fair that they will not being to harsh on you."
good,"I have been with the company about 2 years. My location is small which makes for a more relaxed work environment. We recently got a new manager which is not great, but its not bad either. As with any job, there are moments of stress, but overall it can be quite pleasurable. There are lots of opportunity to advance which makes going the extra mile worth while. However, with advancement comes more stress. Between keeping up with other employees and the customers, little time can be spent on the things you need to do which can cause head-bumping between you and your manager. That's probably the hardest part. It's all worth it in the end when you're able to provide customer service to someone and see that you've made their day."
good,"After working 11 years plus for the company I made this my career. The money earned was very good and the company has great employee benefits, including 401k, VIP, etc."
good,"Very fast paced, physically demanding job.  Very rewarding if you allow it to be.  The hardest part can sometimes be the people you are trying to help.  people can be rude."
good,The customer care call center is a great place to work for as long as you are willing to commit to your work schedule without accommodations. Every weeks we participated in events as well.
good,There is job security. It was a great work environment and it was clean. The people there were nice. I liked my time there.
good,Great for students and people who would like to move up in a large company. Management is great in some stores and not so great in others . Awesome job for people pursuing a job in the Health field.
good,"As a Customer service Rep. at Walgreens, you can meet great people and earn great pay in a 40 hour work week, but at times the tasks for the day can be overwhelming. Never-the-less... everything you do can be rewarded and is appreciated by the majority of management and Co-Workers. The only thing you can really hope for more than the environment is a better pay rate... which become better in time."
good,"A typical work day included an abundance of tasks, not all specific to your department. Though I was hired as a front end cashier, I spent half my shifts in the cosmetics department and cross-trained early on in the photo department. Though the days could be extremely slow, which was the hardest part of the job if occurring during a morning shift, as there weren't many tasks that early in the day to complete."
good,Walgreens was a great place to work when I initially joined the company in 1999. It has changed since then because it is no longer family owned.  It seems as though the employees are not valued as much. Employees discount is nice and benefits were great during the time I was there from 1999-2013!
good,Walgreens is a company that is continuously changing their culture in order to better serve their employees. Walgreens has made great advancements within the last few years that has lead to wonderful opportunities to those in management to be able to build their staff with greater ownership and empowerment.
good,"A typical day of work at Walgreens was challenging in a good way.  It was not unexpected.  I left because I could not get my transfer approved, when I decided to move out of the big city."
good,"A typical day at work for me would include stocking shelves, ringing people out, putting away makeup, and helping customers. the management is great, just not enough hours. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help the customers leave with what they came in for."
good,Great company for first job or those looking for something new. Seems to constantly be expanding and new opportunities are always available for different career paths. Benefits are more than fair compared to the market. The company culture is growing and beginning to refocus on the importance of employee engagement and job satisfaction.
good,"Walgreens is a pretty fast passed job, where you need to know how to work all the departments. That's something I really enjoy about working there, I get to learn how to do everything from photo to beauty. I spend most of the day running from department to department helping others with tasks and aiding in customer service. Especially when the photo department is slow. I manage everyone's lunch schedules and make sure the cashier is getting enough support. It is a fun environment most of the time, my other team members are nice and easy to get along with, as are the managers."
good,Great people to work with. Management knew how to get the job done. The management also made sure they took care of their employees along with their staff. Only moved on because the pay scale was a little on the lower end.
good,"For 7 years I worked for Walgreens. Based on my experience it has it's up's and down's. It fast paced and 80% of your job is customer interaction."
good,I have been promoted 3 times since starting work just over a year ago. They have great benefits and I love the environment.
good,"It was a fairly decent place to work, can get hectic as any retail store, management was okay. I learned a lot about how to deal with difficult customers, but I thoroughly enjoyed working with beauty products."
good,"Could be stressful somedays because of the work load and multitasking that needed to be involved, but fun and enjoyable most days."
good,"While working at Walgreens I was a customer associate, therefore I helped satisfy customers needs, answered the phone, stocked and straightened shelves, cleaned the store, and checked customers out. Through this experience it helped build my communication and people skills as I interacted with many people everyday whether it be coworkers or customers. I enjoyed fulfilling others needs while being a customer associate."
good,"Working at Walgreens I learned things about items I never knew, or paid good attention to. I loved working there you get to meet everyday people, even the unpleasant ones."
good,"I learned a fair amount during this job, given it was my first one. The average day was filled with usual responsibilities such as organizing and tending to customers. The management was fun to work with and had interest in the well-being of all employees/customers. My co-workers were a pleasure to be around. The hardest part would have to be the customer service end, and the easiest parts were the day-to-day duties."
good,"Keeping the front of store maintained and checking customers out. "
good,"I loved working at this place the best job I ever had."
good,"It was fun and productive place to work for. Great manager. i learned how to multi task, how to work efficiently with effectiveness. Management is great always encouraging and makes work fun for employees."
good,"A typical work day can revolve around a variety of items such as stocking, cleaning, checking dates on merchandise, helping customer throughout the store and/or register. Sometimes you may get a task that feels odd, but your never given anything unless they believe in your ability to do it. You can learn a lot of different things such as Advil and Motrin are Ibuprofen's where as Aleve and Tylenol are simple pain killers. The Ibuprofen's help with inflammation where the pain killers do not. Management tends to be good, but as you get use to how your manager runs the store. They are likely to be transferred out. Having multiple manager's in the store can be both a blessing and a disaster. It is great to have the extra help, but confusing when you are being given task by more than one manager. Co-workers tend to be nice. The hardest part of the job is how many things you may be given to do while you still have to help customers."
good,They really work with you and your everyday life. The company really strives to improve each and every year and care about your feedback as an employee.
good,"Overall, Walgreens is a great company to work for. They offer good benefits and an adjustable work schedule to balance work and family."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers find what they want and make them feel good about their shopping experience. I also enjoy working with my coworkers and help coach them into being great customer service associates.
good,"I have fun and always learn a lot. I love this company, they care about their employees. I just wish they would pay more because you have a lot of duties."
good,"The work/life balance is not bad, however the disorganized, random scheduling of managers can be very frustrating at times.  There are also some managers that are not detail oriented and do other things other than work while they are there, but there is a counter balance of excellent employees that I have the pleasure of working with every day.  The benefits are superb!  I just started using one of the health packages and I am looking into upgrading to one of the other packages that Walgreens offers.  The culture there is pretty laid back, but the employees work very hard.  As for the scheduling and work/life balancing issues, having alternating schedules every month would definitely be a better way of doing things rather than changing them every week."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens consist of deligating tasks to employees, while making sure they get done in an appropriate and timely manner. Track sales growth and loss, along with shrink issues. Retain customer satisfaction daily while sticking to company policies."
good,"At Walgreens, the company culture embraced diversity and inclusion of different groups of people with different backgrounds and skills. Each one of us feels empowered by the inclusion and the trust that they will deliver the desired performance in the advancement of the company overall business plan."
good,"fun and great place to work, manager is great, employees very nice and caring. Excellent pay, work hours varies but overall great place to work with great benefits"
good,"The people that I work with are an incredible team of employees with very like minded goals to make our store a better place for everyone. And though it can sometimes seem like overload if we do not have enough employees to run a shift, we manage to make it through the day. The management is very good, and my co-workers are as friendly as can be. But the work life could be improved with better payment and scheduling. It can be hard to pay bills only getting less than 10 dollars an hour. My employers are always finding new and creative ways to keep us motivated throughout the year and are always trying to assist in anyway possible to make our daily lives easier."
good,The hardest part of the job was not being able to assist a customer who didn't want to do any of the solutions I had to their problem. The great part about this job is the people you meet and the fast paced environment.We had many people from many backgrounds at my store.
good,Nothing big or special about the company or the culture. Getting promoted is based on who likes you and who you know. Even the most skilled and college educated make less than someone with no education that has been working for Walgreens for 5-7yrs. Clearly they don't appreciate an educated employee.
good,I would recommend job to younger peers because of technology constantly upgrading. Overall amazing experience working with staff and management.
good,"The Perrysburg Distribution Center is a great place to work at. With servicing 1000 stores from this location, it's never boring.  We have a group of hard working and dedicated workers. Ranging from the age of 20's to 60's. We work hard but have fun also."
good,"Working at Walgreen's was a wonderful experience.  Meeting new people, both customers and co-workers, was the best part of the job. The management staff was great and made work fun. Learning to process film and how to troubleshoot problems with the machines used to process pictures was very interesting.  The hardest part of the job was making sure products were in the correct locations and priced correctly."
good,Dealing with customers that have specific needs and helping them get what they want also running all aspects of the store and getting the employees involved has been rewarding
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work as an mid-level customer service associate or shift manager. A lot of extra duties come with these positions & there's plenty of things I've learned that can be applied to other jobs. Management is very good at following-through on the Open Door Policy as almost all issues get resolved pretty quickly. The hardest part of the job is knowing that your preferred department is not your guaranteed position. You could be hired as a Photo Specialist yet be schedule as a Beauty Advisor more often than not. That being said, I enjoyed the environment the most. A lot of employees end up being cross-trained for all departments which makes for a knowledgeable staff. Every Walgreens you walk into will also typically have a friendly & bright atmosphere, making both working & shopping there feel comforting overall."
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for with a lot of opportunity for advancement. At the time I worked for them they offered good health care, vacation, 401K etc.."
good,"Write a daily work list, greet customers and assist in the day to day needs of the business. Ensure proper ECC procedures are being practiced."
good,the coworkers were nice. The work was easy and the managers were super nice. The work was pretty bad on my legs but it was okay and I had decent hours. I ad to stay until 11pm at night which I didn't like that much.
good,"At Walgreens, I work in an environment where I feel I make a difference helping people. I work at a job where I get to be part of a team, work together with others to help people in need. At my particular location I work quickly and efficiently to help people in person and on the phone. Assisting people in finding products, placing orders on the internet, selling promotional items, and assisting high volumes of people both in store and on the telephone. "
good,Company is changing a lot. must do more with less. fast pace environment. get to learn the in and outs of running a fast pace retail store and pharmacy.  management tends to fare but pretty easy to tell that they fav. team members
good,Great place to work at got along with the personnel and had fun working with people helping the people out.And learned responsibilities and what comes first in work.
good,"There is always something to do. Sometimes standing on feet for 8 hours straight. Easy tasks. Manager is nice, and the employees are very friendly and we all work together."
good,"The people, my coworkers are always eager to see one succeed. Management is very understanding and helpful. A great place for anyone to work while attending school or on the path to achieving a goal."
good,This job has opened new doors I have experienced so much. Management is great they have helped me so much. Co-workers are my family.
good,"I worked in a small store where i got familiar with the customers. the store ran well the people were nice and the managers were not managers they were leaders. They showed by example and sweat as hard as the par-timers and full-timers. The customers were nice and the deliveries were on time and hardly any problems ever came up in the store. if i could id go back, but i have to keep moving forward and find something i could live and love doing."
good,"I was hired on as a cashier and was promoted within the year to Shift Lead. Advancement here is very easy to come by if you're a hard worker. I have learned many things here and one of them is that the pharmacy dept is ALWAYS busy. It's hard to get your own work done when they always need help. You try to balance out your store duties and the pharmacy duties because they're both important. One thing I wish the store managers would acknowledge is that we are working hard to help out the pharmacy, so if we are not able to finish our task on the floor, it is due to helping elsewhere."
good,"I loved working for Walgreens but after 4 years, I realized I had more potential and needed something new. I was in charge of opening and closing the store, making sure price changes were done daily, received multiple vendors a day, stocked merchandise, was in charge of 5 aisles (as were my other co-supervisors) and ensured they were stocked, faced, and ordered things we were out of. I was in charge of the safe, and making sure it stayed at its normal amount. I counted down all the drawers in the morning and at night. I even had some training in the pharmacy (counting pills, labeling bottles, cashing etc.)"
good,"Good company to work for. Not a career unless wanting to become a pharmacist, otherwise good job. Good training and benefits."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to sit down because at the time I was pregnant. Also my co-workers were a joy to work with too."
good,I started as a beauty advisor and quickly moved to the pharmacy. I received on the job training to become a certified pharmacy technician. I loved being able to help people get their medications quickly and accurately
good,It was a good experience with a lot of things that needed to be done in a short time. So there was little to no downtime and multi-tasking was key to doing the job well.
good,although the company is going through changes with hr the direct staff and management i dealt with were awesome. raises are pretty horrible but if you are looking for a place to advance this is a good company for that
good,"I enjoyed working for Walgreens. The main reason I am not still working for them is that I moved houses. My job included restocking anything that needed it, running the cash register, interacting with and helping customers."
good,The Pharmacists and other Techs are great to work with.  I continue to learn everyday.  I also get to interact with Store Management and they are very helpful
good,"Though the reasoning behind my leaving was unexpected and sudden, I would definitely recommend anyone to check this company out should they find themselves looking for a job."
good,"It is a very busy environment that requires me to work really hard.  Co-workers are great, always available to help each other.  The hardest part of the job is to deal with patients who are angry because of their insurances and it is hard to calm them down.  I really enjoy working with my manager, she really does her best to keep the busy pharmacy going."
good,"Stocking shelves, smiling, keeping customers happy. I worked in manly in the photo department but i was used though out the whole store. I enjoyed talking with customers and making them have a better day. My job was to please and make them happy."
good,"confirming the safe count and any money pick ups from registers, making sure the daily duties are being worked on, such as smart count, checking emails from the district/corporate, and setting a plan for the day."
good,"I loved my time at this company.  There were, of course, several policies I took issue with, but I feel that's unavoidable when working for a giant company.  My superiors were always available and helpful when I needed their assistance, and I have some of my fondest professional memories as they relate to my supporting staff while working for Walgreens.  If you can handle retail, this is one of the best places to be."
good,very good place to work as a single mother I need more hours and better pay to support my kids. Everyone is very nice and we all work together.
good,"I started at Walgreens as a simple cashier but within a couple weeks  they trained me over in photo (which was my favorite). Then they had me on the floor a lot. Then my manager says he was giving the Hallmark department to me ( which was terrifying at first) while stilling working register AND photo. I managed to work at every department in that store, I was even training in the pharmacy before I transferred to a different store. After I transferred the new store just left me at the register. I begged them to throw me into other jobs but they didnt. I was very disappointed. I enjoyed working so many different departments, there was always something to do!!!"
good,Doing my externiship at walgreens was great to be part of a dynamic team like I was already hired doing my pharmacy technician duties.
good,"I work at the pharmacy department. Normally, it's fast-paced and a lot of customers depend on the staff to get their medications. My job is to give the most customer service that I can possibly deliver."
good,A typical day at work for me is really slow because it was 3rd shift. I learned how to pick an pack at a fast paste. Management was fun they made sure we understood everything we had to do. The hardest part of the job was staying up all night. The most enjoyable part of the job was they showed me how to pack in order but at a good paste.
good,"Learned many new things as an Assistant Manager.  Gained the knowledge of inventory, displays, sales, payroll, scheduling, and managing the Photo Department.  The hardest part of the job was the numerous resets that had to be accomplished throughout the year due to the different holidays and also the retail side of the business during the holiday seasons.   I enjoyed managing and learning the different departments throughout Walgreen's and enjoyed working under different Store Managers."
good,"never a dull moment with my coworkers, run the entire front of the store. stock rotate product. help with inventory. provide guest service."
good,"Walgreens is a customer-based company that provides costumer's satisfaction. In addition, they also give employees flexible hours and good benefits."
good,Great place to work with wonderful benefits. Management knew how to interact with employees on a daily basis. Customer satisfaction was the main concern of the store goals.
good,"A typical day at work is starting in the drive thru when I first get there. Everyday I learned something new about people, insurance, and medicines. I love all my co-workers even if they get on my nerves sometimes. We all are like one big happy family. The hardest part of -my job is when I have tell a patient that there insurance didn't pay for a medicine. When a patient don't have enough money for all there medicines.

Setting up displays working with the Sims coordinator for any resets or recalls. Customer service by answering customers questions and directing them to item they are looking for or placing special orders. Management did not do a great job at times but not always there was conflict with many departments with insufficient employees or no one covering for lunch or breaks. The hardest part of the job is not having sufficient employees to maintain the departments at times it seemed as we where going out of business from lack of maintenance. The most enjoyable part was being able to help customers with the knowledge I gained or even translating for employees and customers."

They didn't hesitate to answer any question that I had either. I learned how to contact and speak to insurance companies and how to compound medicine. I even learned how to read chemical make ups too. The people and the pharmacists were amazing, They took amazing care of their employees too."
good,"I learned a lot of many details of variety duties. I like to work as a team with co workers and other staff. It is keep me busy being as Cashier, to wish the greetings the customers and service their  needs. The management of the managers taught me a good understand of my improvements and needs.

good,"It was a great setup. 8 days on and 6 days off. The 3rd shift got tiring at times but it was well worth it. Great management though exercised his authority, showed everyone a great amount of respect. Everyone was held accountable for his/her actions which I love.  Hardest part of the job was the holidays."
good,"You are treated like family here, everyone always has a hand reaching out to help. Any issues are dealt with promptlry. Opportunities to grow although promised are a rare occurrence."
good,"The overall job was an great experience but as for management it was very poor. The manager didn't know the difference from personal and professional. The manager had an very nasty attitude, and treated the employees as they were children. This is only the Walgreen in Dolton,IL. I've Transferred to different Walgreen and that is the only one I've been harassed at by the manager. I would not recommend anyone to work there."
good,"The workflow sometimes was slow at times but it was interesting with some customers i faced, learned how to communicate with others and great team work, management was great and also the co-workers where enjoyable always having a great time on what they do while working on helping out customers, but the hardest thing was to handle a tough customer but my co-workers helped me out and also looking for the correct drug name. the most enjoyable time was resting to get your mind fresh when going back to work."
good,if you get a good store the management and people are amazing. if you work hard and talk with your manager you can move up fairly easily. just need to know how to work interviews

This is also the most rewarding part, however, seeing as how much business the pharmacy brings in and how effective front-end/pharmacy alliance can be."

good,"Walgreens is an outstanding work environment.  The company provides lots of feedback through weekly one-on-one  to improve job performance, and the management team is extremely laid back.  Morale is good, because employees are made to feel valued.  Tenured agents are honored and respected, and these co-workers offer help, knowledge and advice to newer agents without hesitation or condescension . The best part of my job is helping customers. I have an opportunity to reassure them. The worst part of my job is when I am unable to resolve my customer's issue during the call."
good,"This was a good place to work to improve customer service skills, and to get a taste of work life as a young adult. My roll with the company would fluctuate, so I was able to learn different things on the job. Working the register I learned how to better handle money and deal with customers.

good,I had learned how to be better in sales and how to react to the questions you are trying to sell the customer.The co-workers were really nice and new how to work together to get the work done.

good,"I am always engaged with customers.  I inform customers on the deals and sales that are happening week to week at Walgreens.  In the cosmetic department, I ensure customers get exactly what they are looking for.  Sometimes, I have the same people come in to Walgreens. Those people I address by their name because I have come to know them personally. The work environment is lively and enjoyable.  Never a dull moment!  Each co-worker keeps the other co-worker going.  We are a team so, we act as such. As a Walgreens staff member, it's my duty to communicate with my co-workers to ensure that customers are taken well care of. The hardest part of the job is keeping an eye on every customer. Unfortunately, there are some customers to take advantage of your friendliness at Walgreens but, it happens.  However, the most lovely part of working at Walgreens is seeing those amazing people come back time and time again because they appreciate the genuineness of our store's customer service!"

I learned everything from working a cash register to entering data into a Pharmacy database. When I left they were in the process of transferring me into the Pharmacy as a Pharmacy Technician. I worked with beauty products as well, which every girl enjoys. The raises weren't all that great but it was definitely a great work environment. If I didn't move out of town I definitely would still be with Walgreens."

good,the job is stressful at times but it is extremely family oriented and gives you opportunity to grow in the company.
good,"They have good management, and they treat every employees nicely and same level."

good,"This is a great summer job and if you like retail management, they do have opportunities to advance.Each store is different but for the most part the staff is great. I would recommend this company to anyone."
good,"A typical day is busy taking care of patients with not just filling prescriptions, but also educating patients on how to take their prescribed medications. Following up with patients that are new to a drug therapy and counseling our patients. Also, administering immunization along with housekeeping tasks that are done to maintain inventory up to date. My co-workers and I are a team. We communicate and everyone has a part in keeping the pharmacy operating as smoothly as possible. The hardest part of the job is being short-staffed and not having enough personnel to assist with meeting the demands of patients. Through this tough part of the job I have learned to become more efficient. When a patient of mine comes up to me and thank me and explain how appreciative they are that's the most fulfilling part of this job."
good,"I learned a lot at Walgreens. It was not just a sales associate or photo clerk job, but I learned many other things while working here. I have been here for 8 years, all through school."
good,"I worked in many stores during my career with Walgreens. I met and developed  lasting relationships with great people. "

good,Great job for people that want to start off working straight from high school.
good,"Promoted to senior technician and expediter. When on shift, was lead technician and made sure all other technicians were in right positions and doing their roles correctly. Any questions on prescriptions and insurances were brought up to me first. the management was very friendly there and taught me  lot on becoming a manager or supervisor in my future. co-workers there were very friendly and the ones I taught were trained there were taught really well. The most enjoyable part about my job was helping people out with their medication and having the accomplishment feeling knowing I am doing soomething well."

good,"During my time at Walgreens I have enjoyed it.  They have offered me opportunities to learn and grow.  I would recommend this company to others interested, if you are willing to transfer to maximize career advancement."
good,"A typical day at work varied on the length of the shift, anywhere from eight to twelve hour day. Working in the pharmacy with minimal staff made some days tougher than others. What I learned was team work is very important and communication is key to any position within any company/organization. Being part of the management/supervisor team made me a stronger employee and helped me grow and strengthen my weakness. My co-workers were great! We worked as a team to get through the days tasks and we all were a phone call away if needed. "
good,"On a daily basis you would work with UPS by shipping an receiving, also pick up calls in regards to problems with the stores or guiding techs in any questions they may including payroll, store location, estimated time of arrival for parts. Management was awesome very flexible and we worked as a team, I learned how to use Lotus Notes, Word, Excel, Remedy, also did a little bit of technical repairs. The hardest part of my job was keeping items organized since many people grabbed items and didn't put them back. The most enjoyable part was working with Management they give me a list of things to do and allowed me to pace and finish these."

good,making sure you meet your productivity each day or night depends on your shift i learn alots the time i  were employed there. i learn how to train other peoples who have difficulity in making there productivity. everyone gets alone w one another especially the department i was in which was called L mod.the hardest part of the job was when distribution would kick in that means that every floor work load would double each day for at least 2 weeks. Sometimes even longer. they had several things that they would do for there employees by buying them pizza or giving out t shirts or other things for having no accidents.
good,A typical day at walgreens is greeting the customers assisting them in helping them find the items they need and making sure they have a quick and easy checkout. i learn alot of new things everyday because of the many people i meet and talk to on a daily basis. my coworkers are fun and try to help create a nice enviroment for the customers even with the different personalities . the hardest part of the job is also the most enjoyable job dealing with all the different personailties.

good,"I love Walgreens CPO,I have learned a lot within the year that I have been a Registered Pharmacy Technician. My managers are nice, I have friendly coworkers, and we all strive to do our best and be as productive as possible. I would say that the hard part of my job would be to meet the workstation goals, but I look at them as a challenge.

good,Working for walgreens in the sfl position you learn how do evey job in the store to make you  a well rounded employee.The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationship you have with your customers like a second family.
good,"Walgreens.com has great benefits however, management needs to uphold their promises, such as, giving employees 40 hours and the offer for pharmacy technician certificate."
good,"This was a great experience for me. You learn how to work well with groups, which is required if you want to succeed."
good,Walgreens is undoubtfully the best job I ever had so far.  Not all districts are the same but for the most part its a great company to work for.  Tremendous management program and assertiveness to remain an industry leader.
good,"When I am able to make my customer(s) happy, it enlightens my day. No matter if I am having a horrible day, I will never let my customer(s) know that. I have learned that sending a simply smile can change a person day around. The hardest thing is not satisfying the customer(s) because that is why I am there. I have to make sure that I let the customer(s) know that I am there for you them. Make sure that he or she was able to get everything that was needed."
good,I was working threw the temp service and i had gotten used to working there 40 hours a week then they laid everyone off around Christmas time. They called me back to work but i decided against it as i didn't want to start again and them lay me off again.

good,"A typical day at work includes verifying and fillings prescriptions, compounding, immunizations, supervision of pharmacy technicians, and inventory management."
good,i enjoyed working at Walgreens mostly because i was able to help people that need it when sick. Some times we had rough days and some day flow by like we was never even there. If you dont know how to multi task you definitly learn it there. Its about being quick and on board with presciptions and the time you spend on the phone with doctors or patients. About how long you take to feel a scipt.
good,"1. go over daily paperwork and cash accountability and correct any mistakes from previous day."
good,"Each day you go and help patients with all of their pharmacy needs.  From entering and filling prescriptions, to calling doctors and insurance companies.  You have to be able to work closely and cooperatively with the pharmacist and other technicians as well as, doctors, hospitals, patients, etc.  The environment is fast paced and can be stressful, but team work often balances that out.  I loved being able to help the customers with their every day health needs.  The hardest part is when you can't help to circumstances beyond your control."
good,The day usually is filled with customer service and merchandising. Always have interesting experiences with customers everyday. There will always be good and bad managers but overall working for Walgreens was fun.
good,"The one thing I liked most with Walgreen's was that everyone helped one another.  Our customers knew most by their first names, including the managers. Every day was different.  One day may be stocking or ordering.  Another would be truck day, which everyone loved because you were so busy putting merchandise away.  You were never bored, there was always something to do."

good,"Multi-tasking: Filled prescriptions, verified prescriptions, administered vaccines, Counseled patients on Medicare Part D enrollment,  answered and communicated with physicians.  Learn to work efficiently in a high performance job, Managed a staff of 5 and supervised several pharmacy  and technician interns.  Very supportive co-workers with different personalities; however,  we all work well. The hardest part of the job is not having enough time to counsel patients who require a little bit more time then the average patient.  To see the smiles on patients who have been counseled on diabetes or high blood pressure and are seeking more help from their physicians because of my intervention."
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for. Enough help to get all the work done and resources provided for completing projects and meet time requirements.
good,work is always busy but co-workers make it easy. Best experience to work asa pharmacy technician. too much too learn from work.
good,"It was fun working at Walgreens. You interact with all different  kinds of people. See me, I was a cashier and a photo clerk."
good,Walgreens is a fabulous place to gain education. The pharmacists put a lot of time into helping techs gain their certification. The company provides books and pays for the certifications.
good,I love my job and helping the customers but the company has decided to do away with my postion causing me to have to step down with less pay or leave.
good,"Wonderful job to have. I loved the people who were very friendly and happy to assist. The enviroment was dedicated to patient services, and I liked that. Sometime I wish I never left, but sometimes there is no ideal room for advancement and making that decision to leave wasn't easy. I learned that Health care can be rewarding, but also frustrating. Hardest part of the job was realizing that metrics don't always comes first, the patient does."
good,good people to work with and flexible schedule.Room for advancement.
good,"Work under the supervision of a floor manager or pharmacist to deliver quality patient care and excellent customer service, fill prescriptions, use the Intercom Plus computer system to process prescriptions and assist patients, handling phone inquiries, process insurance information, entering patient and customer purchases."
good,"At work it was comfortable and relaxing. Respect was giving to all, help was always available if needed. I learned how to throw and receive a truck within a  hour. I was shown how to restock and to read the meter when the store receive new items. I enjoy working the floor helping people get what they need from the basement if it wasn't on the shelf. There was no hard part of the job for me  cause i was always motivated to learn more. I enjoyed every project and task i was giving and when i was done i didn't mind helping the other co workers in the section of the store."
good,"A typical day at work the store is busy. At Walgreens because it opens at 7 a.m, they make the morning shift and night shift pack out majority of the day. I worked the night shift so I would pack out anything that needed to be packed out at night, face whatever aisles that were given to me, when called for help (which is IC3) I would go to the register and help my co-worker who was on the main register cut down the line when it was too long. While working here, I've learned a lot about cosmetic products facing the cosmetic aisles once a week. There's a lot of different products female's use for their hygiene and hair to look the way they want to look. The most important thing I learned was the way the company functioned. Eventually in life I want to own my own retail business and this experience was a good learning lesson for me to remember in the years coming. The hardest part of the job to me was when the morning shift workers half the time would be too lazy to finish their work and leave me and others extra work on top of the extra work we already had to finish or schedule for the day. It wasn't truthfully a problem but when you have to pack out three large boats of products, plus your returns throughout the night and face, that's enough already plus whatever they left. Management throughout the store were cool but very business like. My store manager was a very relaxing but strict type of person. I've learned a lot from him by his decision making and his direction he wanted the store to be in."
good,"Great place to work, good environment and great co-workers."
good,great place to work.dealing with all the responsibilities can be stressful but overall great.
good,I thought that Walgreens was a fantastic company to work for (at that time).  The store was brand new and the manager and assistant managers worked with the employees.
good,"Quite a busy work environment, and sometimes very understaffed.  But it still allowed for one on one patient contact when possible.  One downside was always being on the phone with prescribers, insurances, etc. that took away from time allowed for counseling.  Worked with many great staffs, and the workflow works really well."
good,The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult people but that comes with life.
good,"Everyday was busy no matter how slow the store was. There was always something to do no matter how  much people complained. I learned a lot of responsibility and organization. Seeing that's what we had to do, it was easy for me to bring home to real life. I went through 3 types of Store managers and they were all different in their own way.  The assistant managers, came and go on a 6 week to 6 month basis. Some better in some ways where the others didn't seem to know what they were doing and relied on the work of their co-workers (non managers). The hardest part for me was holding up the work of most of the managers that came into the store and dealing with their jobs when it wasn't my responsibility i wasn't getting paid for that. The most enjoyable part was reconstructing the Cosmetics and Hallmark area and getting to know the people around me."
good,"The day started with counting a drawer to open a register, depending on where I was needed, I would start to work on the designated department. Everyone had goals to meet on a daily basis and management would do a friendly competition with the whole store. I learned how to be able to give great customer service, to be open minded with everything that came with the job. How to be a team player and how to be a leader when needed. How to solve problems and avoid them. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a great team."
good,a day at Walgreen's would consist of stocking and custom services. Unless you work in photo then you would have to about machine mateiniace. The management staff are extremely generous and encouraging. If you ever have a problem most managers will always be there to do there best to make any situation you have easier. My fellow co-workers are friendly to a fault and we always watch each others backs. Best team I ever worked with. The hardest part is also the most enjoyable part of the job. The customers. They can extremely grateful but also extremely rude and bossy. But when you accomplish something for them that they would have no clue how to do is a great feeling especially when they look at you and tell you how much they really appreciate what you did. Some times they act like I just saved there first born.  But there is a dark side of that some people you meet are just down right mean and rude and don't appreciate anything you do for them. As if you were born to serve them. I try not to sweat these people cause in the end of the day its the ones that really appreciate me for what I do that matter.
good,This company has very strong cultural beliefs and puts great importance on customer service.
good,I jumped right into the deep end on my extern at Walgreens. Everyone was very nice. The pace was very fast which made it fun. Management did a great job of organizing job duties so everything ran efficiently.
good,"Walgreens was a great job. It's good for people who don't have very much experience because you have everything you need to learn the job you'll do, and there are opportunities for many different kinds of people. My team turned into my family. It could be fun at times and it could be stressful at times, but it was a good stable job to bring home the bacon. Sometimes I ended up wondering how stocking shelves is important in the grand scheme of things and dreaded going in on truck days, but it all had to be done and I worked with people who were in the same boat as me, so it wasn't so bad. One of my managers had a birthday cake for every month that people working there had birthdays, and that was pretty cool. Along those same lines we had christmas parties and such. A big thing is that everyone was encouraged to give their ideas to improve the way we did things, and we implemented a lot of them which was really cool. I had a lot of control over how the free space in my department was set up, and I could decorate pretty much however I wanted as long as it was approved by management. I LOVED my regular customers. They were the reason I stayed as long as I did."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of either working the register or helping stock shelves. I have learned how to deal with all kinds of people in good and bad situations. The management there was ok, I feel that they could have enforced some rules a little better. My co-workers where great to work with. The hardest part of the job was picking up the slack of some of the other workers. The most enjoyable part was learning the different departments. "
good,"it was an exciting place to work getting to know your customers on a personal basis and learning the names of all the drugs and uses."
good,It is a good stepping block and learning tool for the inexperienced.  It provides an excellent opportunity for those without skills and greater opportunities for those who want to grow with the company as managers or through their pharmacy.
good,"Basically dealing with customers and list given by management with duties including: stocking, resets, cleaning etc. Walgreens Co. is well on there way to making this a very attractive place to work."
good,"I work on displays and maintaining the department. I make sure that customer can find what they are looking for. I ring customers up on the register. I have learned that I can do more that what I thought I could and that I can learn to do more and go for what I want."
good,Aramark provides a vast amount of growth opportunity. Co-workers are extremely knowledgeable. Training and education programs at fingertips.
good,Management was good and cared about the employees.  Lot of interaction with customers and other employees.  Learned to run the Photo Department and enjoyed it very much. I liked helping the customers with their orders and I felt I did a good job with their photo orders.
good,"I have learned the importance of being accurate and focused while filling prescriptions. A typical day includes various duties including working in filling prescriptions, verifying patient information, preparing orders to get shipped out to retail stores."
good,"A typical day would be clocking in speaking with management, organizing, and setting up your department for success. I have learned how to count money and the importance of it, leadership, teamwork, customer skills, computer skills, sales, up-sales and satisfaction. Co-workers are like other places you win some you loose some. The ones they normally keep are great for the company. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with sales, customer service and the departments at the same time. (There has been many times where I had my own department and photo or front desk to watch at same time). The most enjoyable part is seeing your customers leave extremely happy and wanting to come back again, also sample products are fun to use and show off to people."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy with customers coming in and out. Typing prescriptions at the counter can be frustrating when having to deal with insurance claims not processing and a long line of customers. "
good,"I worked with good people, I was able to get regular pay increases and I received promotions fast. I worked on the cash register and in the photo lab. The job was not hard at all."
good,Great starting job. Not a job to make a career pay sucks... Just to get experience while in school.
good,"on and off fast paced enviroment, pleasent customers, friendly co-workers, welcoming management"
good,"Working conditions are reasonable. Maintenance can be a frustrating department to work in, though. They do not always keep parts on hand, so repairs have to wait or you have to make do with what you have. Walgreen's is currently implementing LEAN and Six Sigma. I think there are wonderful concepts in these programs, but I don't feel that management either grasps or lives these concepts very well. I am ready to move up in a logistics environment, but Walgreen's is consolidating right now, so there is not much room for advancement."
good,"Talking to patients and doctors offices to schedule refills on prescription medications. Gathering information from patients on side effects, interactions of other medications and reporting to pharmacist and drug manufacturers. Verifying insurance and working with the financial assistant team to help patients with copay's."
good,company over all is a good company to work for but can be frustrating at times depending on your position.
good,I enjoyed being employed at Walgreens it just wasn't the long term situation I was looking for.
good,"Worked as part of a team to ensure a superior customer experience by addressing customer concerns, demonstrating empathy, and resolving problems on the spot. Assisted customers by answering simple questions, locating items and referring them to the pharmacist for medication information. Operated cash registers to accept payment from customers. Ordered, labeled, and counted stock of medications, chemicals, and supplies, and entered inventory data into computer."
good,I started as a service clerk and proceeded in becoming a photo technician. It as a very experience but i left because i had a scholarship to attend the university of Toledo.
good,"Typical day involved coming in and do the task for the night. Aside from doing your regular responsibilities,I was in the photo department, so that involved me filling the shelf's while processing film."
good,"As a photo specialist I maintained photo processing equipment, developed film/photos, customer service, cashier, stock, quality control, cleaned the store. I learned so much about photo processing and film developing along with the way to edit photos. We had a fun and exciting work place. Management was very easy to talk to and my co-workers were team players. The hardest part was dealing with angry customers when I could not sell them cigarettes or beer without an ID. The friendly 'competition' we had was great. Like who could sell the most of our suggestive sell items or get the most donations for an orgination like M.D."
good,"a typical day at work is helping customers, checking them out at the registers, stocking shelves, etc. My coworkers are great to work with and management is helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job, to me, would be helping customers and keeping the store well stocked and organized."
good,Great place to work Benefits at start are poor
good,"This company allows the stores to work much closer within each individual community. This allows the stores leadership to build community relationships within communities that would not occur in a big box setting. This company provides a glimpse of both the retail industry and the healthcare industry. How amazing it is to have so industry knowledge wrapped up in such a small building. Maybe this is why this company is noted to be ""at the corner of happy and healthy""."
good,"I like working at walgreens every day the people was every friendly. I learn something differnt every day . I learn how to count pills , how to write prespubtions , how to deal with mean people."
good,"I loved working at Walgreens The Staff Was Very Friendly and i love helping the patients. I learned how to call doctors, input patient information, and inventory."
good,Everyday is different in terms of customer intake. Walgreens has taught me to be punctional and always to treat others with courtesy. Management at our store is very helpful and lenient. The hardest part and most enjoyable is working the company truck for unloading.
good,"Great manager,very understanding with work schedule. Learned something new everyday. Very clean. Had fun on the job too, get to dress up as the Church's mascot. Churchie."
good,Assist patients with entering in and purchasing prescriptions.
good,"I love working for Walgreens. Every day is fun and different. You get to interact with customers daily and make long lasting relationships with your coworkers. The only downside is the schedule. Walgreens is a retailer that is open 8a-10p most days, and being an assistant manager there means having to spend a lot of nights and weekends away from my family, which is hard."
good,"Great customers, offer assistance, work with vendors on daily basis. Merchandise store."
good,"Great place to work at though very high stress on pharmacy techs and pharmacist due to the flood of prescriptions needing to be processed on a day to day basis. co workers were great to work with but hard for someone who is new to being a pharmacy tech and for the seasoned veterans there to teach you because there is just not enough time to learn it in a short period of time kinda of a sink or swim scenario because the pace is so fast. Management is great but keep in mind if you are part time you wont have a set schedule and will probably have odd shifts. The hardest part of the job is insurance verification and learning these skills on the fly because of the brutal pace and you will find that filling is the easiest station to work at and build your confidence up. If you are a very fast learner, punctual and can deal with high stress this can be a perfect fit."
good,"A typical day as a service clerk at Walgreen's consists of not only operating the front register at the store, but also finding time to stock shelves, maintain neatness of the different isles, basic cleaning of the front of the store, and other various/daily tasks given to you at the beginning of one's shift. While working at Walgreen's, i was able to expand my knowledge of operating a register and also more efficiently managing my time. The people whom I had the pleasure of working for and with were possibly the most beneficial part as it made for a comfortable, yet professional, workplace. The management made the learning portion of the job fun and also virtually painless. They're knowledge of the store and what it had to offer the costumer, as well as the employee, never ceased to offer chances to expand one's understanding on doing their own job as well as always being able to make sure that each costumer leaves the store satisfied. My favorite part of my time at Walgreen's had to be challenges it offered. While working the register, not only was it important to give each customer your attention and pay attention to what they had to say (such as questions on merchandise), but one must also be able to keep the line moving in a timely manner as to keep business flowing and not become stagnant. This challenge stopped things from getting dull and boring along with adding a great feeling of accomplishment at the end of the day. These are the things that I picked up on while working at Walgreen's."
good,"Everyone works hard and works together to get things done, and we all work hard together to make our store clean and presentable to customers! No matter what's on the agenda that day, we accomplish everything!"
good,"In my most recent position as Store Manager Trainee for Walgreens Drug Co. company, I developed and taught pharmacy, photo and cosmectic technicians. For more than 8 years, I provided effective store management, creative working plans, detailed employee evaluations and highly praised instructional delivery."
good,Curently employed. Run opperation of 3 12 hour shifts over Saturday- Monday and attend meeting durring week. Enjoy working with my team and make it a goal to make thier lives beter daily.
good,"You work congruously with the pharmacist staff, other technicians, and management to provide the best possibles services. The core values are heavily rooted in customer service. I have learned the importance of multi-tasking, team work, the value of efficiency, and simple kindness. The hardest part of the jobe is taking time to cater to the needs of the customers as individuals as well as actually completing the behind the scenes work. The most enjoyable part of my job is satisfaction of helping a customer resolve any problems they may have."
good,New demanding culture
good,A typical day at work is usually quite busy and kind of fast paced.
good,"productive, learn new things daily,great staff, great pay, great customer service"
good,"sign into register at beginning of my shift.Start greeting customers as they enter the store.If customer needs help finding an item i tell them location or find someone who can.Ring in customers as they are ready to leave and thank them for shopping at walgreens.This job helps with patients,due to all types of people and situations arise.Not really anything to hard about this job.I guess the most enjoyable part would be just meeting new people each day and also having regular customers i am getting to know on a regular basis."
good,"simple day clean, stock shelves, help customers, do suggestive sells, work with cash register, work with money."
good,I absolutely enjoyed working at walgreens. It was always pleasant. I enjoyed getting to know the regulars and i especially loved helping others.My managers and co-workers were great. There was never a dull moment. It was always something to do to keep time moving.
good,Nice clean and friendly environment to work in. I work with a great staff very easy going place to work.
good,work morning and night shift
good,"I am working there as a temporary employee. The environment is great, the people are easy going and communicate well. On a daily basis I adjust audits to identify any discrepancies that were pointed out on the audit and adjust payments that were taken back by third party insurance companies. The most enjoyable thing about the job is have your freedom to work by yourself and with a team all at the same time. I sub-manage an auditing group, keep up with their productivity and assist with any difficulties they may have."
good,Worked for this company for a very short preoid of time relocated was only tempoary.
good,"Great Company to work for, ive worked for them for a long time. benefits are great."
good,"focus most in customer service. making customers happy.lot of work ,ring people up at the cosmetic counter. help people with cosmetic items backup other registers. make sure the department is up to date clean, organized, put up new products every week merchandised..."
good,Typical day stock and sales learned stocking and orfering management is not very prefessonal hardest part was computer training and most enjoyable was the flexable hours
good,"Walgreens took up ALL of my time. That being said, it was time spent doing something I love to do. The addition of patient monitoring and immunization have established the company as one of the first to focus on total health and Medication Therapy Management."
good,I came into the company with no pharmacy experience. They trained me and paid for me to take the test for certification. Retail pharmacy is NOT an easy endeavor. With a good team and the support of others even the most difficult customers can't touch your good day.
good,Great job to work if you enjoy working with the public. This job is a very fast passed job. You need to be able to think and work quickly.
good,"walgreens always helped me put school first, great coworkers, great management"
good,"Working for Walgreens and meeting the different people of different backgrounds is a plus, being able to connect with them and devolop a bond is amazing."
good,"Everyday you learned something new and useful. Depending on who you were working with, it could be fun or demanding."
good,"Walgreens is a great, ethically responsible company to work for. Management (DM and above) was very well trained, and was always eager to develop those working underneath them. Compensation was good, if not sometimes great."
good,"Customer service, learning and using different equipments, different environment each day"
good,"A typical day at work was working as a cashier, certified photo specialist and pharmacy technician. I also did resets and revisions to the store to update merchandise."
good,"A day at Walgreens is no walk in the park, everyday is different because you're interacting with different people. Some days you might have it easy like being on the floor which you listen for IC3 calls, give breaks, stock and straighten items. Other days you work at the register all day long dealing with customer that aren't so nice but you just have to deal with it and be as nice as you can. There are some customer that just brighten your day up by saying the smallest things like Thank You. Overall working at Walgreens has been an experience with customer service and would like to work there again in the near future."
good,"It has been more than 12 years since I worked at Walgreens. At that time management was not family friendly and would not offer promotions to young mothers. Store managers were allowed to bring bias to the workplace. Everyone was paid near minimum wage with yearly raises being controlled tightly. The reason I left had to do with a lack of opportunity. I received a raise of .10 per hour with a yearly review of outstanding. I was declined an opportunity for management while new college graduates were being hired in for training in management. I have a BA in Marketing , and had served Walgreens successfully as a cashier, bookkeeper, merchandiser, photo clerk over a period of 7 years. It may have changed. It was a great place to work with a feeling of co operation and family. The hardest part of the job was leaving."
good,Placed orders for 90 day supply to ensure patients receive their medication in a timely manner
good,"Typical day, excellcent customer service is the key. Overall management was informative and not insensitive."
good,A typical day was i walk the store to see what i have to do for the day and get my cashier going for the do.
good,"From my first day working at Walgreens, it was one continual learning experience for me. I never become bored because each day offered a new experience through multi-tasking and interacting with customers. The entire process is to learn about the entire operations so one day you can become a General Manager, or join the corporate office to help support the retail stores all across America."
good,"I enjoy working at Walgreens very much, but I am ready to move on from retail. The managment there is wonderful with a great sense of how to get the job done and keep the employees motivated. My favorite part of my job is helping the customers, and making their day, and them making mine. My second favorite is running the photo lab. Our customers will bring in very old photos to share them with me, knowing how much I appreciate the history. The job is not at all difficult, and I would enjoy it more if there was more challenges."
good,"A typical day in the pharmacy consists of servicing customers, data entry for new medications, filling prescriptions, answer incoming calls, making contacts with doctor offices and insurance companies. I have a learned a lot about customer care and making sure they aware of everything they need to know before leaving with their medications. I enjoying working with others and my co-workers. We are able to work great as a team and we all communicate very well together. The hardest part about my job is the budget cuts and having to deal with being short handed at times, but I like the challenge of being able to move around fast and get the job done. The part I enjoy most about my job would be the customers. I love seeing them coming back and knowing that they are loyal to your store and getting to know the new customers as well."
good,A typical work day at Walgreens was always pleasant. Helping customers figure out what they need or want was always a plus and is always a great feeling seeing the satisfaction on a customer face.
good,"Good pay, chance for advancement, most co-workers are good to work with. Management is good at doing their jobs. Retirement plan is better than most out there."
good,"Very busy,stressful but manageable,good response from my co-workers ..the hardest part is when one of us is out for the day because everything doubles up for the rest of the crew but the most enjoyable part is customer satisfaction of good service"
good,"Retail corner store known by everyone definitely not a bad place to work flexible, decent pay, and advancement opportunities."
good,I enjoyed working for walgreens as a whole they recognized my hard work and dedication for advancement
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for. A typical day for me could be anything from working the front register to filling prescriptions in the pharmacy. I have learned to have more patience and to ask for help. Because there was a time when I was too proud to do so. My management team is great and professional yet caring. That to me is a great is a great combination.
good,She would ring herself up and develope her own pictures when its not a loud and loss pervention would not do anything because she was the best store to bring in profit.
good,"It was a great place to work at, nice people and excellent benefits"
good,I got 3 yeras of work experience from walgreens with lot of help. People were so helping but i had to quit job as i started full time school and now looking for part time job.
good,This was a good place to learn comunication skill and how to get along with others. I also learning how to use a cash register and help people with whatever they needed.
good,"They're located everywhere, pay is good and benefits reasonable, felxible hours. Solid company"
good,"Walgreens is a great company that enforces it's focus on patient's healthcare and particularly preventative care. I am glad the company provides educational services for their pharmacists to promote good healthcare and really inform their patients how to take care of themselves with the counsel from pharmacist which promotes trust, loyalty and a good relationship."
good,"Walgreen is a great company to work for, the employees are nice to work with."
good,This was my first retail job; I enjoyed working with Walgreens Staff. They were very flexible with my schedule due to school hours.
good,This place has a lot of room for advancement. They promote within often. They offer profit sharing and amazing benifits. Most managment knows the ropes really well because they started from the bottom.
good,Loved working here. Learned a lot about the pharmacy industry. Would recommend to anyone.
good,Although I do not work there anymore I still enjoy the time I as there.
good,"High quality co-workers and managers, countered by lower end pay and benefits."
good,While I only worked at Walgreens for a few months I was blessed with an enjoyable job and great managers/bosses.
good,"Ongoing health care services with exciting learning challenges to improve patient care and patient outcome by increasing medication adherence.  A typical day at work may be very stressful at times when the computer systems, electrical transmission from providers' offices or transmission to or from insurances are shut off. Management is very supportive in most cases when there is a sudden situation during rush hours."
good,"Overall Great company!"
good,The managers her are amazing they care about their employees and customers. If there's ever a problem I was always comfortable talking to them about whatever was bothering me.
good,The good and the bad. What stands out about working at this company?This was an internship. I learned much. I worked well with my co-employees. Have a nice day.
good,"Talked to a lot of customers and completed simple tasks, can be a bit boring but staff was great ! Responsibilities included front cashier, stocking items and organizing products."
good,"i'll be honest, i got so lucky to get hired at the location i did. its closed down now, but i learned so much during the time i was there. everyone was so welcoming and helped each other out. leadership were understanding of callouts and were so friendly that i constantly forgot they were my superiors. we treated each other like friends at school. my fellow CSAs always answered my questions without judgement when i first started and backed me up when i needed it. the atmosphere was so relaxed it didn't feel like work. it felt like hanging out with your friends but im aware of the fact that we were the most relaxed store out there. i can't really speak about other stores that i haven't worked at. it's an easy job though and great if you're also in school. usually you'd either be in photo or in the front and both places are pretty self explanatory, it's really easy to pick up. the hard part about it is the occasional difficult customer or ignoring the store managers favoritism but if you're fine with that then you'll be good!"
good,"Walgreens is a good company to work with. "
good,I worked for Walgreens for 8 years. Im upset they let me go over a disagreement with a customer. They let me go and gave the rude customer not one but 2 gift cards. Wow.
good,I would recommend working there but make sure the location is a good one. Some don't feel as safe to work for. I worked in 2 locations and one was much better than the other.
good,The Walgreens tag line is 'Trusted since 1901' and this is true.  Great focus on pharmacy and healthcare and delivering these in the best way.  Customer care is extremely important when you work at Walgreens.
good,"Fast paced environment, Customer relations are very important! Duties will vary depending on your position but there is always someone to help you learn and grow with the company"
good,While I was a Pharmacy Intern I learned many skills to manage a Pharmacy. I worked at the window for patients to pick up and drop off prescriptions. I also counseled patients on their medications and other over the counter medications they were taking.
good,Very enjoyable place to work. If you enjoy helping customers find what they need and putting a smile on their face then Walgreens is the place for you.
good,Typical day work is fun with a chance to learn all new technologies and has a great management  to care of your requirements and a very good workplace culture to work with.
good,"The atmosphere at Wilsonville Walgreen's  was typical of what you would expect from a retail job. Customer care is of high importance and typical days include resets of store plano-grams, morning and evening duties, team member support, weekly truck unloads, interacting with various vendor and other small daily activities. Team members and management are extremely helpful when you find yourself unsure of what to do."
good,Pretty great job.  A lot of  different fields to train to learn different jobs within the store.   Good place for beginners that are in school  they’re trying to look for a job.  Good for elderly people.  Pretty much anywhere in life you can get a job down and being something that you can do and is very flexible if you want or full time.
good,This place is a very fast paced environment.  The benefits are great here.  The hours are flexible.  If you are good at multitasking and working in a fast pace environment then this job is for you.
good,"Good, could be better. Enjoy my team. Wish corporate would give more hours and less tasks. Let us hire more people through the year and not just at holiday time."
good,"For a first job as a teen, it’s the easiest job. There’s some intense labor when truck comes but overall it’s easy and manageable. My location was flexible but i’m sure most can be and they understand that school comes first (in my case)."
good,Awesome place to work my 18 years there I learned a lot a great company to work at especially if you love working with customers always good deals there
good,"The managers are usually very friendly, at least the ones that are actually full time there. The coworkers are also usually nice, keep to themselves, but a handful of them aren’t so friendly or accepting. The starting pay isn’t anything special or outstanding, but if you have time to stick it out a couple of years, pay can become pretty good. Wouldn’t plan on making it your career, but good for getting through college."
good,a great first job for high school kids because they work with your school schedule and the pay is great. the managers are very nice and helpful. its not a super demanding job in my opinion
good,"Walgreens was my first job after graduating high school. The company's culture has made a huge impact on my life, Happy and Healthy. I still carry that cultural belief today. It set a standard early on. The team I worked closely with was easy to get along with. Our managers were experienced and happy to listen to whatever we would bring to them and offer guidance. Most benefits are available to employees who work 40+ hours a week."
good,"I worked as a maintenance tech for 14 years overall I liked working there until new management came in from corporate to managers Walgeens don’t let the older team members get much past 10 to 15 years before they find a way to get you out. Don’t plan to retire from there seldom does anyone get to that point,  Very hard work for pickers that work the lines."
good,"A typical day includes cashiering, stocking, labeling items/tags, and working on the sales floor. The pay was quite good and I was able to get the number of hours I requested. Everyone in the store is quite friendly and helpful and because it is not a huge store, everyone knows each other and can talk to each other comfortably. The customer's however, are often annoyed with associates for no reason, but that is normal for customer service. It is great to see friendly customers, though."
good,my typical day was always consisted unless moved to another floor. I learned that team work is the most important part of the job. The hardest part of the job was when people called out. I enjoyed being part of a team and  knowing that we had each others back.
good,Flexible scheduling met me needs as I returned to work after semi-retirement. There is also opportunity to learn various skills and advance if desired.
good,"It was a good working experience. They offer a lot of opportunities to go up in the company. In addition, they have a good culture and show care for the employees."
good,"Retail pharmacy is fast-paced and needs a lot of attention to detail skills. Daily duties include filling prescriptions, calling customers,insurance verification, and workflow optimization."
good,Walgreens is a very easy company to work for.A lot of advancement to be had. A lot of great people work there and you get to really know a lot of customers who appreciate the work you do everyday. Of course there are some good and bad days as well good and bad customers and managers and employees but keep moving forward to whatever goal you want to achieve.
good,Providing an amazing customer and making my customers happy when they leave the store is whats keeping me employed there. Everyone is so relaxed and lay back.
good,"Walgreens was an overall “okay” company to work for. They didn’t give many hours and didn’t allow overtime.  The pay per hour ($8.55 at the time) would have been okay, if they would have let employees get more hours. Management was good, clean store and friendly environment/atmosphere."
good,Love my job ! Very friendly staff. Yes! Very quick paced and can be stressful but still enjoyable family environment. Informed well about expectations.great culture
good,"This wasn't a career path for me personally, however I did take away some knowledge of retail and how to run a store effectively. Teamwork is crucial here and i was fortunate to work at a location where no one had any problem assisting others."
good,Its good working here and meeting new is always a plus. They are more like a family then your coworker. Its not easy but it your willing to work your can move up pretty easily.
good,"Structured work load, training advancement programs. Stocking, cashier, photo lab, administrator duties. Assistant manager training program. Taking care of customers"
good,"I worked at the ""problem child"" store in the district.  It was a store that took a lot of getting used to.  In the short time I was there, we cycled through management.  As soon as one would make progress, they would get transferred and the process would start all over, again."
good,"Selling products to customers."
good,"This place is very friendly to people with disabilities, and are willing to work with them to some extent. Very Friendly, very nice, and good people work here."
good,Great job and pay for teenagers starting in retail. Management is really helpful and understanding. Schedule is fairly flexible and they provide good hours
good,"You learn a lot, management is good and dedicated, the hardest part of the job is the different environment if this is your first job at a warehouse.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when management throws us little incentives for all the hard work that we do."
good,"Positive experience working there because the store manager put together a positive, hard-working team. Manager was approachable and fair. Walgreens takes care of its employees."
good,"Intake of prescriptions, knowledge of OTC drugs with recommendations from the Pharmacist, medi-care billing and coding knowledge, phone calls to insurance companies for special overrides for certain medications."
good,the staff and employees are amazing they work together as a team. management understands that you need to work certain hours for other responsibilities. managers speak with each other before the shift starts so that everyone is on the same page. the hardest part of the job is that if you need to change shifts its almost impossible because you are hired for a specific shift. more manager meetings are needed so that everyone on all shifts can be on the same page. usually manager meetings only happen one on one.
good,I don't mind hard labor but I don't get enough working hours. Maybe because the Walgreens I work at is open 8-10. I don t mind stocking shelves. Doing McClain but how TF am I suppose to be doing that and being at the cash register because I hate when customers call me out. It would be easier if they assignee to be in one spot. When it's not too busy sure I can multitask but when it gets busy.  C'mon Walgreens hire more ppl.
good,Walgreens was the first job I ever felt like I was accomplishing something with my life. I regret losing the job and would recommend Walgreens to others as a great place to work. They offer you so many benefits and you really develop a family with co workers. I was given alot of opportunity to advance in my career as well.
good,I've been with the company for 10 years. I have worked at 5 different stores and only one did I have trouble. I have advanced a little slower than I expected but I have advanced. The constant changes that take place are a good challenge for anyone. There's always something to do and it's not a hard job. They have always worked with me on my hours and worked around my college classes. Most of the time they're very flexible.
good,Great place to work as a first job or if its not your first job. Average Pay but you aren't overloaded with work. Can be quite fast paced at times but never to fast paced. Management was very nice and helpful. Overall a great place to work.
good,My only complaint with Walgreens is they do not provide enough hours to cover the store and pharmacy properly for customer assistance. This leaves employees very unhappy and unengaged. When employees are not happy or engaged you get less productivity out of them and in the end causes customer services issues.
good,"A typical day at work was greeting the customers with a smile and welcoming them to Walgreens, answering the phone to see how I can assist them or answering any questions the customer may have, stocking, checking out customers, and seeing if they want to donate money to an organization that Walgreens was helping during the time period. I had very nice managers that helped me understand my job position and how our main goal is to help the customer first and everything after that is secondary. My work environment was very positive, productive, and my coworkers were very friendly and nice."
good,Walgreens continues to grow and was busy depending on which store you were assigned to.  Some stores were busier than others.  Good teamwork.  Retail is not for everyone.
good,"I have worked for walgreens for 3 years. It has had its up and downs with various characters coming in and out the doors. I love working here it just needs to pay more for all the work we do. "
good,"Walgreen's keeps you on your toes, it is a very busy place to work but, that is what makes it fun. I have loved all of the managers I have gotten to work with and have always been motivated to work hard."
good,My manager and assistant manager are great to work for and with.  They are helpful and patient.  Both work hard and beside the employees.  I enjoy interacting with the customers and helping to provide products that are reliable and affordable.
good,i liked the management they had in this job. The hours where really flexible. i learned costumer service and how to work with money correctly. It was a fun relaxing job.
good,Being able to meet new customers and see that smile on their face when you make sure their needs are meet.  Also interacting with so many employees were enjoyable.
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work, if you give them 150% of your time.  I love  my job most of the time but advancement and raises are almost impossible."
good,"Walgreens will work with your schedule whether you have kids or are in school. They have opportunities for advancement. Hardest part of the job is how much work they require with little time.   Frontier is a program they are starting in all stores, and it works great with some stores and a nightmare with others."
good,Worked at Walgreens for over 6 years and they have never steered me wrong. Management change is easy to adapt to. Work flow is nice. Benefits are great.
good,Walgreens was my first job. It was my first experience with customer service. I learned how to open myself up and communicate to customers by helping them with developing photos and assisting them as needed. I didn't work at walgreens for long because I moved for college. But my time there was a good experience. I built friendships with my coworkers and a was able to develop a better teamwork skills. It taught me how to manage my productivity and personality.
good,Management are very respectful and understanding to provide you with a life outside of working. There very caring and committed to your needs and the needs of your family.
good,"I enjoyed working for Walgreens. Would still be there today, but I had gotten robbed at night and was traumtized and was to scared to work behind the counter and to deal with money. So they did not have a job with out dealing with money."
good,This is a great job to start out with. You got a lot of opportunities to move up. The Walgreens background and what the future of the company feel comfortable.
good,"Sometimes work was stressful but I made sure to keep myself busy so time goes by faster for me. Also there are task that you have to finish before the end of your shift. Great customer service skills is the key. If you want to move up, you got to be willing to learn new things."
good,I Love Walgreens It Was A Breeze Working There The Work Was Easy And Most Of The Customers Was Lovely. The Manager Was Always Good And Chill But The Work Space Was Professional.
good,"On a typical day you are processing almost 800 prescriptions. Because of that, many times lunch breaks were not given. You had to deal with unruly customers which made the day harder."
good,"I enjoy working at walgreens, it is a great place to help people live well and the company takes pride in making sure that the service we give is good.  The only problem is they do not have great budget for hours and that can affect the workers that are overwhelmed."
good,I like my job on most days. The pay is not great and I think they told me I was tipped out and could not get another raise. I do not agree with this. I have worked for them a very long time and feel I should be making more an hour than I am.
good,"4/5 stars. The only thing I wished was that the stock guys get paid a little more than the cashiers, the physically demanding requirements of the job should be more compensated than the person who just rings the register the entire shift. These people (cashiers) are also considered for promotion first (generally) because its easier to do that particular position 10/10 than stocking on a day-to-day basis."
good,"I have worked with Walgreens for over ten yearns.  It is overall a great place to work.  I have met a lot of great people through co-workers and customers.  I started out as hourly and worked my way up to management.  If you work hard and stay with it, anyone can work into management."
good,I was fun working walgreen but it does get little frustrating because the pharmacy is busy all day and you have to go help in the pharmacy even if you do not work in the pharmacy.
good,"Not a lot of social time for family and friends. You meet a lot of nice people. You learn a lot from management  team and they do like to promote from within. I was with the company for 10 yrs. However, my mother took ill and left to take care of her."
good,"Great place to work. You would show up, clock in, work, 15-30 min break, work, and leave. It was an easy job but can be slow at times. Stalking and facing the store was the most exciting thing I encountered during my duration at Walgreens."
good,"Cash handling, inventory counts, customer service. It was very enjoyable trying to help out as many customers as I could; whether it be finding the products they were looking for or helping them with their creation and completion of ntheir photo products."
good,doesn't feel like a job feels more like home. all co-workers are very friendly. Management try there best to teach you new tasks. all team members work as one to help finish all tasks.
good,No longer an employee. I no longer work with Walgreens. I do not work with the company anymore. My work experience was pleasant and I was grateful for the opportunity.
good,I loved Walgreens because the employees there were outstanding and they made sure you felt comfortable in the environment. Walgreens gave an amazing pay that was a decent amount for someone who was working their first job.
good,The management at Walgreens was great. They were always helpful and respectful. They are constantly trying to help you improve and move up in the company.
good,I felt that I was promoted to pharmacy manager fairly early in my career. I had lots of support in transitioning to manager.  We had teams that would meet once monthly to discuss issues and how to handle the issues.
good,"Working at Walgreen's everyday is a new day. New customer issues to solve and new projects to be done. Management helps guide employees in the correct direction with out hovering too much. in the past year the company has started a new program called the Frontier Program. It it a program for the back end store (employees) to better understand the figures that make up the  stores productivity. The Program allows for the floor employees to have more of a say in how thing can be done, and or changed to make improvements. "
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for. The Walgreens Boots Alliance is a merger of two major stores, Walgreens, from here, and Boots, a british organization. My overnight responsibilities include performing daily maintenance and checking/pulling outdates, pulling drawers and balancing the till, top drawer, and bottom safe, and handling large emergency situations with a cool and collescted head."
good,"Retail pharmacy definitely was NOT the job for me:) but Walgreens is a good company to work for.  I always felt like management stood behind us, retail in general is just very very busy and stressful."
good,"My time at Walgreens was good because I developed a lot of transferable skill that have made me a valuable employee elsewhere. This job sometimes allows you and requires you to think out of the box, so take advantage of those opportunities. Some people can get hung up on the unrealistic standard of a perfect store by closing time but it is not something to get worked up over or insulted about. Just do your best and your work will be noticed."
good,The customers are always happy.It is Very comfortable workplace and there is always something to do and management always pushes you to be the best worker.
good,"Working for Walgreens was my first job, but a great one at that. I was given the tools to advance and grow in the company. Management was very well set. They gave me a lot of advice and preparation for other career opportunities."
good,The only reason for leaving Walgreens was leaving for school in the fall. I overall enjoyed working for Walgreens. They worked with my school schedule extremely well.
good,"Walgreens has amazing management from shift leads all the way to district supervises and most likely above, i just havent the opportunity to meet them. Every one i have come across is fully on bored to help me succeed,  not only for their benefit but for my benefit in the company and outside. Tge only downside is the small pay."
good,Overall I think Walgreens is a good place to work at because you get customer experience there and the basics of working in a local place. I have learned how to communicate with those customer and also how to make sure they get what they want and need.
good,Management was poor but overall was not a bad place to work. It was a nice paying job for the work that you do. They try their best to work around your sechdule if you are in school.
good,"This is a good job for those who still live at home and are a student.  The pay isn't significantly enough to live out on your own.  Benefit options are fantastic though.  In 2016 I got sick and missed 3 weeks, with their company paid disability I survived financially.  I don't know where I would be right now if it weren't for that."
good,"It is a nice starting job for the pharmacy world. When I was looking for a place to put my foot in the door, they accepted me with no experience and took a leap of faith."
good,"I originally took my job at Walgreens until I could find a job closer to home that would fit my needs.  I wound up staying and transferring locations when I moved to a different state.  I have kept my job here and tried out a few second jobs part time, but have consistently stayed with Walgreens and maintained my insurance benefits with them."
good,"Walgreen's is very customer-oriented, with a typical day of stocking items to better suit customers, helping them locate any items they may need and being moderately knowledgeable about any and all products in the store. Management is always available to help customers and employees with anything they may need or any problems to be solved. The staff is very friendly and fun to work with, making the day go by faster and more enjoyable. The hardest part of the job is not being able to reach every customer, however the most enjoyable part is getting the chance to try."
good,"I greatly enjoyed my work at Walgreens. The manager is exceptional, always teaching and encouraging us to grow. Corporate was not as good as they would cut our hours thus causing frustrated customers and many things were hard to complete. The staff is great and works well together. I should have never been terminated due to being on a leave of absence due to fighting cancer."
good,At times a very stressful work environment . It was sometimes difficult to provide quality customer care while completing the numerous responsibilities required of SOME team members. Not always equal expectations for everyone. However it remained a generally enjoyable experience
good,"The entry level pay was worst thing about the job. They start you off at 7.50, but you get a raise annually depending on if you got a good review. There is chance for advancement and you could actually make a career out of walgreens."
good,"It’s a place of growth, my managers are always encouraging us to move up in the business. There are yearly raises, and plenty of benefits. My coworkers are always willing to teach as well!"
good,The walgreens culture feels like that of a family. Is is very team oriented and fun to work in. The only downside is the pay. While you can get great benefits depending on your position and how long youve worked there a lot of the positions offer very poor pay for what you do. I have done everything from front register and floor stocking to eventually being the lead pharmacy technician (worst pay for the amount of work). The employees i have come across are great to work with and have never been a problem. Always felt like family but ultimately the pay was not worth the stress of working in a pharmacy. Would highly recommend as a starting job.
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work. Easy first time job to career. I've been with them for a long time. Learned lots!  I've recommened many other to get jobs here. Really have to be a people person.  they need to like retail and customers. Easy to move up if interested. Great place to work, has many benefits."
good,"I enjoyed working for Walgreens, overall. There were downsides to the job such as it being mandatory to work at least two of every three holidays, but I feel I was fairly paid and was offered flexibility in my schedule."
good,I really enjoyed working at wal green. I would help people if they didn't have enough money to pay for there things. I meant so many people they would come to see me when I worked.
good,"I loved being an employee at Walgreens for many reasons, one being it felt more like a family than co-workers, and I enjoyed coming to work every night."
good,The only thing i didn't like about working there was it took a long time to move up in the company. I would have liked being able to move up more quickly. Also i didn't think the pay was enough for the amount of things you're responsible for.
good,Depends on what store you're at. Some stores are amazing. While other have poor favoritism with management so you really can't advance  good hours though
good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreens very much! The management was very nice and the coworkers very pleasant. It was a clean store and well stocked. If I had to pick out what I liked most about the job it definitely would be the people that I worked with. As in all retail, the flow of customers came and went and most were pleasant. The hardest part for me was the photo lab and changing out the film paper in the cartridges."
good,worked with great people and management trained you very thoroughly. management was very flexible with your family life and work life. great employee discounts
good,"My duties as a Pharmacy Technician consisted of: receiving, typing, filling, and selling prescriptions, assisting customers as my scope of practice allowed and consulting with the pharmacist directly as needed, maintaining a well-organized, sanitary work environment while working in a fast-paced retail pharmacy setting, answering phones before the third ring to ensure short phone wait times, communicating efficiently with my coworkers and pharmacists, following a work-flow to maintain rotation of employees, verifying that patient information is current and correct, after verifying patient information, I would sell the prescription to the patient and consult the pharmacist if the patient had medicinal questions"
good,maintain there truck stay on top of things got you out on dispatch time great place to work. people were nice there. benefits was very good.they used e- logs
good,I love my walgreens family. We have kept a great environment going for the majority of the time.  I have enjoyed working with the people that management successfully hired and working as a team to be a great retailer and leader in customer happiness.
good,"As a former employee, I had an overall wonderful experience working with Walgreens over the past two years. My only small concern is management to be more organized."
good,Walgreens prides itself on helping the community. My department does a  lot to keep the employees engaged.  There are a lot of Employee Engagement events.
good,"During the time I was employed there, Walgreens was a great place to work. There have been many changes since then and from the management I still keep in contact with its still a good company but a bit more challenging."
good,Walgreens is a great place to work. Great benefits and a wonderful family environment. Supervisor take care of their employers. Employee discount is great.
good,"I would maintain the photo machine to print peoples photos. If I was not doing that, I was stocking the shelfs with product in empty spaces and moving truck when it arrived."
good,In the 16 yrs I worked for Walgreens always felt it was stable financially gave good benefits.  Offered Many areas to advance your career.   Walgreen company is very good in training as new technology advances.
good,Easy job with only to stock up items and helping out customers. Wonderful experience overall with also great employees by your side to help you along throughout your day.
good,A typical day at Walgreens is greeting customers and inputing in clients scriptss.  I learned many things about specific medicines and approaches to cure certain sicknesses.  Management was great.  They were willing and eager to help.  The hardest part of the job was the ability to read doctors handwriting.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.
good,"Walgreens was a great place to learn and grow, a cultivating pot for me. Management was patient and wise. They taught me everything I needed to know to grow in the current job market. They even taught me how to drive when my own family was unavailable to. In many ways, Walgreens #04635 was family. I'll never forget them."
good,"I had great managers at the Walgreens I worked at. Definitely job where you can grow in the company, if they see potential they will help you move up."
good,FUn to work there. Great Team. There was a lack of communication between employees that did hinder work at times. other than that it was really great.
good,"Workplace culture is great because everybody works as a team to get the job done. Despite the pharmacy being very high pace, the most enjoyable part of the job is talking to patients and helping them with any health-related questions and concerns."
good,Walgreens was a great company to begin my career. They promote from within and offer many benefits. They had on the job training and were very helpful to employees.
good,it is a very strict place but they do know what they are doing. they are good at evaluating job performance and recognizing quality work. management are all great with personal connections.
good,I loved working for this company. The company is very understanding and has great training. The hr team is very respectful and make you feel comfortable. The hours are good and they sometimes had mandatory overtime. The leads and managers help you gain experience and help you move up within the company if you desire.
good,it was a great learning experience and I loved it until they changed our asm and I got screwed. the new store manager came in and took me away from my rightfully earned spot gave it to someone else to split with me and then took me from my sfl training to train some one else. assistant store manager came in and decided she was going to take out her personal issues on us tricked me into quitting by telling me to clear my locker and go home didn't communicate that to other managers. so they just assumed I was a no call no show later on down the road she was demoted. if her demotion doesn't say anything then im unsure what will.
good,"As a member of management, I have always coached, ""If you are not having fun at your job, then leave."" Making friendships with co-workers and relationships with customers never had a dull moment. There will always be stressful days in retail but if you can change your attitude into something positive there is no reason to dislike what you are doing. Main reason I have seen people leave is for personal job opportunities related to ones' education. The company is a good start in helping you achieve small goals, and reach to the bigger ones! When you believe you can sing like no one is paying attention just remember you might have a friend or two singing along."
good,"Benefits are great, fast pace for management, lots of hard lifting and hard work. Long hours and short of personnel, lots of call outs. Made good friends."
good,"There is always something new to do but management is flexible and works around school schedule. It is a job that has varying responsibilities to keep from doing the same thing every day. Also, the benefits are great."
good,"It was a nice job for the nearly 2 years I worked there. Great first time job, loved my coworkers (wound up marrying one :p Fun work environment, always something to do."
good,The individuals who work there and some of the regular customers that shop there are a wonder to have. The work is not too challenging or too easy. The environment is neat and clean. Work flow is a bit of a challenge sometimes but once everyone gets accustomed to the different individual working preferences it can go smoothly.
good,The job at Walgreens is a slow pace job. Small group of employees which make is good to know everyone you work with. The hours are reasonable and have the ability to get off the days you need for any reason. Managers are not over bearing and let workers work at a good pace.
good,Great start to a career in the pharmacy. Potential for personal growth and advancement. Typically a fast-paced work environment. Lots of wonderful coworkers.
good,"Walgreens hired me through a disability services initiative (I have Asperger's Syndrome, a form of high-functioning autism.) and I haven't regretted the opportunity since.  The distribution center was an interesting facility and the workplace culture was even better.  Diversity and communication are celebrated, and you'll meet all sorts of different people. (This is key because two contractors who mocked a man with a limp were immediately terminated and walked out, and an employee who made some boastfully homophobic comments in a monthly meeting was reprimanded and written up for his actions.)"
good,"Working at Walgreens is fairly simple but can be stressful trying to fulfill customer satisfaction. I learned how to multi task and being more independent. The management was great. It was a very friendly culture. The hardest part of the job were the extremely long lines if an employee called in for the day leaving on two people to work a whole shift. The night shifts were the most enjoyable, great employees."
good,"When I started at Walgreens it was a stressful time, a lot of drama, so I was originally thinking this is to much, I don't like drama, but once most of it if not all wound down, it was a fun place to work, I like the idea of doing things out side of the department I was in, I thrived on multitasking in a lot of cases. Walgreens gives 401 K benefits to full time employees along with health insurance and allows you to join in on profit sharing as well. The first year I was there, my sister was getting married in the Bahamas, and I had not yet been there for a year, but they had no problem allowing me the week off, (not paid of course) but had no problem with having me need that time off so quickly. They are great when vacation time is accrued with allowing the time off. "
good,its a great place to work. i learned to develop pictures. th management is good for the most part. they change managment to much. i really enjoyed working with the public and making the happy.
good,"Always evolving and challenging.   The company is very are of industry trends and is working diligently to maintain the advantages not only to day, but in the next twenty years."
good,"A typical day at work involves me being assigned particular patients to call to schedule delivery. You learn how to work with patients who are battling different medical conditions and how to have sympathy for them. Management is understanding and always willing to help. The workplace consists of many different cultures. The hardest part of the job is making it on your own and not giving up the first week out of training. The most enjoyable part of the job is friends you meet once you are given the opportunity to work on different tasks. At this point, you will meet many people who are willing to help you along the way. This allows you room for growth throughout the company including moving to locations within the nation."
good,"on any given day we were very busy but managed to always get the job done, great staff and customers. Very rewarding and fulfilling job, sometimes challenging but very good overall"
good,"It was a great place to work at the time that I was there.  The job was fun, the people were fun, the culture was great.  It was a job that also had classes to help others get promoted to management.  I also loved working in the pharmacy section."
good,it was fun working there and managers actually care about you. Also the teamwork involved there was amazing. Work schedules were fair and they do adapt to students very fairly.
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for. Many positions are easy to learn and advancement within the company is easier to accomplish if you work smart and accomplish goals given by management team.
good,"Great place to work, you make friends, you always wanna grow in the company. My current manager is awesome, good recognition, they celebrate your birthday and achievements."
good,"Pleasant management and co-workers, easy going but will challenge you at times. Flexible scheduling, very understanding if you need to take a day off. Overall a good place to work."
good,I loved my coworkers and managers while I worked at Walgreens. I considered my coworkers and managers friends. I would suggest working at Walgreens to almost anyone.
good,"On a day to day basis you will enter data, fill prescriptions, work closely with the pharmacist, assist in customer service, learn about insurance, learn about medications, mix and sometimes compound medications."
good,Great place to work!!!! They focus on helping customers and making sure that all of their needs are met when they walk into the store. The ability to be in constant contact with various people makes my job worthwhile.
good,"Walgreens was an awesome company to work for.  The management, the benefits, the work environment, and the people are what made this place so easy and fun to work all while being professional and getting every job done."
good,"The company used to be excellent and great room fo advancement, but since Boots joined with walgreens, it has gone downhill. Hours are being cut tremendously!!"
good,Comfortable work environment.  Additional staffing would be helpful. Excellent computer system and training to complete daily tasks.   Very competitive pay with excellent 401k
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for. It game me and my family a good income with plenty of time off. I would recommend working there. Worked there for 18 years and have never had any major problems or concerns.
good,"I think walgreens its one of the best Jobs I've ever had. You get paid fairly, the everyday customers are amazing and fun place to work. The jobs duties are stocking, receiving merchandise, and operating transactions and money handling and ofcourse, always keeping your area clean."
good,"Great place to learn new experience and meet new people."
good,Overall a good place to work. The stores are always clean and look very professional. They are willing to work with you when it comes to your schedule.
good,"The work days were very repetitive but the workplace environment was enjoyable and it encouraged productivity. The management was supportive and understanding, and taught good customer service through their own interaction with their customers"
good,Learned how properly interact with customers and create a stable working environment. Management was well organized so that the managers and assistant managers can oversee store operation properly.
good,Teamwork is truly upheld at Walgreens. You are working with co-workers who enjoy their job and love their customers. Starting above minimum wage is a good incentive for the cashiers who may have just started out. Breaks are reasonable.
good,A typical day at Walgreens would be coming into work to process prints. I work in the photo department so I process pictures as well as make a few items dealing with photos for customers.
good,"Family oriented, cares about employees but can be very demanding and quick paced. Your whole day is on your feet and may be very strenuous physically."
good,"Wal-Greens has been a good part-time job for me. I only work 2 days a week but, if I need some time off 95% they can accommodate me and my scheduling needs. Most of my co-workers are really awesome and the work atmosphere is good."
good,I enjoy my job I like the company and the direction in which they are moving. Always innovative and seeking new ways to boost morale and keep employees engaged.
good,"Though the job involves a lot of running around in the store, you get to learn new things every single day. The management is super supportive and is always there to help you. The most enjoyable part about the job is you get to learn to operate different departments and solve new problems."
good,"Walgreen was my first big work opportunity. I came in with no work experience and received a job the same day, just from personality and a friend reference. My coworkers were like family. I couldn't have chosen a better starting point to start my career life."
good,I've learned how to become a great leader with the skills and training that I've gained from this company. The hardest part of the job is trying to maintain shrinkage because of the area. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you have made a customer's day by going the extra mile to make sure they had the best experience while they shopped on your store. The work environment is very friendly and sociable. Being a manager endures a lot of responsibility. The great thing is if you lead by example all things will fall in place for your team to be successful.
good,"Walgreens is huge on customer service and getting things done in a timely fashion. As long as every one follows the workflow, the shift should maintain steadiness and less stress."
good,Enjoyed the work and environment. Management and the training programs for advancement were great. Teamwork was good and all the employees seemed to be happy.
good,"Makes you feel like family, meet new people everyday. Very productive and motivational place to work with room for advancement and new challenges everyday."
good,"Everyone is very nice, management will always work with you to reach your goals if you are willing to work and stay focused. Great place to work. I love it."
good,I liked volunteering at Walgreen good working environment.  The customers and co-workers will brighten up your day when you feel like this job isn't for you. Management below Store Manager always has your back and assist in day-to-day task and if you want more training or more task they well help you find it. If your really are determined it will only take a year for promotion
good,"Due to the nature of my job at Walgreen's, I would consider the job stressful. I work in a small town where 9 out of 10 customers want instant gratification. However, don't let this affect you're perception of the company. Walgreen's and the majority of management treat employees very fairly and the company culture is extremely positive and fun. Obviously, it's not perfect as is any job. But, the customers are the worst part of the job. Management is fantastic at my particular store. I would never regret my decision to work for Walgreen's and I would stay with this job if it paid a more livable wage."
good,"Ive been there  for 17 years altogether, and I really enjoy working for them, they have great benefits and flexible scheduling offering both full and part time positions."
good,The typical work day is busy and on your feet sometimes/constantly moving. Never a dull moment. The salary raises are based on a yearly review and if u don't meet the quotas you don't get a raise.
good,DC very positive gives team members chance to improve work areas. Continually asking for feedback on how to change process to improve. Team celebrations are held often.Great place to start your career and learn the distribution field.
good,"In the specialty pharmacy area of Walgreens, a typical day involved speaking with customers across the country."
good,"This was a three month Community Management Internship. The environment was really great and always fun. There was a lot of different things to learn in the store: cosmetics, pharmacy, and front end."
good,"Be familiar with products to assist customers.  Build clientele with customers to assure business.  Positivity is the key to this position.  A typical day at work is no stressful, management is okay."
good,"managed various stores and took care of sales forecasting as well as managing an entire team of people on a daily basis, retail is challenging because it is holidays and wknds"
good,"Always busy and fast paced, constant muli-tasking"
good,I loved what I did on a daily basic. I learned something new everyday. I loved my customers as if they were my only family. The hardest part of the day was to make sure you fill that prescription correctly.
good,I definitely learned a lot working with this company. The most enjoyable part of this job was the customer loyalty and satisfaction. The workplace was productive but also laid back.
good,It was a very stressful job but the pharmacy team was very close. Pharmacists and Pharmacy manager were great. Store support was not so great. Wouldn't mind working there again.
good,I had no experience as a technician before I started here. They did on the job training and within a year they sent me to classes to become a certified technician. They pay for your state registration every year and pay for your national certification every 2 years. You feel valued as an employee for this company.
good,This place is not a bad place to work at. I'm actually thankful that I got this job. In a regular day you get set a number of task that you have to complete by the end of your work shift . Not too complicated task that you can do at your own pace and in between you will also be taking care of the customers around the store.
good,This was a great job.  I was going to school at the time and the management staff was very wiling to work around my school schedule.  I loved the people I worked with and the environment.  I was able to do many things in this store.  I was always willing to learn and to help out other employees when needed or when I had extra time.
good,"It's definitely not a bad place to work if you're looking for a job to get you started on a career or if you're wanting to settle down and you're close to retirement. The benefits are very nice, but it doesn't quite justify the low rate of pay that they set you with. Along with every job, there are going to be very good and incredibly bad things that go hand-in-hand with working here--however, I can honestly say that I'm quite satisfied with the experience as a whole and highly recommend applying if you're interested."
good,I began working for Walgreens when I turned sixteen. I loved it at first but as I grew up I realized I only liked it for the money and that there was not much room for advancement. I learned a lot there and worked under many different mangers. The worst part of the job is being near sick people because of the pharmacy.
good,It was a good place to work at. Salary was reasonable and so were hours. Management worked with me based on my school schedule and allowed me to take off for school as needed.
good,"Enjoyable place to work.  Great work culture.  Not enough hours. The  management, coworkers, and customers made this job fun and a nice place to work."
good,"The management is great. Steady workflow. Most just communicating with customers and filling their needs, helping them find products they need. Very friendly staff and management, which makes for a great work place."
good,"Walgreen's can be an engaging and fun job if you like retail. The only cons you need to worry about is if your management is bad at your individual store. Walgreen's has great benefits for its employees but pays a little low until you get up to AM and GM positions. The customer service portion is usually pretty average, with only an inevitable amount of crazy people that come in. Photo and beauty alike can be really fun jobs if you're into the work those departments offer."
good,I enjoyed the customers that came in.  They always made me smile and laugh.  They made my day. Especially the regulars.  They called me by my name and I called them by their name as well. The managers were awesome people to work for.  I felt like we were family.
good,Walgreens is on the forefront of the specialty pharmacy movement and is well positioned for increasing business. They are forward thinking and are constantly re-evaluating their business models in order to stay relevant. There is opportunity for advancement provided you are willing to put forth the effort. Walgreens encourages employee involvement and their ideas and opinions.
good,"Learned what a great place Walgreens is to work. Treated like family by both team members, management and customers. I learned how to fill prescriptions in the pharmacy, work drive thru and provide excellent customer service."
good,"After working at the same store for 3 years I got to know everyone. I have scarcely been in such a welcoming and understanding environment. Nothing is always perfect, but the people I worked with at Walgreen's truly cared about me and helped me. Not only did the management help me learn and advance whenever I wanted, but I formed lasting friendships with the team while I was there."
good,"Everyday when I walked in, there was always something to do which is something that I like about working. What I learned when I was working there was that I now have experience working in a retail store that I can apply to future jobs."
good,"A typical day of work was busy from the time I walked in and did not stop until I got off of work.  There were many days that we were behind and I had to stay over to help get as caught up as possible.  I took in prescriptions from patients, scanned them into the computer and typed them up.  I pulled medication off the shelf and filled the needed prescriptions.  I input and ran insurance information on patients and helped solve issues that were coming up.  I filed certain prescriptions in the correct place, put medication back on the shelf in the correct way and did inventory every so often.  I also helped get the prescriptions to the patients at the counter and in drive-thru.  I checked the customers out and tried to help solve any complaints that the customers had."
good,"It's a good place to work at, I've only been there for two months and I'm enjoying it so far. Just wish the pay was better but overall it's a good company to work for. My peers are awesome and the management is very professional and helpful."
good,"Most duties depend on what shift and or position at specific time. Morning shift duties included, turning on lights, preparing photos and running them through the system. Preparing cash register drawers, and cleaning counters, ensuring things are clean, organized, ready for use, also checking out customers when approached counter. Mid shift duties include stocking, facing, checkout, and organizing. Running photos, and organizing photos. Making canvases, posters, and wood panels. Helping customers at kiosk. Closing shift duties were cleaning restrooms, facing, and sweeping. Vacuuming, cashing out registers, cleaning counters and workspace. Tidying up store. "
good,"The hours at the pharmacy are inconsistent.  My hours range from 9:00 AM to 12:00 midnight.  Also, I work many holidays.  I am looking for a pharmacy position that I have better hours. Also,I would like to work in a family owned pharmacy, then you don't have to rely on a corporation to make decisions regarding the pharmacy and the employees within the pharmacy."
good,"A typical day of work includes counting pills, taking in prescriptions, interacting with customers doing data entry . working in a pharmacy I learned how to do work the computers interact with people more work on drive thru . My co- workers were nice and friendly you have to get comfortable around them because its a team work job you have to communicate with each other . The hardest part of the job was customers cause you always get angry customers so you have to know how to deal and handle those type of situations . The most enjoyable part of the job is being in a career when you know at the end of the day your saving life's and helping people out"
good,I enjoy working as a team member and the diversity of customers who come to shop. I enjoy turning their mediocre day into something to smile about. I learned a variety of skills regarding cosmetics and photography from my co-workers. The management team works in union to satisfy the customer and employee needs while contributing to a successful company.
good,"customer service is hard but when you have a good team it makes it easier and fun. i like that there is always something to do and there , also like working in photo learning all the machines and technology"

good,"Work along side Pharmacist and Technicians on a daily basis."
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens but it also was a challenge because I had to do different shifts and i had young children at the time.  The managers also worked with me during those time so I am grateful for that. It also has great benefits 401k and you able to purchase stocks in the company.
good,"On any job position, I would like to learn all the building block for my experience and skills. While working for your company, my goal is to gain the skills and job experience to work hard with a good head on my shoulders. And a hard working job under my belt. Am also looking forward to the challenges and successes that come with the job, that I can broaden my experience in the Pharmacy or Nursing employment world."
good,"This job is your typical sales associate job, you learn the various positions in the store and alternate between each of them. Knowledge of both the store layout and products are essential in basic functionality."
good,"In my 5 years at Walgreens, I have made many friends with employees and customers.  The main ingredient to my fellowship with others at Walgreens is the accepting nature and genuine honesty that managers both nurture and expect from their employees."
good,I enjoyed my time working there because it was my first real job. The manager took a chance on me when no one else didn't so that makes me strive. Just a great place good people and safe environment.
good,"I've learned not only a wealth of knowledge about medications and various health conditions, but how to process prescriptions and the troubleshooting therein that is required often.  In a demanding field  that sometimes tests your patience and temperament, I have learned to master both."
good,"Cash Handlings."
good,provide excellent customer service and the work environment was very work friendly. the cons in retail are the varies of hours
good,"A typical day at work starts off as making sure everything is typed fill and ready for pick up when the customers get there. Then its also a time of the day that we call rush hour. Which mean we have more people dropping off picking up and waiting all at once. Later on that day when close to closing we do our side work far as taking out the trash making sure everything is clean, stock and in place. You never know what that day might bring you far as learning. Most of the time its always something new when dealing with insurance and how it work. Far as management goes our management staff tends to help when needed and just make sure everything is ran smoothly.The co-worker I had was awesome I felt like we did well with it being only two of us, and doing rush hour we knew how to work as a team. The hardest part of the job was rush hour and I say that because it was always only two techs. Overall the job was good I love meeting new people and listening to customers crazy stories."
good,Enjoyed problem solving. Had difficulties at times with the photo machine printing. Found it a challenge to try and find out what was wrong before contacting matinees.
good,"Great environment, flexible scheduling, benefits are a plus, co workers are a good team, learned new things day in and day out, positive energy, the job is easy"
good,"There are great benefits to working at Walgreens like health benefits, profit sharing, and stocks available to full time employees."
good,"well i just started working at walgreens, and i have to say that its been good so far. my co-workers greeted me like as if i was working their for years already."
good,During my time at Walgreens I had excellent management and they help you succeed in your job and to advance. I always felt confident in my job as a photo tech and was encouraged to do more in the company to further my career.
good,I was able to get my PTCB certification and learn about medications and other areas of store. Always willing to work with you and help you manage home life and work life.
good,"Customer service is my main focus at work. I assist customers in finding items throughout the store. I help them to make choices on different items. I check them out at the register."
good,Management and colleagues are nice people to work with. Never once regretted ever joining this company. I have no stress as compared to my last job!
good,A typical day at work was very hands on enjoyable fun. I learned that its ok to keep busy. I worked with some of the most amazing team including management. the hardest part was having to clock out on time and not having the choice of overtime. i enjoyed the most it that if you want to grow within the company the option was available.
good,"Overall I really enjoyed working for Walgreens. Every day is busy and there is a very steady work flow. Communication is great and managers are hard working. I love how big they are on customer service and satisfaction. (This was probably the most enjoyable part of the job. Plus how organized everything is.) I learned all leadership responsibilities as a Store Team Leader working for this company. Hard work pays off at this job, as I had tons of growth and opportunity to move up quickly. Great work/life balance with focus on development.    "
good,"I liked working at Walgreens, i worked there for 6th months. I learned a lot about selling strategies, management and consumer service. the managers were very unorganized, negative and over scheduling"
good,"The work is rather enjoyable and the co-workers are very nice. A typical day consists of helping customers, stocking and maintaining inventory, and day to day operations in keeping the store functional. I would definitely recommend this job to someone looking for a nice job in retail."
good,My co-workers were amazing. Being apart of management there was a lot of daily task that needed to be done. I learned so much from this job from money handling to merchandising.
good,I enjoyed my team members and learned different aspects of the job. I have had a great opportunity and advancement with this company.
good,Walgreen's was an incredible company to work for. I loved going to work each day and my coworkers became like family. I am still friends with many of them today. Management was supportive and taught me so much. My only complaint was that the pay could have been better for all that you are required to do.
good,Good company to work for. great benefits and corporate training. Flexible scheduling and many advancement opportunities
good,"My time at Walgreens in my hometown was very rewarding. I was given great raises every few months when I earned it with my effort and my co-workers were very understanding with my life in that I could take off when I wanted and could work certain hours certain weeks, being a full time student this was much appreciated. I loved my manager, he helped me learn and grow in the store and was sad when I moved away. When I worked for a different Walgreens near my University things could not have been different. I quit walgreens in a month when I found another job. That manager did not handle his employees the same as my hometown store did. He had mostly students working so scheduling us all was a mess and he was not as flexible with everyone's hours, he depended on the part timers to come in and hold the fort but then didn't try to allow time off for testing weeks. Also this Walgreens was dirtier and the employees were lazier, it reflected on how the management handled the store in my opinion. Working for big companies like this is probably all the same, it depends on the area/management crew. Walgreens has good benefits even for part time employees and has 401K and stock options."
good,Had a nice experience there. A very skilled team. A good work/life balance and a very  nice environment. Management is done very well.
good,"Great company to work for with excellent benefits and corporate support. "
good,"i would go to work and count the safe on regular schedule. From there i would check our daily task list to see what was needed to be done. once those task are complete i would then move on the next project. what i learned from this position was great management skills on how to handle employes and customers,running a store and also working in the pharmacy. the store as a whole was pretty good everybody was willing to help each other out when needed.I would have to say the hardest part of my job was no being able to learn more with the time i had."
good,"very busy and secure company, great benefits, convenient locations"
good,I am currently at this position working in a very team oriented environment. I am currently working through a staffing agency and need to find a permanent job.
good,I have learned a lot being with the company for 13+ years. I have worked my way up to my current position and opportunities exist for higher advancement.  I take pride in the fact that our working environment allows us to conduct our job in a professional and friendly manner.
good,"Some Managers were cooler then others. It was cool establishing relationships with certain and many different people. The suckiest part of the job was the Repetition ...year after year, day after day, week after week, month after month, for basically my whole life. It was enjoyable moments and depressing moments ..but all in all it was Meh! Couldn't do it again though."
good,"While at Walgreens, I work in the Photo Department to develop pictures and selling the higher end electronics. I also work on our truck days to unload all of the food and items for the store. On the weekend I work as a cashier ensuring smooth and quick transactions while giving good customer service. While cashiering, I also organize the store to ensure that it looks neat and presentable for any and all that visit the store. "
good,Walgreens is a company which keeps its customers happy and healthy by providing great customer service. We complete assigned tasks to create an environment where customers are able to feel safe and comfortable when shopping for items suitable to their needs.
good,"After working for Walgreens for three years, I've been extremely satisfied with my co-workers and management. Management is flexible with hours between second jobs, and school. At Walgreens, the management doesn't make the employees feel any less valued than shift leads, and all work is equal."
good,Pay is ok. Very Boring. Management and staff are pretty fun to work with. I would recommend only using this job as a stepping stone toward future goals. They will work with college students and those who are in school. They will cater to your schedules.
good,"I loved the Environment, everyone was really nice to me and still is. Although we went through a lot of management personnel, and the store gotten robbed more than twice, luckily while I was off."
good,"Fun work environment with very supportive management. There is always room for advancement and promotions. The enjoyable part is being able to work and learn with my colleagues, and there is no hard part about the job."
good,"Overall Walgreens was a decent place to work but communication between employees and management seemed fuzzy.  A typical day involved me helping customers with basic needs, stocking the shelves, working at the cash register and helping developing photos."
good,"A typical day at work is fast-paced and full of tasks to accomplish. I fill many prescriptions in a day while also tending to the out window and drive-through. I must also make sure the order is put away, out-of-stock drugs are ordered at the end of the day, and patients are called if their prescription has been waiting for them for 7 or more days. I also delete prescriptions that have been ready for 10 or more days. My co-workers are very helpful and are willing to step in if it gets busy. The hardest part of my day is keeping up with the demanding patients, as well as when patients are rude. The most enjoyable part of my job is a guaranteed lunch break and the positivity of my coworkers."
good,"I learned so many things from genpact, my former organisation i.e, Adroit web solutions that was my first job of life as a Customer Supports Executive. There i grown up alot in terms of communication skills and Telephonic interactions with customers and clients."
good,Working for Wal Mart is a good place to get customer service experience. The training prepares you pretty well for when u are out on the floor working
good,"A typical day at Walgreens includes dealing with nice customers, counting pills, and stocking medications. It's a great place to be employed at. I would definitely recommend it to someone."
good,very much enjoyed working with a team in improving the user experience for the walgreens in providing them with new features of colobrated services of world renowed pharmacies.
good,A great place to work with all team members getting along. The management gives positive feedback. The management allows you to do your job because they know you can are capable. They have confident in you to take a part of the store to do inventory management.
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for. Everything with them is without fault except my goals require more pay than what walgreens can offer me.
good,Could use better pay considering all the work you have to do. Great environment people are very friendly. Will work around school schedule but very poor training
good,Fine company with a strong training program. Seasonal presentation and weekly ad updates.  We guided customers to appropriate health a home goods.
good,This was a good job and management was great. The only reason I left this job was because they cut hours and I found a job that offered me fulltime and more pay.
good,"Great place to work.  I only left Walgreen's when I was told that the company was eliminating ALL Assistant Managers. "
good,"Walgreen is a great place to work if you want to learn new thing ,but they don't always promote the people that should be prompted, and every other month there is a budget cut  so your hours go down to almost nothing"
good,This job really taught me a lot and I met a lot of great people and made many new friends. They taught me everything I know about retail and would definitely consider working there again.
good,This is a great job.  Management is very understanding but fair.  Coworkers get the job done and are more than willing to help others that need assistance wether it be customers or other workers.
good,"typical work day come in speak to employees/customers while walking to my department, turn on my computer, start facing my department after that check on all pending orders, if those are ready call patient to pick up! the hardest part of the job id tell a patient we can fill the prescription because insurance dont cover or we dont have item in stock and the most enjoyable part of the day is seeing everyone you serviced today walk away with a smile even if they were in pain they still left with a smile"
good,My best day was when the truck arrived with the merchandise; all we had to bring it down and then divide it and accommodate it in place. In the middle of that task always had customers with doubts and questions and I always felt satisfied providing them help they need.
good,I loved working as a pharmacy intern for Walgreens in San Francisco. I was mostly counting and filling medication and I had a wonderful team who was productive in helping me get the job done
good,"Overnights was a bit stressful, only because there's one CSA on the floor, Management and one pharmacist for a 24-Hour building. Looking past this, the business was very well kept and provided a safe atmosphere for happy employment."
good,A very simple and relaxed environment and a great place to work and professional growth and flexibility to explore different career opportunities.  Amazing benefits and a good pay with yearly review.
good,"Working collections and working towards your goal as to how much you can collect for the month."
good,I started Walgreens fresh out of college. I have worked in every  department in the store and have had opportunities for advancement. Management cares about the company and their employees. My managers made sure I was able to succeed at my job. My co-workers were amazing. The most enjoyable part of my job was building relationships with our regular customers and pharmacy patients. It means a lot when a customer asks for you by name.
good,"This job is a very rewarding position and though at times work life balance can be difficult because it is a retail job, the team members, customers and leaders are all eager to help and support you."
good,"Any day at work can run from hardly any customers to being as busy as the last few days leading up to Christmas. Days are usually productive, especially with warehouse days because it gives me something to do. I've always seem to learn something different about the store almost everyday. From learning how to do orders to handling parts of the store on my own. My co-workers have their on personalities from enthusiastic to enthusiastic. They are very understanding. For retail, any day can be hard but the hardest and honestly the most annoying part about working at Walgreens is dealing with customers that think they know everything and apparently know how to run the store. Or having customers (grown people) act like they've been living in a palace or castle and expect everything to be spoon fed to them."
good,Well diversified and cultured location. Extremely busy which made time past quickly. I learned quickly on not to take customers negativity to personally. The co-workers I worked with were very knowledgeable and supportive not to mention fun personalities. I enjoyed working in different departments which helped to break up the daily routine verses having to stay in just one.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of me coming in to post all received orders to complete prescriptions that were past due. Place items in the order back to its respective locations. In between I would multi task with phone calls from MD's as well as take care of patients coming in to the pharmacy to drop off prescriptions and pick up. I would file all necessary paper work for the day in order to keep track of shipments received and delivered, as well as daily paperwork to keep track of the number of scripts per day. Communication is key to continue an active workflow to ensure we keep up with the incoming demand. We must always maintain a clean work area and also be able to adapt to any changes in the work flow."
good,"The job was very fun working with so many cosmetics and meeting really nice customers. I learned so much more about beauty products such as; makeup, hair and body wash."
good,There is no typical day at work. Each day could be different with duties to perform. Co-workers get along with everyone.
good,Very flexible with student schedules and friendly staff. They try to work out with your school schedule and good benefits are offered
good,"enjoyed the customers and employees. "
good,This is a great place to work and customer service is key. Great benefits and room for growth. Its a family oriented environment.
good,The most enjoyable part of a workday at Walgreens would be spending time with enjoyable people and having customers compliment my customer service skills. I learned a lot about customer service and how to handle different types of people.  The hardest part of the job was having customers items to their liking.
good,Great place to work with plenty of learning experiences and opportunities to grow within the company. The management and other co-workers provided a positive work environment.
good,it is very busy pharmacy to work at. i did learn so many pharmacy related things such as data entry and filling. the co-workers are really helpful.
good,I enjoyed working for Walgreens. I made a lot of friends and enjoyed the customer experience. I was easily able to make people happy and had the opportunity to get bonuses by selling promoted products. I would consider working for Walgreens again if the opportunity ever arises in a much higher position. Management was great at every location I worked at and the hours where consistent. The compensation was sufficient considering the low workload and low responsibility. This overall was a pleasant company to work for!
good,Here i really had a great time communication and helping customers. This job helped me learn a lot on how organizations like this company operate.
good,"Good place to work for, very busy which I like.  Management very helpful in teaching new things.  Great co-workers, we get along very well. Most enjoyable part of the joy are the customers that come in especially the regulars."
good,"A typical day as a Shift Lead involves morning paper work, making a daily task list for the crew members and counting the safe. I learned the ins and outs of the retail business. How to manage a store and a crew by keeping everyone productive and on task. The hardest part of the job was the late nights, the store was open until 10 pm. After closing there was nightly paper work and counting down the safe. The most enjoyable part was the regular customers and the crew."
good,"A typical day at work involves taking in about 200 prescriptions, filling, and selling them to patients. Also fixing any problems that may arise. Also normal everyday tasks like putting old prescriptions back to stock, contacting patients, ordering medications, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job is fixing problems and issues in the pharmacy. In order to be able to recognize and fix before the customer finds out about it or gets upset about it requires a level of familiarity with the pharmacy which comes with time, experience, and practice."
good,"I would go in to Walgreens every morning and there would be a pile of prescriptions printed out that needed to be filled. As an extern my primary duty was to count the medications and medial devices, adhere a label, and  put it in a bin for the pharmacist to check. It sounds simple and boring to most people but (I actually enjoyed it); you have to be very detail-oriented and pay attention. During the process of a prescription being filled, the prescription could go through many changes i.e. mfr change, dosage form change, new drug interaction etc., etc.  The entire time I worked there, everyone from cashiers to floating pharmacists to pharmacy techs, were nothing but helpful, supportive, and we all worked as a team to ensure that the patient received their prescription and great customer service. It was very rewarding. Early morning was usually slow and we had hours with many customers and little personnel. Walgreens is where I quickly learned how to prioritize, multitask, communicate effectively and efficiently to ensure the satisfaction of the customer. I had to be quick and maintain accuracy. I multitasked while being polite and positive to the customer. As an extern I didn't work drive thru and typing prescriptions could only be done under the supervision of a pharmacy tech.  Whatever I was able to do I did. In a pharmacy there is always something to do. I would maintain stock, file prescriptions, and organize around the pharmacy during slow periods."
good,"Walgreens is a great company whose commitment to improving the lives of others is apparent.  Pharmacy technicians will enjoy a great training program and the opportunity to obtain PTCB certification without the costs associated with attending a program through a college.  The company utilizes a portal to make sure staff is up to date on their training, so there is never a worry that important information will fail to be communicated."
good,"I learned to control my patient in dealing with customers. I Like the fact that when something improve in whichever department, our manager at that time would reward us with pizza. My co-workers are very friendly and they make you feel welcome. the most enjoyable part of the job is everyday its a different challenge for me..whether its a new customer..different rules..or anything in particular. All I know is that my days are always so productive."
good,"While working at Walgreens a typical day at work would consist of all of us going to our stations and getting the drawers and computers up and running for the day. We would open up the drive thru window and get that ready for the day. We would check the phones messages, check to see if there was any refill requests in the system, we would make calls to the customers and return phone calls to the doctors office, then we would start typing out the scripts and filling the medicines and getting them ready for pick up or delivery. I was trained by Walgreens to become a pharmacy technician. I learned how to work in the pharmacy and what medicines were what and how everything worked. The hardest part of all of our jobs I believe were the customers, not all of them and not all the time did the customers give us a hard time. Also when we were out of stock on a medicine and had to break it to the customer that it would be the next day before their medicines would be in. I absolutely love working in the pharmacy, it is a professional place to work and great experience. Working with the public and getting to know new people on a day to day basis to me is great."
good,"A very effort placed job. You are given a duty for a day and expected to complete it to the best of your abilities. The day's work-goals will always exceed what's capable so there is never a standing moment. Management can be unorganized depending on your work-place. I often felt like I had to complete one thing and then suddenly jump into something else that was unexpected. It isn't too difficult, but sometimes management seems so rushed to give directions that it could be confusing at times. "
good,Great Place for students needing part-time job. The company is great to work with and flexible with hours.
good,"Great company to work for, yearly raises & bonuses, can advance quickly, flexible scheduling."
good,A good place to work to increase customer service skills and interpersonal skills. There is nothing very hard about the job. Management works well with the other employees.
good,"What I loved about this job was working with customers and hearing their stories after I print their picture orders. When I was working there, career advancement was on a freeze, so it took me awhile to get to Head Photo Specialist."
good,"I was responsible for coming in and over seeing my cash drawer. Then i was in charge of sitting up and preparing my department for easy to see display and marketing new sales items. Acknowledging customers as they came into the store or in the beauty department about any sales or questions they may have. Guiding them to things they was seeking and friendly engaging in conversation to better fit their needs. The job was enlightening to the world of make up and Beauty products, Also serviced more with the ability to serve people in a friendly and positive attitude."
good,"Friendly People, A lot of Work to be done, Everyone Works as a team"
good,"Every day is very busy as the pharmacy I work in is a high volume store. I usually start out in the front until my next shift comes in where we then rotate to the next station. I switch to the drive-thru station till the evening shift comes in, then I am at the filling station. The responsibilities are as follows"
good,"Everyday I will come in and work on the photo department to see if it needs my help.  After that I would stock and help with customer service and anything else that the company needs me to do for the day.  I learned that it is really important to help meet the needs of other people so that they can continue to come back to the store to gain customer loyalty.  The management is very understanding but strict about what needs to get accomplished.  My co-workers are also very friendly and will do whatever you need if you need help and give good advice.  The hardest part of the job was staying on my feet for ten hours and working with unhappy customers, for whatever reason, will not be happy even if you are the nicest person in the world.  I really enjoy working with people on their pictures and getting them a great gift for some special event to make it look fantastic."
good,"I filled prescriptions, partial filled, out-of-stock, and stocked drugs. They took time to teach me the basics of filling prescriptions and the register. Management helped me when I was overwhelmed and showed interest in their patient's well being."
good,It is a working environment that provides you the opportunity to work in a professional setting.Provides you the opportunity to learn due to constant changes.The company provides the training to learn new skills .
good,"Had many growth opportunities. (Received raises and commission often)"
good,"Sitting at a desk all day, boring. Management is nice, very strict though"
good,enjoyed being trained in different departments and the people are always will ing to help
good,"A typical day for me at Walgreens would be, I'd get there at 11 a.m. and take over at the register until someone came in at 2 or 3 p.m. and then I would do production but throughout the day everyone was in charge of scanning prescriptions and entering them into the work queue."
good,"Working for Walgreens has enhanced my customer service skills. I am able to interact with people and connect with them in numerous ways such as creating a friendship, adding loyalty, and showing appreciation for their personality that is beneficial for me and Walgreens. There is always something new I learn at my job. The store manager is willing to teach each employee in their own level of understanding to conduct his assigned task. My coworkers are fun to work with and we are able to express our feelings about situations that may occur, good or questionable. The store manager gave me an opportunity to become a manager internship when I was a senior in college. I learned how the company operates beyond being a customer service representative. He taught me about payroll, schedule formation, business goals, assigned tasks given by managers and how they must be accomplished in a given time period, and how a manager is the supervisor of all store operations."
good,"I learned great management skills, how to schedule staff, great patient skills. The hardest part of the job was to keep everyone satisfied between staff and patients. The most enjoyable part of my job was to be able to help the patients."
good,"customer service"
good,"Walgreens is a a great company to work for overall. Benefits are great and the team work at Walgreens is very acceptable and all of my co-workers work together extremely well. It takes more time to move up, however; overall Walgreens is a wonderful company to be involved with."
good,I love working at walgreens! Sometimes you just need a change though!
good,Great place to work and you will definitely stay busy. There are a lot to learn there.
good,"Since Walgreens was my first job, I paid attention and tried to remember everything they told me. I tried to learn everything that I was taught. I first started off as a cashier and as soon as I turned 18, I was trained in the photo lab. I loved working in the photo department. There was so many things to do. I helped unload trucks, worked freight, developed and printed customers pictures. There was always something to do. I also assisted in setting up the promo aisle. I helped open/close the store."
good,"I like working in Walgreens as it offered me a very flexible schedule. I can switch day off with my co-workers if I inform my store manager earlier. The managers and co-workers are very nice and friendly as same as my family. We love help with each other and teach each other. A nice team work is the most enjoyable part of my job.  I learnt a lot from them; for example, during the fist week working at Walgreens, my managers began to teach me how to deal with customer complains -- be patient, be knowledgeable, and be friendly. And my co-worker told me how how to use the computer systems to check the in-store items information. The hardest part of the job is to remember all the products positions, functions, and customers' faces. The hardest part is the knowledgeable part of my job."
good,"Perform physical task in a fast pace work place. Receive store and issue materials,equiment and other items from stockroom,warehouse,or storage yard. Learned how to operate forklift, sitdown and stand up,electric pallet jack and hand truck."
good,"Walgreens was my first job, I absolutely loved it, but I felt like I was ready to advance but for Walgreens as a company I wasn't old enough. I've even considered going back simply for the work environment again."
good,"They treat all employees with respect!"
good,"A typical day at Walgreen's is overall steady paced. During lunch hours we'd have to move faster and work harder because it would get busy. I've learned how to manage money, how to provide excellent customer service, and stocking merchandise. Management at Walgreen's is great. The managers work hard to ensure that both the customers and their employees are well taken cared of. I enjoyed working with my co-workers because they were hard workers and worked as a team. The hardest part of my job was staying busy and making sure at all times I was doing something to improve our store. The most enjoyable part of my job was working on the floor because I could interact with our customers while they were shopping, and assist them."
good,Wonderful place to grow...Learned team work...Co workers were a plus...Best part were the customers...
good,"I only did my internship at walgreens, but in the time i got to spend with the walgreens pharmacy staff I learned everything there was to know in a short time thanks to the contribution of each staff member. They treated me fairly and always found the time to answer my questions and guide me through the process. I found it to be a most enjoyable experience I have since applied to every walgreens in the hopes of joining a great pharmacy crew to call my own."
good,"Fast paced work environment."
good,Great place to work. I started out as a cashier and worked my way up to second asst front end manager
good,"A typical day of work is extremely busy with a large amount of patients and a large amount of time dealing with insurance companies."
good,Filling prescriptions and calling insurance companies were regular duties daily.
good,"Great work environment."
good,"high job security, good benefits, and work hours, but front store management(non pharmacy) gives resentment and attitude if they have to work in pharmacy to help."
good,"I love working for Walgreens, But it rarely leaves room for advancement, and I notice a lot of employees with a lot of potential to move up in Walgreens, but fail to do so because they don't give them the opportunity to prove they are better than just an average cashier.  Then they hire in people for Lead positions instead of letting current employees move up.  The people that work there are all great though, I've never had an issue with my co-workers."
good,"On a daily basis, I participated in a daily morning meet, where I would tune into the duties for the day and what needed to be accomplished on my side of the office. I would spend the remainder of the day compounding IV drugs, speaking with patients, and keeping stock of inventory."
good,waited on customers and did stocking also did production sales .won awards
good,"A typical day at work would start with a list of things to do given by the manager on duty and written by my boss.  The items on the list would usually consist of anything from small tasks such as fixing a display to big tasks such as putting up a truck load of new products on the shelves.  "
good,I really enjoyed for Walgreens. I had the opportunity to grow and advance within Walgreens.
good,very fast paced place to work at. I have learned a lot working at Walgreens in just these couple months I have learned to deal with a lot of different people and to work fast but not to make the customer feel uncomfortable. management at Walgreens is great they are all so very nice. my co-workers are very nice people also everyone is very friendly. The most enjoyable part of my day is talking with the customers and seeing the smile on their faces.
good,"-enforced positive cultural values"
good,"I started as an intern with company and was offered a position as an Assistant Manager upon completion of the internship. I loved working with this company, they show you all of the aspects of running a successful company from purchasing to knowing how to work as a cashier when needed. I believe that is crucial."

good,"Demonstrated use and care of merchandise"
good,"best customer assistance "
good,It's a very fast paced pharmacy and the employees there kept work flowing
good,I liked my work schedule working overnight. My co-workers were awesome and the hardest part of the job is getting used to the hours.
good,"A typical day at the Walgreens distribution center starts with an informational morning meeting. This meeting includes the daily volume, specific tasks that need to be completed, and discussions on any problems we may face during the day. The rest of the day consists of staging and loading assets onto the trailers. Once the trailers are loaded the controlled pharmaceutical drugs are signed for by two employes and confirmed that they are loaded onto the trailer. After that the trailer is released to go to the stores on its route. At Walgreens I have learned about team work, work ethic, integrity, and safety. As well as learning multiple functions around the warehouse. Management and co-workers at Walgreens are wonderful, always profesional, and they really look out for each other. The hardest part about the job is that somedays things may not go as planned. Machines break down and cause the completion of the job to be delayed. The most enjoyable part of the job is the great co-workers that that work alongside me everyday. On stressful days at work when things may not be going as planned these co-workers will keep you smiling and pushing to get the job done. The amount of team work at Walgreens is amazing."
good,management made you feel welcome and great coworkers we all helped each other great team work
good,was never typical. Each day brought about something new which is what I loved most about the job. Walgreens was like a family to me.
good,"This was my very first job. My manager was very very nice, as well as the co-workers. I loved it. Until a new manager was hired. I had a regular schedule since I was heading into school. Once school picked up, I was only working 4-10pm on the weekdays. On more than one occasion the schedules would be changed during the day and I wouldn't know about it since I was in school. So I would show up to work when I wasn't needed or vice versa. Eventually I got tired of this, so I gave my two weeks notice and that was that."
good,A great place to work for someone who doesn't have much bills to pay. Managers and employees work with you and help you become a better employee. Benefits are great for employees especially individuals with children and healthcare needs. The hours worked are very late for a non 24 hour store - up to 12 a.m. the latest. Overall a very enjoyable place for a retail employee to work part-time.
good,"Location was convenient and the company values are something I can respect, Employers are very readily available to help you with any issue you or customers may have. Associates are very knowledgeable and ready to help out. Team oriented. Enjoyed the regular customers that you become accustom to on a daily basis"
good,A typical day at work would consist of me being assigned a specific department and having to maintain the area clean. Put back all returns and assist checking out customers when needed. My managers and coworkers were such great teams members and excellent to get along with. The hardest part about this job is that making sure everything is put back and cleaned within my time worked and that was hard because it maintain busy throughout the whole day
good,When i used to work for this company i had the greatest experience that they gave me 
good,"There is always work to do, or at least I keep myself busy by completing all task as much and as soon as possible. I love the team at my location, they make coming into work worthwhile. As a witness, the most difficult task at work to most of my co-workers would be dealing with irate customers with healthcare plan issues. I've learn to speak to them and tell them what they should only hear to understand the situation better which helps calm them down. But with retail, you are more than likely to come across difficult situations. This is also a high volume store, you must be able to work in a fast-paced environment."
good,"I enjoy dealing with customers daily, which I also the hardest part of my job.  I enjoy the business end more.  Inventory, credits, chargebacks."
good,Management and coworkers were great. Company really cares about their employees.
good,Good company to work for. Its just not in the field i love! Employees are very helpful and understanding. Stocking shelves and resetting stands and isles a typical day.
good,Everybody gets along we laugh talk take trips with each other. We help raise money for a lot of origination. 
good,I loved working for Walgreens.  It was a blast to get to know each and every individual I worked with.  The customers were great and there were a few regulars that I absolutely loved.  The best part about my job was helping individuals find everything they needed quickly and easily and seeing the smiles on their faces letting me know that I had made their day.  The hardest part about my job was telling people that we didn't have the product they were looking for and sometimes they just couldn't seem to understand that.  
good,"Not much room to advance unless you go to school. other than that, wounderful place to work for."
good,"they keep you busy changing out displays/stocking shelves/ running photo/front register,answering customer calls and questions. its alot of responsibility."
good,Working for Walgreens is a very rewarding experience. Its a great place to exercise leadership as well as interacting with customers.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walgreens, I was able to help open this store from the begging. Helped set up the selves and set the product. Met some wonderful people, and got to work with some of them. With it being a tourist town, I got to meet some interesting people when they came to town. My manager was great to work with, he was there to help you and show you how to make your job go more smoothly."
good,"As a photo specialist, you gets lots of tasks and not enough time. Pretty typical for most jobs. The workers are very family-orientated. The customers are respectful for the most part, so it's easy with work with them. Fast-paced reacting to changes and high-quality customer service are recommended for this job."
good,"Well my typical day at walgreens was to be up front at the register help customers check out their items they wanted to purchase. I did freight when I wasn't busy with customers, customer service, handled money and keep my area clean by sweeping, mopping and wiping down counters. I have gained experience in customer service, handling money for retail, freight, and always going the extra mile for customers. Coworkers were great because if i needed help with customers if we were busy they came. Hardest part of my job, well it wasn't really hard,but if i had to say it would be trying to help customers during holidays because its really busy. Most enjoyable part of that job was greeting customers everyday and just having a positive attitude."
good,This company has the well-being of pharmacy at heart. It can be rewarding to work closely with the public.
good,"A typical day at work would start by filling prescriptions, typing prescriptions, calling insurance/doctors/patients and preforming a lot of customer service. Co-workers are fun to be with which makes the day quite enjoyable. Everyday is a learning experience."
good,"Staying busy and having the challenge of making a productive rate according to company standards. Evenly distributed work among each employee. Cant say that there was anything negative about it, other than the fact that they dont recognize the ones who put forth the most effort into trying to obtain employment as a full time employee; from temp to hire."
good,"Very busy work days, with lots of opportunities to help patient and costumers in a variety of ways."
good,"I have always been a very reliable employee. I show up on time, do what I am asked to do. I get along with all my co-workers & management is very supportive. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with the public. The hardest part is always being busy I like being busy.

good,"The management was extremely nice, very helpful, and understood situations that would come up unexpectedly. They were attentive and on any problem that came to the table. The most enjoyable part of the job was selling the make up products in the store."
good,"Clock in and hit that register letting the previous cashier go and right to taking care of the customer. I learned all about customer service from this job take care of the customer be attentive and always apologize sincerely if something is out or you don't carry it, running reports for your register, stocking, and how corporations work. I loved my entire management team from the store manager with is gruff exterior but nice guy inside, to the nit picky executive assistant , lets not forget the three assistant managers great great people always laughing and joking but pillars of service and wanted to help you if you had a problem not faked truly worried about all the employees. My co-workers out of work were great but most of them on my shift didn't take their job to serious, which was distressing I love to joke and kid on the job but not at the expense of doing ones job. Leaving was the hardest thing about Walgreens I loved working there. The customers were probably the most enjoyable of anywhere I have ever been either working or as a customer happy people mostly colorful and always wanted to chat your ear off when they came passing by I really felt like I became a part of their lives when they came to see me sometimes daily."

The management at Walgreens are the best, they are really wonderful people to work with, and they made the job fun. My co-workers were some of the best people that I have ever worked with and I became good friends with them. The hardest part, there wasn't a hardest part the job was easy and fun. The most enjoyable part of my job was making the customer happy."
good,"speak to every customer and help them when they need it. stay kind and polite. nothing hard about the job just keep your head up, smile, put up merch, cahier and help people."
good,The best part of the job was the many people you meet daily. The work environment was easy going unless its during the holidays.
good,"Very busy work enviroment, but you work very closely with the public"
good,"Very busy stores overall. Managing and assigning tasks to all employees to ensure all tasks were completed for a successful store. Assisted with the duties of the Store Manager such as scheduling, payroll, opening and closing the store, etc."
good,"Sign in, Say hello to co-workers, Walk down my aisles and see what needed to be restocked and organized, unload boxes in the stock room on truck day and organized wut did not fit up front... I learned how to keep myself busy and that it is very important to be on time and be honest about having to take off work... The hardest part was having to reach the high shelves.... Truck day......."
good,Great company to work for. Strong team oriented. Upper management is always on top of things and ready to help every employee with anything they need.

good,"• Collaborated in Implementing procedures for managing, packing and resending disposals according to environmental and health standards."
good,"""Typical"" days are highly dependent on the individual store and its volume."
good,The store I work at is very diverse so there is all kinds of people working there and customers from all over. Advancement is possible as long as you are a good worker and honest. My co workers are all pretty great. Hardest part is dealing with rude customers but after a while you realize its part of the job and don't mind it as much.
good,point of sale cash handling merchandising and customer service
good,A typical day at work would start with your everyday tasks and then a list that the managers give to be done.
good,"Overall a good company to work for. most of the people were good to work with, the job was challenging yet fun. the hardest part of this job was the location and the distance i had to travel every day."
good,Loved what I did and my fellow co-workers. Miss being at this place alot.
good,"Employees love working for Walgreens. It is a fun place to work. Management kept the mood light all the time, never any real pressure or frustration on their part."
good,"I enjoyed the pharmacists and techs that I worked with and if it would not have been for my husbands transfer to KS I would still be working there. But ufortunately I became sick right after we moved here and I am just starting to want to start back to work, part time, preferable in a mail order pharamcy where I dont have to stand on my feet all day long. If I an type prescriptions or deal with customer service that would be a perfect job forme."
good,"I hae been working for walgreens 3-4 years it is a good company to work for. Manager is very consiterate and the enviorment as far as co-workers and management go feels like family. I am just looking to do something different with a set scheduale, better pay, and a job that would help me with my future career."
good,I have worked for walgreens for 3 years. within the first 6 months i was promoted to certified photo specialist and within 1 year I was promoted to Pharmacy technician then became certified with 6 months.

good,always productive. never a boring day at work. There are always new positions available. walgreens is a great company to work for
good,Walgreens does a fantastic job of helping out it's employees when the employees need time off. They do a great job making sure you are happy in your job and will talk to you about how things are going. They genuinely care for you.
good,Good place to work if you're looking to gain customer service experience. You get one on one time with your managers unlike major corporations. The open door policy is really good.
good,Working for Walgreens taught me alot more than I expected and I still shop there even though I havem't worked for the company in over 4 years.
good,"You’ll overall have a good experience as a worker, you have to be patient most times but everything is alright, the staff will be kind to you & plus you can get certified in the Pharmacy for free"
good,Working in a field where the clients are mostly sick or suffering can be taxing. The people you work with really matter and need to lift spirits. If thats not possible working in the environment can lead to dissatisfaction
good,"It is a overall fun job you have to have a flex schedule to handle it "
good,Its a great place to work  I learn about different aspects of health and beauty.  I like to educate customers and point them in the right direction. I also love my co-workers and managers. The hardest part is we seem to be short staffed and we can't get the jobs done.   I just wish they paid more.
good,Nice place to work with good benefits. Flexible hours and lots of locations. Very easy to move up. Many different departments available for you to work in.
good,Warehouse maybe what I enjoyed must about the work recieving and unpacking merchandise. Had a lot of experience on my time working that was my first job.
good,"I currently work at one of the locations in Lake Charles, LA. I highly enjoy my job and my coworkers. The managers do change so it’s hard to give a review about one specific person, but I have never had an issue with any management."
good,"walgreens warehouse give good work experience"
good,If someone is a student then i highly recommend working over there the managers will off help if you need it. But you need to keep being on task also communication is also a factor in working there.
good,"Typical day is 10hrs operating  battery and baler, cleaning duties, and clearing faults. Working up at these machine called DE1, DE2 and DE3. Monitoring  calls over the walkie"
good,Our staff must put customer needs first.  We walk our customers to the product they are looking for and assist in any way we can.  We have a service recovery system in place to help us ensure we have happy customers.
good,Stressful work environment. Must be able to multitask many times without adequate technician assistance which creates unnecessary distractions from your work.
good,I worked there for 19 almost 20 years in the pharmacy.  I miss everyone there so much.  Store managment was so supportive and non-judgemental.  I developed life long friendships with my co-workers.   I really wish I still worked there.
good,Walgreens is a nice company to work for. Unfortunately Customer Service Associates can only make up to $13/hr and there is no overtime. Great for students or someone with a second job. Benefits are good.
good,The job is very rewarding and it can offer great opportunities in advancement if interested. It’s a fast paced environment but can come with many rewarding benefits while working with your customers and creating a relationship with them
good,The hardest part of my job is dealing with the language barrier.  But thanks to my translator on my phone that helps solve the problem.  My day consist of taking in and filling prescriptions.  Making sure there is not a shortage or overage of pharmacy inventory.  Helping a patient get what they need to make themselves or a loved one is the best feeling I have all day.
good,"Opened and close the store. Unloading the trucks, management was very understanding, and the most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers, management, and customers"
good,Este empleo de verano me sirvió para adquirir experiencia laboral ya que anteriormente no había tenido la oportunidad. Obtuve una buena experiencia el breve tiempo que estuve trabajando en el area de servicio al cliente en Walgreens porque pude entender como trabajar con los clientes y como darles una buena experiencia mientras compraban en la tienda.
good,"This is an amazing, low-stress beauty job."
good,The company is great fair pay assistance with career advancement and at least all the leaders I've worked with have been understanding that sometimes life gets rough. We do have basic problems such as gossip and call outs but management is very quick in trying to fix callouts and shut down gossip. Walgreens is willing to assist employees in career advancement as much as they can.
good,"I was a good worker there I left cause my daughter .  I worker in the photo lab, helping customers out, stocking the coolers, and shelves, there always something to do."
good,"Working at Walgreens I am learning some new things such as western union, fed ex and printing photos.  It is an enjoyable place to work, everyone gets along with each other and helps each other out. I don't feel uncomfortable asking questions that may seem obvious to them."
good,Walgreens is a very good place to work. I have been with the company for years and they have great benefits. I love the staff and we work very hard to give the best customer service.
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for! I just would like a change in a hospital setting or somewhere where i can grow and expand my skills. I am a senior tech at Walgreens and feel as if there is limited room for growth.
good,I would come into work ready to clock in. Then I would either start working on the cashier or working out inventory. I would help customers look for products and then I'd do my final duty shifts.
good,"I have learned a lot working a Walgreens. Even for a part time swing shift position I was putting myself to the challenge of getting tasks done within the four hours I had there during my day/night shifts. The tasks included were measuring temperatures in the coolers, managing inventory in case of overstock, handling deliveries and making sure customers get the best deals with the rewards card."
good,"In walgreens San Patricio I learned abut team work, customer care, great service, I get to now my work, my lines and my customers. I worked 40 hours in a week and be able to learned that customer care is the most important thing, it is fullfilling for me."
good,"I worked for Walgreens for 10 years. I left for relocation purposes. They offer great benefits and a family environment between coworkers. You have to multitask and delegate task to your employees. Management is demanding, but fair."
good,"My store was fantastic and always provided the best support for me. My managers were concerned with my performance, my improvement, and ran the store efficiently. The coworkers were helpful, team-oriented, and we all truly had the store's best interest at heart. Lately, there have been some corporate changes in policy that have overall negatively affected the company but the stores continue to operate the best they can."
good,On an average day I come in.clean photo machines then check for orders to be completed.if no orders are so at the time I stock the shelves and the cooler area.once that's done by then orders start coming in and you get pretty busy for the rest of the day.I would always run register so the head cashier could go on break.
good,If you would like a management career you can get it here as long as you work hard. There are some frustrations but over all happy with all the stores I have worked at.
good,Good days and bad. Retail Can be very challenging working with the public everyday. Lots of shoplifters and under staffed. They offer 401k for non union  employees.
good,This company provided a fantastic opportunity to get comfortable with retail. I usually worked 8 hour shifts and had costumer interaction the entire 8 hours. I loved talking to my costumers and ensuring them that they were in good hands. This job helped me become very natural at talking to people of all ages and cultures. it was a great learning experience.
good,"On a typical day at work, we know our own tasks and oftentimes, if we finish early, we help other team members with their tasks. I learned many things from Walgreens. I learned how to multitask, enhanced my communication skills, socialize professionally, and caring about our customers. The hardest part of the job would be dealing wit upset customers. However, the most enjoyable part of the job is listening to our customers' concerns and finding ways to resolve those issues. In other words, helping our customers is our top priority therefore, seeing them leaving the store happy is what makes our job worthwhile."
good,Good place to work.  They supported their employees. Great benefits  and all employees received large discounts on the merchandise.  Hours worked were strictly enforced.
good,helped me communicate on a daily basis in person with customers. Became really aware of products and its prices. i would say it was a fair paid job for what i worked. great managers!
good,"the hours are well worth the pay for once a week, i made about 400$ per week, the staff was great and the tasks given were very interesting to work on."
good,"The environment at this location is enough to keep me calm during my work hours. Although it may be slow at times, the entire team does their best to ensure any and all customers are given the best service possible."
good,"It's your basic retail job. I was lucky to get hired into a store with a fantastic team. Those who have come and gone over the years, have all been great to work with. The company offers a lot of extra things. There's several websites to use to get discounts on a lot of things like traveling, movies, cars, etc. Insurance isn't too pricey for a single person. Corporate has some policies in place that make sense, but as a store employee you have to wonder if they've tested all these policies in store. But again, if you look from their eyes, they make sense for both business and safety reasons. I like it here, can't really complain"
good,"A regular day can be uneventful at times, only restocking shelves but there is always the chance to help. The coworkers are willing to teach you new things and to remind you of where certain things go. The management is fair and very helpful. Everyone is friendly to each other and the customers. The hardest part of the job was standing for such a long time. The best part of the job was when costumers were pleased with the help that was given to them."
good,Climate controlled relaxed but fast paced job two thirty min breaks paid everyday work four days a week ten hour shifts. Three days off. Picking products and placing in totes
good,Still good people working there they cleaned house with management they pay more than most warehouse in the area they give good raises they have christmas and thanksgiving  dinners
good,"Not a lot of incentives and not a lot of career advancement.  Unless you are a pharmacist, you will not make much money or advance to the next level.  Not much room to grow."
good,"it's a great place to learn so much,  many different jobs to choose from.  costumer service comes in handy,  no matter which department you work at ,phone answering everywhere. you learn to work fast with different kinds of tasks."
good,"I loved this place, they really invested into their employees and had a great software to streamline service for patients. Most locations also offer special trash-cans to safely dispose of old medications. During flu season they would award a 5$ bonus per flu vaccine to employees who signed up patients for flu shots. Once a year they also fund raise to help the poorest of children across america in an event called red nose day. They sell red nose merchandise and donate the proceeds to children's charities. They raises were on average 1$ per annual review. They offered great benefits and 401k for their employees. I could go on and on. Definitely the best retailer to work for. You can move up quite fast in the job and become a senior tech after 2 years."
good,Great people to work for and to work with - progressed within the company starting as Inventory Control Manager in 2007 and continued with the company relocating to Georgia in order to correct issues at that Distribution Center - migrated to position of Inbound Manager and later to Outbound Manager - Resigned from my position in 2016 in order to address personal issues at home in South Carolina
good,"Being a pharmacy tech can be very difficult some days no matter where you work, but the people I work with really make the job! Hours are very flexible and ideal for a student or someone wanting a part time side job. Pay could be a lot better. The job is different everyday, and can be very fast paced. It is retail so there are some difficult customers, but at the same time you build relationships with some of the greatest patients!"
good,"I really loved this job. I enjoyed helping patients to feel well and stay well. My co-workers were great, respectful, and caring. There was only a hard time when I transferred to the other Walgreens and it was only me all day. I had a great time in Rincon, we strived to give 100% service."
good,I enjoyed working for Walgreens. Great team players and management was very nice and understanding. There is room for advancement as they like to hire from within.
good,"I’m only working to have something to do. I don’t need the job, however I do get insurance and dental and it’s very"
good,"Wish  there  would keep  me on but i needed my State  license, which  i just  have  my training  license, applying for  The  State  exam  in 2month.. Walgreen's  is very  good  place  to get started from  college.  I wish i had known  that thier have  it on school  for pharmacy technician."
good,I was on a contract there and it ended walgreens was overall a great experience I met all different kind of customers there seen many new faces faced different challenges but overall it was a great experience
good,"Walgreens is a easy job if you're trying to get by, pay wasn't enough but the satisfaction of actually having a steady income is enough to keep anyone around if you sell yourself short."
good,"The company strides in promoting advancement. Training and onboarding are very welcoming and management is very involved with their employees. So far, a great place to work"
good,Walgreens is a hard working and fun experience in working. We work together and bond with each other while working. The manager is a kinda and helpful person that helps you when you don’t get something or need help. The co workers are kind and they help you.
good,"The main point is customer service. Walgreens prides itself on taking care of their customers. They have great opportunities for advancement, and great management. The hardest part of the job is learning both pharmacy and front of the store (both are required to be a assistant manager). My favorite part is the employees they have become like family."
good,"Fun place to work, exciting pace when students are at location.  Typical day would be arriving, talking your team into position and winning the night."
good,"A great way to be involved with patients and ensuring they are compliant with taking medications as prescribed - it's great to feel you are making a difference. Management was very approachable, and there were many fun activities such as celebrating Customer Service Week and Pharmacy Tech Week."
good,"Working at Walgreens was really fun and nice. I felt comfortable, the staff was amazing and always willing to help. The manager was very understanding about everything and willing to work with staff when needed he was was always out of his office working right along with his staff/team welcoming in customers."
good,"Walgreens will pay the bills that's for sure.  But it will drain your soul and your mind.  Job is super stressful.  I love my coworkers.  I love the customers.  I don't love the phones ringing non-stop.  The hassles with insurance companies.  I've been robbed once.  No breaks.  Don't get me wrong, I'm very thankful for the opportunity Walgreens has given me.  But I'm just getting burnt out."
good,I've worked 10 years in customer service and to this day Walgreens has been the easiest and headrest job I've ever had. The days switch from easy going to hard and needing time to think out your game plan. You're given every opportunity to grow and learn but make sure you get information from the right people if you're lost.
good,theres nothing i can really say about the job but management sucks and they need to work on that. great benefits the hours are great the people are great
good,"Good  enviorment to work in , you learn a lot. Its a good job for college students or for your first job you can aquire some good values as an employee."
good,I processed the hallmark cards each week and for each holiday.  The flexibility was great with school age children.  I also had the opportunity to help in other areas of the store.
good,This business has a typical retail environment. I have learned light inventory skills. Management changes from time to time. The workplace culture is busy.
good,"It was a fun place to be at times. There was hard work and there was easy work. The hardest part is keeping a smile while working hard, but it’s definitely achievable."
good,"As soon as you clock in you are greeted by all your team mates making you feel comfortable at the start. Everyone is a team player with the No one is left behind attitude, every one does their fair share of work from register, to drop off and drive thru service. Then you rotate from each work station; starting as follows, morning shift gets front register and drive thru, evening shift relieves morning person of this duty, closing shift person relieves evening shift person from duties and then after lunches another rotation begins."
good,Get along great with employees  and management.. never a dull moment very task-oriented overall a good place to work at. Always something new to learn
good,"I was given an opportunity, through the EGUSD job program, Workability, to work at Walgreens for four weeks. During the time, I was able to learn, what it is like to be in the work force. As a student in high school, I was able to increase my responsibilities that I already possessed. Every Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, I must sign in at the time I have arrive, and the time I leave. My duties were assisting the customers, stocking, and handing out flyers for charitable purposes. The staffs' work ethnic was strong and positive. I believe positivity could make a difference for those who work at a company and as well as for the customers. The hardest part of the job was knowing where everything was in a store as I only worked there through a Job program that was temporary. Despite that I was willing to help the customers in anyway I can. The best part of the job is the encouragement from the employees have for one another. Making it a positive environment for all."
good,"When I first started at Walgreens, I absosoluly loved it.  I loved the quick paced environment, the staff, the benefits and career opportunities, I caught on really fast and well It was the perfect job for me as I have always been in the customer service field. As time went on the job got to stressful to handle. Cooperate started cutting hours so much that most days we only have 3 people on a day to run the store which at my location is very difficult. It is one of the biggest and busiest stores so being this short handed left us with a lot of angry customers. I started having to handle photo, cosmetics, give breaks, vendors, helping pharmacy and customers out of the floor by myself which performing a days work. Its gotten so impossible, your set up to fail right off the bat with no help. I cannot handle the stress of the job anymore as they are not interested or don't care to understand that the store needs more help to run and provide the best customer service to the customers."
good,"The work day will place you at every station in the pharmacy before you leave at the end of your shift.  You may start at the register, go into prescription filling, work the drive up window, and go into filing prescriptions for pick up, answering phones, and then start all over again.  This is good if you are bored doing one thing for a very long time.  It is bad if you like to be comfortable doing the same thing, but in a fast paced environment.  "
good,"I had a great experience with the Compounding Division of Walgreens/Optioncare. I was continually learning new things: enterals and tube feedings, billing, intake, specialty medications, chemo compounding. Work was made fun by the management team and staff."
good,"Great team work,  very organized, everyone was friendly and helped each other. Would definitely recommend a friend or family member ro work at Walgreens."
good,"We filled about 200-300 prescription per day. i did learn a lot from my manager there and i did feel encouraged to continue to grow. I just didn't see room for growth within the company, it was in a poverty area and made it hard to meet the customers needs when prescriptions were too expensive. When you were able to help and find a way to lower their cost, they would be beyond gratefull. In the end seeing how many lives I was helping made everything worth it."
good,"I've learned how to communicate and work with the customers along as helping them out. Also being a very well team player as we all learn from one another to get the job done,"
good,After working for Walgreens for 7 years it’s had it’s ups and downs but currently I work overnight and I’m scheduled 8 days in a row then I’m off for 6 in a row so it works really well for me although the pay has never been great and is the only thing keeping it from being top tier.
good,"My days starts with checking my emails to see if there are any specific task I need to complete for the day.  Then I start with my team members in inventory control and delegate the task to them.  I do my daily counts, and checking on my team members to see how they are progressing or if they need help or have any questions.  I have learned a great deal about multi tasks and being a team player. I have learned how important my role as a lead is to my manager and making everything go as to be expected and if there is a issue I figure out ways to solve it before I go to my manager if needed.  I also learned more about doing what’s best for the company and the customer. The workplace culture was very positive and keeping the customer satisfied and happy was the main focu.  The hardest part of the job was when the building closed and my work family I couldn’t work with any longer, there were no hard parts of the job.   The most enjoyable part of the job is that I had a part in making customers happy and helping to make the company successful!  Working with all the team members was one of the most joyable moments because we were all a work family and I loved it!"
good,Good company with great benefits. The management was good and fair to all. This was my first time to work over night and I found it challenging and fun.
good,I enjoy working for Walgreens. My career is very rewarding. Team work is an everyday thing at Walgreens. Managers are very personable and understanding.
good,"Working at Walgreens was an overall good experience. I had excellent co workers and an awesome manager. I learned how to do resets and stage different products. A typical day of work for me was selling products to customers. Saving inventory, keeping my area in the warehouse organized and clean, restocking shelves. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers, figuring out their needs and finding that perfect product they were looking for to make them smile and improve their day"
good,Walgreens was an overall fun place to work. With great management and awesome staff it was always a job you would look forward to go to. The discount was a great bonus too.
good,"Walgreens is contently changing to meet the needs of the customer. Over the years the culture has changed from an employee first to a customer first environment, and to do more with less."
good,"Management was ok , they could've been trained better but it was a great job overall. There are always lazy staff members at any job , and they made it hard for the people who actually came to do work."

good,"Great opportunities for advancement. Excellent training, workplace environment, encourages teamwork, and stability. Very good customer service leadership."

good,Enjoyed working for walgreens and have no complaints at all. My time always flew by and pay was great and management was fair at all times and friendly. You can train within the workplace. There is plenty of opportunity to move up within the company.
good,"My managers at Walgreens were helpful and supportive, and willing to arrange a work schedule that didn't conflict with my college coursework. The most enjoyable part was working closely with my assistant managers and shift leads."
good,"Walgreen's is your typical convenience store/pharmacy. As a cashier your biggest challenge will be staying busy during slow hours along with cashing out difficult customers. Regular customers brighten up your day. Management was great, and attitude was laid back. There's room for advancement to photo and pharmacy positions. Benefits are great as well. It's very hard to get fired as long as you're putting in effort."
good,"A typical day at work is filling and typing prescriptions and dealing with people insurance calling insurance to get the correct information to run a prescription through. Every day you learn something new like codes to make a prescription to go through and new insurance you never seen before and how to enter them in the system. Every location has different managements like the pharmacy, store managers, I was lucky to have the best pharmacy manager and pharmacist and co-workers but store manager was a pain didn't help at all with the pharmacy. The hardest part of the job was that we didn't have enough hours so we were always short on people and we were always busy so we had angry customers in drive thru and inside the store because medications weren't ready and they waited to long but other than it great job. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers and the pharmacy manager everyday you learn something new."
good,"My managers at Walgreens were easy to talk to and understanding. My coworkers were very resourceful, friendly, and helpful. Busy days are hectic and stressful, and sometimes you had difficult customer but the work environment is great."
good,"to work at walgreens its very you need to have a extremely good customer service skill because ,every employed is on competition ,you can get fire for a simple reason if the customer is not satisfie."
good,They try to keep you busy and it helps the days go buy fast.  Managers are very easy to get along with and fun to work with.  good part time job for a high school or college student.
good,Management was a one great training excellent customer service all around good environment nothing bad to say about Walgreens giid pay great people 5 thumbs up
good,"They need to offer full timers set schedules with no weekends. However, at my location, they gave part-time help the pick of the hours and let the full-time people take the rest. Didn't set to well for me."
good,"If you are interested in working for a retail chain pharmacy, Walgreens is a great place to be.  Except for the sometimes unrealistic management goals that are expected to be implemented, it is a good chain."
good,Walgreens is a good place to work. A lot of customer interaction all shift long. A typical day would be either working the front register go on break and finish working the front.
good,"Retail is retail, but walgreens is at least better than cvs"
good,"I had a great boss and I worked with some awesome people. Hours were long but I loved the OT. Only thing I didn't like was the location. It was the busiest corner in Shoreline, on a bus line. Nights were pretty hectic and some crazy people would come in and make a lot of noise."
good,"A typical workday is always crazy busy. I learn how to do thing a different thing each day. I love working in the store to clean the shelves, stock the shelves, clean the stockroom, help the customers look for items, and order out of stock items. Additionally, I love to work in the pharmacy. I learn about new medicines, I fill prescriptions, help customers, call insurance companies as well as doctors. I refill prescriptions. I learn about brand vs generic medicines and I know how to direct customers who have questions about what they take their medications for. I love being there everyday to help customers and learn new things. The work environment and culture is very positive. We teach people when they mess up and get coaching cards, but on the other hand we also get rewarded for going out of our way and helping people. The hardest part of the job is honestly being able to put a smile on my face and ensure that my personal life does not affect my work. Although I never have an issue with it, I notice that the days I'm upset it takes more energy out of me to go to work and try to make my customers happy. The most enjoyable moments are when I used something I learned to help someone. The joy on a customer's face is what makes me feel satisfied."
good,"A typical day at work was not too easy, but easier than one at the mall I had worked for previously. I learned how to operate a cash register there. The management was very good, the workplace culture was diverse and hard working. The hardest part of the job was occasionally stocking the freezer. The most enjoyable part was just helping the customers at the checkout line."

good,It's a good job very organized and well planned out days. management does their best to help everyone they can. It is very rewarding to help customers on a daily basis.
good,Okay to work here not bad or good really. The pay was okay but after a year you get paid vacation time no mater how many hours you work. Not a hard or stressful job.
good,if you want to work at a job and get a lot of hours then don't come to Walgreens. my job is super chill but i want to be full time and everyone is either part time or less then part time. you don't get paid a lot either.
good,working at walgreens was great. people enjoyed working there and the pay was good. updated equipment and respectful managers. long hours and opportunity for overtime
good,A typical day a Walgreen's is helping customers find things they are looking for in the store. I learned that helping others is what I like to do. Management that I work with are the greatest people that I get to work with everyday. The hardest part of the job is when a customer very rude and makes it hard for you to have fun at the job for the rest of the day. The workplace is great I live near my work so drive is nothing for me which is great on saving money on gas!
good,Flexible when it came to schedule but didn't really give to many hours . Management was always respectful. The hardest part of working there was dealing with rude costumers but that didn't happen often and when it did management helped solve any problems.
good,My personal experience with Walgreens was very good due to the amazing team and management I worked with.  Work life balance was very tolerable and there was ample oportunities for training and advancement.
good,I like working her just this job just like any other takes a lot out of you because it never stops there. The company has room to grow more and can improve on some things. My biggest thing is that they hurt the workers when they cut hours and expect the same result on half a team.
good,Along with providing friendly and great customer service courteous insufficient we also handle everything from cash register operations and  customers Service to merchandising. Store inventory  An maintaining store signage & displays.
good,Walgreens is a great place to work if you like a retail environment. You are given a opportunity to make promotional monies by doing the Saturday Promo's. I benefited greatly in my cosmetic dept. I enjoyed my customers and connected with many of them. .The job is not that hard and your given plenty of time to complete task.
good,Tranquilo muy buen trabajo y compañerismo me encantaba poder dialogar con la gerencia y las oportunidades.
good,"Walgreens is a really great company to work for. In my nine plus years of service I can say the only thing I didn't like were coworkers. Unexpected things happen in life. Downfall would be coworkers calling to have schedule changed because of emergencies and never wanting to change their own schedule when something happens to someone else, this affecting ones work to life balance. I had the pleasure of working at a couple of stores and was able to learn a lot about different positions with in the store and it helped me advance in the company. My last store was in a rural area with people whom were not welcoming to change so at times things were difficult when there was no need."
good,"Days always start up with contact with a number of doctor's offices, update of necessary equipment for the day.  Once things were ready to go, it is a jump in immediately kind of job.  Patients are always waiting and many ill or in a hurry.  Careful attention is an absolute must, knowing that the care of the patients is crucial.  It is busy and fast paced but enjoyable and moves quickly"
good,"Its a great place to work, just not easy to move up. My brother has been in the company for 11 years and if someone comes tomorrow and joins management they would still be getting paid the"
good,A came in it was busy from 10pm to 12am then 1am to 2am easy stocking maybe after that 3am to 4am task list and 5am to 8am finishing making the store to look presentable. I learned to be more organized and to manage my day better by working there. Management will work with you if they can but we had people come/go but overall I love the management. The Work environment was friendly and they are good people.The hardest part of the job for me was stocking the freezer but I only had to stay in there for 30 or 45 minutes. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking with some of the people from overnights.
good,"My experience at Walgreen's was a good one. loved my co-workers, and managers. 50/50 on customer base, but good half was always a joy to have. good structure, well planned out schedule. all around good retail experience."
good,i loved working in the pharmacy. i usually worked the drive thru and i like dit aloit more the the windows because i was steady busy.  i just didnt like the favortism that went one with the pharmists
good,"It's an Honor and Pleasure to be working side by side with fellow peers and managers you care so much about. Started working there in fall of 2014, was immediately drop in the forest, did not know anything about Pharmacy, but the more you gain experience, the more you gain knowledge"
good,"They were very good about working with my schedule.. At the time I worked there I had joint custody of my son, they only worked me on the nights that I did not have him..the customers were mostly very nice..Work was very fast paced"

Before I left i we working in the pharmacy. Everyone got along at my job which made it even more better working at. Hate the fact we had to close down. This was my only job since i graduated high school in 2011."
good,Walgreens focus is on customer service and taking care of their employees to keep them long term. Alot if changes in the past few years has switched focus to the pharmacy and a select number of stores specializing in beauty. Recently seen alot of cuts in front end labor budgets making it more difficult to keep employees on the front end.
good,"Busy workplace where you are going to learn lots of thing if you want to. "
good,"Walgreens was my very first job, but looking back it was the best place for a first timer. Always very accommodating of school schedule. The only thing I can say negatively was the compensation with only receiving a fifty cent raise my entire two years with the company and learning every position and aspect."
good,"Easy to move up in the company if you know your stuff, pretty easy job, great pay, can definitely learn a lot if you put your mind to it, good benefits, will hire for full-time easily. Can work in the pharmacy which is really interesting."
good,The people at Walgreens are all very nice and hard workers. We all work together as a team. I work in the beauty department and give people tips on what products to buy.

good,"Working at this particular Walgreen was a great experience, i had to leave due to a need for stronger pay otherwise i would have definitly stayed on with Walgreen. I never dreaded going to work and always was looking forward to seeing my coworkers"
good,Day and evening shifts required. That didn't bother me. Downside to working retail was having to work Thanksgiving or Christmas. The most difficult part of my job was trying to keep my sales up in my department while having to do resets. Very time consuming and you had to stay very focused. That was tough. I was called in the office and my manager would ask me about my sales and why so low. They finally created jobs that allowed resets to be done without me having to worry about that task.
good,I have connected with my customers and they know me by name as well as I know them by name they look for me and know I will provide the best service possible.
good,"When I go to work, I am greeted by the Walgreens staff.  Punch in on the clock. I had a task list to complete by the end of the day. I learned not to end a job before I get another job. The hardest part of job was to fill in for another worker. The most enjoyable part of the job was listening to people's stories and assist them with leaving the store happy and healthy."
good,The days went by very fast.  Very busy store and has a drive thru window.  I am very good at multitasking. The hardest part of the job was there were a lot of foreign customers in North Carolina.  It was very hard to understand some of them but I loved the job.
good,"Work is fun , I learned so fun u gotta stay in task . If a costumer asks for her u help them no matter what . The most thing I enjoy is helping costumers ."
good,"The benefits were impeccable and the management was successful in making everyone feel needed and appreciated. I learned more about being a technician there than I did my whole six months of school. The staff was unbearable truthfully,way more focused on their own personal goals than the patients at times. I learned how to correctly read Doctors handwriting and to mix solutions among a host of other skills."
good,"I recommended this palce to every one who is looking for job ,best palce to devolopment  your carrer and do you increase you experiance all over the wold .I think walgreen is a good place to learn in the life it is like a big school and meet any people and enjoy the work ."

The others hung the clothes on the sales floor to be purchased.

I like my co-worker they are my second family. What I really love is the fast pace in pharmacy and I love to make our customers happy. The hard part of the job is not knowing that customer was not satisfied with my customer service."

good,this place is great due to the fun you have with interacting with the customers and allowing to make their shopping experience easier and more convienent.

Co-workers are very fun to work with and the most enjoyable part of the job is you get to have a little conversation with the local customers. Also another  enjoyable part of the job is you get to dressed up on Halloween. So I guess the motto is have fun while selling."
good,Company was great and great environment to work in and lots of places for advancement within the company. The overall environment of the company was great and i feel honored to have got to work there.
good,"Typical days are fast paced for me, I deal with a great deal of customers and still have to provide excellent service to every one of them. I've learned a lot since I started, I had to develop and enhance my customer service and manager skills, and I had a great team to help me develop how I needed too. The hardest part of this job is dealing with the bad customers but I feel rewarded when I am able to help others. If I help at least one person on my shift that makes my day."

Sometimes its hard to checkout customers who have over 50 coupons but the more you do it the easier it becomes, although you may have to call a manager once or twice because one just wont scan. I enjoyed meet new people and learned as much as i could about the company.I became great friends with many of my co-workers we were always willing to help each out with switching schedules if we needed to be off for need emergency.

Learning the best ways your employees work and adapting to that will make your day that much better not only for you but for your employees and the customers. Having a positive outlook every time you step through those doors and greeting everyone with a smile makes my job more enjoyable. Its not easy being in customer service but having the right mindset and coworkers can truly make your days go by quicker. I've learned so much with this company with as small as merchandising, cash handling, invoices to personal growth like patience, better communication and the true meaning of being a team player."

good,"Walgreen's is a great place to work, my coworkers are like my family. if things get busy ive always got help, I love being a part of this team. the managers are full of spunk for the company and strive to make the store the best in the company. I enjoy being in an environment where everyone is striving to meet the same goals."
good,"A typical day a Walgreens come in prepare your self for your shift."
good,I enjoyed each and every day. It felt great making a patient's day by helping them get their medications they needed. The hardest part of the job was going home every day thinking that there might have been someone that you weren't able to help.
good,"Assist customers with check-out, finding products, explaining a variety of products to customers. develop film and photos via scanning and USB drives on new systems introduced to the company. Stalking merchandise and maintaining a clean environment at all times, as well providing the same ethic in reference to customer service."
good,"When I did internship in Walgreen with morning shift. I learn a lot a things, I worked with patient in counter, drive through and pick up the phone and more than that: Entered prescription in the system, filled patient prescriptions ,provided customer service, processed insurance claims, performed inventory and stocking activities. The technician and pharmacists are so friendly and helpful. The hardest part that doing many things and due with patient. The most enjoyable part that entered and filled prescriptions."
good,This was a great place for a first job. It teaches you what it is like to work in the real world. Turnover of employees is often.
good,"A typical day at work involved professional and friendly customer interaction, a clean and inviting environment, and accuracy with all transactions on the computer. "
good,We all worked as a team there to ensure the best customer service possible. The management was great! Easy to work with.  The reason I left the job was because we relocated to a new state. I would love to find a job as great as this one.
good,we were a very busy pharmacy but the team was good and we got the job done.
good,Greeting Customers as they would arrive and leave with an encouraging word or song. I loved my job at Walgreens and I loved the people and the people would love to hear me sing. I wouldn't bother anyone because know matter what I always got the job done with the help of my team. As you can see I am foremost a team player.
good,"A typical day at work for me is answering phones, refilling patient's prescriptions, scanning in new prescriptions, counting or measuring medication to fill prescriptions, helping customers find products over the counter, directing any questions about prescriptions to the pharmacist. Also, daily inventories and weekly inventories, or returning out-dates.  My co-workers are great, we help each other out. The hardest part of the job is not being able to give a patient a prescription because it is not covered under insurance and sometimes it is hard to get in touch with the patients doctor to start the procedure of a prior authorization. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to solve a issue with insurance billing to ensure patients receive their medication."
good,"no favoritism, very organized, very clean, and every one knew how to work as a team"
good,I was not fast enough for Distric Manager. He was fired from Walgreens.
good,"Customer Service, Walgreens is a fast paced job. I run the photo lab. I make sure that day to day operations run as smooth as possible. I have learned a lot from this company. I have always called the photo lab my home and I know almost everything there Is to know about the photo machines. but I also have cross trained and learned a little about the pharmacy, ordering, the paperwork involved in receiving in truck and so much more."
good,"I would start my day off relieving my co worker, then go to my manager and see what my daily duties are. I would go through and finish all my duties. I would then go and find more work to do by looking at the left over duties list and just finishing them all. I would then look at the outdates list and start on a aisle. If I was helping close I would go into the office and help the manager double check all the money. I learned how to do resets on aisles and end caps. I also learned how to work and operate the photo machine and develop prints. My managers were very helpful when it came to all the questions I had and if I needed more help then they would help walk me through it. My co workers were very helpful with covering breaks and lifting items. The hardest part of the job was a unsatisfied customer and not being willing to satisfy their needs when a product was not in stock. The most enjoyable part was seeing the customers smiling and happy with the service they received and quality of the products we sold."
good,I had a great time working at Walgreen. I was going through a really bad domestic relationship with my kids father and couldnt wait to go to work everyday. One thing about me is I never bring my home problems to work. My co workers were very comferting and supportive of me when I had to resign there.
good,"good company with good morals, fast paced environment with a lot of deadlines"
good,"assisted customers, learned how to multi-task really well and be time oriented. Managers were always nice and willing to help teach you. Hardest part is dealing with certain customers...everyone is different and you have to be able to adapt to satisfy their needs, but it was always worth it knowing they were happy with the end product."
good,"I am working at photo lab, When I get in, first I clean my work space, then I check for orders to be done if I have any I make them. I constantly have to be in touch with costumers, helping them to find products. I have to sell products from photo lab. I learned about technology, how to take pictures and modify them. I have learned how to treat customers and how to build relationships. The store where I work is constantly qualified by costumers as the best ones in service clerk. I have learned that costumers are the soul of any company and companies must take care of them. I  have been living and working with people from differents cultures since my early years and it is nothing new for me. I have always had good relationship with my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is that I have to work until late hours, and the most enjoyable part of the job is to help costumers"
good,"When i worked at Walgreens i was so anxious. The first day i started Walgreens i fell in love. I actually loved getting up for work & going. My co-workers were the BEST, my customers were the BEST & the pay was awesome!!! Even though we worked long hours it was still worth it in the end. "
good,"Pharmacy was always busy."
good,"Working at Walgreens was challenging. working everyday being assigned to different areas and learning to do new things and meeting new people.I have learned to stock, organize, and communicate well with customers and co-workers. my managers was very kind and respectful to everyone no one was treated any different and they was always well organized and always on point. my co-workers was not all social with everyone but those that was was very respectable and kind. it was not as hard to restock and organize but it was a challenge. I enjoyed working at walgreens everyday cause I got to help people and communicate well with customers."
good,I worked my way up the ladder from stock/cashier to executive manager.  Room to grow and move up.  The quality of life and the workers vary from store to store.  I had great employees and hard working staff and coworkers.
good,My day was mostly in the beauty department high emphasis on sales and making sure our customers had a great experience and making them want to come back. I cleaned and faced alot at this store and alot of cashiering experience
good,"Typical day goes by very fast.  Many tasks to accomplish, very productive company culture."
good,"worked at the photo lab, Kept busy got alot of interaction with people.. Great job if your a people person.."
good,"A typical work day consisted of placing product orders for the store, making/putting up price changes, backup cashier, did department resets, unloaded warehouse trucks, stocker, worked in receiving,part-time trainer, and was also a back up photo technician. For about 6 months i was also part of the beauty advisor team in a department called the Look Boutique, a high end cosmetics department located in only select walgreens throughout the united states. My coworkers and management were an awesome group to work with. we helped each other out whenever possible and was the most reliable i ever worked with. The hardest part of the job was having to do all those different jobs at once. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers one on one and helping them get what they need and answering all their questions."
good,"Hard work yes! but satisfying also!  great benefits, and an International conglomerate to make you feel secure in your job.  A 100+ year old company that has everything figured out.  Employees are long term, and are paid well doing what we do."
good,"When I worked at Walgreens, I learned a lot about healthcare. I was able to visit the different departments to learn the importance of each and what they are responsible for. I worked mostly individually, but I was always willing to help my co-workers. My typical day started with working on the prescriptions that were needed by the billing team to submit for reimbursement per insurance deadlines. I also made calls to doctor offices to follow up on prescriptions that I was waiting for. I called patients  or insurance companies as needed for information needed. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I always was busy, and when I would run out of work, my co-workers and/or supervisor were always able to find something for me to help with."
good,"A typical day can sometimes start off calm or you can walk in to a all day rush hour. Honestly, I enjoy either way. Calm days allow you to get a lot done such as calling or faxing doctors for refills and scripts we are unable to process. Also to get in contact with patient who are late on maintenance medications. On the other hand, fast days allow the hours to fly by. You still have the same task as stated above. But, you have to use your professional skills to help patients there in the pharmacy and fix problem scripts that need to be handled before the closing of the business day."
good,"I personally thought Walgreens was a very friendly place to work, and to be able to continue on your career at Walgreens, Kindness and friendliness is a big role. Walgreens also help me built communication skills, team work, leadership, and decision making base on our own ethics. I work as the Head photo specialist at Walgreens. I was in charge of all photo technician and maintaining the photo lab to be in good shape and well in stock of supplies needed. Other than just being in charge of the photo department, the photo team is in charge of swapping other departments for breaks, lunch break, and for any necessary needs around the store. One of our daily duties are to complete manager's list (assigned work around the store by store manager). The job was a mult--task job of consuming the worker to do what he/she feels is best and must be done. What I enjoy most about my job was working together as a team, even though I'm the leader of my department, I listen to my team and help them as much as I can. This is an important role for Walgreens to work with one another and help finish what needs to be done."
good,"A day at walgreens distribution center would always start first with team safety stretching, to ensure that injuries were less likely to associates. There I learned and was trained in inventory control, data entry, and operating Raymond forklifts. During my time there I worked under a strong management team. Working together with my co-workers to complete store orders and shipping dead lines. The hardest part of the job was researching the system mainframe to find where product and quantity had been last seen or lost. Once located physically the data entry process was completed with ease. The most enjoyable part of the day is being able to total up the amount of product and skus found and entered back in the mainframe system, turning my data into my managers on shift."
good,"The job was great with great pay.  However, my goal was to be a school teacher so that i why i left Walgreen and go a job within the school system."
good,"Great job for college students, very flexible with schedule."
good,"a typical day at work would start with sorting mail, distributing it, and orders any supplies that were needed.  I also spent a lot of time replying to emails that were sent to our department (non-profit) asking for donations."
good,"Your greeted by everyone, it makes you feel loved and wanted."
good,Overall this a productive environment to work in keeping me busy never bored.
good,Flexible people. They worked with my school schedule and taught me customer service unlike any other company. I have built lasting relationships through this company.
good,Pharmacy workflow and management is effective. When customer's have issues regarding their billing or prescription the staff is able to please the customers within pharmacy policies and pharmacy laws.
good,My typical day at Walgreens was different everyday. Sometimes I would unload shipment and put the merchandise on the shelves in the correct place. Or I would be conducting a reset/revision on a particular part of the department. I would always assist customers even if I was busy with tasks. I learned a lot about managing employees. I was the head of the cosmetic department. The management staff was very productive and informational. I loved working with all my co-workers. I can't think of the hardest part of my job. The most enjoyable part would most certainley be the customers.
good,"A typical day at work is helping customers--at checkout, and assisting them in the aisles. I learned how to do things that a drugstore would do, such as taking in vendors, setting store displays, doing resets in the aisle, and stocking merchandise--to name a few. Management is helpful in saying what needs to be done and how to do it. They are nice to work with. I get along well with my co-workers, too. The hardest part of my job is really when I might need to bring down boxes from high up in the stockroom. I don't do well with heights if I can't feel secure. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers, ringing them up, and just keeping the store organized and stocked."
good,"When I worked at Walgreens, I had a part time job. I worked about four days a week for eight or nine hours, and I usually worked as a front desk clerk. I learned many customer service skills and fully enjoyed the lessons that I was taught. Everyone that I worked with had been working there for at least a year, and they were all very welcoming and helpful as I became accustomed to the job. The manager was also very helpful as she trained me. Any time I had a question or was having a difficulty during my shift, the manager would thoroughly explain how I should politely and professionally respond to a customer and/or the situation. If there were not any customers at the time while I was working, I worked proficiently while completing tasks individually or with other team members; there was always a positive team work environment."
good,"busy, productive, all people work together got to use my managing skills"
good,"Walgreens has been a wonderful company to work for over the years. They are known for their strong ethics, values and clinical expertise. Managers hold a wealth of industry knowledge and are always willing to educate staff. Most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with co-workers, open door policy with the CEO and clients who view you as a partner and industry expert."
good,"Walgreens is the number one retail drugstore/pharmacy chain in the USA. The employers are friendly and knows how to provide great customer service satisfaction, thus leading to repeat customer business."
good,"I would say that a typical day at Walgreen's is opening at 8:00 a.m. and having customers waiting in the front door to get their prescriptions. Some of them just enjoy walking into the store very early to see what's new in the promotional aisles. I just enjoy seeing how customers shop two or three times a day; and what makes me enjoy it is seeing them happy when they find what they are looking for. My staff and co-workers have become my family, we always look up for one and other and we help each other to achieve our daily goals. The hardest part of my job would be saying ""sorry, but unfortunately we don't have that medication or item available at this moment"". It's just very disappointing to see a customer upset. I have learn that sometimes we have to lose in order to engage better results with our customers."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of constant changing of displays, new projects to take on, and our regular everyday activities. I learned how to take the leadership role and always take on every task given to me without complaints. The management was amazing and always kept up with each task and goal that needed to be met daily. My coworkers were beyond friendly and felt like my family. The hardest part of the job for me personally was truck days. I loved truck days, but unloading it off that huge truck was a lot for me! The most enjoyable part of my job was never knowing what crazy thing I was going to have to do the next day! All in all, I loved my job and the people there are great employees."
good,"When I decided to get out of the logistics, and office customer service, human resources, and warehouse operations after over 30 years, I thought I would like to try retail as I enjoy working with the public, and also enjoy working in a team environment hands on with young people. Walgreen was opening many new stores so knowing that I would have to start at entry level I applied and was fortunate to get hired as a SIMS person as I had strong computer skills,. I loved it and later moved on to store manager after helping set up two stores that were new. It was fun, exciting, and very challenging for me which I love. I did have problems with the photo department, as it was a little difficult for me to comprehend until we went into computer downloaded film. I loved the young people and enjoyed having them help me and also enjoyed teaching them a lot of the things that I had learned along the way. Walgreens stood up for the managers, and I have found that after going on to other retails that I much prefer a smaller more fun work-place."
good,"Being a manager at Walgreen was a pleasant experience. Helping customers and assisting Pharmacy was the main part of my job. I managed the Photo and Cosmetic department ensuring sales were high and staff retention was low. Overseeing high balance of cash and maintaining store operations was also part of my job. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting people every day and keeping in contact with loyal customers. Sometimes helping them on personal things or none personal things was an enjoyment. The hardest part of the job is working through the major holidays, when working hours can go from 8 to 10 hours. Often times managers are forced to work 10 days straight before having a day off. Working 8 to 10 hour days and 10 days a week can be a wear and tear on the body. Having to relocate was hard as well I was unable to relocate with Walgreen from California to Atlanta, Ga."
good,"Easy, fun place to work. I worked in the pharmacy and it was a solid job. Good benefits, but wages are a little low. People are angry because they need their meds and that is understandable unlike most retail places. Overall good place to work."
good,"I had a great team. My coworkers and managers were all fantastic.I became very comfortable with my regular customers and they always smiled when they saw me. I was responsible for floor resetting, visuals, the register, and customer service. I learned to multitask very well from these responsibilities that I was asked to manage."
good,Had a great time with the company and have thought many times of going back but really trying to stay out of retail at this time in my life.
good,"This position was a very quick paced environment. Day to day tasks were checking inventory for compliance and filling prescriptions. Because this was one of the busiest pharmacies in the district, I learned how to work efficiently in a fast pace work environment. The most difficult part of this job was having a consistent work flow throughout the day; there really was no down time so there was constant pressure to keep up with the work. The most enjoyable part of this position were my co-workers. Everyone was willing to work together."
good,Everyday i would come in to a very nice group of of employees. I was treated with respect even when I first started. we all followed the rules because we our management was very nice and would listen to what we had too say. I enjoyed how i learned to deal with a lot of different personality from co-workers and customers. Learned how to adapt to certain situations and make the best of it. Also working very hard and accomplishing a task which helps the business and makes yourself proud. Also learning how to deal with money and returns and placing certain items to certain spots.
good,"I loved just about everyone I worked with, this place was well organized. Mangment was always fair."
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for. Definately many opportunities for advancement especially if you are in a market that is still opening stores. They have an excellent management development program.
good,"Up-to date startegies, exellent work culture, hard working employees and management."
good,"Very Friendly area to work in , Good management team . I believe walgreens is good place to star if your willing to take your customer experience level to another level."
good,Co workers are amazing.Pay was good. Was always busy with a task
good,"Hostile work environment, not enough employees. Resulting in bad customer service. All equipment is out date and breaks often, rude and disrespectful managers"
good,Great management with great support from all employees. Unfortunately the store seems to have very little support from corporate side which can make the employees feel unappreciated.
good,I did receive my raises every year showing my production was outstanding.  I work very hard and the benefits come naturally.  I always give it my all at work and in my personal life.
good,"I really loved working here since it was very patient oriented and gave me time to interact and really help the patients. As time went by it became challenging to continue doing that as their was alot of new things implemented that had to be done within the work hour shift which took a toll on my health,"
good,I enjoyed working for Walgreens it's a nice company to work for your benefits your hours the people you work with and for one love to do displays inventory was good to do.
good,I work from home for Walgreens for the save a trip refills. And i love it they supplied everything for us and the training is very good. and my hours are ok as well. Everything i do is at home but still get the perks and everything if as i working in the store
good,As an overnight cashier I work7 days on then got 7 days off I average about 32 to 36 hours a week and was still able to have a good at home life. Overall good experience.
good,"At Walgreens my job description was a Customer Service Associate. They let me put my passion to help others on speed by introducing me to other stations of the store such as (Fedex, Passport photo, Inventory and Western Union). I had the opportunity to help others in multiple ways and I enjoyed learning to maintain being a cashier and having the experience in different job descriptions."
good,I was very happy with my job at this company and I enjoyed what i did while at this job. I enjoyed billing insurances the most. So when I found a job closer to my home is why i left this company but I would recommend this company to others for their future employment opportunities.
good,"Everyone worked together as a team, your great work was always recognized from the store manager, and pharmacy manager. Great pay, managers were very understanding of things."
good,"If you are planning to have a long term job,  Walgreens is the place to go. As long as you follow company policies, you are guaranteed to have the job for as long as you work there. You could even get promotions"
good,"Helping customers find items, encouraging up coming sales items. Completing the sales transactions. Encouraging them to come again. The management was always helpful. The hardest part of the job was, relocating items that had been taken out of place. The most enjoyable part was, interacting with customers and getting to know them."
good,I worked with the company for 2 years as a beauty sales lead. I loved how much the company cared about me. Constantly having holiday parties. Also celebrating big life events!
good,"We were busy every day. We filled an average of 400 prescriptions a day. We had laughs and heartaches.  The hardest part of a day was when a customer was not happy with their insurance or their doctors office, because they would take it out on us."
good,I've learned how to communicate to customers as well as putting their needs first. I enjoyed the diversity and the friendship I had with my coworkers as well as management.
good,"Assisting the pharmacist verify medications, accurate count of medications, verify the insurance, verify the medications, ensuring patients receive correct medications, assisting the pharmacist with inventory,"
good,"Walgreen's is a well established company and has great values. I enjoyed working their and learned a lot. The only problem was that I had very little training to prepare. Although I was on assignment from TUSD which has its limits, however  I did have to quickly learn certain tasks and things on my own."
good,Even though like any other job days can be difficult but I did enjoy my management roll Walgreens does take care of their employees  and great benefits with room to advance in the company
good,"They really focus on their employees and take your word into consideration when it comes to building sales, and maintaining a fun professional  environment."
good,"I worked at walgreen for my teens/ early 20's it was a good place to work. Although every store is different i think i liked where i worked so much because i really liked the my co-workers. "
good,I like doing a stocking position because it kept me moving and on my feet. It had a great atmosphere and the people and co workers were genuinely caring and nice.
good,"It is a fun work area. Some days are chaotic with rushes but, the busy days are the best. It is a great store and I do get discounts. Good environment to work at."
good,While working with the company Walgreens I have gained multiple advances in my costumer service skills. i honestly believe aanyone who works for this company would absolutely find it beneficial.
good,"While there are various positions to be had within this job, each deals extensively with customer service skills. Most days are filled with constant duties and tasks to be performed that improve the quality of the shopping experience for customers. Most coworker relations are friendly and company changes and improvements are effectively communicated. There is plenty of room to grow and move forward within the company. The hardest part of the job is knowing the various ways to effectively approach difficult customers and the ability to work in a high stress environment. However, at the same time, this can be the most rewarding when you turn an upset customer into a happy one."
good,"Management and co-workers make all the difference. My current work environment at Walgreens is one of the best I've ever worked at. They made me feel very welcome and at home from very early on after starting work there one year ago. I really hate the idea of working anywhere else, however I will be moving out of state shortly.  I pray I find a similar situation in the future."
good,"Store and district level management is awesome. Corporate management gets worse the higher up you go, with upwards of regional management having no clue about the reality of the people on store level and consequences of their decisions."
good,"I had a very positive experience while working for Walgreens. I started working for Walgreens the summer of 2012 as a cashier and within a year and a half, I was a part of a store management training program making twice as much as when I started. My hard work didn't go unnoticed by any one of the amazing managers I was given the opportunity to work with. Walgreens is always evolving which makes it hard to become complacent. The health insurance options were very inexpensive and covered a wide array of prescriptions and specialists, which is a great perk of working for a retail pharmacy."
good,"Amazing workplace. Hardest part were the long hours and lots of pressure to meet company standards, reach certain sales goals etc. Enjoyed the work environment and what it entailed."
good,It’s an ok place to work.  Very fast pace. They worked with my family life and days I needed off. They expect you to work a ton of holidays. Part time highschool kids seem to never get in trouble.
good,"Typical day at work includes dispensing prescriptions, customer care, MTM, immunizations, consultations."
good,"Sales , refund on the cash register, making signs , price tags. helping   customers find what there're looking for. Stocking, merchandising and building end stands at the cosmetic department. The most enjoyable part is talking to customers and know what they like and make them happy by finding all the merchandise that they are looking for. They leave the store happy and love to always come back to shop."
good,"Management was helpful, hardworking, easy to talk to. I would usually put out and organize inventory. It is an extremely easy job, great for students, and they give 15% percent discount on all store items (excludes tobacco, dairy, alcohol) and 25% on all Walgreens brand items. Hours are flexible, staff was extremely friendly. Costumers were nice."
good,I loved working at walgreens I worked in the photo departments. it was a relax work place and everything just flowed smoothly everyday. management was awesome.
good,"The job was stressful at times, when it came to suggestive selling."
good,"flexible hours, family oriented, help you achieve goals. I enjoyed working for walgreens but was over retail in general. Great place to work if you can get on"
good,"Very enjoyable working experience, I learned a lot about customer service and meeting customer needs while working at Walgreen's. The management was always very helpful"
good,Good work place a lot of productive co workers learned great customer service always walking around great learning experience had good staff and great supervisors
good,It's a nice job but for the pay it's not worth it the expectations put on cashiers is ridiculous! Job wise maintaining the front of the store is easy but the idea of not just standing there makes no sense having to constantly move around even when customers are coming in the store meanwhile your in a isle trying to get supplies for the front of the store.
good,"Great job  with great schedule.  Some management need to loosen up a bit and be happy with the job they got.  Corporate can be challenging, but some make it seem like they are in control of running the country."
good,"Excellent choice to learn basic skills for future positions (teamwork, team-building, time management, timeliness, etc)"
good,great environment and can easy transfer around which is amazing when in college. great staff and good starting wage.starting wage is $9 an hour and has a lot of benefits
good,"You can start from the bottom and work your way up.  Great place to work and grow, and the benefits are really great as well.  I would highly recommend this company to anyone looking."
good,"A typical day at work for me is rewarding, as well as educational. My compassion for my patients, and my passion for my job, has never felt like work."
good,"Great company to work with, a lot of benefits and opportunity to grow within the company. The manager rena and john stanish are rude and never follow store policies. Always trying to cut hours"
good,"Good everyday atmosphere , managers hold you to your responsibilites. Everyday at work i take customer prescriptions, type up the prescriptions and make sure the customer insurance covers the scripts, fill the prescriptions , then hand everything to the pharmacist to check. I also check in the order and make sure the drugs we need are here for customers scripts that were out of stocks or partial fills. We then sell the prescriptions to customers that come and pick them up.  At the end of the day we clean the pharmacy , delete any old scripts and also order any drugs needed for the next day.I learned many of things working in the pharmacy such as drug names brand to generic, how to order drugs, type up doctors prescriptions , how to work the out of stock and partials, how to fill scripts and many of other things. The most enjoyable part of the job is to serve the community and knowing i am helping people with their health and everyday lifestyle."
good,All co-workers and management were always friendly but also efficient. workload was consistent and easy to deal with. I learned about the photo department along with stocking and constant customer service. The hardest part of the job was probably the fact that i didn't have a specific job there was a constant change in responsibility even so it helped build my flexibility while on the job.
good,Walgreen's kept me busy. It was a great learning experience and always a challenge. Customers always come in and leave satisfied.
good,"The pharmacy can get extremely hectic with the high volume of patients we have daily, but it is still a great place to work. My co-workers are professional and we get along well. Walgreens is a good company in what they offer for employees, and for customers as well. Walgreens is highly focused on customer service, which is where I learned most of my customer service skills. The hardest part can be the amount of customers when we have a rush, but the best part is when each customer is satisfied with what we do."
good,"Everyone is always happy and willing to work with each other. Management was willing to work with scheduling problems. They seemed to actually care about problems that you were having a tough issue with, whether it be money issue or family issues. The employees worked so hard to make the customers happy. The work was reasonable and fun to do with a team."
good,this store was a low volume store but it was exciting helping people along with the staff they were pretty down to earth showing me the ropes
good,"Walgreens is a pretty good company to work for. They were very understanding in regards to my family needs, and offer great benefits. I feel like they care about their employees and we were like a family. I was able to move around and cross-train, learning photo, front end, stocking, cosmetics, and pharmacy. The transfer process is pretty simple as well, so I was able to transfer between states."
good,I loved working for this company. The benefits are great. There is plenty of room to grow. I liked working the photo lab most of all. You get to meet lots of people.
good,"I managed on a daily basis:"
good,"Walgreens was where I started my pharmacy tech career. It is a great company to work, it just does not pay as well as other companies."
good,"Coming to work is like coming to my second home. I look at the sales compared to last year. I then come up with a action plan on how to improve the sales and motivate my employees. I learned to never give up and to always be persistent. My whole staff is very good at what they do and I appreciate their hard efforts during urgent moments. The hardest part of my job is making everyone happy. Everyone can't have the same day off, everyone need hours, everyone wants a promotion, and etc. I try my best to treat everyone fair and make them happy. The best part of my job is taking on challenges to meet goals and develop the best employees in the district. Overall, I love what I do in retail management and I hope to continue to excel."
good,"Its a great place to work. There are flexible hours, and competitive pay. There are many opportunities for advancement."
good,"working with walgreens not only was my job,but it became a passion of mine got to help out a lot of customers and aslo my regulars who would stop by just to say hi I made a lot of friends.i just had to leave due to some medical issues.i am ready to get back to doing what I love."
good,"great hours and benefits, learned a lot about HMO's, PPO's, Medical, medicare and infusion billing, friendly environment, great people and management is great."
good,I worked there for three months.  I worked at two different locations while I worked at Walgreens.  I liked one location better than the other.  You get to meet all kinds of people.  Some were pretty strange.
good,Typical day at Walgreens consisted of a group meeting to start the day and tasks were assigned on clip boards and handed out to each department. Management was friendly and helpful. Coworkers worked together as a team. Hardest part was truck day; catching the boxes. I loved my working environment.
good,"A typical day at work for a Walgreen's Beauty Adviser would include a lot of communication and selling. Typically I greet every customer that enters Walgreen's. I service them by helping them find what they need and suggesting promotions, sales, or new products that best meet their needs. Management at Walgreen's Co. is encouraging and helpful, they have helped me grow as an employee and person. They help with constructive criticism and also notice hard work. My co workers are friendly and I enjoy working with them as team members. "
good,"Because it's a very known market in PR client traffic is high, therefore  there is no shortage of time when it comes to stay alert on the job."
good,Absolutely love my co-workers and my boss! Great people to be around.
good,Friendly supervisors and coworkers just in general a great place to work
good,"Loved working for Walgreens. Stayed so many years because I built a family like bond with all my co-workers and managers. Since I was a great employee I was really appreciated, was given advancement opportunities and had a flexible schedule. Most of my skills and work experienced I owe to Walgreens. The salary could be better but to me the work environment made up for that."
good,Everyday at Walgreen's is a busy yet challenging day.Customer Service is a must.We always want the customers to feel healthy and well and we do our best to ensure the patient medication and insurance is correct.It makes me feel good that our customers are happy and satisfied.
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for.  The company has great opportunities, such as opportunity for advancement and benefits."
good,"Everyday work was not very complex as i was a just a extra pair of hands."
good,"greeting customers as they walked in everyday "
good,"one day i go to work put merchandise out to shelf"
good,"I manage 25 employees. I promote and communicate Extraordinary Customer Care daily with staff. Merchandise daily to help increase sales. Delegate job responsibilities out daily and follow up. Engage and communicate with staff with 5 minute meetings daily. Process payroll, deal with opening and closing responsibilities. Handle cash, responsible for picking up cash out of registers and dropping cash, balancing drawers, safe. Listening to customers needs and going after them needs. Most enjoyable part of my job is my customers and providing great customer service and managing my staff! What I have learned from managing is being a active listener with my staff,customers, boss. Being and showing great team work. Providing a positive environment for all staff and customers! How to delegate job responsibilities out with a 100% follow through."
good,Everyday had surprise within the photo department. I learned how to manage a group of employees and generate revenue within a business.Great store manager who took me under his wing to teacher me the ins and outs of managing a store.
good,"This is not a job for someone who does not do well with being on their feet all day and it took me some getting used to. I was fine after I adjusted to it and it was fun working here most days (I say most because everyone has those days sometimes). The managers that were there at the time were great. I trained at the Snellville store and when they got the Loganville store built, I helped put it together inside. There was a lot to learn, but not hard to catch onto."
good,"good but sometimes slow work days, great co workers good management usually all task are simple and easy "
good,"customer service is main priority"
good,"I think that management could have been more approachiable and professional as far as their employees. Management was very opressive, when you have happy employees you have a more viable work environment"
good,Provide excellent customer service
good,Responsibilities/learned:
good,It has been my part time job for the past five years. I have an awesome manager who has worked with me when I was working a full time job.
good,A typical day for me wouldbe hectic but worth it all. What I learned is how many stages I have grown from and developed a great deal of understanding people.Managent is mylife. I want to one day havemy own business in the near future. My co-workers are the identity of my thoughts. I learn how to understand different stageof ones personality and being able to assest what is best. The hardest part of my job will be not being there. The most enjoyable part is producing a team that works well togther and make all the customers smile.
good,A typical day at walgreens was going in stocking cigs and inventory register Doing outdates on any items upfront. helping customers all day. greeting customers. Once a week while still doing cashier i would stock from truck unload the truck before being put on register.. I Could also do the photo area and pharmacy. And would also do resets and revisions
good,"Stocking Shelves , Operating Cash Register , Solving Customer Problems"
good,Walgreens has a steady pace work enviroment to work. The people are friendly and helpful
good,Experienced in customer service and food . Good communication skills. Good technology skills. Good people person. Trustworthy. Reliable. Dependable. Responsible.
good,This company has it's ups and downs but it is the employees you work with that make coming in every day worth it. Costumers are sometimes bothersome but our policies and pricing can be a bit confusing to them so you have to be knowledgeable (basics really)  about it. I learn something new everyday so it's not like you are going to learn everything in one day. The waves may be rocky at first but soon you will be smooth sailing.
good,Working for Walgreens you have to be compassionate about others. You also have to be able to multitask and also be able to process everything correctly.
good,It is a fun place to work and I enjoyed it but the manager was not fair to all employees and did a lot of favoring to the ones she liked.  I did get along with all of the customers and fellow workers.
good,"i like work there and have a good relation with the people work with me , a great customer service and every body know wht is his job and what he have to do. a good management."
good,Great supervisor great co-worker . My hours were great also it was a good place for a first job and I would recommend others to try. The work environment very calm and collected
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work. Whether you are in high school, college or an adult! The benefits are GREAT! There are stock options, 401k, medical, dental, vision....THE WHOLE SHIBANG! The management is great. The managing staff is here 100% to support and help you with whatever it is that you need help with. They will coach and explain and show and everything in between to help you better yourself to advance and move up in the company. The advancement that Walgreens has to offer is extraordinary! This company shows that any hard work seriously pays off! I very much enjoyed working here and would recommend this company to anyone!"
good,I been working at Walgreen's before as a student worker for like a couple of months and it's calm and peaceful work space other employees were fun to work with
good,"The workers are great and work as a team, the company is also good to work for. The customers can be rude but the Pharmacist takes care of them. I loved working there."
good,its not a bad place at all. very flexible and considerate. i would go back but school started and i dont have the time.all you really do is smile at people.
good,"during my externship, I learned everything I could and put everything that was taught to me in school into practice, unfortunately, there was no open positions at the time, i had to move on."
good,"Walgreens was a great big family that i did not want to let go. i watched customers, and patients grow before my eyes . My peers and staff were all very encouraging and clever in all of their tasks and duties."
good,start out small but it becomes  a family thing. love the people I used to work with. just be sure to follow the rules when it comes to asset protection because they do not play around
good,"A typical day at work included: greeting customers at the door, providing help with questions, helping locate items on isles and ringing the customers' items up. I learned how to keep my moods at home and be as positive and patient as possible in the workplace, I also learned about stocking proactively, scanning and ordering items for the store. Management was very helpful and attentive whenever I was having a bad day they made their greatest effort to make sure I felt better to work. The hardest part of the job was dealing with disrespectful shoplifters who would threaten to physically hurt all employees if we didn't let them get away. I would feel so scared for my life sometimes that I felt so helpless. The most enjoyable part was working as a team with my coworkers to get things done and also making customers really happy with their service that they would mention my name in the store's survey and come back just to see me."
good,Great way to work your way to college it has many opportunity to work in the busy streets of City Place. Customer service is a must and you assist many people.
good,never stressed out working here. everyone helps everyone out. management is wonderful. young team of employees but everyone works hard.
good,"I love my job. I love my current management. They work really hard to make sure people have enough hours. The neighborhood I work in is great. The only complaint I have is they pay, I wish it were higher, otherwise I wouldn't seek further employment."
good,"The typical day is very busy and filled with many task in which they give time to finish most. I have learn many task needed to work in retail, including managing inventory, handling lost prevention problems and a few pharmacy task. Management within the store is wonderful. The hardest part of my job, is managing time between task and customers. My co- worker are very nice and helpful. The most enjoyable part of my job is my customers."
good,I enjoy the people and the place I work. Helping out the customers really makes my day go by. If I have any questions about something a lead or manager is there to assist with helping.
good,"I LOVED this job! Loved the company. I unfortunately was in a horrible car accident and had to leave my position. I was only able to be there just under a year - but I loved every moment of my job. I was praised often, I felt I had the ability to create my own job and do what I wanted with it - which was validating. I never felt micro managed, I always felt HRs doors were open, the COO was approachable and so kind. The managers were all wonderful, enthusiastic, encouraging people to work for. We had a blast as a team. Its too bad the MN Distribution center had to close. There is a great future with Walgreens. I heard that a lot of people that were part of the employee buy in had Millions in their stocks. They have very decent pay, great benefits, and good retirement options. There is also lots of room for growth and career development. "
good,When i did my externship I learned to type and fill prescriptions. I also learned to take care of patients through the pharmacy's drive-thru. I learned how to stock medication alphabetical order. The pharmacy tech's and pharmacist were very nice and helpful when I needed their help.
good,"Very friendly staff, I completed an externship in the pharmacy working under the pharmacist and pharmacy tech."
good,I assisted the pharmacist with his daily job I filed prescription customer service help other find thing in the store
good,"Promotional display merchandising"
good,good 8 hour shift team work management worked with employee everyone got along night shift. self worth
good,"a great experience, friendly and fun coworkers made my time there enjoyable"
good,"Working at walgreens as an externship I felt like a real co worker working there. my co workers and my boss was allowing me to do almost all the task that a real pharmacist does. I learned how to refill the cassettes with the correct pills. I learned how to do the drive thru, look up peoples medication, if there ready or not . I learned a little bit of how to fill a prescription and the doses and days. The hardest part of the job and im still working on it is learning all of my trade and generics and what is the drug used for. The most enjoyable part about working at walgreens or pharmacy technician period is when I was able to refill all the cassettes with the correct drug because it kept me busy and I love to do work that keeps me busy and not just standing there letting my talents go to waste."
good,Again never know what you are going to get out of a day. for the most part days were crazy busy. i learned alot being a pharmacy tech its an awesome job! my management was good. always there when you need them. the co workers were also good it changed often though. the hardest part was just having a moment to catch up. the most enjoyable was making the customers happy.
good,"Ive worked for walgreens for 6 years with many promotions and raises, if you work hard you will be compensated."
good,I enjoyed it very much. I made some life long friends. Had a lot of fun wherever I went and whomever I worked with. I enjoyed everyone I got the chance to be stationed with.

good,"believes strongly in customer service, it is a company that you can advance in."
good,"I am a good worker, I have a good moon with everybody include co-workers and customers. I will show what I learned so far and easy to learn new stuff, to work in a good area with nice people. It's hard for me on the first weeks at work specially when I'm alone with the customers. And the most enjoyable time for me it's when I know my job perfectly I would give people the best of me and help them better satisfaction. I make my co-workers,my manager include the customers happy."
good,"Answering over 200 calls, locating medication receiving correspondence faxing and e-mailing patients, customer service and data entry. A manager on site call center environment private desk co -workers available for assistance. The hardest part was not being able to direct contact with the customers and the most enjoyable part of the job was everything"
good,"Great;"
good,I love the employees but the pay isn't fair. For people that have worked for years at the same company to break their backs and train new people that are hired on with no experience making the same pay. I'm discusted with the way the company treats their long term employees. I wouldn't recommend this job to my enemies.
good,i have such a great customer service back ground im looking to move up n my career to no only work but have a a career. i work as a cashier also on the floor to up keep the store.
good,I was a cashier at the register at Walgreen's Drug Store. I would assist customers by ringing up there merchandise that they wanted to buy. At the end of the night when the store closed I would need to balance out the cash drawer and face the aisles to be neat for the next working day. 
good,it was great working for walgreen.. looking to grow with in the company reason why left job gave to 2 weeks notice
good,A fun and friendly place to work with great co-workers. very informed staff.
good,"You are micro managed from the moment you clock in, breaks seem to be cut short, mandatory overtime is assigned with the hour you are relieved of job duties and if you do not stay you are at risk of losing your job."
good,"daily quota , small consultations for make up or skin care ,building and taking down end stands"
good,I loved my job at Walgreen the people were great for the most part. The hardest thing was unloading the truck and putting up the stock.
good,"Learned a lot during my internship at Walgreens. I wasn't hired with them but, I completed my hours with them. Great pharmacist and technician, they help me to succeed."
good,"Lots of moving around, helping out customers, managing your department. Lifting and unloading totes/boxes.Dealing with theft daily, call ins, problem solving, employee interaction."
good,"I worked here because I was told they would help to train you in the pharmacy. Once I got my pharmacy technician license, I was given the run around and was never placed there. Also, despite telling them I have a small child, my hours were no more than 6-15 hours a week. I couldn't live off that and pay bills. I got frustrated and I wanted less to do with the location. Tried to transfer but that didn't go well and I was taken off the schedule the same day. I prefer going further out than work for this location again."
good,"I typical day at work is very fast paced, I have learned a lot of the people that shops at my job.I have learned how to develop pictures and make poster, calendars and how to print cards of all kinds.Management is manageable .Work place culture are the customers that come in everyday they are what makes my job worth while. The hardest part of my job is not having enough employees and to much workload for one person. The most important part of my job is my usual customers."
good,"Greet customers, ask if they needed any help while visiting the store. Make sure store was clean and presentable to the public."
good,"i would never bite the hand that fed me, i truly enjoyed my time working for Walgreen's. Unfortunately, there was a poor choice of management. Other than that, working for this company was great!"
good,"I love Walgreen's however there management sucks. The paint you a picture of sliver and gold rainbows but when you start working, you come to understand that the picture painted was a bunch of BS."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens was to run day to day functions that required you to get change for employees, reset merchandise, and merchandise the store. the co-workers were great to work with but became a little challenging when it came to suggestive selling. The hardest part of the job was getting the management team on the same page. The enjoyable part of the job was challenging yourself with merchandising to see if you could get a sale with your display."
good,"Loved my actual store. Can't say enough great things about it or its employee.  I'm a licensed cosmetologist and was paid less than a non licensed cosmetologist based on my store locatiom. The Regional beauty consulant Manger was the worst. Uneducated, fake and has no idea what's she's doing. She has no direction and doesn't manage. Rarely on time or have a plan. She is the reason I left. That and I realiased I was being less than a beauty consulant up the street who wasn't licensed or had prior experience. I really loved the job but out corporate management for my area wasn't worth it nor was being paid less but have more experience."
good,"Ok pay, have to work all holidays. No promotions. They change job titles a lot includes pay change. Good discount for employees. Management never there on the busy days."
good,Typical day is a 10 to 12 hours non stop on your feet and it's of wear and tare on your body  and physical labor bending twisting lifting etc. No support from management .
good,"Super stressful, was told to do many things at once when so many coworkers or management was telling me what to do. Lack of training and empathy on new associates."
good,"I loved what I did and I was very good at doing my job as long as the so called management team left me alone."
good,"This job is a great job to work in if your going to school or have a second job...this Walgreens I work in use to be a rite aid before...and since Walgreens bought out all the rite aids it lost money so they are cutting hours. I appreciate the flexibility they offer but that was before...We are low on staff and NEED more people, not less people and now less hours for the people that actually wanna work."
good,The little time that i worked at Walgreens it seemed to be a fun upbeat job. I can't give any pro or cons about the position since it was over 8 years since i worked there.
good,"We would check in, get a heads up on what needed to be done. I learned how to manage my staff, ordering, Reconcile all tills. Management at the top was very lax. A very nice place to work. Top management was very difficult at times. The customers and my staff."
good,"Got Stressful after Phar Manager became stressed out an was mean to everyone. Did same as other job , answering phones, filling scripts, filling paper an pens getting ready for the day, waiting on drive up window, customer service, answering insuranace questions, drug related questions, filling stock vials, and filling inventory."
good,Working for at Walgreens given be good chances and stressful ones more than anyother place I work but it's just for being in the front end of the store not the pharmacy
good,I was an extern pharmacy tech and my only job there was to fill prescriptions that came in to the pharmacy. i learned about the way a pharmacy setting worked and i greatly enjoyed the work i did and the fact i felt i was helping people
good,Loved working for the company. Work included stocking shelves and unloading truck. Handling cash register and customers. Taking phone calls. Cleaning.
good,it was a good place to work. management was okay not the best && it was no chance to move up in the company at all
good,I enjoyed my job and it's duties but there was poor management. It showed whenever a problem needed to be handled. I was harassed when new management came in towards the end of my experience there. Several customers complained about the issue also.
good,"Walgreens is an upbeat place if you are an outgoing and friendly person. There are many kind customers and fun workers. You can have a good balance between work and school. I like this company because they work with my school schedule."
good,Good place to work for teenagers. Little outs and easy work. Management is decent but could have been better. In paid lunch breaks and horrible job system.
good,"Supervisor of the Corporate Consumer Relations team. I supervised 30 people which included hiring/firing, weekly feedback, annual reviews, and taking escalations from patients and customers from ALL of the Walgreen's stores. Through this I learned about several laws within different states, how to deescalate calls to ensure customers were happy, provide follow-up, and provide closure for customers. Also, I provided detailed feedback to my team through the process of strategies of success."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens was working in the beauty department helping customers find anything they needed, stocking, making sure everything is neatly organized.  The job overall was a great first job with decent benefits.  The hardest part of the job was the management, it was not very good management from only one specific person and I was not very happy coming into work every day."
good,"It is the fellow co-workers and customers that make walgreen's a goo place to work! They give partime, as close to full time hours as possible to help with their pay check"
good,"sometimes its slow sometimes its fast paced ,most of all fast pace especially if short of co worker,have to small talk with customers and get my task done.Co-workers are friendly to me and  am to them.We help each other out if need.The most enjoyable part of the job is to learn different people personalities ,new people and just communicating with them."
good,Not a people place to work. Supervision hostile. Micromanagment unnecessary. Poor production. Supervisor disapproved of my relationship with my patients.
good,I went through a typical shift as a Pharm Tech. I filled over 500 Rx per shift. I was not a bonafide employee so a lot of this does not apply to me.
good,"A typical day would include customer service, Stocking and cleaning."
good,"help costumers with all there photo needs. assist costumers with findings products and checking out. Simple cleaning tasks suck as mopping sweeping, taking out trash, and cleaning restrooms."
good,I enjoyed working seeing some of our loyal customers.
good,I only worked there for my externship with school so i would love to actually be apart of there team
good,"It was very inspiring. I was able to fill prescriptions, and stock supplies. I performed some inventory functions. Another one of my job functions was to search for information using the computer. So overall I was pleased with my externship. The only thing I did not like is that I was not allowed to take phone calls. Although I certainly understand the reason for this decision."
good,"Working at Walgreens was just about as normal as could have been expected. There were busy days and times, as well as times of day where very little went on.  As long as you were consistent, ready to learn and dependable you had a job there."
good,"Like with quite a few jobs it is not really about how hard the work is, but who it is that you work with and at this store it was the dream team. It was one of the busier stores so we were always on our feet and everyday was an adventure, but everyone was willing to compromise and get the job done. Management was amazing our store manager was not afraid to get her hands dirty and made sure to make all of us employees feel like we mattered. "
good,Way too many hours were scheduled for the management. Too many times we were scheduled with only 8 hours between shifts and 10-12 hour shifts. They would also reassign managers to different stores with little notice.
good,"Overall the company is really good, I just don't think it's fair for someone that's been working there for 4 years to get paid the same as someone that got hired a month ago. Also poor management."
good,Working with customers is great! Love the people I worked with. There is always something new to learn the people are great. Pharmacy is wonderful!!!!
good,"It was fine, I enjoyed my role and the fact that it was a laid back position and environment while I was pregnant. I would recommend to anyone and really go back if needed."
good,I had a really good manager and did like the job. However it was not enough money to live on at all and I was given no opportunity for a raise or advancement.
good,very nice to work at Walgreens many benefits to receive but sometimes coworkers can be until reliable and make the job very stressful as well as a low balance between work and your regular life.
good,I have had my pros and cons at Walgreens but besides that it's overrall a great work place and I would recommend it to a friend. You get to meet wonderful people at Walgreens
good,"I loved working here for my first 2 years. Working on canal i saw many tourists and celebrities and i loved that. i learned my customer service skills from this job and how to deal with people who treats you bad. Many customers would come in with attitudes that was way over my pay rate to deal with but i got it done. Although management changed frequently for the most part rules stayed the same so everything worked out well. I loved meeting people from all over the world. The hardest part would be dealing with so many customers at one time. I sometimes had to be the cashier, photo specialist, and a stock member all in one. Very frustrating"
good,"Did not have much job availability in the DC area.I really enjoyed the people that I worked with, but did not feel upper management did their best to show their employees that they were valued."
good,"Busy, busy"
good,Walgreens was not a bad company to work for I would clock in go to my register throughout the day i would put up stock and/or price modifications and sale tags if needed in my assigned department but due to an altercation between my store manager and another store manager which was a relative of mine my hours started to get cut and refuse to allow me to transfer and it became difficult to afford the expenses of transportation and childcare. The store has been closed down.
good,"It was an awesome place to work at. I did feel like the pay could have been improved, as well as the work hours. Co-workers we nice, but there was always an issue with scheduling."
good,"It was the most wonderful experience of my life.  I  looked forward to going in everyday even though I was just an extern and not getting paid I loved every   minute of it,"
good,It was an ok job. The store manager was an A hole but the staff was cool. If you come to work and do and do what is asked of you everything will be fine.
good,"My work day consists of updating a shared Excel Spreadsheet with dates for medications that are on backorder from the manufacturers. I also help resolve issues that customers have made with our customer care center. Issues may consist of types like: medication was damaged upon delivery, order was sent to incorrect address, customer was shorted on the quantity of a medication."
good,"	Customer Service"
good,"on a typical day you usually always keep busy time goes by fast, I learned how to use the cash register and stock products"
good,"This place is a great experience for an entry level tech. If you were going to school or some sort of technical college, this place would be ideal for you. Hours increasing and fluctuating weekly is the down fall of the company. Its a great place to work and the staff is awesome. The hardest part is dealing with high volume of patients."
good,"I gained a great deal of experience working with the company. It is a great platform to serve customers. Customer Service is what its all about. They have a updated software system. Overall, it is a good retail company to work in.  "
good,"I worked for Walgreens for a short time, because of a few poor managers they had at the location I worked at. Walgreens overall is a great company to work for, but the customer service at the location I worked at was very poor. I would welcome customers into the store and thank them for coming when they left as what I felt was the right thing to do, and which was also ask of me to do. I was ask all the time by customers if I was a manager at the store and I would tell them no, and they would tell me I should be. There was times I would ask for help with checking out customers when there was more then three waiting in line to be checked out, and one of the female assistant managers was shooting price tags for items on a shelf up by the checkout stands she looked back at the line of customers that were waiting to be checked out and then she turned back to what she was doing without even stopping to help with the customers or anything! That to me is a very poor attitude to have for someone within management at any retail company! The biggest problem is the store manager knows about her attitude, but he is unwilling to do anything to correct this assistant managers attitude toward other employees or customers! As for my co-workers, team leaders, and the other assistant manager that worked there through out the store, they were all great to work with and they made it very enjoyable to work there! The most enjoyable part of the job for me was getting to interact with the customers and help them with their shopping needs!"
good,"Upon arrival there would be perscriptions to be called in, either through the insurance company or the doctors offices. I was also responsible for filling perscriptions for the pharmacist to check and issue to the customers. In addition, I'd have to accept and enter perscriotion information for the perscriptions to be processed and filled. The pharmacists and other workers were vry pleasant to work with and be around. The most difficult part of the job was the times the computer systems would have to be updated and the pharmacy was still accepting perrscriptions but everything had to be processed by phone and fax. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with."
good,filling prescriptions- assisting customers- figuring out insurance for customers
good,Working at Walgreens was a great experience and I loved working with people and helping them get what they needed in the store and making sure they had a great visit at our store that day.
good,"I enjoy working with the very professional and educated co-workers at Walgreens and appreciate the training and knowledge i have gained through my employment with Walgreens."
good,My experience as a management team member was long hours and hardly any time off. My co workers were amazing so it made the days go by easily. Walgreens never closes or closes early not even  for Christmas or Thanksgiving ! We had no security and stayed open until 12pm!.
good,Good company to work for in certain areas of cities. Dealing with patients can be difficult. Fast paced but easy to deal with if efficient and organized.
good,"Pick merchandise out of tote bags, package them and place items on conveyor belts "
good,Good company but hard to get advancement. Alot of favotism at this particular store. Hours went down as soon as the new year changed. Learned alot about myself and knew alot from previous jobs through out the years. I like being there but not happy with pay and promises that aren't kept.
good,"Such a great and rewarding company!"
good,"I loved this company but after getting sexually harassed by a manager, the other manager didn’t take my uncomfortability seriously, I had to leave. Almost 3 years, they started making bad decisions and putting money before the customer. I just can’t agree with them anymore."
good,I went from being a Tech in Training to a Certified Pharmacy Technician in 6mths.  They offered a month long course to prepare you for the exam. They also paid for the exam. I passed in the first time and I truly believe it was because them.
good,Walgreens on Church St. was very busy. It was harder to learn because there was not really enough time for teaching it was more like learning as you go.
good,I cannot provide an honest review because I worked there a while back and cannot remember my time there. It was a good job and loved it while it lasted.
good,"When I took the shift lead position, the assistant manager and store manager left. We got a new manager and he was horrible. He made me do almost everything and I wasn't even properly trained"
good,Customers are great as well as coworkers. Must love people and be able to do many things. Raises aren’t that great. You must live there to make a decent check. Policies are always changing that can get annoying.
good,"I absolutely love Walgreens.  I quit as the hours were getting less as they had hired I think too many people.  I didn't want to leave, but rather than get into it with anyone, I took the hit.  No worries.  "
good,Good workplace would like to go back. Management was a little bad for shift leaders some were rude store manager was great. You have to work in a few different departments each day.
good,I miss working at Walgreens in inver grove heights. I would send my friends there. My boss was nice and very understanding. I wish i could go back!!!!
good,working for Walgreen enhanced  my customer service skills  my manger would always keep you motivated to work here the new direction was not for me and I resigned
good,"I only worked here for a couple of months, my experience was great I did enjoy working there. The few things that I would fix would only be some management but other than that I would go back if I wanted to."
good,"great place to work"
good,"Once I got to work and clocked in, I would head straight to my designated department (Cosmetics) to take over for my co-worker. Usually I had a small list of things to take care. For example: Either, take down or put up new promotional tags in front of the corresponding product, department revisions, clean the shelf strips with ""Goo-Gone"", help anyone in the cosmetics department that may need assistance, etc.."
good,"Walgreens takes care of its employees as a company."
good,"I loved working at Walgreens, I have no complaints except for how a few of the managers treated the employees but I guess thats not something that should reflect negatively on the company."
good,My boss at the time had the great idea of having us work get this ten days on with four days off. Right to work state so he could do it. The hrs were bad and benefits were so so.
good,A typical odd-job. Laborious and 8 hours standing on foot at minimum salary of 9USD/hourly. Mostly old customers who are cranky and expect to be spoon fed everything. Nothing more to say.
good,Walgreens is a nice place to work. I enjoyed working there it was very productive and the staff were always friendly. I just need to better myself in leadership skills.
good,Fun learning experience love dealing with customers and helping them find what they need had great coworkers excellent store manager who always willing to teach you anything you may need help on learning always on hands
good,"awesome, employer was rude, manangement lacked a handfull of them didnt even know what they was doing I had to show them."
good,Its a boring job with the same day to day position that I just can't get out of. Its not for everyone but its a good place to start.
good,I enjoyed this type of work. it was always my dream as a child to work as an cashier and to interact with people. I have learned a tot from this job.
good,"a great place to work, everyone is nice and all the customers are happy and interesting.  there is a decent flow of customers which makes a good balance between helping guests and getting tasks done."
good,"Productive work environment, call center job with no set goals. Management was supportive and coached and trained with detail."
good,"i worked the front end as a cashier and also as a Beauty Advisor.  Help customers, built displays, help customers  find the products they were looking for and suggest other products they may like to try.  Scan outs , and putting away weekley orders.  counted down cash drawers and end of night."
good,"A typical day was filling prescriptions, I got a better understanding of what goes on in the pharmacy world, management was ok, co-workers really showed a lot of knowledge in what i did not know how to do, trying to keep up, I learned how to do a pharmacy asst/tech job."
good,"ok job, low pay, great for student, management was okay, pretty fair no complaints, job is exactly what you expect it to be"
good,Great place 2 work  I worked at return center warehouse received returned good for store credit but it was a temporary job that ended
good,The company went bankrupted. The company is not very organized in terms of administration. A typical day at work is to pick up the phone and start calling people according to the yellow page. Co-workers are mostly sales so there are minimal communication as a team.
good,"good retail experience, good staff, management is always changing and no team work."
good,You have no set schedule one day its first next it could be second or third shift. One week you may have 40hrs next 12. I learned alot at this job though. The co workers here are not so friendly but thats ok becuase you are spread out and can avoid each other .
good,"My typical day at work is greeting every customer with great service, learning how to address different customer problems and solve them quick and inside store without going district office. The hardest part of my jobs is that the new changes that going cut a lot of pay in a year. I love my relationship with my customer."
good,"nice place, nice people, friendly."
good,Good workplace for college students but not for working mom. The job gets the bills paid.
good,I loved working here so much that i was sad giving them my two weeks notice.
good,I fill that I cannot grow with my degree with this company. This job had to grow on me. I did realize shortly after starting my position that I was to be apart of healthcare.
good,"It is a high pace environment that takes a group effort. When everyone focuses on his or her part it can be a breeze. There is not much training; therefore, one must learn on their feet."
good,Walgreen's is a great company to work for if you are a single person. A lot of hours including weekend and holidays. Very labor  intense. Have to be available
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens it was a great environment clean and we stocked every Tuesday it was very in order here and there great staff just alot of cleaning
good,"Work here was pretty standard to that of a corporate call center environment. Opening/modifying support tickets were the majority of the work, next to customer service. "
good,"Always show up on time, if you're going to be late or absent always call ahead of your shift time. Always dress properly and smile and greet fellow coworkers and customers try to do your best as a woker."
good,I have nothing really to say it pay the bills it use to bee family company now every body works like robots and the stress of moving fast is really not helping if u run out alot of time in 8 hours we work
good,Tienen un equipo bueno aunque en ocasiones no son justos
good,"When I started working at Walgreens. My title was overnight shiftlead. It stayed that way for about a year , 10:pm to 6:am worked seven nights and off six. It was great. Then we got slotted to o longer be a 24 hr store. I couldn't transfer, their were no openings. So Day Shift it was. The transition was hard.I gave notice."
good,"Enjoyable, managers were approachable. I enjoyed working there for 6 months and would go back part time. It was close to my house which was convenient for me."
good,"Brooksource treated me well and helped me advance my pay but I had to ask for it.  No chance of being kept on.  I tried 10 times to get hired on with Walgreens and was turned down for less qualified people.  Not Brooksources fault, though."
good,Working here is very relaxed there is not a lot to do. Being a cashier is the only position that really has something to do all the time as long as there is people in the store.
good,"real complicated, employees do not wanna work, oe help you, there is not team effort in my opinion, needs more leaders than followers i wouldnt recommend to any one"
good,"I really liked the company and my managers, you had to have great customer service, which was great for me because I am a people person. I helped to open two of their new stores."
good,"I usually run the register, greet customers and help them find what they are looking for by giving a general direction trough the store. I have learned how to properly work merchandise, and perform scan-outs. The management is very friendly, and are willing to work your your schedule with still giving out a decent amount of hours. The hardest part of my job is when we are short staffed around busy times during the day and having to check out customers at the front counter and help customers with pick ups at the photo counter. I love the atmosphere, and I love what i do, it makes my day go by so quick."
good,The culture of cross training of employees in various departments was  a good concept that was not executed well.  this left employees to be jacks of all trades and masters of none.
good,This is a good company if you like working retail. The pay is ok work life balance is okay. I would not work there again
good,"I stated with the company in 2013 in New York, since then I have transferred to a Tampa, Florida to a new location. The company over all is great to work for, even with all of the changes. A typical work day an be extremely hectic and stressful. Every day I learn some thing new, about  my self and about medications."
good,"I got the chance to train within the Pharmacy, but my manager decided to not tell me that I'm not going to be training within the pharmacy anytime soon. So I've been sitting idle for a few months waiting for this action, getting my hopes up and really bragging about it to my friends, when in reality they kind of lead me on for the position.Other than that I have really enjoyed working there. I love talking to customers and helping them find what they need. I feel like this job has helped me grow, mature, and really build up my people skills."
good,"No micromanagement, flexible schedules, good pay, co-workers are very friendly, manageable work load, no a good place for career advancement opportunities."
good,"I have learned a great deal about customer service and communication skills in both wording and text and verbally at this job. I could not ask for better co workers to share my day with. I have made close friends with everyone around me and relationships that I hope to carry with me for a lifetime. Management could always be better. They show favoritism a lot and that is not very professional at all. The hardest part of this job for me is following procedures exactly like they want you to. There are so many more easier, time efficient ways that would save the company more money, but they would rather you waste your time and the customer's time going the long way around and taking the more harder route that is definitely not best for the customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers and getting to talk to them and build a trusting relationship to provide the best customer service experiencing possible."
good,Many times required to work a 2pm to 10pm shift followed the next morning at a different store an 8am to 4pm shift.  I learned about Compounding with Walgreen's Recipes.  It was very interesting!  The pharmacy technicians and pharmacists were great to work with.
good,A typical day at Walgreens is usually fast paced. Although i was stock i was taught how to use the register and photo department. Walgreens is a great company where the costumers are always right.
good,"A typical work day consist of taking out the trash inside and outside of the store. Next, if it was morning shift, I was cleaning up the stockroom, making sure everything was off the floor from the night before and all ready for truck to come so we can have room to unload it. Then, the shift lead on duty and I would unload the truck, and it was my job to make sure that paper goods, laundry/household cleaning supplies, pet care, and arts and crafts were all put out on the shelves or put in the proper spot in the stockroom. This would take till the end of the shift. If it were night shift, after taking out the trash, I would clear off the stockroom floor, make sure the belt was cleared of all boxes and totes. Next I would walk down the aisles assigned to me, a total of 3 aisles, and see if there were outs and face the items that were on the shelf so that way they are in the right spots and facing straight so you can see the labels. Then I would ask management if there were any tasks that needed to get done. And finally, when it came to closing time. I would go through every aisle face and reposition all the items on the shelves, next I would dust mop the store's floor. And then head for the bathrooms and clean both the male and female bathrooms. "
good,"Was my customers, any day that I could make someone smile and feel good was a good day.  I pride myself on giving the service that I would want when I enter in any other establishment to shop.  I'm direct and always willing to help find options when their choices aren't available.  For me going to work is more like second nature, it sort of more like going to visit a very large extended family.  I've meet many wonderful people from just about every walk of life and I've learned many interesting things in the process."
good,Friendly co-workers and every one helps out each other. Great supervisors. The best part is they treat lunch at times and very great hours. 5-1:30 pm
good,when i go to work i have a set mind focuse ongetting every job done thats needed
good,A typical day is never the same always learning and growing and dealing with new situations. I learned so much about pharmaceutics and how to enter act with all different likes of people. Management was always help full and willing to teach.The hardest part of my job was to not only please the customer but also my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people every day.

good,"Dealing with customers all day and being able to get most, if not all, work done for the day. working on your own projects. able to work with ording things for the store and recording all transactions. management was okay, as co-workers. I enjoy working with people. I'm a people person. It was only hard when i first started and after a week or so I knew about everything I was doing. I'm a very fast learner. It's easy for me to learn new software and data that is handed to me. The most enjoyable part about my job is being able to see what I accomplished at the end of every work day and knowing that I'll be here the next day to start on a new project,"

good,"For a floor associate, your day will mainly consist of stocking shelves, taking inventory, putting up tags/sales promotions, and covering for cashier breaks."
good,I went to Walgreens in high school for an externship for being a pharmacy technician. The staff helped me along the way and allowed me to learn much more than I could have in a classroom.
good,I don’t have any thing bad nor good to say about them . My experience with the company was great and the environment was great also but management was horrible.

good,retail work ok schedule can be fast paced. You will work in almost every area of the store. You interact with customers all day. You have to multi task.

good,"Walgreens is just the right place for a pharmacist who is fast pace multitasker and love helping people clinically! It’s neat, all stores follow same rules! You would feel you are home in every Walgreens !The only thing is that when you become a pharmacy manager and you still have the ambition to grow they won’t really follow up with that! I don’t want to say you would be ignored but it’s very similar!!"
good,My experience with Walgreens was pretty good overall however I was only there for like two months because the store closed shortly after I was hired so my opinion on the company as a whole isn't very well informed.

I have a weekly meeting where i collaborate with other team members as the customer service champion and pharmacy techs to better improve and serve our customers. I usually worked 8-10 hours a day as a photo tech. I relieve other employees for lunch breaks. I assemble orders and help customers at our photo kiosk and over the phone for online orders. I also run a cash register and have a lot of experience dealing with returns, coupons, and other issues. If I work in the evening I usually clean the restrooms, sweep and straighten the store. On truck days I stock coolers and shelves. I have weekly scanouts where I scan empty spots on shelves for inventory. Management is great, always very considerate. Also participated in store competitions for charities, earned monthly potlucks and jean days. The hardest part of the job is we are a 24/7 store so we work all holidays and is very busy. Another hard part is you are scheduled a lot of swing shifts where you close one night and open the next morning. Other than that, the pay was nice and had fun."

good,I worked in a Walgreens in Mesquite as an intern as part of my high school's clinical program. The people were very kind and willing to teach me the responsibilities of a pharmacy technician. The hardest part was filling prescription medications when there were many prescription orders as they were a bit understaffed and things could get a bit overwhelming. Overall I really enjoyed my time working there and I really appreciate that they took me in when I had no experience whatsoever.
good,"company gave me an oportunity  in managment   i have  enjoyed my time"

good,My time with this company taught me a lot. I jumped straight into an assistant manager position. Everyone helped me get up to par with my responsibilities. It was up to me to excel from there. I decided to go through the police academy and ended up being a stay at home dad. I would've gone back but everything there has changed including the management structure.
good,It is a great place to work. I was able to learn customer service skills along with gaining effective alternatives to enhance service and satisfaction. I was able to have a flexible schedule so that I could attend school.
good,"great place to work great place to work great place to work need to apply,be ready to work great time they are truly in need of what’s going on no matter what ok"
good,"Very fair working environment. Great company that focuses on  excellent customer service and at the same time care about its employees. Employees can also grow within this company as they "
good,"According to all known laws"
good,It is a quick-paced work environment with many duties for each department. Many opportunities to grow in the company. Trained in every department so I could work where they needed the help.
good,"I greatly enjoyed my time with Walgreens in all of the locations I worked.  Unfortunately my overnight position was eliminated and I had to look for another position, otherwise I would have been happy to stay with the company."
good,"Out of all the jobs I've had Walgreens had to be one of my favorite places to work at, the people were so nice and my supervisors would walk me through how to do specific tasks"
good,"Performs all other duties as assigned in order to maintain an effective and profitable"
good,I loved working here. Loved working with the customers. Sure the pay and benefits weren’t that great but I was happy there. It just wasn’t for me I guess.
good,I like walgreens everything about it was fun and desirable to work at. The staff was nice and the pay was good for what you were working for I really liked it
good,The only negative thing is corporate constantly giving unrealistic goals and then changing things that work to things that decrease productivity. Management changed 3 times at my second store in a year and most recent one wouldnt discipline senior employees who thought they didnt have to be a cashier and one that was bullying me because I needed to be on the floor more often. Also I had to work midshifts and they dodnt want to stop giving me them
good,"Walgreen's was a good job. it helped me gain good customer services. i had to help them and greet them. I always made them smile and helped out when needed i even volunteered helped without needed. Walgreen's helped me gain working experience as well i had to stock and put up products and i had to move and work at a good pace, you also get moved around to doing different stations."
good,My manager made things difficult but everyone else made things enjoyable for me to work. I was told to re-apply when I had the chance because they have very good benefits
good,A great place to GROW. I had so much fun working there. I miss it. I think the hardest thing about working there was restocking on certain days when we had lots of traffic.
good,"In my Short time working here, they gave me hours to finish out my internship and gave me great future advise. they were very friendly and they seemed to care about the customer a lot."
good,A typical day at work will be greeting everyone that entered the store. The management is wonderful. There really isn't hard part of my job.I enjoy my job.
good,"Walgreens is a highly up beat place to work, the managers and employees both have excellent customer service to share with the new employees and they train you very well, managers take actions and fix the issue despite if the person likes it or not."
good,i had some personal family reasons and missed some work due to my own issues. so i understood when i was fired. would definately work here again if i could
good,Great place to work and meet new people!! I really enjoyed my customers as well as my co workers. I liked the way everyone pulled together to get the job done.
good,Work days consist of about 8 hours. I typically learned my customer service skills can be flexible throughout the entire store not just the area I work.
good,It was a summer job and it was very relaxed and my managers were helpful in it being my first job. I learned a lot from it being my first job and would recommend it as a good first job for anyone.
good,All the leaders are willing to help and work to make us meet customers demand. There is always the effort to make things right and fair for workers too.
good,The staff is very supportive of each other. The atmosphere is always pleasant. Great place to meet new people and to overall grow as an employee I would more than likely refer someone here to work.
good,"Since I was an intern, my job was very different from everyone else's. Yes, I got paid the same as them but I mostly stocked shelves and accommodated to customers needs on the sales floor. I never was on register, but I met a lot of nice people and all of the managers were very nice."
good,This company was a good place to work at with plenty of work if you like to stay busy.  I enjoyed my four year career with them in pharmacy and all of the employees got along and were team oriented.
good,Cutting of hours has been the norm for walgreens lately.  We are provided little help to do the job . Metrics are very important to  them. You are asked to meet many metrics.
good,"You will work about 40 hours a week, including nights, weekends, and holidays.  Great work environment and I was able to learn something new each day."
good,Working at walgreens i have realized that in order to get ahead you have to not do your work. That if you sit in the office and do nothing you are more then likely to get the bosses approval. I always work hard. And wasn't in any cliques but being a member of leadership i always feel like i was on the outside when it came to the others.  I loved working in pharmacy and helping back there because it was more of a team back there then in the front of the store. The front of the store is every man for themselves. They wanted to be sure that everyone pretty much does whatever they want. That no one who takes time from their day to do overtime will always lose. I honestly am wanting to get away from walgreens and hopefully learn more from others who would be willing to teach me.
good,i worked at Walgreen for probably about 6 months i was an alright place to work i had awesome employers but they didn't pay enough per hour for me to work there i couldn't pay my bills
good,I actually really liked working at Walgreens. It was a great environment because of both customers and people you worked with. Great benefits and fair scheduling.
good,"The positive of Walgreen are the benefits.   The negatives of Walgreen is that it's long hours and can be very stressful.  They continue to take the benefits from us, especially when an employee has been with the company for 27 years."
good,"As pharmacy manager, I have meeting with my store manager at least once a week, and meeting with my staff members at least 2-3 times per week. This creates great opportunities for me to know about the company incentives, business, metrics, how my pharmacy is performing, and know more about my staff members. This helps me create good connection with my team members and support them in every way so that they come to work everyday with their highest energy."
good,"learned the pharmacy environment with co-workers and pharmacist.  Refers any questions regarding prescriptions, drug information or health matters to a pharmacist."
good,"I really enjoyed working there as a Pharmacist specially answering patients questions and being busy with reviewing, checking for interactions and dispensing medications."
good,I loved working here the management was great and so was the staff. Fast pace environment. The costumers were great had a lot of regulars. My favorite job.
good,good job good company and they always have room for advancement for the correct candidates the pay is a bit questionable but the job is great for entry level.
good,"Great place to work, good staff, great boss, hours are kind of rough at times, but overall great! Allowed to control my team and help them to achieve the goals that are needed."
good,"May Duties, with keeping things in order and making sure things were done correctly and in a timely manner. Making schedules and handel many different projects at once."
good,"Great work environment, 90% of the workers/ management are cool as can be and always care about employees personally. This job includes benefits and gives decent hours."
good,I started out with no experience. and they were willing to train me and get me certified. I just did not last long enough to complete the certification process.
good,although I had fun in Walgreens it was the best place I learned how to be more professional. I was counting registers making sure my area was clean. before closing time we always had to face the store basically just make sure all items where stocked well and face front in the isles. it was a great place of work.
good,Management at every Walgreens location I worked at was great. The day to day tasks are organized and there is always something to do or help out with.
good,Overall enjoyed my job. Do not accept gifts from  customers no matter how much they enjoy your service! the company can be held as a liability and will terminate you. pay attention to ppls.
good,Working at Walgreens taught me how to be more compassionate to others and more patient. This company is excellent for those wanting to get a foot in the retail/pharmacy door.
good,"this also was a good job, friendly enviroment cool employees and the boss was decent, the work was reasonable, not to difficult and the hours were also good"
good,"I enjoyed teamwork and helping my customers to best of my abilities."
good,"I had a great internship at this place. They have taught me everything I know. They are very helpful and very open. If you do something wrong, they will not discrimate, they will help you to prevent future mistakes."
good,"the pharmacy manager I worked with was very nice. One of the pharmacist was sassy and I did not really like her. But whatever, there are always mean ppl"
good,I loved the store I worked for. They were helpful with customers and employees. Had one of the best store managers ever. I worked at other stores when my store couldn't give me enough hours and it helped me out. Over all I think working here really helped me into the retail world and made the process switching to another retail job easy.
good,"I enjoyed working here. When in the photo department  even though the machine did most of the work, I would always take pride in the finished product.  I also enjoyed the atmosphere with the customers."
good,I was a cashier. I enjoyed this job. I loved the customers as well. I only left the company for a better pay opportunity. I would have stayed if the pay was better.
good,I loved working there it was so much fun and I got allot of experience in the pharmacy feild I wish I could have worked there for many many days to come
good,Fun place to work with an awesome manager and team...enjoyed meeting people and seeing friendly faces. Very clean and well organized store. Pharmacy employees were very nice and helpful as well not to only customers but all employees as well. Great place...sad that it's closing.
good,"I have enjoyed working for Walgreen the past 3 years and have made a lot of friends. I will dearly miss working for this company, and miss my bosses and coworkers the most."
good,This is a great store and can learn a lot about outdates. I would clean and check the parking lot. It also can be a fun environment with other co-workers.
good,"a typical work day at Walgreen's was stocking items and placing them in their proper shelves, helping customers find what they are looking for in the store and collecting shopping carts from outside and placing them inside for customers to grab."
good,"I love working at Walgreens.  I'm so so so sad that I have to relocate, and the one near my future home is not currently hiring.  I'd love to be able to transfer."
good,great work environment with opportunity to move up. there are tasks that will challenge you to become better at your craft. the work place promotes good customer service.
good,"•	Worked collectively with other team members to receive, fill, and dispense prescriptions as well as resolved insurance issues."
good,The workers didn't know how to keep it professional. They use to talk behind each other back even the manager with the worker. They have to learn business is business
good,Walgreens is a great place to work at! My experience has been quite eventful and the stores I have worked at have a pretty good staff! Overall a great place!
good,Good place to work at while the company was locally there for diabetic supplies to those with Medicare. Business shut down after not too long at that location
good,"Walgreens is quick to promote a poor employee with a degree or hire outside of the company than give it's loyal employees a chance. After 8+ years with the company I received a Shift Lead promotion and the starting pay for shift lead, which was much less than a hired on Shift Lead with a degree. Walgreens is loyal to itself and not it's employees. The company is fine to work for but the management staff is lacking. Bad employees moving up and hiring bad managers leads for a bad experience. Asking for time off requires weeks ahead of time and still most likely being denied. No set schedule, mostly for no reason, even if it's easier for everyone involved. I worked for multiple stores and multiple districts. The same problems exist throughout."
good,The job was very fast paced which made the day go very quickly.  I also worked at several different stores.  Basically wherever I was needed.  I really enjoyed working with the other techs and the pharmacist.
good,"I was very comfortable working at Technisource.  I had serveral positions within the company.  (Contract work). They took great care of me.  Once one contract was over, that found me another.  Positions included Dr Pepper/Snapple, Dell Computers, Walgreens and Pepsico/Frito-Lay."
good,"- Filling drug prescriptions, call the patient to pick up there medicine, keep their medical file up to date"
good,"Walgreens is a great place of employment, it's   Teamwork. The day will go very smoothly  I enjoyed the holidays,  I enjoy traveling to different stores and setting the cosmetic department up, and any other area that I was asked to help out with. If I had to say the least thing I had to do. What is the revisions and sometimes unloading  our truck merchandise. Overall Walgreens is a awesome place to work"
good,"Learned organizational skills. The other employees are very easy to work with. Relaxed work environment, enjoyed learning from the people in charge. great place."
good,good training management. I moved up in my position fairly and in a short period of time. I felt valued and felt that my work was recognized by my superiors.
good,Walgreens is a great job for current students. They really work with your schedule and allow you to attend school while still having a job. A lot of co workers that are around the same age so it is a great place to meet new people.
good,"supportive and outgoing staff whom of which took on extra duties introducing me to the pharmacy technician work field. Workflow was high and yet after a couple days my workflow technique followed those who led me. I still need experience, but that is what I am looking for."
good,the place Is fun to work. Many up and coming technologies that help people with making better safety decisions in life. Very chill environment. Great benefits.

good,"As a high school Intern at the time, Walgreens pharmacy served as a great first hand experience towards the retail aspect of the pharmacy. It can get stressful at times, however, if you like to work in a fast pace environment, I'd recommend Walgreens pharmacy."
good,A typical intern day was a good learning experience for me. Everyone that worked in the pharmacy was nice and very helpful. They made sure that I learned what I need to learn.

good,it is a very busy place to be working but it helps the long shifts go by much faster. It definitely strays from a typical 9-5 desk job. It's always something different everyday.
good,Walgreens enhance my customer service skills tending to peoples needs and or wants. I enjoyed completing tasks such as helping people find an item they were looking for and giving them advise on the product.
good,Great company to work for and if you are a hard worker and do what youre supposed to do advancement becomes really easily. they offer competitive pay and are flexible with hours.

I learned about the shipping procedures of walgreens and merchandise packing directions. it was difficult working with overly competitive co works, but the management would help when needed"
good,This was where I did my internship and I learned a lot from customer service to inventory control. The manager at the time truly cared about the well being of all his employees.
good,"Always something to keep you busy. "
good,"I worked for Walgreens for 7 years and I enjoyed working in the pharmacy helping the patients. Every day I would go into work sign on to a computer and start typing perscriptions. Each one would have to be checked by the pharmacist. The hardest part about the job was the amount of the job was the lack of help, and the most enjoyable part was getting to know so many different people."
good,The work environment is amazing and the employees are amazing as well. The managers listen and allow you to choose your schedule. The people that come into the store are nice.
good,"I love the people I work with and have the privilege of helping people I care about. I couldn't ask for more. In addition, decent benefits and compensated for the hard work put in."

good,The management was amazing and always willing to work with my schedule!! Everything worked smoothly and you didn't have to ashamed to ask questions. Plus they rewarded us with drink bucks where if you were seen doing something amazing or were rated a 5 star from a customer you got a free drink under so many dollars.
good,I loved working for Walgreens under Suzie. She is an excellent manager and is very fair. She ran her store correctly and always had happy employees. I would work with Suzi no matter where she managed.

good,Started and the bottom in the front of the store and worked my way up to the pharmacy. I learned a lot form my coworkers. The job could be a little stressful working in the pharmacy but my coworkers made it a little easier to deal with.
good,"It was fast paste. Of course the company is all about numbers, but I felt I could not provide the best customer service that our patients deserved. It seemed that we were understaffed a lot, but we usually had a great team on board that hustled and bustled to provide the best customer service we could."
good,"Managers were amazing, love the discount, everyday was fun. Hardly any rude customers. Willing to work with your schedule, especially while still in school."

good,I had my internship at walgreens from Spetember to November of 2016. I learned alot with only being there for 3 months. They were really fast paced and I picked up on everything really fast. I had a wonderful experience! A typical day for me was right when I walked in I went right to filling prescriptions. That is pretty much what I did most of the time in my internship. I also would take some of the medications off the shelf being that they were about to expire. I helped a couple people in customer service and also in the drive thru.

good,I enjoyed working for this company. Staff was very professional and management was great as well. We were free to take on our own responsibilities. Pharmacy manager worked very well with his/her techs
good,This is a fast paced work environment with excellent management that offers excellent customer service. Overall i think it is a great place to work at.

good,"Working in a pharmacy can be very challenging. A typical day includes calling insurances, taking in and filling prescriptions, and doing inventory management. A technician has to know how to manage. You might have a rush and you're the one that has to manage the order and who needs to be where. The hardest part of the job is that we can be spread thin. If you are on the phone helping a customer you can't help the front counter or fill a prescription, so the workflow piles up a little. With all this being said; a pharmacy technician is very rewarding. You get to know the customers and sometimes the medications you dispense to them are changing their quality of life. We might be the little man but technicians are the face of the pharmacy."

good,Enjoyed the days and they went fast. Learned forklift driving and shipping/receiving. Got along well with co-workers. Enjoyed working at Walgreens for over 15 years.
good,"A typical day includes offering friendly and sincere service to customers by always making sure that they come first. I spend most of my day offering customers help, but when I'm not my day consists of developing and editing photos, stocking and organizing shelves, and cashiering. Out of all the places I've worked, Walgreen's has had some of the best managers and co-workers. The hardest part of my job would be helping customers find things in our store because it is currently being remodeled and shelves are being moved around. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping and interacting with others."
good,"Amazing opportunities and experience I got my first does of customer service skills from this job and I was difficult at times but nothing I couldn't handle. I will always appreciate all the lessons I learned on this job and the experience as a whole.

This job overall was the greatest work experience of my life."

good,"Overall the coworkers and the store was fun and easy to work at.  The one downside, because I usually like to stay busy and on my feet, is walking from one side of the drug store to the other going from one customer to a clerk working under me.  Pretty much nonstop, everyday!"
good,High performance and mult-tasking required.  Customer service of high importance as well as sales volume for store.  Seasonal and Holiday items and inventory displays very important.
good,"Being a very popular pharmacy, Walgreens showed me what it was like to work in a typical pharmaceutical setting. The licensed pharmacists and pharmacy technicians were very patient and helpful, showing me all of the different duties of the technician. I received prescriptions from patients at the drop-off window, entered them into the computer, filled them with the appropriate medications, did inventory, organized drugs on the shelves, and called MDs and nurses about patient refills. I enjoyed interacting with the employees and the customers. Because it was my first experience in a pharmacy, I was not familiar with how fast-paced everything was, but my coworkers made sure I was comfortable and that I could slowly ease into my new position."
good,great environment friendly coworkers be ahead of every makeup brand and beauty product personal experience better than reviews

good,Great supervisors and management. The benefits and salary is excellent. Opportunity for a long stable workforce. Definitely would recommend this company to anyone.
good,"Laid back office, employee friendly but management needs improvement in communication and managerial skills. Pay is not competitive and it is very low for this industry."

Very fair individual. The job had its ups and downs just like any other, but overall, I learned and it was good."
good,I learned how to efficiently multitask while delivering exceptional customer service.  My co-workers were fun to work with and were able to teach me skills on the job.  The hardest part of the job was wrapping up at the end of my shift because it is a 24 hour pharmacy that never closes so there are always new customers coming in even after my shift is over.

Sometimes you'd get repeat customers but most of the time, they were different.  Walgreen's was my first job so I learned a lot of things.  I learned how to count the cash registers and how to give excellent customer service.  My co-workers were pretty nice.  The hardest part of the job was learning everything but once I got used to it, it was okay.  The most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with customers."
good,"Honestly I did not like working at walgreens, co-workers were rude, manager was rude, not enough work to do during the work hour, and on top of that i didnt get enough hours"

The management was great as well all very friendly, the best part was getting to experience it all and furthering my growth into something as fun."

good,"Help customers and learn new things each day, either by the customers or assigned tasks."
good,"I as a shift lead at Walgreens it is my duty to make sure customers are satisfied as well as my team. I have boosted others by making a chart to earn points for my team members so by the end of the month they can win a special reward. By doing this event, my team members were very motivated to push our internet ordering in the store and also customers were very happy to know that they could come into a store and regardless if we had the product in store, we took the extra time to look it up online and order it straight from the warehouse. At the end of the day, my team members and customers were very happy within our store and community."
good,"A typical day at work requires punching in, going to the Photo Lab, checking on new information and talking to the previous photo lab technician about what's going on so far for the day. My coworkers keep themselves busy with projects. Management will usually let me know what they expect from me for the day, and I will go ahead and get those projects done. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers who are looking to get their photos done on the kiosk, developing film, and building wall décor like canvases and posters. The hardest part of the job would be the ability to answer every question that our customers have, and seeing them disappointed if I am not able to come up with a solution to their answer."

The hardest part was working late at night, but sometimes it worked for the best."
good,"At Walgreen pharmacy, one of the greatest things that contributes to a successful day is Work Flow. The processing and dispensing of prescriptions go through a variety of stages. Some of the stages include, an initial interaction with a patient, the Doctor or agents at the doctor's office. Once the prescription is received, a Pharmacy Intern or technician enters it into the system, for it to be checked by the Pharmacist. After the prescription has been checked, it is pulled from the shelves and filled. When it is filled, the Pharmacist again verifies the prescription to make sure it was filled accurately. Once that is complete, the prescription is then ready to be dispensed. This is the process through which all the hundreds of prescriptions that are sold each day go through. "
good,"work here have for 11 years"
good,"On any given day there is always something to do or change including slow days. I learn something new everyday, for example I taught myself a bit of Spanish to go above and beyond so that the Hispanic portion of the community had the same savings and discounts as the English speaking. I am learning more by interacting with the customers. My managers are easy to work with/for as well as talk to about any subject whether it be work related or not. I absolutely adore my co workers they are the meaning of the word team. The hardest part of the job is dealing with irate and inconsiderate customers, especially if your having a not so great day yourself. Even though I stated that the hardest part of the job was the customers they are also the most enjoyable part as well."

The hardest part is going to be leaving them because they are life family to me now. I enjoy helping customers every chance I could and fulfilling their needs. I've learned that everyone works different and everyone has their own opinions but at the end of the day everyone must work together like a family."
good,I received experience at Walgreens just not as much as I would have liked to have.
good,Greeting and assisting customers! Respectable coworkers! Rewards cards!
good,"I really fell in love with Walgreens as a company, I just wish I could work with better people. I only enjoyed the company of two managers who actually came to work to work instead of using their job as a high school hallway. I was only recognized for doing great when corporate was making their visits. I constantly strived to be the best in suggestive sell and was successful almost every month, but like I said, I wasn't recognized until my boss learned corporate was making a visit...then he would write employee recognition cards. The older employees were much easier to get a long with and I consider some of them family. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my regular customers come in and smile when they realize I'm their cashier today! My typical day at work consisted of a million phone calls and a huge line waiting for me to check them out while I release the previous cashier. I learned that speed doesn't always mean you're doing a good job, it's best to work at a pace you are comfortable with and make sure things are done correctly."
good,See recent comments for previous review of Walgreens. Time management was an issue and I enjoyed working with people.

good,"While working at Walgreens I was required to always make sure the customer feels welcomed and experienced an easy shopping trip.  I learned there was more to a retail job than just ringing customers up.  There were many more important tasks that needed to be done.  Since this was my first job, my management helped me become reliable and a hard worker.  My co-workers were always there for me as I was for them.  The most enjoyable part of this job was getting to know my customers and meeting their needs."
good,"Job responsibilities include filling prescriptions, customer service, working with insurance companies, SIG coding, and communicate with doctors.

I am always early at work keeping great example to all co-workers. Hardest part job was dealing with new and smart young generation, which I always loved, because it is great experience with them."
good,"My job as a Pharmacy Technician within a retail setting is filled with a lot of important responsibilities. Pharmacy Technicians are tasked with helping the pharmacy run smoothly and efficiently by performing duties within the pharmacy, as well as compounding and filling orders, and requires both attention to detail and stamina as it is a challenging, fast-paced environment. In addition to filling scheduled medications, we prepare TPNs, narcotic, and many STAT medications continuously throughout the workday. We have to be able to think quickly, identify and select proper medications, and figure dosing strengths, all while ensuring that our sterile technique is perfect. The Pharmacy Technician responsible for creating oral compounds prepares all STAT, scheduled, and PRN oral medications. Some of our other duties include cleaning and sanitizing work areas and equipment, repackaging bulk medications, stocking medications, and ensuring that stock is rotated and expired medications removed. In addition, we are always available to our pharmacists to provide assistance with anything they might need throughout the day. While the majority of questions for pharmacy staff must go directly to a pharmacist, in many instances, Pharmacy Technicians can help identify the problem, locate a missing medication, or answer a general question."

good,a lot to learn and amazingly talented team. good work place.
good,"The majority of the day is spent typing prescriptions on the computer. I would say that is the main downfall of the job as I like to be on my feet. Its a great opportunity for self teaching because you have the tools to look up any medication to find out what it is for, how it is used, and how it is normally dispensed. The most enjoyable part of the job is that your stats are based on the effort you put into it. Learning new things everyday is a great motivator. It is not really a social setting as our main focus is making sure we enter all information correctly and in a timely manner."
good,Very helpful and I learned a lot. It was always busy and always had something to do
good,"Could pay more, easy position, great call center experience. Management was great."
good,"I promised myself that I would never work ""retail"" again.  But there were several reasons I decided to accept this job offer.  1. Walgreens is my favorite drugstore. 2. This was a new position that Walgreens was introducing and the store hiring was part of the ""test market"". and 3. It was perhaps a chance to use some of my medical knowledge which has dissipated over time.  I saw this as an opportunity to be part of something new, fresh and big.  I really enjoyed my time working for Walgreens in this position except that I stood all day and due to a medical condition I had to leave that position.  If they had been willing to accommodate my need to sit down more frequently I see myself still being there."
good,"pleasant atmosphere, good co workers,learned a lot for medicines,filling and typing"
good,"Your days go by fast and its a very fast work environment, never a dull moment."

I worked there for 4.5 years and in that time frame I worked for many different managers who were all very different from one another. At 16 I learned a lot about how to effectively communicate with others and I learned how to be professional even at a young age. I feel like I grew up a lot faster than most of my peers by surrounding myself with professionals. I will forever be grateful for the things I learned not only about the real world, but myself as well.

good,"typical day was filling prescriptions (pulling meds, counting, packaging, labeling) occasionally needed to stock shelves or pull expireds. the three pharmacists i worked with were helpful, easy going, and patient. the techs were easy to work with and showed me the ropes. i can't really say there was a hard part of job, i enjoyed working there."
good,"my most enjoyable part of this internship was getting a hands on experience of my chosen profession, the people and environment."
good,Overall a good company to work for with lots of advancement opportunities.
good,The entire experience was GREAT....each particular issue was almost entirly always different.
good,"Nice calm and relaxing not to much work had to be done, great management, excellent co-workers, there wasn't anything hard about this job."
good,It was a great opportunity. A fun and lively environment with friendly co-workers.
good,I spent 120 hours as an extern with Walgreens. I had the priceless opportunity to work with 3 pharmacists who taught me every aspect of working within the Walgreens Pharmacy. I loved every single minute and would only wish they were hiring!
good,"Build/Reset product displays by planogram in Walgreens, Jewel Osco and Walmart"
good,"Always had a security on the look out. Not much of the rush hours. a typical night, clock in, stock, cashier, answer phone calls if any made during the night."
good,"My typical day consisted of data entry, schedule, inventory, filling, cleaning and drive-thur. I learned to make schedules. My management was top notch. My co-workers were hard working and fun. The hardest part of my job was reading handwriting on scripts."
good,On a typical day at work I would assist customers that came to the cosmetics department. I learned a lot about what make-up works best on different skin types and colors. The management was great and I got along with my co-workers just fine.
good,The people are very friendly and helpful. I didn't want to leave the job but it was only for six weeks and if i could i would take the job back in a heart beat.
good,much to stringent on employees that have a long work history
good,great place to work and meet new people. The co-workers were great to be around
good,"Easy going atmosphere and supportive management staff. Most days are spent photofinishing however stocking, merchandising, and register work was also done."
good,Good people. The system was fast and efficient. Workflow is productive.
good,was a great working environment. I learned alot while employed with walgreens.
good,I've learned many things at Walgreens. Most of all I've enhanced my management skills.
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work, there are many tasks that must be completed daily but it is not hard if I balance my day correctly. I enjoy the different personalities of my employees and because it is a small scale store I know them all very well. Overall it is a great place to work but I would like to work in the field I studied in and that is Marketing so I can move up the job ladder in a field that I love."
good,"I have been a loyal and hardworking employee of this company for three and one half years. I have found Walgreens to be a very well run organization, very supportive of its customers and employees. I would like nothing more than to continue my professional growth with this company. I feel that my gained knowledge of this company's policies along with my proven abilities in my capacity here in customer service as front cashier, experience in stocking, ad tags, inventory, and my ability to adapt and learn quickly would be definite assets to any other store position in the Pensacola, Florida area."
good,"This was the best company I have ever worked for. The benefits where great and the employees where also, I wish I never stopped working for this company."
good,Due to hour changes and elimination of position I am looking for a new position. The most enjoyable part of my job is customer service and being able to have different tasks each day. I learned many aspects of business from Store management to Administrative duties.
good,I loved working for this company. the management staff is great and they are always supportive.
good,This was a great company to work for. The only downfall was the variety of hours. You never had a set schedule.
good,I was a cashier and I would full in back in the pharmacy. I loved working with the people.
good,"outstanding management, friendly environment, would work there again if i could!"
good,"My co workers were like my family. They made my days great there at Walgreens. I felt like I could not advance though and that was a problem. I felt like men were treated like gold, where as women were treated poorly."
good,"I loved seeing our customers everyday & some of my co-workers came to be like family. Friendly environment, clean. A place where you get your work done but have fun at the same time."
good,"Stocked items by barcodes/UPC numbers. Recovery (maintained and put misplaced items back). Out dates (checked for expired items)"
good,i love working here. great people but some can be difficult in the management staff. i had a great store manager for years and a great pharmacy manager as well just depends on who is running both is how successful the store will be.
good,"I think Walgreens’s is a great company. I just wish they were a bit more flexible. Hard to stay with company when you have small children. Other wise room for growth , training advancement, other perks."
good,I love working at walgreens but everyone try's bossing you around because you have not worked there long and the stealing policy has gone out of control
good,I like working for the company when I was started working there it was fun and exciting I work in the photo lab and I experiencing working at the cash register and talking to the customers
good,"Real nice environment. I learned some very good people skills, I learned patience and to stand for long periods of time. The best part of the was being able to help people. The hardest part of the job was standing up on your feet for long periods of time, But it was all worth it at the end."
good,I loved it i was a resolution specialist which was mostly outbound and that was to call healthcare plans to confirm if patients has valid health care benefit . if not i search for new benefits plan then send for approval to pharmacist.
good,I have been at Walgreens for almost a year now. I enjoy working at Walgreens. There is A lot to learn and advance in the Company. There is a variety of jobs to do. Learning something new every day is the best. Something new every day. Management is hard because there are more bosses than workers. Sometimes you get told to do something one way and then another manager tells you another way that gets confusing.
good,I absolutely love Walgreens as a company! Would be a great place to work for as long as the management is great and follows the company’s guidelines for how to treat all employees equally.
good,Nice place to start work not at all stressful very friendly work environment .very understanding about the schedule and were flexible hours liked working at Walgreens
good,"was good steady work, productivity rate was fair. mandatory overtime was overused, impacted work life balance. pay rate is good, attendance policy strict"
good,"The managers at the location I worked at could use a bit more training in communication and understanding as well as time-management and patients. The job in itself was fine to say the least. It was fast-paced, lots to do, and always packed full of people from the moment it opened to the moment it closed. There was always lots to do and the pay and benefits were great. It is a job I would love to go back to if I could, but the management needs to be trained in a few aspects and observed with a bit more care."
good,"please be sure to be extremely fast while in this store, you will have an great amount of customers due to promo's and coupons. over all great company"
good,"Working at Walgreens was great, it was laid back and only got busy a few times a day. Management was good and plenty of opportunity to advance. However, be ready to close the store with only two people most nights."
good,"Walgreen was great place to work, everyone was very career orientated; most of us were working on something like our bachelors, master’s degree, or some type of certification. It was a lot of very interesting people and everyone always had something going on. Most of my coworkers were very positive and helpful people."
good,"A typical day at work was slow,  stocking mostly, backroom most of the time."
good,"Loved working with everyone, from management to associates they make you feel very welcomed. And customers are very appreciative of the great customer service."
good,I like working here because sometimes we have company charities that we can participate in like red nose day. During this time we can dress up in red and get wacky with it to raise money for children in poverty.
good,The environment made the job fun and peaceful. The energy was high and as a team we did our best to help sales and customers. I learned a lot about retail although the hardest part of the job was multitasking i quickly over came that. I enjoyed helping people and helping the store meet high standards.
good,Management worked well to provide the times and hours I needed.  Always willing to help accommodate my schedule time   Management was very involved in making sure you had the help you needed
good,"I love my customers, love the location! I enjoy my t years in the store but I believe I need a change! A chance to explore my abilities outside and the real world!"
good,"I made it up to management. Just couldn’t work until midnight! Too much on my body. It was cool though but the nights got to be too much. You have to stand up for yourself and not let management make you"
good,"Every week there were different changes being made. Corporate policies are always changes and it makes it hard to keep up with what you're suppose to be doing. With all the policies and changes always being made it makes it a very stressful work environment. I had trouble sleeping, eating, and enjoying family life outside of work because I was always stressing over the job."
good,This was my first job after graduating college and Walgreens was my foundation for learning management. Great company! I learned a great deal from everything from the front end to the pharmacy
good,"Prior to the merger with Boots, Walgreens was a great company to work for.  After, they changed the whole culture and it's not as great.  Your job satisfaction depends on your manager - if you have a good one, everything is great, if not, your life is awful."
good,As a shift lead I had a stressful but good working experience. The leadership at store level varies in quality from store to store. Would be interested in returning.
good,"Walgreens is a nice place to work, and they are pretty easy to get into the last I remember."
good,I enjoyed working there.  The manager was easy going and stern at the same time.  It was a distance to get there but the people I worked with and the manager were like a family.  I like that.
good,I love Walgreens because they have flexibility hours there friendliness and also my managements team is Alsome and my coworkers Walgreens is a great place to start
good,Loved working at Walgreens loved getting to see my new n same customers n helping them find the products they needed. Loved being their cosmetician n findeing the right makeup for them. They were always satisfied.
good,Retail all retail just needs to pay more. But it is a great company to work for and the manager's are great and so are the benefits. It is a great company to begin a career with.
good,"I worked with Walgreens while I was going to school, they worked with my schedule and was very understanding. Even though it was only a temporary job, I still enjoyed it."
good,"I believe I already answered the questions for this review. It was a good place to work, but always short staffed. You always had to stay over but your paycheck was nice."
good,"They have to enhance their compensation. Is a good employer."
good,"Walgreens has plenty work to accomplish if you want to keep busy."
good,"18 months and older.   Family Practice experience is a must to work in this walk in clinic environment.  Staff NP to manager over the 8 year period employed.   Immunizations, evaluations, health promotions and employee evaluations.  Developed strong coding and billing skills and documentation to support."
good,"I worked at Walgreen's with many of my friends, but the job itself is rather frustrating.  Tasks that should be mundane are brutally critiqued and employee input is hardly ever even acknowledge, much less followed up on."
good,Working for Walgreens is a pretty good starting job for a teenager or someone trying to get back on track it's fun and fast paced not enough employees to work there
good,"Walgreens is a great first time job. Its easy, flexible and usually you come across friendly people. Theres always room to grow if you are truly committed"
good,It is a nice place to work if you enjoy solving problems and helping others. There is a lot of work to do as the company expands and reaches no milestones.
good,"Busy, never boring. I really liked this company, to be honest the only reason I left it was because of pay, if they were willing to pay me more and allow me to thrive and grow with the company I would never have left."
good,"It's a great place to work, just their point system and accommodations to people that makes a far commute, is really not fair. Then you do all this work and they treat you like its military bases."
good,"For Pharm Techs a typical day is challenging when it comes to patients and their insurance. Lots of bureaucratic kinks to work out."
good,"This was a good establishment. The manager was fair and had excellent management skills. It was hard work and sometimes heavy lifting. You were always busy, which is a good thing."
good,"Culture needs to improve, as well as management, benefits are expensive and they only offer HDHP. But, the compensation is good and there is job security."
good,"Overall it was a good place to work as long as there were hours to be filled, If the district didn't have any hours to distribute to floaters it was very stressful or may have involved very long drives."
good,"clock in on time break time after 2 hrs staff helpful and energetic learned item codes and item placement check expiration dates and greet customers & help them locate items"
good,great company to work for. Great people great supervisors and leads. I loved this company and would work for them again if I was asked to join the team.
good,"walgreens pharmacy is a very busy place, need to be very efficient to complete work related tasks. at work i greeted customers, filled prescriptions, and handled phone calls."
good,"Walgreens was a very great work place. I learned a lot. I learned how to count inventory, demonstrate excellent customer service and generate positive energy amongst  others."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreens for my 80 hour externship, however there was little to no time to be trained on anything other than filling prescriptions."
good,"Walgreens was a great place to enter into the pharmacy work place. They are a teaching company. Only problem they are stern on the Retail scheduling, not to willing to give a set schedule."
good,"--Typical day at work helping customers on a daily basics"
good,This is a great job for any one entering the work force. It gets crazy during the holiday season but that's expected any where around that holiday season.
good,A typical day at Walgreens was exiting because everyday I meet different people I learner how to do Inventory there. The management at the store that I was at was not a good one at all.. The hardest part of thisn job was the physical labor
good,I really enjoyed my experience with Walgreens. I was impressed with the management team and the Walgreens integrity and philosophy. Great store!  They are fair and reasonable about the job descriptions and growing their employees. I have no regrets for the experience of working for Walgreens. I would recommend it to others.
good,I learned all the pharmacy technician skills to work in a retail pharmacy.  I spent about 6 months here in an unpaid capacity.  The pharmacists were knowledgeable and competent.
good,This was a small and busy store. You had to multi-task and work with speed. But it was friendly and enjoyable. I wish I got hired on as a full time employee.
good,The company is a great place to work and good place excise without even not knowing it. The management and staff is great.
good,"it is a very challenging job at time but fulfilling.. you have to have patiences and love what you do.."
good,They are very helpful and welcome you with open arms when you first start. Every employee and store leader make sure you are on task and guide you to the right path. Very good people.
good,"I worked in the liquor department as a license distributor and in the stockroom off loading trucks and back stocking the shelves with product, set up displays and signs....ect"
good,"Great opportunity to advance up to shift lead. Superviors are understanding, but, not much room for bonusing or pay increments."
good,i was only doing my exten there so i did  not learn alot about the company i learn more about how the pharmacy was to be ran and i enjoyed the people i worked with and enjoyed my time there.
good,"The only problem with walgreens was the favoritism between workers. I believe if you are in anyway related to management you should transfer. Management was very nice until you call out ""excessively"" then the rules will change on you, what once was considered consecutive days will no longer be consecutive. Or leaving halfway through your shift is no longer non penalty to you, now you'd be fired if you got vomit all over you and were sent home. I would never volunteer to work at a walgreens again."
good,I like working at walgreens. They always accommodate my school schedule and the management is very nice. The only reason I would leave is because it doesn't teach me the skills I need to go toward my major.
good,I enjoy working with my coworkers. Needs improvement for advancement. Its very hard to advance in this company.  Pay is minimal for the amount of work to perform.
good,walgreen's is a fast pace working envirerment that the people and customers are enjoying.i have learned a lot from walgreens
good,I got to pick what days I can and cannot work. The other employees were really nice and the work day was usually pretty relaxed until it got really busy for a short amount of time.
good,they were no advancements of moving forward no bonus with such a large company to work for when we all had a part when it came to saving the company money in purchasing drugs and supplies
good,Fun co-workers and good employee-management relations. Stayed over a year. Management is understanding. Room for advancement. Can work diffrent departments.
good,"Greet when you arrive, let everyone know that your there. Ask managers whats your task for the day you learn something new everyday you may be doing the same as yesterday but with a different product. Managers help you as needed, and check on you to see how far along you are before starting your next task. Everyone around the store has a set job to so throughout the day for others to take there breaks we switch jobs, The hardest part about the job is having to have so many things done in the matter of hours required, but dealing with the customers and managers and being finished on time is the best part about the job."
good,"I do enjoy my Job at Walgreens, the management strives to make the place a comfortable work environment for the employees and pharmacy, they give great benefits, profit sharing opportunities, and give you time off. The hours were flexible and good for me while in school taking classes for my soon to be career in HVAC."
good,"I love my job here, the only downside is the benefits and compensation. Management is of the norm. I wish there was more training and there is no room for advancement."
good,"Enjoyed my employment, managers were friendly as were co-workers. Only issue I had was my schedule. Forced into the night shift even when I stated that I was available for the morning shift."
good,"Walgreen has taught me be flexible, for they are an ever changing company. It forces you to think on toes. It is a wonderful way to gain accurate management experience."
good,"Fast pace place to work. I learned different kinds of prescriptions, also to eat healthy. Management was very professional. The hardest part of the job was seeing patient in pain. The most enjoyable time when I finished that day and felt I had learned a lot."
good,I was the number one upseller of donation dollars and candies every month at my store. Also was first employee to get employee of the month after the first time the store manager introduced it for us.
good,"My name is Kandice, and currently work at Walgreens as a cashier. My application for my pharmacy technician license just got cleared and I am ready to work. I am seeking a workplace with a great atmosphere with great workers who are team players. I am very good at my job and enjoy it. I greet customers daily at Walgreens and ring them out at the register. I get along with everyone and a team player. The hardest part of my job is dealing with customers during the holidays, but I make it through and make sure my job is done professionally. The most enjoyable part of my job is customers telling me they appreciate my work and time. They thank me and like to come and visit Walgreens to see how I am doing."
good,great company to work for worked for only one year. first serious job
good,"cashiering, working in liquors, and in the photo dept. stalking the shelves. "
good,I would go to work and fill prescriptions and deal with insurance problems all day long.
good,wonderful company to work for. constantly meeting customers and able to make a difference every day.
good,alot of phone calls and troubleshooting while taking car of patients. sometimes it is long hours with no real support to help you pick up the load
good,Major changes have occurred in the back office for Walgreens.  Majority of technical store and distribution support is NOW outsourced to a single third party firm.
good,"It was a learning experience the time I was there. I was a cashier first, from there got promoted for cosmetology. few months later Photo Technician.. The managers where amazing, they gave me the experience to learn and move forward in the company. The hardest part of the job was dealing with thief. I enjoyed every part of it, I am a very open minded person, I enjoyed my customers."
good,"Everyone is fun to work with and it's a pleasant experience. However, I am looking for a more suitable job for my lifestyle. I want a secure career and more experience in other fields."
good,"On an average day, I stayed busy and learned a lot from my pharmacist and pharmacy coworkers. The hardest part of the job would have to be time management along with managing patients. The most enjoyable part would have to be the interaction with patients."
good,I been there 16 months and haven't moved where I want to be so far. Plus they need to do more reviews so there workers will know where they need more improvements
good,I love this company and its benefits. They are pretty flexible with hours and with a lot of opportunity to get extra hours as well.
good,"Friendly and down to earth pharmacists, pharmacy tech, interns. I learned how to use NiaRx, handle the drive-thru, and counsel patients. Prescriptions were filled. Hardest part of the job is handling Mondays at the Walgreens I worked at, busiest day of the week as well as difficult patients. Most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you're improving the lives of patients. "
good,"As a service clerk, you are the face of Walgreens — the person who helps fulfill  making people's lives a little easier. Along with providing friendly, courteous and efficient service to customers, service clerks are also responsible for everything from cash register operations and customer service to merchandising, store inventory and maintaining store signage and displays. "
good,A regular day at work is to make sure the customer is always acknowledge and is finding everything they need. Making sure that warehouse gets completed before the end of the shift. Ensuring that merchandise is fully stocked. All managers are great people to work with. My co-workers all get along. Overall it is a great place to work in.
good,"i was an extern at walgreens i was put there after i finished my general studies in school to gain a hands on experience working in the pharmacy setting . my duties were to learn the walgreens computer systems as well as there protocals i shadowed both the leading pharm tech as well as the head pharmacist on duty. filled and filled prescriptions locked and manged controlled substances and handled the drive thru as well as the inventory of all medication .I talked with patience ,HMO's as well as Doctors to provide each client/patient/customer with the upbeat and proffessional customer service that our clients come to expect from all and any walgreens chain of pharmacies."
good,Being employed by walgreens was an interesting experience. I love the pay and team membes. I learned how to operate different machines and how to multitask under pressure. i wish that management was more involved with team members and courteous. The hardest part about the job was tryong to complete the job in a short period of time. The most enjoyable part about the job was actually meeting rate requirements faster than the allotted time frame that they gave you. I consider it a challenge.
good,"A typical day at work would be on the phone with different insurance agencies, getting claims processed. I learned how to process paper claims, and operate the retro billing. Management was not so fair at time, but management was fairly helpful. My co-workers were hard workers just like myself. The hardest part of the job was nothing. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning new tasks."
good,Walgreen's was a good employer to work for but the work/life balance was totally out of whack.
good,"A typical work day consisted of transcribing all new prescription orders, filling prescription orders, stocking new drugs, customer service and cashiering along with light maintenance duties if closing. I learned insurance billing procedures, how to work quickly with attention to detail, multitasking in a fast paced environment and HIPPA privacy laws. Management was phenomenal and encouraged all technicians and students to be our best. For the most part, co-workers were always positive, upbeat, and willing to help, some were attempting to intimidate the student technicians, this was on of the hardest parts of the job. The most enjoyable parts of this job were gaining the work experience and knowledge of the entire field of retail pharmacy."
good,"They don't pay very much, but it wasn't too bad. I liked it because the people were nice."
good,"I do not like being idle at work. So, I help other employees with a lot of their resets, and all my assigned aisles. Like what I said, I take pride in what I do and not do it just for the sake of it."
good,This is an excellent company to work for. I love to meet the customers and interact with them. Provide excellent customer service
good,"Overall was good experiences for me , Learned a lot great atmosphere , great staff. Really felt like a place where i could excel"
good,I would have liked to have stayed if my internship didn't end
good,On-The -Job training to initially practiced what we have leaned from the school/training center.Pharmacist were so helpful and working place is nice.The hardest part of this job is that prolong standing wherein it increases the probability to have a varicose veins.
good,Full time hourly position. Highly demanding hours. Retail - customer oriented. Must be good at multitasking. Strong knowledge base of pharmacology needed.
good,"It was a good place to work , benefits were good , people were nice you work hard it was recognized and hoilday was fair you work nights and weekends and that was fair too"
good,"Managed wide variety of customer service and administrative tasks to resolve customer issues quickly and efficiently.Stocked shelves with unpacked items, ensuring proper labeling in clear and visible areas."
good,"Busy workplace in the afternoons, enjoyable atmosphere with nice co workers, very good at accommodating for medical issues as well. Overall a decent place to work"
good,I did enjoy my time at Walgreens.  Good communication with management and coworkers made the workday less stressful.  The pay was lower than other retail jobs but I didn't have to support myself completely.
good,Enjoy my customer service role very much. Management is excellent. Team members are very helpful. Customers are wonderful and enjoy my service. Hours are flexible.
good,Walgreens is really not a bad corporation on they provide you with a nice polo shirt so you can look presentable when you’re helping customers because that’s the biggest thing assisting customers. make sure they have what the  customer need people come in there for one or two items daily and Walgreens is committed in making sure the decision that the  customer made to visit the store be the best Decision that they made long as committed and making sure that the decision that the customer to the store
good,"I absolutely loved my job until New Management took over. Very sad that I had to leave, but I will never allow my superiors to treat me badly without reason."
good,Love my job. So glad I accepted the job. Best thing that’s happened in years. Different outlook on working and life. I hope the advance further in the company.
good,"I would say its a nice work environment . The management is understanding and will work with your schedule. HOWEVER , holidays are mandatory! I would say if you like to work customer service jobs you will really like this!"
good,I was young but enjoyed working there. Clean and honest people. Relaxed bit fast pace work. Hardly stressful has awesome sales in the stores. Great job
good,"Relaxing environment "
good,"Working with Walgreen's was productive, the stock associate position was easy. Greeting and helping customers was a huge part of the job and that was the most enjoyable to me. Helping the elderly even the younger people find the products or merchandise they needed was also part of the job description overall the job was easy yet productive in every aspect."
good,"It's a nice place to work, and you always get nice and efficient coworkers. It is a clean environment  to work, you make a world of a difference to patient's"
good,I do really recommend working here. The pay is great and the job is not very difficult to do. The management could be better but overall this is a great place to work in.
good,co workers willing to help and train you on anything you need to learn . I've had  one co worker who's stuck by my side from the time that i was an intern until now .
good,I would refer someone to work at Walgreens. The company itself has a lot of benefits. You can make a career of it. All you have to do is be the best version of yourself.
good,"Pharmacy cashier basically means direct hitter, which means you are only ever in the pharmacy when they need help or if a pharmacist or tech needs to go to lunch. You spend less than 2 hours in the pharmacy on any given day."
good,A typical day varies due to different issues that may come up. I learned how to open and close stores also how to count down drawers and manage a store.
good,"You have to be able to think on your toes, work the computer system to figure out any information a patient may need. Greet guest and ensure they have a great experience."
good,"Hard work but it was fund to be around my coworkers. I learned a lot about being a pharmacy tech, as well as working face to face with customers and would work there again if given the chance."
good,"I started at Rite Aid which was fairly decent. But I felt overworked, was not given enough support while working. But as we turned into Walgreens I gradually saw major changes. I was happy to hear shift leaders would get a 2 dollar raise. But rite aid said we were in management but the money didn't equal out."
good,Got fired cause of driver facing camera.  Reached for cell phone.  But pay is great. Use rollers to unload at walgreens stores. Hot in the summer. Cold in the winter.
good,Walgreens was a very good company to work for. They provide health care and dental benefits after a certain time spent employed with the company. The management is very nice however the hours can be long.
good,"Working in a pharmacy opened my eye to many of the conditions people live with on a day to day basis. I gained a great understanding of medications, both in how they work and the effects they carry to patients."
good,"Walgreens was a really great place to work under the supervision of the old manager! But when you make a pharmacist a store manager with no experience, that became a problem! But other then that I loved the job! Really hate I left!"
good,A typical day at a pharmacy included handling the cash register; signing in/out prescriptions; filling prescriptions; entering insurance data; and organizing all medications.
good,"Great first job, or if you need a second job. Slow paced and certain locations but Enough service and duties to teach about good customer service. Pay is great for a young teenager or young adult otherwise become manager not cashier."
good,"I like the fact that they let you choose your own "
good,This job provided me the tools to be of more customer service to the public. A typical day would be going in and performing the task that were given to me before shift started and helping pick up the slack when my fellow co-workers needed help. Great job for an entry level individual!
good,An alright place to work but you have to have a very pleasant disposition to work there. Management can sometimes show favoritism which leaves you short on hours. Good job for high school grads or first job unless you have the patience and resources to advance to seniority.
good,"I love this company. Like any retail location, there will be the downsides when corporate comes into play, but no amount of change in policies or the flow of things has hindered my experience at this job. The management truly cares for each team member!"
good,"I really loved my job, its just that you hardly got any hours, no benefits for part time workers I believe but the staff was excellent.I would recommend a friend"
good,"Productive, extremely busy"
good,Walgreens is a good job If you are a college student or if you are still living with your parents or if you having someone helping finically. It’s not a job for a single parent of four with rent car and health insurance
good,"Almost too high of expectations from corporate and too little time to achieve almost anything. Giving your all is never enough, even when you sacrifice your health and personal life to succeed."
good,"I worked for the company for almost three years but after no room for advancement no matter how much I tried and applied and was told I would, I finally left right before hitting my 3 year mark. But the work place was wonderful and very understanding any time something came up for me and my family and always did their best to work around my needs, I just couldn't be stuck as a cashier for any longer when I had bigger and better dreams with plans to advance my life that they were just not open for, so I moved on but I do miss the job and the people I met during the job."
good,I haven't worked at Walgreen's long enough to give a fair opinion of it. From people I  have talked with say they like it and they have a pretty strong company. Good job stability
good,"Learned a lot about retail pharmacy. Didn't really get trained on insurance and how it works with the rejects reasons. The hardest part is understanding the insurance. Didn't really get trained, had to learn most of it on my own, when you ask questions they say your the technician figure it out."
good,"Overall good place to work at, great people to work with, the upper levels of management could use a shake up though, also without there being a union its easy for some employees to be ran over."
good,Great work environment and awesome teamwork and work community.  One learns how to deal with aggravated and struggling individuals.  Helpful and relaxed managers willing to work well with workers.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of running the register, cleaning my aisle, helping customers. The staff was very nice as well as the customers. I enjoyed helping customers find the right product they desired. I also enjoyed cleaning the aisle and making them appear nice for the customers."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of checking in and readying the shelves, making sure all products were up to date, and neatly placed in their respective spots. Warming up the photo machines, and checking orders. Greeting and assisting customers as needed. What I learned was how to efficiently communicate with customers, co-workers, management, and upper-management. The workplace culture was very professional, and all about health & wellness which was also a plus. The only hard parts to this job was working in the Photo Lab and keeping up with the daily changes and demands it encountered. Sometimes to the machines would be down and would take days before we could complete a photo order because we would have to wait for a technician to fix the machines. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers, and them leaving our store satisfied with our service! Overall it was a well worth it job."
good,"its cool as a part time job. i live in california so there is not enough money that i can make in order to be able to live on my own with this job. If you need something simple and part time, work for walgreens"
good,I love my job but like all jobs we go the our ups and downs I love learning new things and I feel my boss knows I learn fast it’s a great place for me but I will say it’s not for everyone
good,"There is always a task that needs to be completed or started , hands on training is provided, great work environment for the most part, clean store inside and out. Excellent management team. I currently work here as a CSA I love what I do and show up to work when scheduled in time."
good,I became a Registered Pharmacy Technician.  I love their training.  It was very stressful but I enjoyed helping the patients fill their medications and at times being a source of encouragement.  The hardest part of the job was the average handling time of 4 minutes per call.  I achieved it.
good,horriable management world wide I worked in many different walgreens and they are all the same managers yell at employees and don't even finish they own task but will belittle you for yours. Never had a day where I wasn't aggravated but what I can say they pay you that's it !
good,"A typical day at Walgreens was easy and calm. I enjoyed learning about how they counted for inventory, how they ordered the inventory, and seeing the customers every day."
good,walgreens is a great first time job for employees that are still in school and need a company to be flexible with school schedule. management communicate with the employees well about whats expected out of them daily
good,"The S.B.A. typical work day involves interacting with customers and asking questions to help them find the best beauty, skin care or grooming items.  I learned a lot about the need to have a SPF of at least 30 on your face daily to protect it from the harmful effects of sun damage.  Walgreens management is really good about promoting from within the company.  However, if you ever want to be the top manager of a store; then you will have to pass a test on pharmacy.  The workplace culture is wonderful.  It is about going out of the way to please the customer and giving great service.  The hardest part of the job is when people call in sick.  It makes it tough on everyone who works in the store.  Whether it is a cashier, photo or general help.  It effects the employees getting things done in their department due to having to help out in the area of the person who called in.  The hardest part of the job is unloading big, heavy boxes and cases of water when the truck arrives from the warehouse weekly.  The most enjoyable part about the job is the employees that you work with!  They end up becoming your friends for life.  This is due to Walgreen's having a low turn over in employees."
good,"considero que Walgreens es una empresa que da facilmente la oportunidad a muchas personas de trabajar, les brida la enseñanza que se requiere y el personal encargado, al menos de la locación en donde yo estuve, son de alto nivel."
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work, however, there should be more room for growth and advancement. The job is not difficult, and most of the customers are awesome."
good,learning of different medicines as well as needs of everyday household needs for individuals my age to elderly was very interesting. the job always kept me sharp on details.
good,"-Fast paced environment"
good,I would come in and start my day at the front register. Days were very slow because the store had recently opened and not many customers were coming in.
good,i was in charge of packing the cigarettes shelves and  the close shelves near by my register so i can see customers coming up to buy stuff.   You have to make  sure the customers are happy.
good,I enjoyed working at working at Walgreens the most because it was a stress free work place. The hardest part of the job was staying up overnight. The most enjoyable part of the day was lunch break.
good,It was a great place to work i just needed to make more money . so i switched to a delivery driver position at my next job which paid more and if i could have got more hours with the company i would have stayed
good,I enjoyed my 8 years at walgreens. Not only was my place of work but I made lots of friends and everyone treated you like family and especially through hard times. The work was straight forward and fair. Great environment.
good,"Would come in on night shifts when rush hour would start from 5-6 p.m.Customers treat the Drive-through like a fast food restaurant and expect the meds in 10 minutes. Really cold in the Pharmacy because of the room temp for the meds. I learned multitasking is KEY. People would come in and would they will be waiting for their prescription to be filled. One needs to balance the time to check and manage the 'Waiter's' script. The nights from 8-10 are the best times to clean and organize because it gets very slow. Birthdays are great, gets cake/cupcakes and holidays there are potlucks, gift exchange, and more hours from the holidays. The most enjoyable part of my day was seeing the insurance cover the medications that were really expensive and seeing the look on the customers face when they pay less than $20."
good,The job was very nice i just didn’t like how the manager ran the job it was no organization but i did learn a lot i became a people person learned to smile a lot and speak to every customer
good,good company to work if you like fast paste call centers the only problem is supervisors could use a little more feel of what being a supervisor is they need to be a little more helpful in my opinion
good,For many years I enjoyed working for Walgreens. It was my very first Job. I wouldn't have the expertise I possess now if I had not grown with in this organization.
good,"My typical day at Walgreens is me coming in to count and verify the safe, cash handling, and customer service. I order and receive vendor and warehouse shipment. I learn so many different things from my customers and their daily stories. My customers make my day. The hardest part of my job is doing all that I can and know that advancement is not available when asked."
good,Very fast pace.  Great Benefits and love the customers I had. Throughout a shift at the location I work you have to have on your running shoes. Manage the pharmacy as well. but most important making sure customers were satisfied.
good,"Day to day workings were routine however management encouraged us to find ways to make the job interesting, fun, and family oriented. I learned to build rapport and understanding customer needs."
good,Walgreens gave me the chance to advance my skills and knowledge to help further my education in the medical profession. The staff was friendly and welcoming and the customers were great as well. Being able to work with so many customers really made my job fun.
good,Working in the pharmacy was bittersweet. Being able to help patients with getting their medicine. The pharmacist are great. The hardest part of the was keeping up with filling all the prescriptions on time.
good,"It feels like I've known these people my whole life, we are very close at the store, especially with our past store manager. We help each other out, which makes the work space so enjoyable."
good,I loved working here it was a learning experience and I would tell anybody to go work there. they really do take good care of there employees and they know how to have fun.
good,eh o.k. place to work if you are fresh out of high school. would not recommend for a long term employment if you are older....................................
good,The time i worked at walgreens was one of the best. I really liked it there. Would go back if it was an option to me. Had a great team and never did I feel not showing up
good,back when they had a construction division it was a great place to work. the management would listen to advice from the workers. they had it where there wasn't that much travel involved with the job.
good,"I learned how to restock shelves, assist customers, follow directions, zone shelves and maintain an organized area.  I enjoyed the atmosphere the most. Staff was friendly and approachable."
good,It is amazing place to work if you have the right bosses. I have been with them for almost 3 years now and I have loved it for almost the whole time. its a good place to work but not for a career
good,I sorted pills according to incoming orders. Made sure that pill counts were correct and matched with the patient's name. Narcotics double counted for accuracy.Learned multiple aspects of a pharmacy technicians job. To ensure the privacy of patients names and drugs.Management was fair but demanding and the speed of filling prescriptions was emphasized.The staff was for the most part pleasant..The most enjoyable part of the job was providing services to the community.
good,"typical day, picking, and loading bakery items,no workplace culture,the hardest part is employees is too absents every day, always ,the most enjoyable is the CEO is a beautyfull person, excellent human,"
good,"Most coworkers were great, team leaders were very good teachers.  The manager (in training) at the time was awful.  He has since moved in.  The regular store manager was wonderful.  I really wanted to train to be a pharmacy tech. but could not satisfy the manager(in training) to advance any further than as a customer services/cashier, even with a medical/clerical background."
good,The work environment is ever-changing and evolving.  Some directors are willing to listen to what team members have to say and will take their comments into consideration when making decisions that affect them..
good,"Loved employees, very friendly organized place. Willing to work with schedule, flexible. Management was good, made it very easy to talk to and didn't have to feel nervous when problems come up."
good,"A typical day was nice I would greet the customers, sell products, and assist customers at check-out or finding items in the store. I learned that you can't please every customer no matter how hard you try. But don't let stop you from having great customer service. The management was great, they would show me feedback from the customers which made my day. Workplace culture was the usual getting along with co-workers and management. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that were difficult. The most enjoyable part was selling the stores products and being #1 in the district 3 times."
good,Awesome staff but management did not play there role in being management. The job is very basic duties such as cleaning and stocking.
good,"The ability and accuracy of transcribing and filling of patient prescriptions, verifying of patient information and patient insurance, along with professional customer service"
good,"Great environment, nice people. Having flexi-time really helps to create solid and enjoyable work life balance that positively impacts your work"
good,"Great job , just wish you did not have to wait long to be promoted, great structure. If i did not move i would have stayed with the company and worked towards my promotion."
good,"I loved working for Walgreens offer great benefits, co workers were very helpful and friendly. I would consider working for them again if I wasn't looking for a better opportunity and work schedule."
good,"Lot of job rotation at Walgreens. Moved around as photo tech to working the cashier to stocking to resets, etc. Kept most of the workers productive most of the time cause there was always so much to do. Managers were amazing, they always worked around my school schedule and were always helpful."
good,I was enjoying working at Walgreens. My co-workers were very friendly. I learned many things from my co-workers. Their management is very good.
good,"more similar to a hospital inpatient setting that is dispensing drugs from a remote location to the various long term care facilities, it can be fun most of the time, but the atmosphere was a bit too casual and unprofessional with a little bit of drama"
good,In my experience at Walgreen's my night always started off with a laugh with my amazing customers. my manager and I worked perfectly together. I was given a task and I put my 100% effort into it and keeping our store looking clean and organized. Hardest part of the job is advancement in your career as Walgreen's is not very interested in promotion of employees who worked for a raise.
good,A good start for college students. Was working there as a part time. The manager and the store manger were friendly and understanding with my needs. The co-workers were quick when working together to keep the store clean.
good,"Walking in, signing in , and greeting everyone alike. Filling prescription bottles, stocking and clerical. Very nice Work space. smile on everyone's face. Never a dull moment."
good,small place easy to run small team which makes work usually go by fast and at ease. Working with customers feels like a community. inventory payroll and sales are easy to maintain.
good,"It was a wonderful place to work, like a family. pay and benefits were  great! and nothing really bad to say except for the store mgr was not meant for the job! but they have fixed that issue!"
good,i learned a lot of my advanced customer service skills from this company as far as great training but not enough appreciation as far as management it was all about the dollar not the hard work employees put in.
good,I loved my time at Walgreen's it was a great place to work the pay could have been higher but the insurance was great and he Managers were phenomonal
good,I've been wit the company for about five years. This is a good place to work very flexible with my home life. the job advancement at this job is not so easy.
good,It is a great place to work if you need the job! The people are friendly and the location is busy enough to always need workers.
good,good company and job security but the hussle and bussle of retail was not for me. Half the customers hated you and it was mutual. Always wanted something free or discounted when they did nothing for it.
good,I was only there for seasonal purposes but I loved to work there. I loved working the register and stocking the shelves. The other workers were really hard workers but very friendly.
good,"Working mainly overnights, I had few problems with customer interaction or service, my co-workers and mangement on the overnight shifts were easy and fun to work with. I had more of a problem dealing with the leftovers of the prior shifts that got dumped on the minimal 3 person crew of nightshift that the 2 shifts of 8 to 10 floor and register crews either chose not to do, incompleted, or blatantly ignored on a daily basis."
good,"This was an externship as part of the schooling for Pharmacy Technician. Lasted 6 weeks prior to graduating from the course, pulled printed medication request, pulled that medication; made sure the dosage was correct with the printed sheet. counted the number of  pills required by physician, counted twice to make sure amount was correct. Printed label for bottle, and sent to pharmacist to approve and package for patient."
good,"After 6 years with Walgreens I became one of their top employees. There wasn't a task or situation I couldn't handle. Yes at times I was faced with difficult situations but I always handled them to the best of my ability. I had a really great team at Walgreens, I just felt like it was time for a change. I'm excited to see what else is out there!"
good,Working here I learned so much from  handling mutliple transactions to stocking and sorting everything that came in on truck days. I also learned that as long as you kept a smile on your face the customers enjoyed the time at the location that much more. Working hard at this company always paid off.
good,"A typical workday-highly busy"
good,It was a great experience to work in customer service and I believe it made me a better customer. I have worked at two locations with multiple mangers with different styles of leadership. It just all depends on your with ethic. I enjoyed challenging myself in suggestive sales and it showed me I could sale anything.
good,A typical day at work would be a busy day. Always lots of traffic. What I have learned from this company is how to make a big profit off of an inexpensive item. As far is management is concern. I love my position and I believe in team work.The hardest part of the job was closing because everything had to be picture perfect and ready to run in the morning. The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends with the customers/employees.
good,"Since this was my first job, this was a learning experience in working with the public. This was a great experience that I will never regret; the bosses, the co-workers, the customers ~ All very enjoyable."
good,A typical day at Walgreens is restocking the isles; helping customers find products; educating customers about products; teaching customers how to apply products; money transactions; inventory of products; and cleaning.  I've leaned how to properly dispose of a variety of products; intake loads off of suppliers truck through the automated system; train new employees; and assist with the overall appearance of the store.  My co-workers are pleasurable and friendly within the store.  Team work is key and we exemplify that trait.  The most enjoyable part of the day is making sure the customers are satisfied with my recommendation for a product.  The hardest part of the job is reaching the top of the risers to place products neatly because I am vertically challenged in height.
good,"I had the opportunity to practice and learn much more about pharmacy technician procedures at the work place, enjoy helping pharmacy staff and consumers. It was a great experience."
good,I started this job when I was a junior in high school and have worked them all the way up to now. I am currently a sophomore in college. The managers work great with working around your schedule and I have never once dreaded going to work. Friendly environment with amazing coworkers. I would recommend working here for anyone who either needs their first job or something on the side.
good,"able to learn more as opportunities permitted"
good,This was a great internship site. I learned a lot from everyone there. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. I got to see how bust it was and really enjoyed being there.
good,"Walgreens has been a good job for me, but is no longer fulfilling my needs. I feel that I am undercompensated and have more to offer than the position I am currently in."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walgreens, it was challenging but rewarding work. My main focus was customers and I really excelled there."
good,it was fun to work there you got to meet and communicate with peole visting the store
good,Walgreens was a good company to work for. Most of the work was self explanatory and easy to do.
good,"The best part about working at Walgreens honestly comes from working with the customers.  Naturally there are a couple grumpy and very unkind people that come in but they are far and few between.  The ""couponers"" can be challenging at times but most of them are very kind. Nevertheless, no matter what the customer is like I enjoy trying to make them happy. I try and treat every customer in my area like family and if they walk away from my counter with a smile on their face then I feel I have accomplished something."
good,"I worked in the Beauty dept. I spent most of my day stocking, sales, resets revisions, cleaning, recovery, putting up displays and filling in as needed as cashier.I was educated in sales and beauty products that I did not know anything about. Management was great to work with very employee friendly and worked with you with scheduling as needed. My co-workers were very fun and energetic and made the work day enjoyable.The hardest part was trying to make quota on certain sales and promotions. The most enjoyable part was the challenge of sales on a daily basis."
good,Great people you worked with.. The customers were awesome and understanding. It was a learning environment.
good,Everything I wrote in my previous questionaire goes  the same here;I have been a pharmacist all my life;I love people;I love what I do;I love to face what-  ever comes up with the best attitude and good  intension always
good,I really liked working there meet some good people was not a stressful job and was able to work at my own pace.
good,"Stayed very busy, learned to work in all areas of store, must be flexible and reliable."
good,I learned a lot at this job.  I was able to be the best at what I love to do.
good,"A typical day Walgreens for me consist of filling the coolers freezer beer warm juice toilet paper warm liquids."
good,"The best part about working at Walgreens are the customers, they're so happy and give you a great laugh every now and then. I learned great customer service but I wish they had better management skills, the managers are more like friends and not like managers. The benefits are horrible!"
good,I loved inter acting with patients and insurance companies. I always worked in Medical ins for PCP's and now switching over to prescriptions it was a new field to explore .
good,re-stocking items back on to the shelves and selling make up products
good,"I focused mainly on the photo dept but did merchandising, stocking, etc. I excelled in customer projects. My most memorable was spending two hours on the phone with a lady from Oregon who needed a collage of photos for a funeral in our area. She was so pleased with my work that she wrote a letter of commendation to corporate."
good,"Walgreens pushes their employees to recognize every customer/patient that comes into the store or pharmacy. They want to improve the well-being of their loyal customers and employees, and I think the direction they are going with the well-transitions stores is going to only further improve their brand."
good,I worked the photo center and would also work the front register. I learned how to handle people in different situations. My hardest part of the job was trying to please everyone and to remember to not worry about everyone else feelings.
good,It was a fun fast paced new learning expierence I learned how to work in the pharmacy how to fill scripts I was a manager and responsible for basically all store operations from money to face to face customer service
good,A typical work day was a lot of confusion. I learned pretty much everything there was to do at the job. Management was very biased. It seemed as if the managers would give you rules and break the rules themselves. Co-workers were very rude at times and always brought their personal problems and drama from outside of work into the workplace which I thought was very unprofessional. The hardest part of working for them was the drama that happened everyday. The most enjoyable part of Walgreens was meeting all the different types and race of customers.
good,"Walgreens   was an all around  work area. the objective was to learn everything there is to know either by, initiative or directed to do so. worked with employees with different races and different ages. very diverse, also challenging. there was no life balance tho. but very  helpful. I obtained a lot of information"
good,"I worked at Walgreens clinic for my internship when I was exiting out of my Medical Assisting program. I really enjoyed working with the patients and helping them with paperwork and questions they might have had. The only down side was I was not allowed to give injections. I was able to learn to collect specimens and run tests, as in strep cultures, and poke fingers to collect small samples of blood for a test something like Mono. It was nice being the only medical assistant and one nurse practitioner so we could work closely together. I really only did vitals and rooming patients and occasions do some test procedures."
good,"typical stocking job. had to restock shelves, cleanup spills, talk to customers and help them locate any items they might want, rounded up carts in the parking lot."
good,"Working here has been extremely interesting and well paced. I have enjoyed everyday working with customers at Walgreens and it is always great to see a familiar face come in with a smile. Helping people in the photo department is always an exciting day because helping individuals print there memories to share with family and friends always brightens my day. It is always nice being able to help people use the technology in our stores as well. The hardest part of the jobs is stocking the shelves, especially when you have heavier items to move but I get the job done and it makes it worth it in the end."
good,"Enjoyed working with the customers and helping them with pictures. I didn't like all of the drama between the younger employees and their personal lives. I believe that personal life drama should be kept out of the workplace. My store manager was a good person but not one that I trusted in confidence. For the most part, I liked helping people on my own terms not  with someone standing over me and telling me times up to move on and start doing something else Very rude."
good,I learned a lot while at Walgreens and I liked working with them.
good,"My day typically consists of attending customers with new prescriptions, or simply refilling a prescription that is already in store with us. Scan prescription on the computer, type the scripts out for pharmacist verification. After prescriptions are verified by pharmacist, I count out or measure out medication and label for another pharmacist verification. I learn different ways to override any insurance issues by calling insurance companies and supporting them with information on rejects from third parties. I call doctor's offices to request refills for patient prescriptions. And I provide customer service and information. I also order medication that is not in stock."
good,"Typical day was taking report and seeing pt in home care setting"
good,A good place to work. Management and co-workers are helpful and knowledgeable.
good,"It was a difference experience coming from a food service position. This job helped me become more customer oriented, organized, and detailed to patient sensitive information."
good,"loading all the products in a certain amount of time,neatly and secure"
good,"You are responsible for every aspect of store operations, which I enjoyed. Worked about 60-70 hours a week, and took work home often"
good,"Expect overtime on short notice. Managment in fear of making any decisions. Can't speak out without repercussions. HR is not for the people, only for those they are friends with."
good,i really enjoyed this job. everyone was always nice and smiling
good,Making sure all task were done in a specific time frame. Making sure that customers were being take care of and were satisfy with our services.
good,"A typical day would depend on what department I was working in that day.I enjoyed the front register and talking to all the people. In the camera department there was a lot more to do.I had to wait on customers,develop film and manage the equipment. I also worked in the liquor department stocking shelves and waiting on customers, and tending to the register. We had a lot of managers,with whom I got along fine.I think the hardest part of the job was when it got really busy for long periods of time. I liked all the people I worked with, but needed to find something more substantial."
good,I worked as a cashier but I wanted to work only in the liquor store and they vary my position
good,"Working at WalGreens helped me understand how the retail pharmacy setting works.  They helped me understand how to count inventory, how to fill prescriptions, what to ask when a doctor would call about a certain patient or medication(s).  The hardest part of the job was trying to understand the insurance part of the job, of what was all needed so the prescription(s) go through.  Management was very helpful in teaching me different things through out the pharmacy.  The rest of the workers helped me a lot understanding how the pharmacy was laid out in where the medications were and how they were put on the shelves.  If there was an oder that the pharmacy received I helped put it away and made sure the medications were properly rotated.    "
good,"I would cashier, stock shelves and answer phones, i sold tobacco products as well as make up and other household goods.I learned to be organized and to spend my time wisely, i liked working with my co-workers as a team we accomplished alot."
good, 
good,"A typical day at work, I learned more about the pharmacy industry. Management was okay, better at more stores than others. Co-workers were okay at the last 24 hour store located on Braeswood and Chimney Rock. The hardest part was just getting all the customers problems solved during rush hour and the best part was satisfying a customers problem."
good,"Great place to work also a great staff. I was able to learn quickly with excellent and clear instructions. I love the hands on duty, helping others in need. "
good,"I arrive at work at 0730 hrs. After I clock in, I begin my daily check off list, which is my chancce to note anything out of the ordinary. This is also my time to greet co-workers and customers of Walgreens which are also employees but customers to us (Asset Protection). Once I am finished with that, I may help out with the needs of the customers or investigate thefts, contamination of drugs, or whatever needs to be investigated. I learn new things everyday about the job; specifically the way people work. My fellow co-workers and myself work as a team to make sure all tasks are done at the end of the work day. The hardest part of the job is not being able to find a conclusion to a investigation and the best part of the job is seeing the satifaction of a customer when you have made their day go a little easier."
good,"This store was a very high volume 24-hour store. you were always doing something helping someone, there was always something new to learn and the older tech's were eger to show you how to do something new. The hardest yet the best part of the job was the customers.. They made your day "
good,The company was a good company to work for but what they ned to do is give there employer a rise when they are due for one.
good,"The third dhift does not give me the opportunity to work with other workers except the manager. I am left to do my job without much supervision and usually includes stocking, manning the cash register, cleaning and emptying the outside trash cans. The hardest part of the job is emptying crates on wearhouse days and the running the cash register at the same time because i am expected to have all the totes empty before my shift ends, but am usually held up at the register orhelping an employee."
good,I was hired as a Photo technician..we began the day preparing machines to take in orders..via..in-store..online or kiosk..it was the hardest because sometimes the machines would jam while processing a customers order and thats no fun at all!!..Because photos are very precious memories..that sometimes u just cant get back and some customers would get upset and some wouldnt....But it was also very interesting learning about photography at the sametime and getting to know some customers on a more personal level... I also worked on the floor sometimes stocking shelves..helping unload the delivery truck when needed..cosmetics department and being the cashier when needed..i enjoyed each and every position I was placed in becasue it taught me to be very versatile and very multi-tasked!!
good,"Working closely with each distribution Centers,"
good,i loved the fast pace of retail. The company as a whole was very stable and fun.
good,My typical work day starts with calling patients and reminded them about their prescriptions whether its picking them up or refilling them. Then I call doctor offices on behalf of patients and their insurance company for issues with their prescriptions. The rest of the day is spent entering and filling prescriptions. What I have learned from this job is to be patient and to always be open about learning about different kinds of people. The best part is the part about going to work everyday is interacting with my patients. They become an extend part of my family. The hardest part of the job is when I do not have enough time to complete all my projects for the day since it gets busy.
good,"worked overnights,made sure everything was clean and stocked"
good,• Effectively resolved third party rejections and other billing issues
good,"Excellent Team Members involved in daily Customer Service re-enforced my resolve to serve the American Public. Being happy, light hearted, and showing geniune concern backed by store knowledge can influence a customers demeanor for the better due to the good experience."
good,switch out old magazines and books w/ new ones wkly. This is an extrememly wonderful job for someone who wants to stay home w/ their kids but still get a little extra money.
good,"My job was to load,unload trucks and to pick orders,build skids ,put aways ,replenishment,clean exc."
good,A typical day at work was very busy. I learned to be thankful about my health that there are people out there that are far worse than I am. Management was good. My co-workers were wonderful to work with we all got along with each other. The hardest part about the job is that when we were short sfaffed and then trying to do everything by yourself. The most enjoyable part of my job were the patients that I got to know them and they knew me on a friendly basis.
good,"I enjoyed it for my extern site, was a positive learning experience, great staff."
good,"The pay was great, and the job was challenging but I'm a fast learner so I caught on real fast. I loved that I was a beauty advisor cause I met alot of people and suggested alot of products to customers the only thing about the job was the manager that was there but is no longer there was not very professional nothing was confidential but other than that I loved my job there"
good,Great place to work. Great job security. coworkers are the best ever.
good,"Counting safe.Check daily assignments. Check cashiers to see if change is needed. Work on tasks and delegate some tasks. Do refunds if needed. Help customers when needed. Scan in truck once a week and put up merchandise. Order assigned areas. Stock shelves if needed. Make displays if needed. Close store enter in cash drawer reports. Balance reports. deposit money. Walk store to see if facing is completed, bathrooms clean and floor swept and mopped. Lock store set alarm."
good,"I enjoy my job and meeting and greeting customers. I have learned every aspect of this company in the 27 years that I have been with them. Our staff is like family, we would give our last dollar to the other one if he/ she needed it."
good,"Meeting and helping customers, co-workers love their jobs, hardest part of the job is there is no hardest part."
good,"very busy,cash counts, pulling bins, running photo,help out in pharmacy if needed"
good,i counted inventory and made all the ordering on top of taking care of the customers needs.
good,Walgreens is a great place to start a management career. It is a great opportunity to strengthen interpersonal skills and leadership skills.
good,"Working for Walgreens is a fun experience for a typical day can vary by every customer that walks in the door. Based on that bit of information I have learned how to push myself to assist customers in locating items they are seaching for and being able to critically think to solve problems that can arise. The management and co-workers there are a group of fun filled, friendly, and driven people. Even with these qualities, the management has a way of maintaining the respect of their position. The hardest and best part of this job would have to be the customers. They are the hardest part of the job because it can be challeneging to make sure that everyone leaves our store is happy and found what they were looking for. They can also be the best part of the job because I have the ability to get to know them and identify them by name when they come in and know what they are looking for. With this knowledge I am able to create a relationship with the customer that keeps them returning."
good,"Good company with awesome core values. I worked in the pharmacy, photo technician, customer service clerk and floor, including cosmetics when needed. Not enough advancement."
good,"very busy envoirnment ,management was great and the co-workers wrer very helpful"
good,Liked working there just didn't like the way i got treated by some of the management people.
good,you will learn something new each day. opportunity for extra money plus base pay
good,Walgreens is a good place to work at. They work you really hard and they dont have enough help. There pay isn't so great either. They make you work very hard and they are not on your side.
good,"I worked at several stores over the many years I worked with Walgreens.  Lots of management switch-ups for various reasons.  Learning to work with different managers was a challenge, because some of them were competent and some were not.  A year before the start of the Rite Aid buy-out, they stopped allowing any hourly employee to have overtime.  Not sure if they were trying to save money, or it was just a coincidence, but as of July 2018, they still didn't allow overtime.  Uniforms are provided new once a year, and you may purchase more if you want.  The hardest part of the job was there wasn't adequate training.  Often times, because I had the many years experience, I was called to assemble a photo gift item because the shift leaders (2+ years on the job) didn't know how to do it.  I learned lots of ways to communicate with customers for sales and just general courtesy.  I recommend super comfortable and durable shoes as the concrete floors really mess with your legs, knees, and back if you have poor footwear.  Some coworkers even used compression socks.  And if they stick you in a room with a computer for new-hire trainings, bring a coat.  Almost every Walgreens office or spare computer room is freezing cold."
good,Finds items that’s in need. Staff are people friendly. Coworkers are cooperative. Everyone works together as a team. Manager helps motivates employers
good,"Wonderful company to work for, with plenty of growth within the company. Management, pharmacy,  and or customer service rep. Management at my location could of been better but non the less would happily work there again."
good,Great place to work. However growth in company is unlikely. Used to care about their employees more. Overall a good company to work for  benefits are also good
good,"Customers, which make my job more meaningful. You can start their day off with a Good Morning, greet or with a Welcome. It's a neighborhood! The attitude of gratitude helps me to help them"
good,walgreens is a good company for corperate offices. the stores is flowing with good hard working people but the hours stay cut and some projects is hard to complete
good,"I loved working for this company and I was almost always very happy at work. I was happy because I like to stay busy and there was always something to do. I liked how the company began something called PULSE where we had weekly meetings and staff was given a chance to feel more like a leader by being assigned certain measures. I hated the way they changed mangers with extremely short notice! I was ecstatic for several years then I got a new horrible manager and things went downhill quickly. I have never been the same emotionally. I tried to get a lawyer but nobody was helpful because the new manger fired me after convincing me not to quit because he knew it would make him look bad. They lost a wonderful employee to keep a cocky, inept dude."
good,"i learned to deal with customer service strongly people come from all back grounds. Friendly invironment to work at. The hardest was doing the totes when the shipping came in lots of totes and when you have to do new shelves and put on prices. the training on computer was senseless you could have a manager go over all those things on or after interview. I worked in pharmacy tech, in cosmetics department, in halmark as head of department did two walgreens location and work as a  cashier. the positive thing i liked was being able to transfer state and get rehired that is awesome benefit. also getting employee discounts and buying things on clearance was an advantage. I worked for walgreens about six years and the pay never impressed me it was a job to get by. "
good,Walgreens has been in my life for over 11 years now and I consistently go back as they are very accommodating and helpful. I am able to quickly get back in and make a pay check. They are always nice anywhere I have gone.
good,"Was a great experience met amazing people while working there and learned many work ethics. "
good,"On a typical work day. you never know what you'll come across. I learned alot from our customers and co-workers. (love, compassion, integrity, and great customer service)"
good,productive and busy especially on holidays. Be prepared for certain customers who expect more than what they are asking for. Make friends at work and be open to rying new things.
good,"The Walgreens i worked at was very clean and organized. When I was working at Walgreens I stocked, organized and cleaned shelves, I price checked merchandise, Greeted customers with a smile and offered assistance to customers. Also, I structured and organized beauty department. When I worked at Walgreens I learned new skills like patience and understanding. I needed those skills so I could better the customers service."
good,Face paced company with awesome team players and benefits. Environment is what you make it. People work together to get the job done. Most challenging part of the job was accomplishing company goals.
good,I loved working for Walgreens but to get around giving benefits to full-time employees only had part-time work. Both my managers were excellent at their positions.
good,"Great system"
good,It has many opportunities to move up in positions. The people are fantastic. Free meals time to time. Great snack and go. Freezers for lunches and microwaves. Local food stops
good,It’s a great place to work. I enjoy the people that I work with. They really try to work with my class schedule. And they have helped me learn about different things
good,"The Company was much better with better benefits for employees before the changes with boots. But for managers, you learn to dive into multiple projects and how to prepare for success by engaging with the team, the pharmacy staff, the customers and the vendors."
good,"I worked for Walgreens from 2005 to 2015; and during that time I had a wonderful experience doing my job, great coworkers as well as administrators; they did lots of training."
good,"high pace work, with responsibilities, and opportunities to learn and develop in the work place and personally. highly enjoy what I do and the employees I manage."
good,"You just have to bk to work, love what you do, get to know your customers and your co workers and remember that you have to do what's right for the buisness"
good,"I have worked in several stores and your upper management is what makes the difference for the team members to succeed or not. The company offers great opportunities, benefits including medical, dental, vision, 401k, profit sharing, grievance pay, maternity leave. Great employee discount program."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens consisted of ringing up customers and stocking product. "
good,My experience at this job was actually amazing I’m great full for any job I get at this age because it’s been very hard to find that job. I moved had unfortunately I had to leave the job because I wasn’t able to have reliable transportation.
good,I had a great time working here the only thing I would advise is that you should look into the neighborhood because Walgreens tends to be a place where everyone in the neighborhood goes to get little things every now and then. Most people come in for one or two things and then they leave. Hardest part of the job was dealing with unruly customers. Best part was working with my coworkers.
good,I have had a few issues with Walgreens but I think my biggest one was I was underage when I first started working there and they made me stay till 12 a night to put up tags which I thought was against the law for a Minor.  but I enjoyed all of the team members that I worked with
good,"Friendly staff, great management, not enough hours though. Maybe work 1 day a week. Always on your feet and are breaks were only 15 minutes and lunch was 30 minutes. A lot of heavy lifting."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens was opening the store delegating employees on their work task. I learned a lot on being interactive with people and showing good customer service. The management staff were not as supportive, made a lot of task very challenging. The workplace was always busy and there was always a task that had to be completed everyday. The hardest part while working at Walgreens was managing the employees. The most enjoyable part when I worked at Walgreens was the task given because I always like to stay busy."
good,"It offers good environment and benefits."
good,"I was a  beauty adviser and   had a great time working at  Walgreen's.  I worked hard and had fun too. Learned how to do reset and  set up  new product displays,  set circular adds and other promotional displays.    Got to meet some great people and make their lives  better and they  made my day and life better too."
good,This is a good place to work. Not very stressful and the pay is decent. The only bad thing is many times they do not have many hours available so just be prepared for that
good,"Walgreens is overall a great place to work. While working there, you gain customer service skills, learn where products are, learn how to talk to customers and much more"
good,"Very competitive, very stressful. I learned a lot and was looking forward to promoting to shift lead. The team I worked with,  made working enjoyable."
good,"Walgreens (depending on which location you are in) can be slow paced or fast paced. I have worked at a beach Walgreens and they are always busy which is fun because I work better in a fast paced environment and it makes the shift go by so much faster. The Greenville Walgreens I work at now is not as fast but they get a lot more photo orders than my beach Walgreens did and photo orders are fun. The management is very helpful whether its personal or work related. We really are like a family. We have fun, we have disagreements but we work together as a team towards a common goal and to deliver the best extraordinary customer care we can."
good,"I liked working there is was very different.. Management very helpful, teamwork wasn't always great but the coworker try to communicate with each other"
good,I love working at Walgreens and I love the people I work with. They are very understanding and caring. I used t0 hate the job I worked at I was over worked and it wasn't a good environment. Since leaving there and coming to Walgreens I have loved it here.
good,This was one of my favorite jobs. I loved being able to get trained on the latest beauty trends and tell my customers about it. Very fun place to work but ultimately left because the pay was horrible.
good,"Would highly recommend this company with flexibility and care for employees. Always something to do and very helpful if there is in any confusion with any task, also room to grow as move threw different departments wether it’s pharmacy or beauty and management."
good,"You get along real well with coworkers and managers. The tasks are not always to hard, and you kind of having fun doing it. The managers are very easy to communicate with."
good,I enjoyed working here because they listened to what I had to say and worked with my schedule until recently. Budget cuts and losing store hours hurt my motivation to work here.
good,I loved that Walgreens was willing to train me and pay for my PTCB certification. They gave me plenty of raises and opportunities to advance. My only complaint would be that there doesn't seem to be an attendance policy or if there is it isn't followed very well. Some employees consistently call in if just don't show up without any consequences.
good,"Walgreen's is a good place to work for just about anyone. The team is usually pretty well rounded and the work load is pretty lax, Most of the team members work by themselves unless help is needed elsewhere."
good,"Its very slow most of the time, job is really easy to perform, not many responsibilities, there is career opportunities,  they are very flexible with your hours."
good,"This is somewhere to start, but not stay. Too many managers. Lots of staff turn over. Management doesn't support staff. Customers are fist bumped for being rude to employees."
good,It really depends who your manager. They can play a key role in executing the company policies and procedures correctly. Unfortunately some store managers have favoritism
good,"-Very productive fast pace place"
good,Working at Walgreens was amazing it was relaxed management was kind and respectful. Even though it was a summer youth program it was a great experience for my first job.
good,"I love the customers, even the impatient ones, because I am reminded that the customers are always right and not everyone is against me on account of reactions. We all experience irritable days and misunderstandings."
good,"The hours were really easy and some days went faster than others depending on how busy it was, but if it wasn't busy then you would stock shelves or do you typical easy cleaning."
good,Great later benefits. Well learning experience. Discounts for better savings. Team and single off work experience. Environment varies depending on location.
good,"I liked Walgreens, sometimes time moves slow. I was always at the register and I never had a jacket so it will get cold to me very quickly.  I also heard that you were able to take two 15 minute breaks."
good,It was my 1st job and i loved it. They treated you like family and want to see you move up in the company. Some of the head people was Very Head on some things in the store.
good,I think this job was great I loved the Staff I liked the pace off the work and the afternoon schedule was nice.  I also recieved a employee discount at that store for my family and myself. Overall I would rate them a 4 out of 5
good,Great place to work when getting on your feet. nice enviornment managers are cool and work with you for hours needed to work. friendly team.great place to work
good,Very excellent company to work for but they need to pay a little bit more money from upper management to supervisors to group supervisors are very outgoing makes sure you play it by the books very knowledgeable as to the operations and willing to take the time out to train you right to become successful and get the best out of you
good,"I was on the fast track to become a manager, but we got a new store manager and everything changed when he came on board.  I still enjoyed working with the employees, but the new manager made things difficult."
good,"Walgreens is a good company that is very focused on Customer Service. By providing top of the line customer assistance in store and online. "
good,"I am a cashier"
good,"Working at Walgreen helped me improve tam work but most importantly my work experience. Overtime i became more advanced with cashier and stocking, keeping a organized clean safe work area for customers was very important to me too."
good,It was kind of hard answer a few questions because I was a student intern so we didn't get paid and we didn't have to stay more than three hours. However it was a great experience and I wouldn't mind working for Walgreens in the future.
good,Loved Working at Walgreens...Management was a little Shaky..Manager kept Replacing Supervisors..Tight Knit Store.People Knew each other.Well.Neighborhood Employees..A couple Co workerstheir 25+ Years.Store Manager was Prejudice...
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens. You can transfer from different department and they are willing to train and promote from within. They also offered benefits and a flexible schedule but not very good pay.
good,Walgreens was a relaxing place to volunteer at all I did was restock shelves from items from downstairs and to bring back upstairs. I re-put items up and moved expired dates to the backends.
good,Walgreens always worked with your schedule to the best of their their abilities and was always negotiable to new work chances.Management was always understanding for every situation.
good,Not a bad place to work. Lots of creative tasks involved. Management at my store was below average. Great prescription coverage. Other insurance wasn't good.
good,Good starting job with good benefits@ it's good for high schoolers and people coming out of which school but I wouldn't recommend this to people who are looking for a career
good,Wonderful working environment. Networking and providing customer service was what i loved the most. some days are slow motion but most days are fast paced.
good,I would say Walgreens is an equal opportunity workplace that does care about their employees  . But in certain departments the management is lacking the ability to work well with the opposite gender and therefore brings down the moral of the business however the management in other departments makes up for this and it is indeed a good place to work.
good,I definitely loved the crew that I had to work with no problems at all from them. The job is hard but you make it how you want it to work . Management they were really understanding and welcoming so I loved my job
good,"All about skin care for all ages, up selling and earning on commission getting to know what my customers like and need being able to manage time, helping in all areas of the store"
good,"I had a duo role at the store.  Cashier and stock clerk. Greet customers as they walk in the store, assist in any way possible and observe.  Restock the shelves on the store floor and restock cold beverages in the cooler area.  Sometimes relaxed atmosphere the night manager was great had a good personality."
good,"Learned alot about retail in my role here. Was fast paced and demanding. Definitely had my fair share of horror stories dealing with different personalities. But all in all, good place of employment definitely a resume builder."
good,"A typical day at walkgreens varies from day to day. Some days it is slow pace, and others days you will be on your toes. you will learn to manager your time very well working for walgreens."
good,There is never a moment where you are not doing anything unless you have finished all of your work. You basically do everything from being a cashier to working in the stockroom and doing inventory. It is a good job and you have a lot of opportunities to move up.
good,Customer friendly and detailed oriented. Must be able to multi-task. Need to be able to assist customer when needed. Always be ready to help your fellow co-worker when neccessary.
good,It was a nice job that got me through my senior year of high school as well as the summer before I left for college. We had a smaller team so it felt like a little family instead of a bunch of coworkers. We all cared and looked out for each other all while pushing one another forward to be their best in their role with the company.
good,i only left because my last boss lied to me about 8 days on and 6 days off for working the overnight shift. also lied to me for months about promoting up and kept finding ways to not promote. ironically shortly after i left he was let go from the company. i would recommend working for walgreens as long as you get a good manager
good,different for every store but you stocked and took care of customers then went to lunch then took care of your store made sure it was ready for the next day.
good,"I loved working here, I had given birth to my first child and had a really hard labor.  So I relocated to my hometown.  The management had exceptional management skill. He was respectful and wonderful at his job"
good,"I had a great manager who always made their team feel engaged and who advocated for the team at all times.  Long hours would occur, but it was like working with family and not an issue at all.  An enjoyable and productive place to work."
good,"I truly enjoy and love all my co workers, Walgreens is well known and I truly enjoy servicing the customers. Customer service is the most important part of building happy customers."
good,"Good customer service, management did care and made allowances and they have awesome customer responsibility...i really enjoyed working there and they were sympathetic to me and my situation"
good,a typical day at is you came in clock in and look where you are working and go to work. i learn a lot from how to do a passport photo to facing the store meaning fix everything the customer mess up. there were some very cool manager and there were some that wasnt so nice.
good,"I am in an entry level position - customer service associate - cashier.  Since my hire, I have visited several other Walgreens and I very much enjoy working in my current location.  It is a collaborative supportive environment.  Generally, we work as a team.  I really appreciate the corporate culture -- the outreach of the company in such areas as international donations for vaccines, immunizations and vitamins.  I also appreciate the opportunities to support community programs such as:  Red Nose Day, hurricane relief, and other ""causes.""  I feel Walgreens does the vetting of the credentials of these programs.  Through ""the ask"" process, I have had incredible conversations with Walgreen customers.  I see working at Walgreens as an opportunity to serve my community."
good,"My Experience with Walgreen's has been both Wonderful and not so wonderful. Walgreen's is great company, but the lack of advancements within the company is what makes me want to branch out into other career opportunities."
good,the pharmacy is a fun place to work and patient care is always important managers were awesome to work with and work flow was not to bad unless we were training.
good,"Walgreens was my first job, i very much enjoyed working on the register and eventually was moved to be a beauty advisor. Working at walgreens was enjoyable and I would definitely go back."
good,Good company to work for . It was close to home. After 9 years working there they offered part time position.  You received 2 raises a year. You received a cost of living raise
good,"It takes some time to learn the ropes but once you get use to it, it becomes a routine. Its a a fun place to work (if the right people are working). The hardest part of the job would be trying to do everything at once. Youll be running the photo lab when someone needs your help on the floor but theres also a price check on the register. with very little people working or not wanting to do their job can get frustrating when you are the one that has to do it all."
good,"I loved my job as a CSA, I got to greet people, help them find things they needed or recommend a better alternative. "
good,"Typical days included money handling paperwork and procedures regarding the store safe at the beginning of my shift and ordering money if necessary. Also delegated tasks to my team which depending upon the shift could include 3-12 employees, addressed and resolved any customer service complaints, managed vendor invoices and submitted claims, conducted scan outs and made adjustments to inventory/orders as needed, and entrusted to open and close store(s) weekly."
good,"I enjoy working at Walgreens I am just ready for a change. This is has been my only job I've ever had and I have been with the company for 8 years. Worked as cashier, the photo tech, Head photo tech, Shift lead, and tried for ASMT."
good,Sometimes there is a rush of customers and sometimes it is slow. There is always something to do if you ask. The employees I've worked with are friendly and nice. The management is usually easy to get along with. The store manager is willing to work with his employees to better serve their needs.
good,"stocking and customer service, checked customers out and managed cashiering responsibilities. this was a part time position only and I enjoyed working there"
good,"I'm an intern in the pharmacy as of now. Every one is very nice and helpful. Definitely a place I would recommend as a job, whether it's pharmacy or front the workers are very friendly."
good,"Walgreens was a very pleasant community, learned a lot of social  and stocking skills. friendly hospitality.I would without a doubt recommend. Great place to work."
good,I would recommend the training and atmosphere to any young person eager to learn retail and teamwork.  I was quickly noticed as a worker to get my work done in a methodical and mindful way.  I eventually was trusted to update inventory numbers and other tasks only management usually were only allowed.  My detailed tidy streak was beneficial to the food handling portions of inventory management.
good,The management would change every six months so it would change how everything was already so people would have to adapt to the new training they received
good,"I miss this job the most, it starts you off with terrific pay, and on top of that they are flexible when it comes to hours. Everyone was kind and cared about each other like a family."
good,"My time that I spent at Walgreens I would say was enjoyable nevertheless. I enjoyed working with a team and also helping customers out on a day to day basis. I would often restock shelves, coolers, and work the cash register as well. I would recommend this job to anyone, great experience within the little time that I was there."
good,"I love working at walgreens. I loved moving up in the company, i started out in the cosmetic department went to photo and did some work in pharmacy then I  ended up being the sim coordinator."
good,"The only down fall of walgreens is management keeps changing, lack of staff being hired when needed, they hire more for pharmacy than the front end of the store where they need it the most"
good,"They accept you no matter your hair color skin color or anything, the job is pretty easy, it is very fast pace but you never get bored. The coworkers are always super nice and while i worked there i felt as if it was my second home and second family."
good,Loved working here one of my favorite job pay wasn't all that great but the employees and the customers made up for pay good part time job for students
good,"Walgreens was a great place to work. You meet new people everyday. Learn some new skills weekly."
good,"This is unique to my walgreens, but I worked with the best pharmacists walgreens had to offer. This is more of a reflection on my boss than the company as a whole."
good,Had a good experience working here. Worked while going to college and they worked with my school schedule while I was in college. Overall a good place to start working for the first time.
good,I was able to advance through the company by the mentoring of many great individuals who took pride in my career and development. Great place to  work.
good,"The company lacks the hours needed for the man power to effectively do the work load, the staff at my location is friendly but tend could use work on team building"
good,Walgreens is a flexible employer that allowed me the freedom to work little while focusing on my degree and then able to provide me full time a employment as well as a promotion as a reward for my hard work and dedication through school and my loyalty to the company.
good,I loved working there felt like I was part of a family.  I wish I had never left.  The management made it more than a job on those days that just sucked.
good,"It was great learning experience working in Walgreen. I always wanted to work in pharmacy, learn about the different medication, and wanted to help the customer as much as possible.I learned a lot of skills like customer service, working in fast and stressful environment, and learned to work as a team."
good,Good work enviroment. Have room to improve the store but all in all it was a good place to work especially when you are looking for a job to start out with for basic skills and earn responsibility.
good,working with health and wellness products teach you a lot dealing with customers and learning products. you learn how to direct a customer to a specific product
good,"With as much as there is to learn, it can be a bit overwhelming to start, but once you've got a couple months under your belt, you know what is expected of you and you'll become comfortable with your job. I know experiences vary from store to store based on management and employees, but as long as you show up to work on time and do what's asked of you, you'll be golden."
good,I worked at the Cleveland Heights location and the customers love me! They did surveys for me which added bonuses to my check! Its all about establishing meaningful relationship with customers. I had a customer tell me that he travel 20 miles just to come to the location I work at because I was so excellent at customer service. I did my best at providing exceptional customer service. I've gotten the greatest compliments from customers everyday. They made me feel so special!
good,Walgreen is an outstanding company that offers generous pay and career advancement. but managers expect a lot from staff.  The people are friendly and support each other.
good,Great work enviorment.Great co-workers however management is very diffcult to work with.Manager takes everything very personal and is not flexaible with work schedules and has farovites.
good,"Keeping up with the whole team can be a lot, but at walgreens we interact with the whole team almost every day.  Making friends with new team members and having work celebratons was common."
good,"Chaotic but fun work environment. Be expected to fill hundreds of medications daily, and be self motivated to complete your tasks, come to work ready to do your job not complain to your employer."
good,Nice place to work managers don't do there job correctly... they have their favorites which I think shouldn't happen on a job.. Team means we not you and and associate... had a bad experience working at Walgreens but all of them not the same. Will I work for Walgreens again yes I will. I loved wat I did
good,Since day 1 on the job I have always felt like a part of the team. The managers and the other employees are always nice and very helpful ! I love working at walgreens!
good,"Depending on the store, can be very busy and hectic. With enough workers, there is optimal time to do everything. There is a steep learning curve with things you don't learn in school such as insurance and prior authorizations."
good,"The job itself was great, I loved my co workers and the monthly customers we're my favorite part. I did learn excellent customer service skills and how to keep a clean work environment."
good,Everyone is welcoming when you start working. Job entitles you to do the same things repeatedly. Over time come used to it. Great staff and managers are very friendly.
good,"I did a lot of different things, I worked the front and checked out customers and I stocked and the main thing was doing film for peoples pictures.  I loved this job the managers were awesome and the hours were great and I enjoyed the whole time I was at work."
good,"You come in to work, you meet with the manager you are relieving from past shift. They bring you up to date on current activity's. They then handover the safe keys to you, and you count the entire safe In front of the leaving manager. After, you then handout cash drawers to incoming shift employees. continuously listening out for call demands of all kinds. Give money exchanges and excellent customer at all times. As well, finishing the list of works from senior store manager before finishing you're shift."
good,Great work environment would go back if pay was better. management made sure the employees were first priority. true definition of a team. Made work fun looked forward to going everyday
good,Overall experience was positive as I learned new skills in a retail environment. Management ensured that my coworkers worked as a team to provide a quality shopping experience.
good,"Its a nice environment to work, nice team leaders and co- workers. It's easy to apply, have to pass an exam to keep the job  and keep with continuing education"
good,I really enjoyed working for Walgreen's. The employees were fun and entertaining for the most part. The management was consistent and easy going and didn't mind going out of their way to tell you that you were doing a good job. Unfortunately it was usually really slow and drawn out because of lack of business. My opinion is that they had horrible merchandising and the sale tags were hard to understand a lot of times. I can't even begin to count how many times I was asked to explain a sales tag.
good,"I enjoyed working at walgreens, but the pay did not meet my expectation. You can move up the ladder within time. Great job for entry level college students."
good,The store I worked for in Tennessee was not a pleasant place to work because of the store manager. That manager has since left and I am sure it is a much better place now.
good,"Management was rough to work with, working in the photo lab was my favorite part. I also put truck away every Wednesday, and had a flexible schedule. Some days I'd work in the morning, and some were closing shifts. I always preferred mornings."
good,"A typical day of work could be pretty chilled. Walgreens welcome a lot of customers daily. Pharmacy gets most of the customers on a regular basis. I've learned that every job is not easy. This is a retail job, so of course around the holidays it is pretty busy. The hardest part about the job right now is staying on task at all times. The phone constantly rings throughout the day and customers asks questions about various things. The most enjoyable part of the job is putting a smile on the customers faces as well as management."
good,"Was great place to start out and learn everything I could from pharmacy staff- helped with my future goal of being a mid-level provider. Understanding drug interactions, dosing and common uses of medications was very helpful when I became a prescribing provider"
good,"During my time in Walgreens, it was a pretty good time. They accepted me with no work experience prior to that job. The management there was a little rough. Management wasn't strict enough in my opinion. But overall the job was self explanatory & simple. Great for starting out."
good,Gained experience in medical field. I learned the fast past of the prescription world. I enjoyed the hours that worked around my children. The hardest part was when it was rush and you find yourself composing to maintain professionalism while customers lost theirs.
good,"The store I worked at recently bought out an independent pharmacy, therefore our daily fill was about 700-900 prescriptions. We balanced walk-ins, drive through, delivery, and immunizations. I was constantly busy, which I actually enjoyed, but it was only possible if the full team was in sync and making equal efforts."
good,Walgreens is a wonderful place to work if you enjoy working part time. If you earn advancement you will get the opportunity when there is space available.
good,"It's not worth trying to move up in the company because you always get no praise for the good that you do. The company does give you great experience in the pharmacy setting, but you will not make any money unless you are a pharmacist or a store manager."
good,"Walgreens Corporation is a major drugstore chain.  The organization is providing much needed medical services, to individuals and will continue to grow and involve according to the mission statement put it place by the founder over a 100 years ago."
good,"Great work environment. Made sure employees were trained properly. It was almost like a family atmosphere. "
good,"The store was usually very busy. I learned how to give great customer service. Co- workers and supervisors are nice, helpful, and sometimes flexible to your schedule. the hardest part of the job was cleaning and fixing the warehouse. The most enjoyable part was helping customers."
good,this was a good place to develope work skills. there is not much room to go up in the ladder but if your looking for something to make ends meet then i would give this company a shot.
good,especially holidays they are always open most likely you will be working when I first start here it was a blessing but so many things have change and its like the company don't care as much it was a family oriented kind of place but not now. Enjoy what I do don't get me wrong and my co-worked and management.
good,"The clinics at Walgreens are a wonderful way for patients who are ill can be seen quickly and efficiently. It is a more affordable option for those without insurance, and if they hired RN's I would still be working there."
good,Wonderful atmosphere for a job. Management is wonderful but needs to be a little better at scheduling and communication but besides that is great to work with. Co-workers are very friendly and it's like a big family that you work.
good,"Love working, very patient and friendly with anyone. Very easy work and was very self thought in makeup enthusiasm. Managers were well organized and very good at teaching."
good,"Working in Walgreen's pharmacy allowed me to continue honing my multi-tasking skills. Resolving issues in Medicare, Medicaid, and Insurance processing. Co-workers are helpful and nice, and working alongside a pharmacist is a good opportunity for learning. Hardest part of the job would be keeping an abundance of customers happy while working very quickly to assist them with their needs."
good,I have worked at Walgreens since 1997 I started out a cashier and then became an hallmark specialist after that 4 more years later I became a shift lead manager then about 3 years after that I became a assistant store manager which I am presently in this position now
good,I loved working here. Even on a bad day Id walk in to work and instantly feel better energy. This job has such a family feel.
good,"I had a great time at Walgreen's. If you keep your nose clean, you can advance quickly to store manager. They like to promote their pharmacists to District Managers because they make too much money, whether they deserve it or not."
good,"Also depending on the store manager and maybe even the DM are how the job cultures are created. It is the perfect entry level job especially for kids who are either still in High School or just graduating and need money. It doesn't pay well unless you move up within the company and right now, there are a lot of opportunities."
good,i liked this job a lot it was on the college campus and i learned a lot about walgreens and the company and it was great i was a greeter i stood in the front and greeted all customers that entered and exited the building and i was loss prevention sometime i had to stop people from shoplifting and do reports
good,Very busy all the time. Management understanding. Coworkers were fun to work with always had time to show me how things worked. Hardest part was trying to remember all the cigarettes people wanted and enjoyable part was the customers
good,"- Fun"
good,"Loved working here, for the past 3 years I've learned a lot about people. I've learned how to become more patient, more responsible, and I've learned to come out of my ""shell"" of shyness. I've learned how to print posters, make canvas's, and so much more. Over the past year I have noticed that the store I work at has become more a place where you have to be a favorite to get any hours or you have to be ""buddy-buddy"" with managers to get hours."
good,well a typical day at Walgreens . restock the store. and run the register . unloaded the truck on the truck day. clean up the store. answer the phone.
good,"It was pretty upbeat and fun but also very challenging. Overall, Ive learned a lot during my time there about customer service and management."
good,"Working in the Photo Center is really fun. I make all different types of things like posters, Canvas prints and wood panels. It's a challenge sometimes, especially around the holidays because you have a lot of orders to do in a certain amount of time but I love doing it. It's a learning experience."
good,"My 210 hour internship at the Walgreens pharmacy was fast-paced and tedious, But it was an enjoyable challenge. I wasn't paid so I don't know how good compensation or advancement is. I learned more from that experience than from all the hours of schooling put together."

good,worked here as a teen lots of people i worked with years ago are now in better positions such as managers friendly people no benefits
good,"I've learned a lot working for this company."
good,"Walgreens was a great learning, develop, and a well appreciated Job. Walgreens is a pharmacy/retail store which gives you a well round base of work skills. The number one thing I've learned in walgreens is Great customer service. Walgreens diversity co-workers are front cashiers, photo techs, stockers, beauty advisor, pharmacy tech, and management which.The hardest part of the job is not have the product the customer need. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and seeing the smile on there face when you help them. As well as building a bond with them."
good,"It's a fun place to work. Great staff. Something new everyday."
good,"Comfortable work places with supportive team members. Always fast pace learning environment, never a routine. Main task was, of course customer service and department sales goals but it also had a wide variety of side task including stocking shelves, and store maintenance. New management did change a majority of work environment causing a lot of confusion in stores main goal."
good,"Walgreen is your basic corporation.  They treat their employees fairly well, however they could compensate some of the positions better."
good,Learning new procedures in the field and applying learned skills in the workplace. Team members feeding off of the positive and disciplined performance displayed by myself.
good,"I loved working with people of all ages, and using the phone to contact people when there were problems. I liked help everyone with problem solving as well as problems with my Nurisu  printing machine."
good,"A call-center environment, you work at your private cubicle. Minimal supervision. Expected to exceed in your area of expertise with minimal assistance. No interaction with patients. Highly computer based position. Really good benefits, new facility, great co-workers!"
good,I enjoyed working for Walgreens. They were really flexible and I had enough experience to be a strong employee. Unfortunately because they were so understaffed I didn't get the training I needed to be stronger.
good,i thoroughly enjoyed my many years at Walgreens.  I enjoyed what I was able to do what I could for my patients.  I enjoyed watching my people grow and make changes that made their lives better.
good,I loved working here and shopping here. My co workers was nice nad my supervisor was a great person to work with. They took their time to teach me talk to me and treat me like i mattered. They was sweet to the customers and really kept the store net and clean.
good,Great management when I worked there. Had fun working with the employees. Everyone was super nice to me and all of the customers.
good,"I was an Intern at Walgreens in Long Beach. My Intern Instructor was extremely helpful and informative. A typical day at work consisted of me counting pills, answering phones, working the drive-thru, and restocking inventory. The hardest part of the job was learning the different insurance procedures. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers. I formed many bonds with a lot of them."
good,You really get a sense of togetherness and team. Good place for a start. And if you like retail. A good place to work if you are a tech fresh out of school. They work with you and teach you a lot of things

good,I started working for Walgreens as an entry level manager after completing my bachelor degree. I would recommend Walgreens as a great place to learn management fundamentals and operational management skills.
good,"I learned the importance of doing your part"
good,"Get in a little early, and get the machines are running at full steam. Definitely an interesting job, with quality checks on the photos that are coming in, and the customers usually like to share, if you are friendly, they are friendly in return, and almost always enjoy their experience more. If you are a steady worker, they have an inside advancement worth looking into definitely, and the management, both in store and district, are always open to suggestions or questions, or even complaints if they are serious. The environment is friendly, and just a little competitive, but no one hesitates to lend a hand when it is requested. The hardest part is definitely the annual inventory time, when EVERY item in the store, on shelf and in the stock room, must be checked into the system, but the day to day running of the store still continues. The best part of the job is definitely the people. Both staff and customers."
good,Co-workers are very nice and helpful. Management is focused on customer service. I can see happy customers all the time. they work like a real team.
good,I really have been enjoying working for Walgreens. I have been able to learn so much from my management to help improve my work experience. They have helped me throughout different aspects of my working life. They have shown me how to become a stronger leader. Walgreens offers good benefits as well as a decent schedule.
good,A typical day at work is like any other sales job. You learn customer service and how to manage inventory. Management is a hard job here. You must great at multi tasking. Be prepared to take on anything at any time. One day your co worker is you equal and the next they are your supervisor. The hardest part of the job is the schedule and rude customers. The most enjoyable part is the relaxed atmosphere. Managers and co workers welcome you with open arms
good,"Good place to work, can get crazy"
good,I recently just wrote a summary on this job like I said its an awesome job to work for especially if you are just beginning in retail u can really grow here
good,"A typical day at work is busy! Management is well up to part, and my co-workers are pleasant people. I must say the hardest part of the job is trying to please every customer. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you help satisfy a customer needs."

good,This job is very fun especially if your a teenager. I experienced some my fun and happiest moments working here in High School.
good,"Checking customers out, helping them find products (if not found, ordering the product for them), cleaning the store and stocking."
good,Both jobs focus solely on customer service. Sweetbay you get to work in all departments while tryi g to do your own job. At walgreens its about the same there as well. The plus side is I get to work with medication since thats what I went to school for.
good,"morning shift opening up the store get safe counted and ready for registers set up 5 min meeting,prepare TO DO LIST for the day..... The biggest thing a learned was Multi Tasking been able to get my assignments done The hardest part of my JOB is to get my TEAM to follow and believe we can get it done as a TEAM...."

good,Very friendly environment with wonderful management staff.
good,We had days were we were super busy and where running around back and forth helping customers look for the things they needed. We had to unload trucks and put the merchandise up and the shelves. The hardest part of the job is when you have to help more than one customer look for a certain product.
good,Fun place to work but it can be boring doing the same thing everyday
good,I was a stock boy who was given simple tasks and left to do my work once I understood what I was supposed to do. I ended up having a basic routine every day.
good,"A typical day at work includes reviewing kpi's, planning daily tasks and following up on execution. Delegating to employees and coaching them for higher performance. It also includes driving sales initiatives, reviewing financial aspects, conduct huddles and performance reviews and interacting with customers. The best part of the job is teaching my employees in order to make them better and assisting customers. The hardest part of the job will chasing metrics."

good,"A typical day at WalGreens on Essen is very busy and no-stop. But i  liked that part at time because it made the day go by faster. I learned everything i know by the Team Member and, they never minded helping one another. Great Team Work. The hardest part was working under staff, you would have to pull all the weight on your own."
good,Staff communicate very well. and the customers are friendly too! 
good,"During my Pharmacy Technician Externship training I would begin work by receiving prescription leaflets and I would then have to retrieve the medication from the pharmacy shelf and dispense it properly with the label and have it readily available for the pharmacist to check.  I learned how to package prescriptions, and dispense them, I also was able to understand the computer software system and was taught how to print prescription labels.  My co-workers were nice although very reserved.  The hardest part was adapting to the fast paced environment.  The most enjoyable part was completing a work day with happiness and fulfillment of my duties "
good,Typical day at work was going between cashiering and restocking items on the floor. The managers and co-workers were always helpful. The hardest part of this job was learning how to do the resets in the store. My favorite part of the job was the resets and customer interactions.
good,"A typical day at work would me first a quick briefing of expected goals for the day with your senior or supervisor. I've learned that  if you work hard you can move up in the company. The co- workers are also friendly and helpful people. I would say the hardest part of the job is to be able to please each and everyone who walks into the doors, but the most enjoyable part of the job would be to try."
good,"I have a bachelor's degree and I don't want to be working at Walgreens forever. It was a good experience and a great job for people who are starting out. I've worked there for five years and I carry on a lot of responsibilities. I am responsible and know what is expected of me. Unfortunately, there is no upward mobility and after five years of hard work and dedication, I barely get paid above the minimum wage. I get along with everyone I work with and I love being part of a team. The one thing I love most about my job is the people I work with including the managers. "
good,"We work in armony."
good,"Learned skills for Assistant Manager"
good,I LOVED working for walgreens. The pharmacy was extremely busy there was 3 pharmacist and 4 techincian working at a time. They filled over 500 scripts a day.

good,"Productive and Customer Service Oriented. I was a Customer Service Rep in the Beauty Cosmectis, also working the front Register."
good,The store manager I had was one of the best I have ever had in my life.

good,A days work at Walgreen's Mail Service is answering the phones and assisting customers with occurring issues and helping refill prescription orders. The management is good at helping the employees with information needed to assist the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is there is no one forcing you to do anything. Everything is laid out in training and you just use that information to assist the customers.
good,"A typical day at work starts with checking inventory and stocking shelves. The remainder of the day is devoted entirely to customer service and sales. The management that I worked with at my store I would rate as excellent and caring about their employees, my co-workers are always willing to help each other and fun to work with. I never considered my job hard and the most enjoyble part of my job were the co-workers and even better the customers."
good,"I started with Walgreens in Monument, CO and relocated to Greeley, CO after being promoted to the traveling reset team. The work was not hard and required a team effort to get everything done within the short period of time that we were allocated per store.

good,"You have a chance to meet different type of customers,"
good,Benefits were great but the work environment was hectic at times.
good,great company to work for. definately enjoyed it. learned alot about pharmacty
good,This is a company that sometimes is willing to help but there are others that would not and will drive you around the bushes specially when you want to grow up with the company. Managgement sometimes discriminate and try to hire their own race even if they know they are not capable of doing the job and that there is another person that is more capable but from another race.
good,"I work about 55 hours a week in a salaried position. There is no typical day at Walgreens. Daily, I review reports from previous days including sales, profits, scheduling budget hours, etc. I get along great with my co-workers and strive on providing a fun and productive work environment. The hardest part of the job is working the extremely long hours and getting one day off a week. The most enjoyable part of my job is the fact that it's something new every day and always a challenge."

good,"My first full time employment experience.  Many positions held in Walgreens.  Cashiering to retail and bookkeeping experience.  After moving to field service, learned much about equipment and servicing customers.  Communication with corporate and problem solving skills learned. Dispatching and learning our geographical area well.  Kept direct contact with store personnel.  Vendor interaction as well as shipping duties.  Payroll and office skills greatly used.  Keeping store personnel informed of service times was challenging.  Always good to hear feedback when service calls were resolved timely."
good,"If they would stop with the random drug testing, and save those test for serious accidents, they'd have more employees. Overworking all the good and permanent employees is not a good idea. Overtime ia good, but mandatory overtime sucks, especially when it's being posted at the last minute."
good,Really liked my job there. I left the company due to the lack of hours and lack of benefits. I needed to be able to support myself and my children. Was hired with the understanding of getting full time employment. Would have definitely stayed if they could have offered that.

good,relaxed and laid back place to work. on my feet the whole time. room to grow into management. different departments in the building. management is ok.
good,"Friendly, knowledgable staff which helps a whole host of patients out with issues.

The enjoyable part is the constant satisfaction of helping numerous patients throughout the workday."

good,I've been with Walgreens for 3 years and I absolutely love the company. I have worked at several different stores across the US. They all feel like family.
good,A typical day is always maintaining product on shelves and assisting customers. Assisting cashiers to keep customer waits in line to a minimum. Very high volume photo labs which were high priority.

good,its a great place to work you get to see so many happy customers and the coworker love to make the customer feel sweet about there self and the quality
good,I was given a chance to prove myself as a pharmacy technician without prior experience and learned a lot. I really liked it here the only con were hours being cut. It made the heavy work load that much harder to complete when hours were cut due to budget. I had to look for something a little more steady.
good,A typical day at Walgreen's was relaxed and fun. I liked talking with the customers and getting to know people in the community. I learned how to receive stock and place merchandise where it goes. how to operate the cash register. Management was great there. The hardest part of the job was constantly taking test by due dates. the most enjoyable part was the inter acting with the customers.
good,"I was a contractor so I did not get many of the benefits as the perm employees. There is an employee cafeteria on site that offers breakfast, lunch and snacks at a discount of retail. There was an employee store on site that you could purchase much of the merchandise available in the stores at a discount."

good,Very easy going work environment. Good ideal first job. Management is very hands on and helpful. The coworkers are very friendly and customers are typically very kind and appreciative of the services they offer.
good,It was laid back easy work but the only downside was I was let go due to budget cuts after being told it was a more permanent job but other then that it was nice working there
good,"The hardest part about the job was probably the rude customers, but that's it. Pretty solid and easy job with well rounded people. It was temporary job but I enjoyed it while I was there."
good,Walgreens was great to work for and I loved my managers and coworkers. Everyone was always really happy but customers try to use invaild coupons a lot and a few fake IDs but if you always card you are safe.
good,"It is very interesting working at the Walgreens - Mt. Vernon Distribution Center.  Work conditions are good and opportunities in abundance as a whole.  At the Department level, I felt we are losing focus in our role to support Inventory Management Team (consists of corporate supply/demand planners).    "
good,"Great working there, certain Walgreens are better than others, I was lucky to have had a great experience with my walgreens. Friendly workers and customers"
good,"I work remotely as a director for multiple regions of the country managing the day to day operations of all aspects of the retail clinic arena. Typical days include multiple meetings, frequent staff calls, preparing meeting materials, responding to multiple emails, staffing and scheduling and chart reviews. Balancing the multiple hats that I wear is the hardest part of the job and being available to answer the multiple calls at late hours due to the time changes is always a challenge. The most enjoyable part of my job with the one on one that I get to have when I am in the markets educating, spending time with my staff."

good,The store was heavily used as the store was open 24 hour with a Pharmacy onsite.  The functions of the Photo Department was my station and it was always a place of display and creations for any customer in any format for their pictures.
good,"Management and the employees are some of the greatest people to work with. Management shows compassion for their employees, always willing to listen and go the extra mile to help you."
good,Typically the day would go by fast and it would be relaxed. Although i was an intern the workers there welcomed me like I worked there for years. I can say the same about management. Even though I stocked shelves all day I went home happy that I met such nice co-workers.
good,"My experience working with Walgreens was always a good one. I loved working there, it was always fun and encouraging. There was always something new to learn. I loved my work family,"
good,"The coworkers are very friendly. Everyone was kind of like a family. It’s not very stressful most of the time, sometimes it can be a lot. The managers were very kind and would do anything to make sure you were okay."
good,Working at Walgreens was a fun experince. It was a recpectful and relaxed workplace. Management was well organized and productive. I met wonderful staff.
good,Getting to know  your fellows coworker very well. Having people come in the store from all over the county as well from all over the world. Enjoying the work that I do for our customer's.
good,"Great Second Job to make extra money while my husband was laid off.  Loved the management and staff.  Very diverse work.  Nothing bad to say at all about Walgreens, except the pay was minimum."
good,"Check customers out ask.  Ask them if they found everything they needed."
good,It felt like a family to work there. I honestly miss it sometimes. When I left the got me a goodbye cake.holidays we did secret Santa. Birthdays we did surprises. We dressed up in Halloween m. It was fun and loving
good,Working as a Pharmacy Technician has been amazing. I would recommend this company to anyone interested in working in a fast-paced pharmacy environment.
good,"A day to day there are smooth and easy. You knew what was to be done and when, it was outlined in a check list at your station everyday. One of the easier jobs to work."
good,"lack of career advancement, but it's a good starting wage if you're just looking for a normal retail position. it wasn't something i could spend my entire life doing, but i have no real resentment for the job itself."
good,"If you get in at a good store with a good manager it can feel like the whole ""work family"" sort of atmosphere and you won't dread going to work. If that changes though, you're pretty much doomed to continue the same level of efficiency with a quarter of the morale."
good,Everything is very simple and pretty much self explanatory. It s a calm and fun atmosphere to work in and it is easy to get alone with everyone you work with and everyone that comes in.
good,"The employee discounts were very satisfying. If you like helping customers and working retail then you will definitely like working at Walgreens. If you have great customer service skills, you will be able to help customers who come in and are upset or grumpy find what they need and possibly get them to leave with a smile on their face. Walgreens supports their employees in being safe in the workplace and caring about their employees well being."
good,"Great employees to work with, and the management is very personal and friendly. Management allows you to do whatever you want as long as the job gets done and great customer service is given."
good,"•	Provide technical and troubleshooting assistance to customers."
good,"Walgreens tries to authentically care about its employees. The pay was lower than the standard of living, but that's an American norm. Management and policy try to be ethical, treat everyone fairly, and meets the needs you as an employee have. (work-life balance, not being harassed about calling off.) "
good,Walgreen's is a great place to work. Working here you will be provided with skills to better you in your future. Walgreen's teaches you responsibility.
good,This company is a very good company to be employed under. They take care of their employees fairly well and the people you meet through the company are good people.
good,I loved working there. The hours were great and so was the pay. The people were all nice and friendly and the management was great. There was a good discount and good benefits.
good,"Walgreen is great because they have flexiable work schedules, they also offer advancement oppertunerties. Walgreens is a great company to work for and build"
good,Walgreens would be a great company to work for if they offered certain holidays to have off . It’s mandatory that we work at least two holidays . Xmas or thanksgiving . We open all day and do not close early . Also they days before the big holidays we stay open until 12 instead of 10. Every store manager and pharmacist & techs are off every holiday while front end work
good,"Work days would typically begin with a Shift Lead, Manager, or Assistant Manager giving a brief rundown of what needs to be done for the day and at what times they should optimally be completed by. Relationships with management changed yearly due to Walgreens' consistent Assistant Manager rotation practice, but otherwise, they were well off with Shift Leads. Coworkers were also very cooperative within the store as we aided one another in several tasks when we found ourselves finished with our own. The most difficult part of the job was setting up for different seasonal events as there would be items leftover from the previous season. I mostly enjoyed being able to work with customers who wanted to print photos of them and their families in an event such as a vacation or a marriage ceremony."
good,I enjoyed working there the only negative was I needed more hours. The management was very easy to work with. Any time I had a question or a problem they were quick to respond and always did it in a helpful way.
good,What you need to work at Walgreen's is a friendly personality and an affinity for interaction with people. It is a pharmacy but is also still retail so customer service goes a long way.
good,Walgreens gave me the opportunity to become PTCB certificated without having to pay for schooling. I love my fellow employees but it gives little no chance for advancement.
good,"Working at Walgreens is a very challenging job experience. I learned "
good,very busy place work like a team very helpful most pharmacists are very helpful great place to work definitely good place to learn ideal place to grow.
good,okay so Walgreens prides itself on customer service and they succeed at that but the thing is in the area I live in there's a lot of homeless begging and camping out in the area
good,"One of the pharmacists could really use training in communication with employees.  Overall, I enjoy working for this company.  I was welcomed with open arms when I transferred."
good,"Working for my pharmacist was amazing, I loved it there and had fun while having a professional relationship with coworkers and clients. manager always listened and respected your opinions."
good,I have grown in my ability to supervise and communicate with store personal and customers. I feel I grew up in my role as Lead shift with many responsibilities I encountered and it helps with the encouragement I got from my manager.
good,"Walgreens is a good company to work for and the pay is good if you're full-time. They only pay $9.00 per hour for part-time. Once available, the benefits are good."
good,Walgreens was a good place to work.  Everyone was like family.  But really no room for advancement unless you are with them 10 or more years.  No pay raises.
good,Love giving customer service. Loved stocking and resetting the shelves when needed. Loved the fast pace work. Especially when my customers knows me and appreciate everything i do for them.
good,"I worked for Walgreens in Baton Rouge, LA. My manager was easy to get along with if you did your job. I was a cashier there and enjoyed meeting new customers. I also learned to put up sales tags and do resets. I just really enjoyed working for Walgreens. It was a fun place to work."
good,This was a wonderful opportunity to learn management skills and to take on responsibility of many things at once. It also helped me to grow as an employee and learn to cooperate with other managers.
good,"Enjoyed working at Walgreens, relaxed environment but poor pay couldn't afford to live on that salary."
good,"Global merger significantly changed culture at corporate office. Most senior management was replaced. There still seems to be a disconnect between US employees and European employees, as well as processes/strategy."
good,"I owe Walgreen's my start and love for working in the pharmacy.  Between CVS and Walgreen's, I have enjoyed working as a pharmacy technician.  Customers may sometimes be rude and hostile, at the end of the day I am very proud of the work I do."
good,Walgreen's was a good place to work at for a certain amount of time. I was given the opportunity to grow with the company in different departments. The managers were great and very helpful with preparing the employees with new positions. They were very patient. The store manager did everything he could to make every employee feel good about working at Walgreen's. The most enjoyable part of the job was working as a team and the Store Manager made the environment feel like a family.
good,Love working there. The pharmacy manager was very understanding and patient with me. I loved the people I worked with. It made it easy to work in the place I was working in.
good,"I had to leave Walgreens because I moved away for college. The job was so interesting and I generally enjoyed every time I was there. You meet new people every day, but also have regular customers that you gain a bond with. The job was pretty easy, but I worked at a trainer store and I've heard other stores get pretty fast paced and have more responsibilities. Walgreens also cares about the well being of their employees. They were very understanding of depression/anxiety episodes."
good,"I got along with everyone that work there , but had to quit due to lack of communication between Management in day shift with night shift manager and there schedule that was made for Me. Went from night to morning, afternoons but to nights again , with a hour notice. Messing up my child care."
good,"I loved working here! It was a great environment, flexible and I was able to get two different types of job experience working in the pharmacy as well as the store itself. I needed something different for college, but this was a great job for anyone!"
good,"great help support for the pharmacy including support of manager, technicians, and cashiers. the system is always up to date and the drug inventories are always good on hands."
good,"Great job to work at, they were nice very helpful. Everyone have great attitudes I was showed a lot and was taught during the time I was there one of the best"
good,I was a shift lead and enjoyed my job. Company went in different direction as wants and needs. Became a conflict of interest to me. Depends what your doing it is a friendly atmosphere.
good,Nice place to work at. Great staff and management. Staff was very helpful and great at training and teaching when you first apply. Very easy going place can be very fast paced during rush hour
good,It was a easy slow paced and repetitive workplace but management was great on giving task to everyone and telling everyone how it needs to be done and right.
good,"If you're looking for a job that you only have to work for six months, or can easily come back to during school breaks, Walgreens is perfect.  Smaller stores makes for an easier time, and the environment is pretty stress-free.  However, if you can't drink the company Kool-Aid, don't expect to go farther."
good,It’s a fun place to work if you have a great team like I do we are like family. It is stressful though you always need to be on you’re feet. You don’t need to start at Walgreens to learn this is where you come after you’ve gotten down your skills.
good,"A typical day would be opening the store and tending to the customers at the front register. I learned a lot about public relations, and that the customer is the most important aspect of the job."
good,"cosmetics, cashiering, stock, customer service, great to work with the customers. hardest part of working the job was working with a manager that had a power issue."
good,"I only worked for Walgreens PRN during residency and for about a year after. I really like the company, and if I ever work retail pharmacy again it will be for Walgreens."
good,Love working here wish it paid better need more employee Passover all would do it for a living and staff is great Love the culture. Schedule sometime conflicts.
good,great place to work owners serve the Lord and know how important it is to keep God first very friendly and family oriented they are amazing people to work for for your own soul
good,"-Cashier, stock, patient advice, fill medication, drive-thru, do insurances"
good,"I lov ed working there, I like to work at fast and be around  management that treats you well! My co-workers were very great , if I needed extra lunch break which was very rare I could! What I loved the most was fast working because I don’t like moving slow ! Loved it"
good,I loved working at Walgreens. I learned so much in the short time I was there. The management was great they were always so helpful and supportive. The hardest part of the job was leaving. the most enjoyable part of the job was that it was always fast paced.
good,"Walgreens is at great company, very difficult to get a schedule change they value seniority. Great stock options and benefits of your full time. Great company to work for. But you willl Be required to work every holiday as a new comer for years because of seniority of other employees"
good,They care about you in a different kind of sense that makes your day run smoother its a relaxed and comfortable place to work. if you have the right team its like a family working together!
good,"This company is slow depending on the zoning. However, I've worked at several Walgreens and all of them gives the opportunity for high school students to get their feet in the door."
good,"There were many wonderful employees and managers, all willing to help each other.  I learned many things, how to work a register, how to use makeup and skin care and how to advise others on the beauty products."
good,Walgreens is a wonderful place to work. Working there comes with a lot of experience and a lot to learn. Each day is challenging but you can always make the best of it. Everyone is helpful and understanding.
good,"Working as cashier, I had the opportunity to interact with customers most of my shift.  I enjoyed straightening shelves, hanging signs, helping customers find items, restocking shelves and handling cash.  The environment was fairly relaxed and friendly.  When visiting the location where I worked, I find some of the same people still working there from years ago.  Good place to work."
good,Excelente relación laboral entre jefes de equipo y compañeros de trabajo
good,"Everyone working there cares about you, or at least pretends to. It's a small community and it's not hard to fit in. I had so much fun working there! I worked in photo mostly, and I got to be so independent and creative."
good,"Typical retail environment but has good perks for employees. Would recommend. Also typical company culture of key ""buzzwords"", etc that change but not hard to manage. Enjoyed my time there"
good,"I worked in the pharmacy for about 2 + years, that being the only place I worked in Walgreens. I worked here while deciding whether to become a pharmacist or a nurse and I did not become a pharmacist. I became a nurse, this job opened up many doors for me actually, I am very great full of it. I was not thrilled with it here and there and, the managers of the pharmacy were in and out constant relocation but I really did love it thru it all. I learned a lot, about drugs and I went to the school thru walgreens. I definitely take pride in saying I worked in the pharmacy thru Walgreens. the most difficult part is more of the work life balance if you become short staffed in the store. Other wise it was a great job they worked with my school schedule and all."
good,"I had just left a high stress job and needed something less demanding mentally. The Manager was willing to take me on even knowing I would take a drop in pay. "
good,Walgreens is a progressive company that is always changing. The company is consistently working to stay relevant and competitive (which is not a bad thing).
good,"pays more than the typical retail pharmacy. flexibility to transfer state to taste. pay increase every year. management is ok, very few issues. my only complaint was the wage. technicians should make atleast $15hr. Senior techs are paid well but most have been working for the company for over 5 years"
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Walgreens.  There were regular customers that I developed a relationship with. There were also new customers that needed to know where stuff was.  Sick customers were the worst; with tired, stressed out caregivers running a close second.  We got free flu shots every year.  I really built up my Balance Rewards, which we could use in addition to the sale price and discount.  And they sell some of everything so I bought all my necessities from Walgreens."
good,This job i learned how to be the boss pretty much. It was a good learning experience for me as far as being in a leadership position. It taught me a lot about how this company works.
good,Wonderful job. left to move to the Beach Me and a family member owned; I loved it but moved back for my grand babies. So we sold the business.and we moved back for the grandbabies.
good,"I worked in the back room moving items to there desired locations, "
good,"The average day at work includes the same daily tasks 7 days a week, mixed with challenges. Going into the holiday season, there is always preassure for higher sales. There are bonus' for store mangers based on certain metrics that we are always asked to focus on."
good,"I actually love working in the pharmacy of walgreens. It was always a different day, although, you did the same thing everyday, you also did it differently. We were always learning something new from one another. However, management wasn't the best. But then again, not all walgreens managers are the same."
good,"In the morning, I normally go in and restock ""manager's choice""(candy), hang tabs, cash out customers. The work environment is very cool and relaxed.."
good,"if you need to start some where, this is the place to start. I've been Working at Walgreens for 3 years now somethings I've noticed that it is quite easy to move up and management is excellent throughout my experience. Although the job does not pay well."
good,I enjoyed my college intership as a store manager. Learned every department and the history of the company. As an adult I still lean towards Walgreens than their competitors!
good,"As a heavy equipment operator, I would say that working midnights is the hardest part of my job.   I enjoy helping management and training people to learn"
good,The particular Walgreens I worked at was a  fun place to work. Everyone got along and helped each other out. We were great on customer service and management was wonderful.
good,I've been with Walgreens a couple of years. I've worked at several locations (I was a floating technician for a while). Every manager I've ever had is fully capable of their job. The scheduling is fair and always given in advance. The systems are pretty easy to use (though a bit old). I've loved every store I've ever worked at! Good work flow and structuring!
good,"A fast paced work environment. It was a very competitive workplace in the department that I was in. Hard work, very consistent. Lots of mandatory overtime."
good,very good place to work very organized in the lobby the stock room needed more work but the manager was direct. over all the company is very good to work at
good,Fue una buena experiencia de trabajo aparte de ser la primera.
good,"Walgreen's is good to employees, has good benefits and very nice management. Management will work with you on hours etc. Very fast paced during holidays. Only down side is always working weekends, hours worked can change from day to night's frequently and a lot of standing, lifting and bending. Overall great employees to work with and management is very caring!"
good,One of my favorite places to work. Good neighborhood. I was in charge of the beauty department. We were like a family there. Also was taught to run photo and learned how to develop pictures and errors with pictures and machines.
good,I loved working here a fun and enjoyable place to work at and the company is great and i loved their benefits especially their health insurance and their plans
good,"I really enjoyed my time there for the most part.  Unlimited OT available  Would have stayed longer but my father was diagnosed with terminal cancer, and i wanted to spend as much time as possible with him."
good,"Not much to say, the culture is the best part.  Walgreens is starting to turn it's ""customer"" based mindset into a ""guest services standard' overall, which can only mean good things."
good,"Was great but not my cup of tee not many hours were offered."
good,I enjoy the work and have a wonderful team. We work well together and respect each other. The only reason I am looking for another job is because I want to pursue a career in accounting.
good,I enjoyed my short-term temp assignment at Walgreens. My manager was not only employee focused. She had an open door policy and always made sure that I was happy and enjoyed my time there. I had a great time.
good,I really enjoyed working at Walgreens. The management was organized. It was clear of my responsibility. When ever I had a question the supervisor or manager were always available to answer my questions. The management was very kind the entire staff. The culture was good.
good,"I worked there through the school so the bus took me there. all I did there was stocked shelves, be nice to customers, I also Helped customers find what they needed. The management was really good. The workplace culture was really good. There are good customers who came in and asked for help and we would help them find that item. Talking to angry customers. Working with other people."
good,"Walgreens was a very good place to work at. The pay was not that great but was happy working 7 to 3 with Sundays and Mondays off. "
good,A diverse job working between the retail side of the company and then the pharmacy. I was taught all aspects of management good or not so good. I enjoyed that there was not one day the same.
good,They are very flexible with me while I was attending school. I just graduated and since then they have given me the hours that I want while I am looking for something within the field that I graduated from.
good,"after clock-in routine check to all department as far as photo, cosmetic front register and pharmacy. prepare price change and clearance for all department put merchandise up for sales mostly customer service."
good,I like working here. I have heard people complain about it. But it really depends on the managers and shift leads at the specific store you work at. The management team at the store I work at is great.
good,Great company but unfortunately elimination of title  occurs and I would not stay for 21 years of service if I wasn't happy. I am looking forward for a new beginnings.
good,"The pharmacists are knowledgeable about almost everything and if you are not they will gladly teach you what you need to know. Great atmosphere the only downfall is opportunities for advancement are slim to none. Also at the location where i found employment management did not take leadership roles serious and were always found on their phones, which i found to be very unprofessional. But overall excellent leaning experience for those interested in pharmaceuticals."
good,"I kept busy and going at all times.  I learned a great deal about the pharmacy and drugs and everything that comes along with it.  I was externing so of course they let me do some heavy work, haha, but in a good way.  Learning where the products were was not that difficult.  The hardest part was leaving for me, I would have loved to stayed on."
good,very friendly and willing to work around schedule. not much room for advancement within the company unless you're willing to dedicate the rest of your work life to walgreens
good,i loved working there. in my two years of being a walgreens employee i was treated fairly. they always kept my ideals into consideration. it was a pleasure to be apart of that team. i love all the employees and it was always fun at work
good,"not a hard job, my cousin and I would restock the cosmetics and beauty area. I dont know if it was because we were slow because it would take us all day."
good,"This company has had its up and downs, but I enjoy working here. Hopefully, once school ends, I can land a full time job at this store to further expand my knowledge as a staff pharmacist."
good,"Walgreens was a great place to start working and earn money to being living on my own. It had a great, understanding, and cooperative staff and was an overall enjoyable work experience."
good,The work environment is very laid back. The company really takes care of you when you're a hard worker. It's easy to relocate if you're needing to move so you'll always have a job. Last but not least the pay is better than most places in this field.
good,My experience at Walgreen was good everyday i came to work with a positive attitude and left with a positive attitude. but one thing i didn't  like a Walgreen is some tine i felt like i was doing more work then other but i never complained because i knew i was a fast worker and caught on to things fast. i enjoyed working with new people and i got alone with everybody i work with.
good,"Walgreens is a rather Friendly environment to work at, and many of the people who work there, work hard to earn their money. I made many invaluable friends there. "
good,I always had something to do which was a plus. I learned a lot in a short period of time. I always got help when I need it and it was just an overall great experience that I wouldn't trade for the world.
good,"honed my customer service skills.  "
good,"overall, this is a good company.  I was promoted quickly numerous times, and have a good time with my coworkers.  However, many people come and go, so we are often short staffed and over worked, and have random shifts."
good,"I liked my first manager that I worked with, the one who hired me, some of the managers that followed weren't too bad either...when the last store manager came in she seemed not to like me and made to find a way to get rid of me"
good,I Have met amazing people working for Walgreens. I really enjoy working at the cash register where I can interact with all of our customers. I love how they push strong customer service. My management is amazing. I do wish I had more hours.
good,"A typical day at work would be inputting customers scanned prescriptions so we could get their prescriptions filled and verified at a timely manner. I learned a lot about how much math is very vital to customers prescriptions and that there are a lot of steps that are involved with every prescription we enter and send over to fill. The workplace was always friendly, quiet and had a calm ambiance to it even though all employees were working in a very fast paced environment. The hardest part of the job I believe was receiving prescriptions that were ineligible to read or make out. The best part of the job was learning new skills, helping people with getting their medicines in a timely manner and working with the very kind and helpful staff."
good,"Walgreens is a good place to work at. I loved communicating with customers and making their day,  Walgreens is a well-balanced place to work at and would recommend a friend to work for Walgreens."
good,"Enjoyed the company very much over the 25 yrs. Great company for advancement within the company. Transferred many times, during advancement, learning different ways from different Managers."
good,It is a fast pace environment that is completely stressful. The management is not very helpful within the pharmacy and the employees are expected to do too much.
good,"Worked with my schedule, at times the customers tend to take advantage of the ""the customer is always right"" which is not the case. There are times when management is needing better improvement."
good,"I love working at Walgreens. My work is so rewarding to make people happy. Some things that I do on a daily basis are taking in prescriptions, talking to an insurance, and interacting with patients. The hardest part of this job could be remembering the difference between brands and generics, but this comes with time. Also, there is a drug system that helps provide important information about brand to generic conversions, typical uses, and side effects."
good,"the ideas are great but some don't make sense. I learned management skills in here, inventory and many more. I believe I could have been motivated if the pay was equivalent to job itself"
good,"Great Place to work, Management is workable, peers are truly great people there, The only con is compensation is there is nothing about getting raises"
good,If you want to broaden your work history this is the place to be. This job will opening your opportunity for many different jobs.  Give me lifetime friends here and also the customers are very pleasant for the most part.
good,I have been with this company for 4 1/2 years. I made my way to Shift Lead. Due to moving complications I had to step down. I was repeatedly promised my promotion and always lead on and let down.
good,"The company is going through major transformations, as with any company that merges. This is a plus for new team members as there are very few ""old ways"" of doing business that may hinder how you are able to stretch the boundaries of your work."
good,"Worked omly a few months, typical day at work would be working the register stocking as much as i could and helping customers with anything they could possibly need help with. i learned that not every customer wants the excessive help i tried to give them, i would still of couse respect that. Reading customers is very easy for me. Management was very professional environment. professional attire in which i respected cpmpletely and enjoyed. hardest part of the job would have had to be learning at the begining where everything was. most enjoyable was talking meeting with new customers, Making the experience there the best possible leaving them with what they came in for and in turn making their day better, and then seeing them again within the week knowing i went above and beyond , something they noticed and wanted to come back to."
good,A company where you have equal chance to pursue the job and achieve advancement. When working here in taught me so much on being a salesman and dealing with the problems of the public.
good,"Walgreens offers great benefits as a worker, have opportunities for advancement but hours that may not always work. If the right store is selected management teams are different by the store. Self-evaluation of each individual is preferred."
good,"lack of planning for management, but good company to work for.  Everything was up to code and worked accordingly but sometimes things do go unnoticed and never mentioned again."
good,"My supervisor was wonderful. The people I worked with were team players. This was a job I liked and couldn't wait to get to work in the morning. It was fun. At the end of the day I felt I was very productive and got the job done for the day."
good,open at 7am and started to prepare the store to open. checked out customers from open to shift end typically 8hr. day cleaned store and faced shelves when no customers where in store.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the position I held, was the one on one customer experience. We could get to know anyone who walked through the doors really well, this would help both employees and the customers find what they were looking for. We made friendships that will last a lifetime time with most of our customers."
good,"Working there was a thrill.  People were coming in and out all the time and needed help with finding their favorite products and brands, and help with pricing information which I was more than happy to assist with.  I learned how to attend to the needs of different people and what was expected of me as an employee.  My co-workers were friendly and remained positive with positive attitudes.  The job was full-time and I was getting alot of overtime so I had the challenge of becoming more flexible.  I enjoyed adapting to needs of this company.  Management was very understanding."
good,"Open clinics, prepared charts for over 5 physicians alternately on a daily basis. Cheerfully greeted patients as they entered office for check in, accepted cash, credit card and check payments for co payments. Input all insurance information for appointments while practicing HIPAA laws and regulations. Retrieving information from pt to physicians and vice versa as well as appointment scheduling with the best fit per pt and physician schedule. Nightly deposits, all other receptionist duties."
good,"8-5 pm in the front, helping customers to check out also to find what they need in the store, I was a customer service rep. The hardest part of the job was during peak hours. All the management was fair  & paience."
good,"Very chaotic place to work, but once you get the hang of a fast paced environment you will love it. The data process is very simple and fast paced way to fill prescriptions."
good,The company is really good with working with your school schedule if your a full time student. Its a fun place to work if your working with good people.
good,"Walgreens is an o.k. place to work I just couldn't stand my whole shift. I had foot surgery hoping to return but, it didn't happen. I worked as a cashier and I worked in the photo department both I enjoyed.I unloaded semi's when I was able. I liked doing different jobs. I lived close to the Walgreens I worked at so, I walked"
good,"The best thing about working at Walgreens was the people I had a pleasure meeting and greeting, each and everyday. I worked in a middle of Time square so meeting celebrities was really exciting. The hardest part of the job was working the over night shift and  going to school at the same time."
good,"The job was great, management needs improvement. They are really bad when it comes to scheduling and giving hours. I needed time off for school and they always gave me a hard time"
good,"Typical work day includes completing all tasks such as inventory management, late for pick up call list, filling new and existing prescriptions, processing insurance claims, and providing excellent customer service.  I have learned to multitask in a fast paced environment and also acquired professional communication skills.  Management I deal with is very fair and they have a lot of respect for their employees.  Co-workers show the same respect for not only management, but for other employees as well.  The hardest part of the job is inventory management with the daily volume of prescriptions being done and ordering several medications needed if immediately unavailable.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working along side my co-workers."
good,I love working here. I have the hardest job. Greeting and being the face of walgreens everyday. Learning everyday. I knew how to handle customers on a daily basis as well as complete tasks that were given to me
good,Good solid company that actually cares about there employees and customers. Fun while working and their managers are nice
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work especially if 1 is looking to advance. My location is very busy and demanding which requires patience and efficiency. The men and women i work with at every level are wonderful and are like an added perk for coming to work every. Management keeps the store running smoothly and always has the employees best interest at heart. The hardest part of my job is insurance and illegible prescriptions at times. I've learned a lot at my job including resolving insurance issue, deciphering prescriptions, medication interactions and laws, and customer relations. The most enjoyable part of my job is thinking that i may have saved a life and i enjoy the team I'm on."
good,South Texas Pizza (Domino's) was one of the more enjoyable companies I've ever spent time with.  Upper management including the owner would often stop in and see how everything was running and to offer any help/support needed to accomplish company goals.
good,"Walgreen's core disciplinary action lacks and not many raises are given but certain stores hold a very friendly atmosphere that is easy to adapt to and enjoy. The company's recognition of employee acts is something I'm quite fond. Employee of the month, some health benefits, customer surveys all get recognized but I enjoyed the daily interactions with wonderful and loyal customers. Not all of my co-workers were favorable but it was always just a bump in the road. Management offers a ""open door"" policy so that you can come to them with any worries that you may have, depending on the manager and how associated you are, it could even be non work-related. The days become routine after a while but I still enjoyed them and they went by pretty fast because of how busy the store was. The most difficult aspect of the job had to be once I moved to another city and I had to learn how a new store works but it was quite frankly boring because of how low traffic the area was."
good,"Walgreens has always been an amazing company to work with. A typical work day flows beautifully at my disclosed store specifically, management works great together. My co-workers have created a friendly, peaceful environment so work doesn't feel like work most days and can be very enjoyable. The hardest part of my job is not being able to fully help everyone to the extent I'd like, the most enjoyable part of the job is working with people who I can see truly appreciate what I help them with daily."
good,"There is absolutely not weekends free unless you request them off in the computer at the store. You get stuck with the same shifts every week that will make it harder for anytime to do things with your significant others. For instance, I have been getting a night shift on Saturday night time shift until 10pm then immediately have to go in on Sunday morning shift for 8am every week. It is getting quite annoying. I am on the market for a job that allows me to have my weekends off and work 8 to 5 Monday through Friday."
good,Staff was always friendly and positive. They handled the day to day work with open mindedness and a positive attitude. very welcoming
good,Working at walgreens was a good experience. That was my first time working in a pharmacy and dealing with customers with health issues and problems
good,"I loved this job. The only downside was that i was sexually harassed numerous times and my job didn't care at all. I learned a lot of patience at this job. Customer service taught me to understand kids and relate to them better. My coworkers were nice to me. We all got along like a little family. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to help the customers. To others, it may have just been cosmetics, but to that customer, it could've been their confidence and the world to them."
good,"The best part about a job are the coworkers, I love the management and the team. Working here is physically stressful sometimes and you wear a lot of hats. I loved meeting different people each day and talking to them. Which was the best part of the typical day."
good,"Great,easy job. It's perfect for a college student like me because of the flexible hours created by management. I would recommend working here."
good,"it was great I really liked the job, People were great management was cool they were not on different pages. Benefits were good specially with the investments of 401l"
good,Working at Walgreens gave me great experience with customers and other employees. It was my first job and i learned what to do if there was ever a customer who was not happy. My co-workers were all great and my manager was kind and tough at times.
good,"Work is good and I like the co-workers there. We received new management and that is going along well. However, I wish I received more hours during the week."
good,Great company to work for had a lot of up and downs but that's retail make sure that is what you want to do as a career. Some people at different locations will try to work you hard if you are a good worker especially being a ASM. Plus they will move you around a lot and put you in some bad store cause you are a good worker and try not to promote you.
good,"The commission for the company is great. However the focus tends to be on stats, and not the patients. Other than that, it was a pleasure"
good,"Nice management, very patient and considerate, mature and polite employees, lots to learn and do daily, busy store (Beaverton)"
good,"Loved being a Restaurant manager, It was a non stop job. Learned a lot about how to deal with customers and staff. I learned about teamwork, how to delegate responsibility and cook."
good,Learned how to input peoples info into the computer for drug scripts down to the insurance.  I handled the register rang and cash out. I looked for peoples picked up meds. Helped the pharmacy fill prescriptions did inventory. Always moving around helped customers with any questions that might have had.
good,The company is very good a making their staff feel like family. The hours are not the best but they will make sure that you get all of the hours you need to provide for your family. The training is great. The hardest part of the job is maintaining the store fully stocked at all times there is always a sale. I loved that the customers were very friendly also they knew your name that always made my day.
good,"My review on my job, in the location its in. It is an okay job. A normal day for me is busy! The customers are most times easy to deal with. I have awesome co workers. I believe if you can not get allow with the people you work with, the work ethic as a team would be insufficient. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing that when the patient leaves our pharmacy, they are happy with their service."
good,"Great place to work, shift leads are easy going. co-worker are always will to help each other reach production goals. Hardest part about job is standing for extra long periods of time. Most enjoyable is when our foreman lets us know we reach production goal early and we can get off early."
good,"I really enjoyed working with the management and staff at the Tacoma and Silverdale locations.  The coworkers made the store culture fun, team-oriented, and energizing.  "
good,"Did my internship there and I loved it, I loved filling prescriptions, restocking the medications, refilling the automatic dispensing machine and not very much the customer service part. I don't like the drive thru and inputting the insurance because of the customers faces staring at you like if you are just messing around."
good,"I worked 8.5 hours 5 days a week, assisting customers with shopping and operating cash register. I learned to do inventory, scan out ,and operate a telzon. Management was friendly and helpful ..Every one worked well together as a team, the hardest part was resets ,because the shelves were heavy and didn't always fit. The enjoyable part of working there was interacting with the customers."
good,I attend work and i am very puncutual and outgoing. I am able to multi task and have  learned how to do resets and follow the planograms. I have learned excellent customer service skills. I  have been taught how to engage with the customers and give them the efficient experience at our store that they desire.
good,Walgreens was a very good company to work for with good incentives and work environment. I enjoyed my co-workers and enjoyed working with the pharmacists. The environment was safe and welcoming.
good,"A typical day, arrived at pharmacy to received meds from wholesaler,check invoice for coorect amount of mediation, and other supplies received; if there is no customers; will start to restock shelves; call physicians for medication refills;start processing prescriptions left from the previous day;attend the register; process prescriptions left at drop-off;call-back to physicians; contact patients re: medication pick up."
good,"Great opportunities at Walgreens, fine company with great staff.  Some red tape but always willing to balance out to ensure end game"
good,"Great guest and co-workers."
good,Filled prescriptions and  called the Dr. for patient refills. Assisted the Pharmacist on keeping work area efficient and running smooth.
good,Working with patients daily to get them the supplies they need for their therapy.  Obtaining downloads from cpap machines and sending to Doctors.
good,"A typical workday involves being on your feet for most of the day assisting a licensed pharmacist in the delivery of pharmaceutical services to the public. This can involve preparing a variety of non-sterile internal and external liquids, suspensions, capsules, ointments and creams and dispensing prescriptions as well as Perform administrative tasks including answering phones, operating cash registers, and taking care of insurance billing."
good,I enjoyed working there and made lots of close friends. The job was easy to learn and easy to make rate. Has room to move up and nice work hours.
good,All I did was cashier and customer service. I enjoyed working with customers and keeping busy. I stocked every once in a while if the managers wanted us to. I really enjoyed working there
good,I enjoy the fact that you able to work independently and the environment is great. The management staff are always available for questions.
good,"Fast-paced pharmacy with plenty of room for patient interaction. A lot of responsibilities, but it is to be expected in our position. A lot of number/dollar-related detail focus for management, which can trickle down to staff pharmacists. Heavy focus on customer service. Overall an enjoyable workplace."
good,staff and company were great and helpful. pharmacists wanted to see you succeed and maybe get you hired at their location
good,This is a nice place to work. The people are friendly and the manager is most understanding. The only downfall is that the compensation is very minimal but the benefits are great.
good,"I learn to provide customer service in diferent departments (photo and pharmacy, Cosmetics). Would have like more opportunity to advance."
good,"Making reports everyday and helping team members"
good,"Great Managers,  I worked Part-time therefore was excellent they accommodate my needs,  friendly co-workers. Managers were fun and treat employees with respect."

Help customers, enter information and perscriptions into computers.Get perscriptions and check out customers.File filled perscriptions.Get medications and fill perscriptions. Order medications, Restock medications, clean pharmacy. help pharmacist with any other tasks. Count down cash drawer and close down pharmacy."
good,"The management was excellent at training personnel in all areas of the store, I learned positive customer service, operating systems, photo services and developing relationships with Walgreen's personnel. "
good,"There are pros/cons.  It is retail so you have to work most weekends."
good,"A typical day for morning shift is to make sure everything is ready for lunch rush; working at Burger King the customer is always right the most important thing is to obtain a positive attitude. Working closely with your co-workers is mandatory as well as listening skills and knowing how to maneuver quickly in an hectic environment. The hardest part when working in the fast food industry is to maintain composer to keep the team at a constant past. you must be able to stay focused especially if there is a mistake made. If one team member falls behind it causes others as well. Besides the fast past the most enjoyable experience is accomplishing the goal that was made to obtain for that day, keeping drive and front lobby hold time on giving the customer their food taking no longer than five minutes."
good,"Walgreens is a place where you know what you are suppose to do.  Everyday there is a list of duties you are supposed to complete with the help of management, and co-workers."
good,Walgreens pharmacy is a great starting point to get a feel for the pharmaceutical industry and discover the niche that fits best for each individual. This company was a great place to learn everything from insurance issues to how best to properly handle customer service related issues. The hardest part of the job is moving to another location and leaving behind the customers you have grown to know and love. The most enjoyable part is learning new things on a daily basis in various areas from new medications to new insurance plans.
good,very black and white. really no room to grow but very good job. the staff is more like a family but you must work hard...........................
good,"Take orders, process photo's, greet customers, "

good,I enjoyed working with the public.  Great supervisor and co-workers. Learned alot working retail and different departments at Walgreens.
good,Typical day was very tedious but not impossible work. I've learned to take my time and go through all the procedures making sure everything was complete.  Management was present but never overbearing.  My coworkers had a sense of teamwork throughout.  The hardest part of my job was trying to tell customers of new check clearing procedures we had to follow and or deny cashing checks all together.  The most enjoyable part of my job was being in charge of the One hour photo department
good,Normal  days at Walgreens Pharmacy are busy days. We take care of 700 prescriptions per day. We have great management and co-workers are nice and friendly.
good,Worked at various different parts of the store and learned something new everyday. Management and coworkers were always a pleasure to work with. The hardest part of the job was to keep up with time and plan out what tasks needed to get done as soon as possible. The most enjoyable part of the job was associating with the customers and helping them.
good,"This was a very good job! It was fun, fast paced, and everyone was extremely nice. It was a little difficult because I always worked the swing shift."
good,"I absolutely loved working with the clientele, some however could be very trying. New insurance with lower co-pays were always ""my"" fault...people just don't seem to understand the ""doughnut hole"" on their insurance. I always try my best to have the customer leave with a smile on their face regardless of the situation."
good,"There was a very friendly atmosphere at the store I worked at, lots of really great people in management. The people that you work for really care about you and will do anything to keep their employees happy."
good,"It was a great place to work. Management had it's days with the coworkers, especially when corporate was coming into the store. "

good,"	Greeted and assisted customers"
good,"Overall, not a bad company. Some management issues, but nothing that training our HR could intervene with.  I truly enjoyed it, with the exception of pay for what the responsibilities were.  However this was years ago and pay has rose 15-25%"
good,"I loved this job. My co-workers were amazing and management was fine for the most part. It wasn't until an employee became favored by the former store manager and was not reprimanded for his inappropriate behavior that every female (employee/customer) made complaints about."
good,"I came into this job as a temporary payroll clerk, but gained respect and trust from my employer. So much so that when my position was cut, my former boss argued with his supervisor to keep me."
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for. They really work around your schedule.
good,"Small medical collection and billing office."
good,"As a oharmacy intern, I have really leaned a lot from this intern site. My preceptor and my co-workers taught how to do well in this cummunity pharmacy, I enjoy the working environment most over here, and I the hardest thing I found was the internet system which requires lots of time to get used to."
good,"It was fun getting to know returning customers, being able to have their medications ready for them without having them tell us their names. Management was awesome as were my co-workers. Everyone helped each other and no one made you feel bad for not knowing something. I loved my job, even when customers would yell at me about their pain medications. The day definitely went by super fast, I was always moving. I just think that for the work we have to do, 10/hr is not enough compensation."
good,"A typical day of work was definitely an experience. I learned how to deal with different kinds of customers, also I gained retail experience. My favorite part of the job was ringing out customers and cleaning my department (Cosmetics department). The hardest part was what they called ""Tote day"" and that was where you get different bins and restock the shelves with products."
good,while i was working the day shift i love both the job and co-workers. My customers was wonderful. The graveyard shift I didn't like so much.
good,"I like working at walgreens but they weren't hiring. they had to many employees. I'm looking to work at a place with a friendly atmosphere. also, hard workers, I want to work in a permanent pharmacy. further my education when I learn everything at work. I'm not afraid to ask for help. I want everything done correct and complete before the end of my shift."

good,"I like working here, I can have fun while at work. I am taken serious. My boss and supervisors are caring and easy to talk to."
good,Looking for stability with in a job and they just cant provide it
good,"I had previously worked for Walgreens in a previous state and I absolutely loved it. Then I started working at the Walgreen across from UNCG in Greensboro. It was awful not only was the store manager unfriendly, but he was rude. Some of the people I worked with were a saving grace at that location, the rest of my co-workers weren't team player. I would never work at that location again. However I would work for the company because of the previous location I worked at before this."
good,"Since I've been working for Walgreens i have learned a lot from dealing with  stubborn customers to doing a reset. It gets tough at times but I enjoy a challenge. My co-workers are amazing, they always lend a helping hand."

good,"Their was never a typical day but never a bad day either. I learned how to interact with the public/customers from the good to the hard to handle. Management changed but always some one new to teach you something new. My co-workers were all different from high school kids collage kids parents and seniors.  The hardest part of the job was working with people and not getting personally  involved in their situations. The most enjoyable things about this job was the vast different that i seen on a daily basis, and the different areas to learn."
good,"busy days 8a to 10p. fun place to work, not much advancement, always advancing in technology inspiring better quality customer service."
good,Working at Walgreen's was a happy place to work at.  I enjoyed interacting with the customers and helping them find what they needed.  The job was mostly simple.  I learned a lot about counting money and making change.  The management was very respectful of my schedule.  All in all a great place to be employed.
good,I worked at a store that did 900 scripts a day!  It was crazy!  But everyone knew what they were doing and you were ALWAYS behind and somehow you made it work and make it happen!  I had a lot of fun!

good,"Good and easy going job. A typical day in the cosmetics department will usually consist of ECC, or known as excellent customer care, all day where I mostly assist customers and help them purchase and find products that they are looking for and help them find the products that work for them. I learned how to use a different POS system and how to use a telzon at work. The managers and the rest of the staff are all pretty easy to get along with and I never had any complaints. The hardest part of the job is when there are projects and you are in a crunch for time."
good,"walgreens was up beat. i rang  up customers. helped them find items around the store, i learned how to deal with different kinds of people and cultures. the managment was great open door policy. my co-workers were great always was a lot of team work. the hardest part of he job was doing the truck. the part of the job i enjoyed the most was serving the customers."
good,"Coworkers of all job levels are respectful towards one another which allows each workday to go smoothly. Since I've begun my work as a Customer Service Representative at Walgreens, I have learned little which has made it difficult to advance upward, position wise."
good,nice low pace to work very nice friendly co workers train you in different departments
good,Great place to work in customers are so friendly and management was so helpful. I leaned how to work the photo department and polished my cashier skills. My coworkers were very helpful and friendly always willing to help.
good,"I entered Walgreens during a very prosperous time. Overtime could be justified by sales and the financial compensation required 4 hours of overtime per week. The frequency of ""time and a half"" opportunities is what made the position attractive from the beginning. As with many companies, a downturn in the economy forced corporate changes. Overtime was banned. The position of assistant manager was dissolved and a new position created at a substantially lower rate of pay. A no longer honored court ordered parenting schedule  forced me to pursue other options. After nine years with a company, the outcome is a pretty sad state of affairs. Very unfortunate."
good,Excellent company to work for. Great employment benefits. Assisted new technicians with knowledge of becoming a technician. Pleasant and professional environment to work in.
good,"At typical day of the pharmacy is attending clients, processing the prescription and the medicament's, selling, cashier, customer service. I'm learned to processing the prescription, medicaments process, file prescription and others things."

good,"The people are always friendly and the work place is easy going, fun, and always interesting."
good,"Cashier, cash office, and pricing.  I worked well with my managers and co-workers, The hardest part of the job was not being able to speak Spanish. I would have to try and find a manager or a co-worker to help the customer. I enjoyed working in this diverse atmosphere."
good,"typical days were 3-10:30pm. I learned alot with the registers and photo machines. Management was ok in my view, there was not too much connection to employees with management. The co-workers were amazing, friendly and caring. The hardest part of the job really was nothing at all it was a really easy, smooth going job. I enjoyed my 9 months there."
good,"I worked nights so when i get there i gotta see what the morning person didnt do and finish up on that first.. and start covereing breaks and lunches and help in pharmacy if they need help.."
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for. They provide competetive benefits for all employees part-time and full time. They made sure that you knew your job in order for you to do it well and there was always an opportunity to learn a new position for advancement.
good,Walgreens is such a great company to work for. There are opportunities for career growth.
good,"Responsible for inventory and stock ordering"
good,"A typical day of work would start out very fast. The fast, busy pace is something I loved about this pharmacy. We would fill, on average, about 550 prescriptions daily. Throughout the six years that I've been with this store, I've learned so much about prescription drugs, their uses, and their chemistry/biology. The management was very easy to look up to, the Pharmacy Manager, Lionel was a great mentor for everyone he taught. After so long, I've reached a peak, and have no where to further my career. There are no positions available for me to grow any further with this company. The hardest part of this job was staying on top of the many problems that I would bring about myself to correct. In a given eight hour shift, I would fix about 3-7 problems, and take stresses away from other co-workers, mounting it all on myself. It began to be very stressful, though I would still complete every task. The most enjoyable part of this workplace was the knowledge and wisdom gained from other pharmacists, seeing how differently they would go about facing certain issues. There were times I corrected them about drug facts, and nothing felt better than being as knowledge-able about medications as a registered pharmacist."
good,I love people and I have the skills to get it done . I love to have a job that's rewarding . I hope that my talent and skill will help my job succed and others around me . I also love being a professional mascot ..

good,"I typically work 11 am - 6,7, or 8 p.m. as support staff to a Nurse Practitioner five or six days a week. I have become very adept at vital signs, computer documentation, triage of patients, marketing of services, and constant change."
good,"Everyday is an adventure. I've learned so much over the past 4.5 years. The management is ok, could be better. Co-workers could do a lot more then what their doing. The hardest part of my job is not having what the customers need in stock, they tend to become irate. I enjoy the people, I enjoy helping people."
good,a fun place to work. I had a good time work for Walgreen. The co-work made it a fun working place. You had your good/bad customers.
good,Love the people I work with but the company is all about making money and not so much as proper concern for the customers who keep them open and help to pay my salary.
good,"Everyone there is great to be around. They are helpful, cooperative, and enjoyable to work with. The hardest thing about the job is the customers. Sometimes they simply do not want you to help them. On the other hand, helping out a challenging customer is always gratifying. Everyday is different, not because of the work, but because of the diversity of the customers. Working in such a diverse environment has taught me patiene, empathy, and multi-tasking. Because everyone's needs are different you must also be resourceful."
good,I was cashier and I worked the floor. I stocked and helped customers with their needs. 
good,"I really enjoyed working here, especially with the little children and preparing them for elementary school"

good,"As a Beauty Adviser, I was constantly interacting with customers and advising them to use new products from store. Every month we were encourage to sale certain products and learn about them as well as new products. In returned we will gain commission out of it. The environment out here in Walgreens was very energetic and friendly. I remember every morning waking up feeling happy and energetic and ready to go to work, because I loved to express my ideas and use my experiences in the beauty department or any other experiences with other products from the store with my customers and co-workers. I had a strong and friendly relationship with my managers and co-workers. We all helped each other when we need it, and work as a team to help our customers who were in need. When I was in front of the store as a cashier, I enjoyed as well building up relationships with customers. Sometimes customers would come out to my register and while they were ringed up for their products, I enjoyed listening to them about their day experiences. Over the years in Walgreens, I built strong relationship with customers that would come up to me with problems in their life and asked me for an advice. Those are the moments when I also love to helped customers because they become friends and not just customers."
good,"Once I go into work, I start by a random inventory count, and price changes. After that I then walk the store and check the counts on items that are only ones, zeros, and overstock. My management team cares mostly about the stores image and maintaining a clean and organized work environment which is what I also like. My co-workers are friendly and always willing to help each other. The hardest part of my job is learning how to manage a staff that has been there for more then 15 years and are set in their ways. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a full shelf due to my sales and ordering forecast"
good,"I had to fill prescription, contact insurance companies, sell prescriptions, order and count product, input prescription information and personal information, clean and use exceptional customer service skills. The hardest part of my job was having to sell needles to drug users. The easiest part of my job was interacting with our customers."
good,I come in sign in and I immediately start entering prescriptions and counting. My lunch breaks were greats because the vicinity where I worked had so many choices of fashion and food crusine to choose from. I worked at a fast-to-normal paced until my shift was complete. My first 4 days I filled over 200 prescriptions. Evaluations were Outstanding rating outstanding and good.

good,"Work at Walgreens was by no means typical. I found the work interesting for the most part because I was always learning something new. At first my job title was pretty vague but I would like to think that it helped me grow in the job. I began working at the main register, then interacting with customers on the floor during the day, then I worked opening the store & unloading boxes in the stock room in the mornings, and then finally I became a photo technician. I became a jack of all trades, if you will. I learned a lot from working quickly and maintaining efficiency, to aiding customers whilst in the midst of all your other duties. I worked very closely with all three managers every day I worked and I had a great professional relationship with them in the end. My co-workers were really helpful and friendly and I was blessed to have their support. The most difficult part of the job was also the best part of the job, which was the amount of responsibility. I soon felt as though with all my responsibilities, I wasn't just any other employee but I was truly helping the store run smoothly. The most enjoyable part of my job were the relationships I formed, whether they were with the profoundly friendly customers or my supportive co-workers."
good,I enjoy working for Walgreens it has definitely taught me a lot from working there.
good,I started working at Walgreens when i was in high school about to graduate in 1997. I like working at the cashier and do stocking. the co-workers was always helpful too. Walgreens was my first job and i was glad to work there.
good,"Every day a dynamic variety of challenges,question, problems"
good,I enjoyed customer service cashier relief. Other employees were wonderful and management were easy to get along with. The company had alot of products that catered to the tourist industry of Sedona.
good,I really enjoyed the environment at Walgreen's. The Pharmacist supervising me fantastic. She made sure that I got what I needed of my externship.
good,"I mostly worked on checking and fixing inventory counts. I would also help customers when they asked for help, and I knew where every item in the store was located. My manager was awesome and my co-workers were just as great."
good,always challenging
good,I am a people person. I want to make a difference in someone's life. I feel I am not able to advance in my position or life working in retail.
good,I typical day at work was filled with things to do. Staff quickly became trustworthy because we completed projects together. Managers were sure to thank their staff once a project was complete. There was never a dull moment so it made time fly. A great thing about getting your check was that there was always a little extra because we would get a small commission on items of the month. The only hard part of the job was putting all the small items away. Other than that this Walgreens was a close group of people and we all worked very well together so it was a joy to come into work.
good,i love to work in places where i can grow in the company. the people you meet on a day to day bases are enjoyable to come accross. i loved working at walgreens.
good,"Assisted customers with final selections of the day. To always be polite no matter what the situation may be. Management is very reliable willing to help you when your lost or need help with something. my co-workers were friendly,helpful and understanding.the hardest part was dealing with Irate Customers.helping Customers and being friendly no matter what."
good,"Assists the pharmacist by performing administrative and routine task , including 3 rd party billing, inventory control , assisting patients needs, cash/credit handling"
good,I learned a lot here and met some really great people. Walgreens helped me to work efficiently in a fast-paced environment. It also thought me patience and better customer service/communication skills
good,Very professional and very clean. It's nice to work for a giant company that offers benefits and hours.
good,"A typical work day would start off with me writing notes, walking my store and checking my schedule to ensure I have coverage and what time to expect them. As a store manager, I am there to train and manage all my staff so they will know my expectations on a day to day basis. After walking the entire store, I would walk with my executive assistant or an assistant manager to make sure they understand my notes. I would then check my email and send all recaps before the deadline, complete my groups sheets/ad bulletins (ordering sheets for the store) and making sure that all notes were completed the night before. I'd check on my vendor purchases to see if more or needed and I look up within other districts to see what's hot and could possibly a nice seller for my store. I would do schedules if needed and then check in with all employees making sure they are completing the notes as well as helping customers. I would have a ten minute meeting to give my employees praises to acknowledge how they did as for customer praises and receipt surveys. I meet with The hardest part of the job I would say is to try and change old employees and get them use to how the company is changing in this day in age. There are a lot of employees that have been around long, so they have a hard time adapting to change. I enjoy eveyday teaching my staff new programs and how to get better with certain projects. I also enjoy pleasing my customers on a day to day basis...and listening to their comments about the store and their experience."
good,Good place to work
good,"Good work group in a retail environment. Fast paced, many customers to take care of."
good,This particular job was my externship. I was able to learn new skills.
good,Walgreens was also a very good job and I learned so much in that field. I had amazing co-workers who were like family to me and they were also very flexible with scheduling me around with school. The store that I worked at was very busy and at times would be overwhelming.
good,"I worked for Walgreen's in total for nearly seven years. I absolutely loved it until the economy crash hit. It was like they were not sure how to react. Then the Obama care hit and it through the company into a panic it seemed. Business structure kept changing and positions kept being eliminated. The changes would not have been bad if I were a single woman, but being a mother of five, it became more and more difficult to maintain a balance between home and work. Work eventually came in direct conflict to my family life and I had to resign."
good,Have work this company before.i was a cashier and stocker like it very much.manager was great to work with.good work atmosphere. Had good relationship workers and staff
good,Walgreens is a very good job but there hours could be better that’s the only problem you would wish you could have more hours but for the most part the work place is very great
good,"It is a good place to work especially if you in the transition from school to real-life work, I was very content with the company I can Complaint."
good,"Working in this company helped me grow. Working here I was able to learn new things and be reminded that if I needed help , there was always a helping hand. The bad about working here was we were very understaffed. I personally didn’t mind being on register because I like to interact with customers and give them a good experience. Being understaffed isn’t fair when you have one cashier and one person on the floor doing a task th at is assigned to them."
good,I know if I was still a resident of Florida they would love to have me back as an employee. I enjoyed working for Walgreens. I was dedicated and loved the environment. I also learned alot about make up and other products as a beauty advisor.
good,"Working for Walgreens taught me so much, I genuinely loved this job and there is so much opportunity for growth within this business. Highly recommend without a doubt."
good,"Typical day consisted of either being cashier or being on the floor, and either one had to talk with customers to enjoy a friendly and supportive environment for everyone there. As long as you can act friendly, the overall job was very easy."
good,Walgreens provides a flexible work schedule and I enjoy all of my coworkers. Everyone is very friendly. My typical day at work takes me all around the pharmacy from filling prescriptions to working in the drive thru.
good,"I learned in order to be effective and productive within a workplace, I must communicate within my team. I was able to engage in a plan to maintain an organized workplace and helped to develop employees working habits, communications, and efficiency."
good,This company cares about our opinions on what’s working and what is not. Our engagement while working with other teams and management is to keep us encouraged by helping each other with customer care.
good,I worked at Walgreens for the summer. It was near my house so I was always on time and ready to work everyday. The people that worked in Walgreens where very friendly and welcoming as well.
good,It was an ok job I hate obtained this job throu workability and look forward to other jobs there a lot nice people and were very understanding for when I'm not able to go to work
good,Great place to work. Friendly staff. Lots of challenging things to do while working there. Have to be patient with rude customers. Learn to balance your tasks.

good,I really enjoy working at walgreens. The managers and assistant managers are awesome. It is a busy location but it doesnt feel like work because the managers make it fun.
good,"Working at walgreens I learned about organizing and maintaining a clean area, I also learned on how to help customers and many other great things. Such as greeting customers correctly and also helping people with their needs no matter what."
good,"Flexible"
good,"A great global organization, and a really great company to be a part of.  They have an excellent record of associates growing into higher level positions."
good,"Great work day, usually busy with customers ready to begin shopping the second we open. Busy until like 6/7 pm then the traffic begins to die down. Most nights short staffed, constant IC3"
good,Walgreens provides adequate training and disciples as fit. They do not discriminate. Scheduling arranged due to life events. Comparable benefits. Management follows company codes.
good,I was only there for a month as a intern but I had a nice time. The management was always very kind. I would like to work there again part time if possible
good,i honesty had a good time at walgreen even when the people giving me a hard or the other employee when giving me head arch and it was not  really slow and not to fast
good,Fun environment. You are responsible for many things. Some shift leads do not help. The hours at times can be flexible. you have to be assertive while working there.
good,"When a long term employee makes "
good,"Objective:"
good,Working for this company is a learning process. But seeking to grow and further pursue my skills. Looking to advance with a company who will offer an opportunity.
good,"I worked as an intern for a limited time but it is a good place to work, not that stressful and the staff is great. I learned a lot from working there and the majority of the customers that I assisted are very nice. Good for first job experience."
good,"It’s a good learning experience for pharmacy students. It’s really fast paced environment to work in. Customers can be very rude. Our store had good management. I wish we had better pay. The things I  hate about this job is the mean customers, low pay and low hours from corporate"
good,"It was pretty stable. I had a lot of simple tasks to complete each day, and I got a handle on dealing with all different types of consumers. You had a lot of merchandise to learn about and a lot of product to sell, but it was a good job."
good,I loved working here! I enjoyed my co-workers and boss. You could have easily moved up within the company. They just need a better system for you to do your cdl’s.
good,You have two deliveries in one day two days apart and you’re expected to have it all put up by the end of the week.. some people work quicker than others so they can get it done but if your like me and work a little slower than its kinda difficult
good,"Good place to work in , good benefits. Very busy. Depends on your manager."
good,Working for Walgreen's was one of my best job experiences. The staff was very nice and easy to work with. The management acknowledged a job well done.
good,"You grow really close to the people you work with on your regular shift. Pharmacy will always be busy...for Holidays I was given 3 options to take 1 specific holiday off. Every year you get a raise...not much, but its something."
good,Sometimes busy but not always. Always something to be done to keep you from just standing around.The staff if full of great people and amazing customers
good,"Great experience. "
good,it was fun and slow paced i stoccked shelves pulled stuff forward cleaned bathrooms. and filled the cooler met cool people got lunch breaks and stuff.
good,"Walgreens is a great company must be flexible to work different shifts, also you must have great customer service that’s the most important thing when working for Walgreens."
good,"The job is easy, yet very fast paced. You only get two thirty minute breaks, but that makes the day fly by. If you like to do the same thing all day everyday this is definitely the job to have. I personally love it."
good,"working there since 2014 and bouncing back and forth since they've missed me so much *wink wink* everyone is appreciated for their team effort. the only con is that when one gets upset, the vibe from that one person carries on over to someone else."
good,"All stores are different but my first store I worked at was amazing and I really liked it there. When I got promoted to manager a couple months after starting, I transferred to another store. It was pretty nice at the beginning then things started changing because a lot of employees don’t have respect for the shift managers. I, on the other hand, didn’t tolerate it. I was strict even if I was 20 and Manager. I know they couldn't do that and eventually had to quit because we got a new store manager and he was worse."
good,Walgreens was a great job to work because it's not stressing you out and it's not a lot of things to do it's really slow paced and the co workers are really nice to talk to if you need help with anything
good,"This company has done right by me in the past and continues to do so, but I don't see the future beyond the trees. There is a limited upward mobility with this company and I don't want to be stuck in the same place for the rest of my career."
good,I was Beauty Advisor and a Cashier and I enjoyed working with both departments and types of customers. Fast-paced work environment that kept you on your toes and busy but the work day went by fast.
good,The job has a lot of potential. It is a great work place. It was managed poorly but you have to make the best of it for yourself. All of the coworkers work extremely hard.
good,"Walgreens is actually a good place to work and now they actually have it where you can work in the comfort of your own home which is really convenient. The starting pay is actually good, however not enough for the cost of living in Florida but overall I like my job I just need more money."
good,"I learned that it is important to know where products are located, for faster customer service. When dealing with customers be patient, understanding, and be sure to let them know solving their problems is the number one priority."
good,I love working at Walgreens. I feel like I learn a lot while on the job and enjoy the fast paced environment. The managers are always very helpful and kind.
good,"Walgreens is a fun place to work at because you meet different people every day and  you learn about new products."
good,Loved working there. I learned lots of skills. They treat there employees good. Learn how to run a computer register. I learned how to do photo center and do pass ports.
good,It is no secret that Pharmacy Technicians across the nation are overworked and underpaid.  The team and leadership I experienced during my time at Walgreen's created a supportive culture.
good,Walgreen was a good place to work at. My coworker for the very nice and helping if I needed anything.  The customers were sometime rude but I learned how to deal with it.
good,I'm usually standing at the register all day unless a customer needs something unlocked. I learned the sales and price changes we have every weekend. The managers are alright. It is a diverse group of people working. Nothing really hard the easiest part is standing at the register.
good,"I felt very comfortable, I was given the opportunity to make a difference. Spent a significant amount of time interacting with the customers to get to know them and supply their needs."
good,"Know career advances, management is not professional would not plan on staying here for a career. The schedule is not guaranteed and is back-worlds. It is not worth the money for the amount of work that is required."
good,"Fast paced,friendly enviroment, constantly revolving in education and updates. Great Training, Room for promotion and growth, well educated staff. Great Place to work."
good,"First we would have our meeting for the day, assignments will be issued, Then we began to off load the trucks.  What I  learned most was team work.  Management was always there to assist and direct to get the best outcome for all involved. The hardest part was starting a new task. The Holidays were the best part."
good,Its a nice place to work as a cashier and you get to meet very nice people who work there as well. Schedule was very flexible and can work with students.
good,"Amazing place to work, great co workers and always something to do. Fast paced and very busy. Adequate hours. Some room for promotions, but can take years."
good,"Overall a busy store and effective in handling prescriptions and customer service. I enjoyed my time there, the hardest part was the understaffed environment."
good,I was working contract and didn't want permanent because of the distance from my house and the traffic.  I don't have anything negative to say about this company but I recruited for the call center which was ongoing.
good,I was training to be a Pharmacy assistant and they were so kind to me through the whole process. I really appreciated their help and kindness especially considering how fast pace pharmacy work is they always took the time to help me
good,"I worked back in the pharmacy and it was very fast paced, so if you were training for the technician part, it was really hard to get any kind of training actually in because of how busy it actually was. Up at the front of the store was really nice though. We were steady all day long and we always had help when people called."
good,"This was my first ever job, and was a good one to learn the ropes of what employment entails.  Customer service can be a tough job, but has many important lessons to impart should you stick with it.  Patience, good attendance, attention to detail, time management, stress management, and communications skills are good areas to learn to name just a few."
good,"The first store was a good fit. I truly enjoyed every aspect of this job. They were very flexible with scheduling, friendly, and considerate. "
good,Fast paced and short handed all the time. Corporate budget cuts and equipment eliminated does not help company workflow. Considered overwhelming and exhausting through work days.
good,"Like the summary says it all depends on the location you are currently living that will define how the environment gonna be."
good,The staff was always friendly with new coworkers and made sure to train each person at their own pace. Management made sure to explain or help out if anything got too tough.
good,A great place to work for. Easy job for me well I think after learning the job it becomes easy to me. You get to see a lot of people help them if they have questions and just an ok job to have.
good,everyday we got a variety of customer that made the day past time quickly.i really  enjoy my co workers and the atmosphere. the job was very flexible to your needs
good,"The managers at my store are wonderful! I wish we get paid more as pharmacy techs because we learn a lot of information and deal with very tough patients, but overall, I like my store and would stay here long-term if the compensation was higher."
good,"It was never boring, Able to learn and move through the company. As a Manager for Walgreens you will move from one store to another. every 6mon. or so. So if you don't like were you are wait it out. "
good,They job is okey you do a little bit of everything and lear how to work with alot of stuff and deal with customers as well help find product and able to sell them.
good,"Working at Walgreens was a wonderful experience. Management did change rather quickly and consistently. Many managers who were there when I first started, were not working there a year later. It was decently busy, with ample downtime. However, there was not always enough work for the amount of people who were scheduled."
good,Pay scale is OK. Room for advancement. Not your typical 9-5. Can be a stressful atmosphere. Lots to learn but pharmacists always willing to help. Fast paced
good,It’s a good place to work at and with it benefits that comes along with it. I get 32-40 hours and sometimes over time.You also get paid time off. It’s also busy at my store even when it slow for everyone one else during winter time
good,"I have grown as a manager,employee and person throughout my employment with walgreens. I have developed people skills and the ability to thrive unser pressure."
good,"I lead and train personnel on a daily basis.  Handle day to day operations and work with pharmacy on a needed basis.  The company allows personnel to rise up the ranks as far as they want, depending on qualifications."
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced and is different every day."
good,"Walgreens is a serious place to work and fun at times. The culture is to take care of the customer and provide to them the best customer service and never say no, always work to solve the problem."
good,"In my opinion, the hardest part of the job was the long and extensive hours a person has to sit to complete tasks. Besides that, if you are a people person this is not a job for you. You have to focus on your duties and getting everything done in handle time."
good,I think ive been working there almost 2 years because of the Manager.. we have had a few bad seeds come in and out but i get along with everyone. Hour fellow employees willmakw work better!
good,"Fun place to work with room to advance, but there was a lot of time without family even though Walgreens was family oriented. A great learning experience and advancement."
good,"I liked working here. Mainly because I like to work by myself, however, I learned every department and skill there was to learn. I became extremely proficient in all aspects of my job while my sole job title was just the Customer Service Rep. Walgreens is a great first job or a stepping stone to getting your skill set up."
good,I am just looking for a job in medical assisting which is related to my major so I can use my skills and knowledge at workplace to better serve people
good,"flexible start time and hours"
good,my day at work would be stocking shelves and helping customers. I learned how to face shelves and how to address a customer in a good manner. management was good and also knew how to keep the workplace productive.
good,"I worked daytime , then switched to graveyard shifts, but enjoyed working with my coworkers. You pretty much do the same thing every week, so time goes by quickly, and depending on your coworkers it becomes a good day, although I always had a good day with whomever I worked with."
good,"I have formed relationships with many of my customers. Some customers are very difficult to deal with, but it is very rewarding to deal with the ones who put a smile on my face and refer to me by name! I know that I have made their day better when they can come into retail chain store and can have a relationship with the clerk. I have learned that no matter how frustrated I get at the other customers and things at my job, it's the other customers who bring a smile to my face daily that make everything worth it!"
good,i loved working their i just wish i was working through them and not through project yes i was getting paid every other week and it was just not helping
good,They have been an awesome retail chain to work for. Can be high in demand at times but I believe that comes with working in pharmacy.Highly recommend it for anyone willing to put in the time and effort with this company.
good,"People there were so nice, I enjoy work there. It was great experience, work there, I learned a lot of stuff I had a great Store Manager she was very helpful."
good,"I loved working for Walgreens. Every bit of hard work I gave to the company was reciprocated with awards, job advancement, and a winning culture. Very flexible with hours if you are a student, parent, or have another job. Walgreens means everything to me"
good,"they keep cutting all employees because they lose customers to Amazon, so the pay isn't high enough for the amount of work done. otherwise, this job is super flexible and management is great."
good,Its a ok experience. Be willing to do work and always be on your toes for different experiences. There isn't anything to really learn expect to be very observant and willing to do what is asking of you in minimal time
good,"I love working at Walgreens, but since my store isn't 24 hours, my shifts are always during the day. It's an easy job for me now that I've been doing it for so long, but in training people, I've come to realize that this is kind of a difficult job and there are a tooon of things to know. The people I work with are great and we are always eating great food during the day! It's usually pretty busy so there isn't much down time."
good,fun place to be but management makes mistakes often but we are all human. Make friends there. Having friends to back you up is the best thing to have at this job site.
good,"Enjoyable place to work. Training great ,management great. Hours are very flexable as well as chances to move up. Loved working there. Could travel if needed to via moved to different town or state."
good,Great company to work. Nice people. Loved helping people get stay and live way. It’s a equal opportunity employer. Good start off job for any over 18.
good,I'm had many blessed years at Walgreens but i think it's time to move on. It is a great company to work for lots of benifits . great working environment and they take care of their people.
good,"Every store manager for Walgreens is caring, smart, and very nice. The bad thing about Walgreens is that if you are in the management team you have to devote yourself to the job. Which means working long hours, depending on how many people are working at the store as in my store, we are very short staffed so the management team covers some of the CSA shifts"
good,"Some of the funniest, kindest, and hardest working people I have worked with I have worked with at Walgreens. There is a company wide structure and plan for organization and metrics, but the management and workplace culture truly depends upon the store in which you work."
good,I got to meet a lot of the people who live in the community and that was GREAT.  I enjoyed working with my Manager who was easy to get along with and knew HIS JOB 100%
good,"This job kept us busy with no down time and we were constantly being productive all while keeping the store clean, shelves stocked, and kept a great attitude towards the customers."
good,Great work place with a great team and management to learn from and they prepare u for promotions if that’s something that u might be interested in and they give flexible hours and are willing to work with you on schedules
good,"Love it here ! Everyone is so friendly and we all respect one another . Working here is like a family , we look out for one another and car for one another ."
good,"Walgreens was a very exciting, worksite were you cud learn a lot, great and interesting products, we stocked in the shells. Management was great, gain a lot of different ethic of work skills that were use with in the business."
good,"Great job to work at. The employee discount is very handy and as long as the store is staffed, the maintenance and tasks for the staff are easily completed."
good,"Everyday at walgreens I never felt out of place, everyone their was willing to help me learn their system and how they do things. They were all very patient with me and never seemed to get annoyed with the million questions I asked. They taught me as much as they could according to the store policy. I'd love to work at that specific Walgreens store again. All the people were extremely nice and very accepting of the way I needed my schedule to be for my young son. The management was very helpful and still to this day is a great resource for me in my job search for my next steps in my career."
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens. There were times when I wished I could be daytime only but I understood that in fairness I had to work the evening shift also.
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for.  The atmosphere and management are a pleasure to be around."
good,Very good at teaching new employees and make sure that you understand what you are doing before they just throw you in. Very friendly employees. Everyone is kind of just a big family there.
good,"This was a great place to work longterm for 10 years until, they decided to acquire other home infusion companies in Arizona. The acquisitions created overlapping of positions which created layoffs."
good,I really miss Walgreens I just wish their was more of an opportunity to grow. I really enjoyed competing with other stores on their sales events. I also liked that they offered Pharmacy Technician classes and offered a lot of training classes.
good,"typical day is getting the scripts filled,adjuticating third party issues and assisting the pharmacist in duties,i also was training new technicians as they came in the door"
good,"As a whole, working for Walgreens is pretty good.  Naturally as a corporate company there is always something disagreeable to how matters may be handled.  However, the ""corporate hand"" in the stores, I feel, is not to heavy. They allow enough freedom for the store to be shaped by it's community. They also offer good advancement opportunities for certain positions."
good,"Great company , everyone is very nice and understanding , must be on time everyday , must always call out day before and bring doctors note , try your best to level up in the business"
good,Typically a day at work would begin by me clocking in for shift. I take a look at what my assigned tasks are for the day besides my position of being a cashier. Make sure I'm always nearby the register and able to greet and welcome back coming and going customers. My managers were pretty cool! People oriented workplace. Also senior friendly. Hardest part of the job for me as a cashier was standing in one spot for pretty much the full 8 hours. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with lots of customers every day.
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work. It can be fun and educational. Learning all the different aspects that go into running a store like this is huge, but the payoff is well worth it."
good,"I love my job. I am maxed out in my position, I work too hard no to get compensated. I worked a 8 hour day and 40 hours a week. I have learned customer service, ordering, inventory, and resets. call-in, budgets, Working with management is fun, we are not treated any different then they would want to be treated. My least part of the jobs is getting to know your customers and finding out they have passed away.I like most about my job is the challenge of new procedures, and I love my customers"
good,"Good stable company to work for, encourages professional growth and advancement. Customer service is priority and patient adherence to medications is topmost."
good,Customer Service oriented. Good business model. Not enough people allowed to be hired to complete the mission (Make a profit). Wage rate inhibits acquisition of better qualified help.
good,"I feel appreciated - unlike working at Richmond University Medical Center.  The store manager is a great guy! Always smiling, always saying thank you for my work.  My coworkers are great - it's not stressful.  Just dealing with the general public can be stressful - you have to deal with many, many different personalities and whether or not a person is having a good or bad day.  But I've learned to just let it roll off me."
good,it was a great job my in store supervisor was more then helpful with daily tasks and they tended to always have new stock coming in frequently and very rare for there to be things expired
good,Flexible and learning experience. Flexible hours and had to work weekends and holidays. A person working there can have a lot of experience working in different roles.
good,"We dispense medicines to send by mail, we also prepare automatic machines to dispense medicine. We do inventory control.We are a large group from different countries and we like to work together because we learn from each"
good,"So I rated everything 4 stars, but still give it 5-stars overall all, because some of the ratings were personalized to my experience, but not necessarily representative of the company overall.  For example, I worked in the Mt. Vernon, IL Distribution Center.  The Work/Life balance is 5-stars overall, but for me it was 4-stars because I had a long commute.  I worked in HR, so at some point my Advancement would have been restricted unless I wanted to re-locate....but for Team Members there, Advancement is solid as long as you don't point out for attendance.  :)"
good,Even though customers were often sick and not always the kindest the employees there are great. Great to work with and to be helped by. Overall a great place to work and fill prescriptions at.
good,"Walgreens was like a family when you worked with the same coworkers for years on end, the patients even become family.  One of things you miss when you leave a place like Wag is your coworkers and your patients."
good,It was one of the jobs that I actually enjoyed going to.The managers were good people. My days usually consisted of checking out customers and stocking merchandise for the front registrars.
good,Walgreens is a great company with a good work environment that allows progression and growth. If you are a people person then this job has plenty of opportunities to make a customer happy.
good,Dealing with rude customers can be very stressful but and leaned how to calmed then down and solve their problem makes me happy. Hardest part of the job its when employees not doing their job.
good,Walgreens is perfect for a fixed schedule.you'll guaranteed have the 40 hours a week or if part time from 25-30. its very non-rushed. just scan the items accurately
good,"Was a great workplace as well as a place to learn the in's and out's of customer service. Wether it be a stepping stone or a permanent career choice, give it a shot and apply."
good,"I had a good experience working with Walgreens. I started working there when I was seventeen and worked at the Lakeville location for ten years. It was a great place to build customer service skills. The hours were fair, especially since most of the time I worked I was going to college. It had a good atmosphere and I made a lot of friends at the Lakeville location. I went back again to work at the Plymouth location a couple of years ago to make a little more money in addition to the full time job I was working. They were very understanding a flexible too. I only worked at that location for a few months, but I found a full time job. I would recommend this for a first time job or even as a full time job for those wanting to build experience and make some extra money."
good,Everybody was great coworkers and the hardest part of the job was leaving. The most enjoyable part was walking home in 4 minutes on my break. The workplace taught me a lot about patience and staying on task.
good,"comfortable environment and consistent hours, very flexible with schedules, switching shifts with someone or working an extra day or two. The pay was minimum wage I dont think anyone can survive comfortably at all in the U.S with that but it was a good job, managers were easy going."
good,I worked midnight's so it was a lot stocking and cleaning. Unloading the truck.  I learned to work with my coworkers and when to ask for help.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with disgruntled customers. The most enjoyable was my coworkers and the fun we had while doing our job.
good,Loved working here and was sad to go. Lots of opportunity for personal advancement. Management at my store was amazing. I learned a lot of computer and management skills.
good,"I learned how to do a reset for cosmetic wall at 3 of ours stores. At all the Walgreens we have Fedex, where you can send your packages off and you also can pick them up as well."
good,Had oppurtunuty to learn many positions. Management did a great job to help out. Has a relaxed vibe to work at. It also had opportunity for training for a pharmacy tech. Dealing with angry customers can be challenging but thats at all jobs.
good,"Walgreens has been one of the best options I have ever taken. Going into it I was nervous a little closed off, but the management is wonderful and always willing to help compensate for things i may need. The store i worked for specifically gave a lot of responsibilities to the employees which is good because it will show who is made for the job and who isn't. As well as being a good learning tool for future tasks."
good,Working in all areas at the counter are a great experience from cashiering to the photo lab then to the Pharmacy. You get to meet a lot of interesting diverse people and the employees become like family.
good,Love Walgreens and would recommend to anyone looking for a job. It's super chill and you get to know customers very well and develop relationships with then
good,Need a program to teach the next and future generations of management. Need to be one guideline. From my experience every store management and shift leads seem to be taught less and less yet are getting more and more responsibles.
good,"As soon as I step foot through the pharmacy doors there was nothing but opportunities to help and meet new individuals. Day to day duties consisted of Patient care, transfers, handling scripts, prescriptions, and money, and cleanliness of the work place.  Its always a pleasure having the opportunity to go to work with such a great company and team of coworker/management because I gain a lot of experiences from simply interacting."
good,"most of the jobs here are register and stocking jobs. Money handling, customer service, merchandise stocking  The hardest part about the job is the store is open on all holidays so you will have to rearrange your family holiday time"
good,"Fast Pace working inviromemt,  big warehouse,  lots of people,  many shifts. Good benefits.   Can not go out for breaks.   Poor management team.    Needs lots of training"
good,Opening the store and greeting coworkers and morning customers was a pleasant way to start the day.  I learned a lot about people and ways of interacting to both enjoy and get along with many different type of people.  The management position taught me a lot about the company values and the way a company views many areas of expertise such as vendors and the process in which they benefit the company and customer relations and how to go about improving the overall customer experience.  The hardest part of the job was finding new ways to encourage employees to do there very best.  It was a challenge but it taught me a lot. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people.  Meeting new people on a daily basis and learning more about co-workers was very satisfying.
good,"My typical day was to check people out wit their groceries,stocking make up and make sure everything is clean and in order. Sometimes dealing with thrifty customers was the hardest part of the job."
good,Walgreen's : Bassett High-school's  Workability Program was a perfect introduction for high-school students to understand the retail work environment. They did a through job of training students and treating them with the same respect and consideration as a normal employee. This program gave me the beginning tools and skills to enter the working world and helped me get employed after high-school.
good,The worst part and the best part of the job has to be the people. There will be some customers that will make you smile and feel good about working at Walgreens. Then there are the others. The ones that scream and holler for you to fix something that you literally have no control over.
good,"I am just an intern position from school. In order to get the experience from here, I had to work as same as the staff in Walgreen. I liked working there because pharmacy is the jobs that I love and I grew up my whole life. This is the place that I feel familiar with.."
good,At Walgreen's I was able to expand my horizons and work in the pharmacy which was cool. I like the fact that my job supports me with school and my  future goals of becoming an register nurse.
good,very on hands manager cashiers were very trusting you never were stress out when addressing customers needs learned a lot in  operations of our backroom.
good,i went to Walgreen for clinical and they where super nice and worked with me and helped me with everything i needed . they would help me understand all the things needed to be done.
good,"Walgreens is a very good company to work for.  I have enjoyed working for this company for many years.  However, I consider that it is time for me to find new professional challenges and new career opportunities in other companies.  I will always be grateful with walgreens for teach me ethical values and for allowing me to help customers .  In Walgreens, I learned to love my job and customers.  For all these reasons, I would recommend any person to apply and work for this great company."
good,"I liked almost everything about working at Walgreens. They have things set up so that there is very little room for error, and all questions from customers can typically be answered easily."
good,"I would recommend Walgreens for someone who prefers a retail environment that stays pretty clean and organized smaller store to maintain, constantly helping customers needs and questions, more of a family atmosphere, intimate , be willing to cross train if necessary to help store run better."
good,"I like working at Walgreen's. However, I'm looking for a more career driven path of work. I would like to keep the job as a possible part time if my supervisors allow it."
good,Every day was different. I was the department manager for a year in beauty. I worked with many different people and loved everyone. I would go back if I lived near one.
good,They are very laid back only thing I seen wrong is poor training skills but overall they are cool very nice supervisor and love the fact that they have meetings every morning
good,Great place with great people. You work with different types of people everyday. I learned alot about customer service and merchandising. The management only sought to make their store the best it could be.
good,"I was usually a cashier but once a week you had sale tags to put on and you had trucks to unload."
good,"fast paced environment with focus on safety, inefficiencies, engagement and improvements, great opportunists to try new ideas without fear of retaliation, open door policy in my  position, love to teach and educate teams as well solicit feedback from them who i consider the SME ."
good,"I loved working at Walgreens during my high school and college years. I had great co-workers and it greatly improved my social skills. I would recommend this store to a friend,"
good,I would have to restock several items on different shelves in the department store. As well as assist customers with questions of where items are located.
good,At Wall greens a learned a lot of how to deal with customers. I also learn how to multitask at the high paste environment. Here I also learned the importance of the team work.
good,"Was a joy working for walgreens,  they have wonderful staff ."
good,Great management and co-workers. I love coming into work everyday. I am treated very good. It is sometimes fast paced but not too bad. The pay is lacking for my position. Other stores pay more for basic positions. Put hard work in and you will succeed. My hours have become consistent but starting off I had hours all over the place. I am happy to call Walgreens my 2nd home.
good,"Para mí fue  una experiencia enriquecedora, no tan solo en lo laboral sino también  en lo personal."
good,"working at this company set all employees to career path, i like their continues training programs which keep you up to date with current changes in the healthcare field."
good,"Great company and people, very disorganized and short handed all the time. Big paychecks due to over time. I would work there again if the opportunity came up."
good,"Highly productive and competitive environment."
good,A typical day at work would be standing at the register while checking out customers. I learned to be patient with all customers even when they are rude. The management is wonderful depending on who you get. The hardest part of the job would be having endless lines of customers during rush hours and not getting to get any of your task list done for the day. The most enjoyable part of my work day is getting to sit down and relax my feet after standing on them for hours.
good,Walgreens is a good working environment and helped me get through college. As an intern I dealt with various employee and customer matters. The management at my store was good to work for.
good,high paced and competitive but in a healthy way that makes you grow as an employee and in your job field.  I was at a location in Buffalo NY from 2004-2007.
good,It was a nice friendly environment. The managers were involved and worked well with other associates. The customers were very nice and polite. Overall Walgreens is a wonderful company to work for.
good,This company is very good but sometimes the schedule really didn’t sit well with me.O have 4 children and having a weird work schedule I always struggled with it.I didn’t see kids much because of my shifts.but other than that it was a great job
good,"People are gfeat to work with.   A management perxl. Is difficult to work with.  Benefits are great."
good,"Walgreen's is a very protective, outgoing and welcoming environment and i would recommend it to anyone .Also the employees are very nice and the hours were very flexiable. If you need a job Walgreen's is the place to go."
good,un dia tipico de trabajo tranquilo aprendi bastante la gerencia bueno hace falta mayor profecionalismo pero son mas o menosla cultura ES BUENA ENTRE EMPLEADOS LO MAS DIFICIL es la gerencia es sigen mucho con poca paga
good,"This was a very fun place to work.  There was always enough labor to get the job done.  Having come to Walgreens from the high paced high stressed environment of Organic Grocery, i really excelled here.  I was able to use my past experience to improve inventory accuracy and reduce overhead.  "
good,really enjoyed working staff was awesome customers treated you nice. Wages where serious competitive. Benefits were top notch and you really learned your job so you could perform well.
good,"A typical day at work for me never felt like work. Trusting relationships with team members as well as patients provided a comfortable and exciting environment. As Lead Medical Assistant, I enjoyed training and educating new staff members and participating in several events sponsored by the clinic. The most difficult part of my job were the limitations that were implemented involving developing trusting relationships with my patients. Diversity was key in developing interpersonal relationships which allowed our team to trust and rely upon each other. "
good,A good position for young people or students working their first job.  Lots of time on your feet so invest in comfortable foot wear!  The most enjoyable part is employee support.
good,"Great company to work for, great training, great opportunities for advancement. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers stay healthy & happy."
good,"I had lots of great memories shared with different associates and customers at Walgreens . Walgreens truly showed me how to think and it also taught me when times would get hard, how to be independent and successful on my own."
good,"I filled prescriptions, stocked, double counted class 1 and 2 drugs, compounded, prescribed, cashier, and customer service. I was in training and enjoyed my experiences. I got to work in side a pharmacy and find out that people are very depended on them."
good,Great Place to work suitable for all life styles.This is a job placement agency. It is a good place to work because you get to work different locations and learn different things as you are placed abroad.
good,"17 years old when i first started at Walgreens. I was a full time student and played many sports in school. This job made me feel great about myself. I would get feedbacks from customers saying i have great skills. For work i had to log into the register, count money, organize the shelves, face the products, put new price tags and labels on some products. When the supply truck came in, i would be in the stockroom unloading trucks or out on the floor rotating new and old products. Great place and peacful spot to work at."
good,First time working as a sales associate and I really enjoyed it.It was something different from what I was normally use to.But I enjoyed meeting new and different people the staff was fun and awesome.

good,"Great place to work, fast pace, good co workers, and good pay.  "
good,"The working environment culture substituted between tracky and dynamic. Walgreens attempted to maintain not too bad esteems, tuning in to its representatives, and handle changing patterns proactively. Be that as it may, they are unfamiliar to it."
good,"Walgreens is an all around nice place to work, but the pay wasnt much. I got to meet a lot of different people, and also do a lot of different jobs around the store."
good,"A typical day at work, it's all about customer service. I've learned patience and how to work with others. Management was fair and helpful. Work place was nice, it was like a second family. There wasn't really a difficult part of the job, anything that was challenging was accompanied by someone that could show you what to do. One of the best parts of the job was helping the people and watching them walk away with a smile."
good,I learned customer service and helping and providing your customers to the best of your ability. I enjoyed it there because the managements were very awesme and the associates were really nice.
good,"I was there briefly for hiring orientation; therefore, I have little thing to discuss here. The team-playing culture is the sustaining and mainstay of this company."
good,"Working here, I learned the value of teamwork. This being my first job, working with AMAZING people, I have no true complaints. You really a tep back and see how much you've grown as an individual from being in such an environment."
good,Have to have a thick skin and a lot of patience for dealing with the public. My boss is very understanding and will work with me on any schedule I need.
good,"walgreens have good and competitive pay scale "
good,"I enjoy a fast pace environment, I like staying busy. "
good,A fun diversity plus you have lots of room to advance in your job if you're interested also good benefits and employee discount is available in select store locations
good,All employees get along and are happy with their work life balance management is open to helping any employee that needs help. I just feel here if u work hard u do get rewarded for it.

good,Walgreens has a great work culture. The pharmacy technicians are really helpful. They make the workplace feel like home. The patient are very grateful.
good,Honestly I don't have any bad reviews from working with Walgreens I still shop with them. They offer growth in their company. I had great team members.
good,This is a very good company to work for. The benefits are amazing. I had wonderful Co workers and the management staff is very helpful and easy to talk to if you have any concerns.
good,"I enjoy working for Walgreens. We always have a fun, productive day. When leading my team, I know things will be done as needed and to standard. The upper management, I am considered lower management, is very encouraging and help you to understand how to work and grow in your position."
good,"I was only a intern, and I enjoyed working at the store. The pharmacy is a very busy department in the store, and the team seems to work together to get the job done."

And through the passion of its people and corporate leadership, Walgreens continues to grow and evolve on a mere daily basis.  As with all significant growth, come changes and offer sacrifices, but in the end creates a solid and unstoppable global organization.  The Walgreens Company, and entity of Walgreens Boots Alliance, is a multi-faceted organization with a career opportunity for anyone that is open-minded, and passionate about their work."
good,"I really enjoyed working with Walgreens. I never had any complaints. I had really nice management and I felt like a valuable member of a team. "
good,"Strong team spirit with great co-workers. Having pharmacist immediately available for consultation a great asset.  Unfortunately, all NY clinics closed in December 2016."
good,Walgreen was a wonderful company I learn so much from here and moved up very quick. I figure out my career from Walgreen. I became a beauty tech because they give me the optionally to go to school from them and I'm so grateful
good,I loved working for them. They make you work hard but the pay is worth it. I got hurt on the job and they tried placing me elsewhere but the management at my store was not the nicest.
good,"Flexible hours.  Work from home.  Good pay. Multi tasking required.  Talking to customers via phone, chat and email.  Assisting customers with navigation of the website."
good,It Doesnt pay well but I love my Walgreens family. Everyone from pharmacy to coworkers to customers are family to me. That are so caring and understanding and overall great. Many locations are different but mine feels more like home than my own home does.
good,Supervised employees; receiving inventory; stock facing store; balancing daily cash for night deposit; assisting cashier with money drops; and service calls request
good,"I liked Walgreen's, because it was laid back and quiet. I never really had a lot on my plate and there weren't a lot of problems that I ran into. I definitely had a lot to do such as making sure shelves were stocked, tags were on correctly, making sure there was a certain amount of money in my drawer, answering costumers questions, resolving item concerns, answering phone calls, facing shelves etc. I've learned a lot about customer service because this was my first job and I didn't know much about it until I started here, I've learned about food and expiration dates, handling customer complaints and refunds. My managers were my favorite people to work with here, I loved working with them, they made everything so easy and made a lot of suggestions and tips to help me do my job better. The workplace culture was a lot like every other Walgreen's, I don't think there was a lot of uniqueness about it, but I liked being on a schedule routine was good for me, other than that the diversity of the staff was spread widely apart and I really enjoyed that, especially because no individual was treated any different. I think the hardest part of the job was at night, when we'd have only 1 or 2 stragglers that would come in, in the last 2 hours, it was so boring and I had a lot of the stuff that I need to get done, done so there wasn't a lot for me to do. The most enjoyable part of working at Walgreen's was that it was my very first job and just experiencing that in itself was a really great experience."
good,"Walgreens is a nice place to work at. You do get benefits such as discounts and free flu shots. "
good,It was a great first job.  It taught me how to work in a team and how to work with customers so we keep them happy and wanting to come back.  Very flexible hours.
good,"I learned a lot about retail. What facing means, pull the old products to the front and put the new in the back. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking to my regular customers."
good,A typical day at work included getting the regular customers. I learned that it's crucial to make sure that the customer is happy through my amazing managers. The managers were always on top of everything making it an easy environment to learn in. The workplace culture had a very welcoming feeling. The hardest part of the job was stocking shelves in the freezer. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet new and interesting people everyday.
good,"Busy pharmacy, hardworking and efficient team. "
good,"This was my all time favorite place to work! My direct manager was amazing, friendly, thoughtful, and worked with any schedule demands. Took the time to teach you what you needed to know to help one another out, as they act like a family rather than everyone is on their own (like it is everywhere else in business industry)."
good,Everyone is nice and helpful. Good benefit and easy job.. It's just bit boring  typing all day every day. if you don't mind sitting in one place and typing all day then this is a perfect job. They have strict attendance policy
good,"Fun work environment and management is understanding. Hourly pay is $9.50 for csr, not that high. Everybody there is nice and so are the shift leaders."
good,"its a great place to work, you can work the cash register, photo, cosmetics and floor. lots of stuff to do. fun people to work with. you get to interact with the customers."
good,Amazing job! Filling Prescription Orders engaging with customers to meet their health care needs. Maintaining medical records and personal information. Taking inventory of each drug.
good,"Best Nursing team in my 25 tears of Nursing: professional, available, supportive.   "
good,Great company and a good way to start learning for a sales associate position and great management to support your start-up job. however you have to work your way up to higher management.
good,I enjoyed working for Walgreens and would love the opportunity to work there again.The Pharmacy manager was very nice and helpful and I could say the same about the store manager and employees that I worked with at that time.
good,"September 2014 Customer Service Assistance."
good,I enjoyed to leave school early for work because i knew i was going to work with a good team. i learned to make pictures the way the customers wanted them. the hardest part about this job was nothing honestly. i enjoyed this job because i learned quick and enjoyed it.
good,"Management is awesome, hours are great and flexible. It's unfortunate that every company is aiming to maintain part time employees, that would be my only complaint. Nonetheless, I regret quitting."
good,Love the company. Love working with customers and being a photo tech. Love being able to meet and talk with new people every day. Love the fast paced environment.
good,"I had the pleasure of working for this company. The staff and management always had a great, uplifting, and positive attitude. One part I can honestly say was not the best, was when work picked up speed before you could breathe. I can rate this company  5 stars, it was great being part of the team."
good,I apologize but it is my personal opinion not to post on social media any opinion good or bad about any companies weather I have worked for them or not this is not a good business practice to follow
good,I loved this store and the people who worked there. It is a great environment to be in for working at any age. This can be a great temporary job or long term job.
good,"Other employees are a little rude but I loved working in the pharmacy. They rotate you throughout the day to different stations (drive through, counter, or filling the scripts)."
good,"Overall my experience at Walgreens was great! I looked forward to working in a culturally diverse environment of customers, as well as, employees. I managed to build exceptional customer service and took pride in working for the company."
good,the store I worked in had great managers. Everyone got along great which made for a positive experience. Hours do fluctuate a lot so there may be weeks where you work two days a week and other weeks you work close to 5 days a week. employees get great discounts when shopping at walgreens
good,"Fast paced, multitask oriented type of workplace.  Company constantly changing to stay ahead of competition.  Best training in the industry.  High level of stress for pharmacy managers and store managers.  Company has changed over the last ten years that they are all about figures and less about their talented team members.  Most enjoyable part of the job are the regular customers and team members."
good,In the eight years I worked for Walgreens I worked under 3 different managers.  The last one was excellent.  It's to bad the company was restructuring because it lead to my early retirement.  I still miss some of my co-working in the Keene Store.
good,"I was honored to been given the opportunity to have been a member"
good,I made sure to provide customer service to anyone that was in need. They do except you to be flexible with your time there and to always think of the customer first.
good,"I absolutely loved working for Walgreens. My coworkers felt like family, and I am still friends with most of them to this day. I moved up in my store really fast, I made employee of the month my second month there, and within four months I was working as a pharmacy tech in training. Unfortunately, Walgreens will work you into the dirt and not bat an eye. They called me on every single day off. I worked for three weeks straight once. They kept making two different schedules for me, scheduling me at different times on the same day, in two different department, and they would get mad at me for following the wrong one. I tried to quit because I became very ill, and they wouldn't let me and encouraged me to take Paid medical leave, which I got denied. They told me I could come back when I was better, and when I tried, they told me they didn't think I could handle it. So I never got my job back."
good,Walgreens is a good company to work for with many different departments to branch out to  There are many store locations to work at and corporate is not too far if that's what you are interested in.
good,"A typical day was very busy, I learned to fill prescriptions pull out inventory and put away Scripts accordingly, management was very friendly and helpful, the hardest part is making every customer happy but we tried our best, the most enjoyable was meeting new people and learning they're different techniques to make work easier."
good,"I have enjoyed working with all of my coworkers from various backgrounds / titles of leadership.  It's a very fast paced environment but the great thing is that there are always things to accomplish.  I feel working with individual's insurance can be very tedious; but, if it puts a smile on the customer's face at the end of the day, then it was well worth it."
good,Had good and bad times during my time there but don't regret applying and would work for them again if allowed...........................................
good,Once stop shop where you can get your prescriptions filled and shop while you wait. Great employees. Good atmosphere. Good prices and good deals always.
good,"The culture changes with management changes for any given store you may be working in.  My initial experience with management was great and I liked the work very much.  I prefer work that keeps me busy and this is a place that does that.  However, a change in management with the new Store Manager was not as great as before.  Good person, but not always honest about his intentions and uses the corporate rule book a bit hard for the culture.  I understand rules, but some things are taken too seriously and could easily be avoided with just a conversation."
good,"Working here you will gain experience in multiple departments. In return, you will have different possibilities for advancement whether it is through the pharmacy or through the sales floor team/management."
good,The insurance is great. Great opportunities to succeed. You will love it.  Great job and great people. The customers were awesome. Looking for a job to grow this would help you.

good,"I was sixteen when I started working here. I'm still friends with my at-the-time coworkers, and I still go back just to say hi.  Wasn't a super fan of the manager, but she was doing what she needed to do, and I doubt I could have done a better job to keep the store running."
good,"i had a serious sickness, throwing up and small amount of blood coming out too. main management cared less of it and made me come in."
good,. I love working at Walgreens because if I meant to be around people and she was showing them things that I love with you straight up I believe that if I would have stayed I probably would have been a better trip but I wasn't sure if I had another opportunity I probably will go back and become a manager because our brains have great benefits and it's a nice clean respectable place to work at the people are friendly and the place is clean and the resources and you have have to worry about things that you have to worry about dealing with other places that have worked at

good,"It was fun while I worked there! I chatted with most of the staff as I did my job and waited around to help customers. My co-workers were a couple of my friends from school and the managers weren't too bad either; one of them wasn't the nicest but was straight forward about the job. So I couldn't really dislike who they were cause they explained the job the best to me. The hardest part of the job was when it was only me working late nights or in the morning to do the restocking, mopping, organizing and etc (minus the medical, photography, and cash register) I enjoyed it because of the hospitality of my co-workers and some customers."
good,"Excellent opportunity if you possess a strong work ethic, humility and great customer service."

good,"Walgreens is a wonderful employer to work for, while employed the store employees were all put on part-time without benefts - which was disappointing for their moral.  But, this situation has happened with many companies nationwide.  I really enjoyed working in the clinic, but worried about longevity with the employer."
good,"My co-workers are nice and easy going, fun to work around. Very down to earth, and makes the work place comfortable......."

good,Walgreens at Union Station gives great customer service and has amazing team management.  Everyone that works at this location is trained to give all customers the best experience as possible.
good,My typical day at work always consists of customers. Greeting and asking about how their day is going. I've learned that every customer and situation is different. My co-workers are great and always helpful. The hardest part of my job is telling a customer that their copay is over their budget which is very upsetting. The most enjoyable part of my day is making my customers smile.
good,"At walgreens i would handle cash, answer phone calls, help costumers, restock when not busy. On truck day we would unload trucks and restock with new merchandise."

good,Long work hours complemented with excellent pay make for a great place to work.  Excellent management as well.  You may spend a lot of time working out of town but they always take care of you.

good,"I worked for Walgreen's for nearly 3 years, and two of those were in Colorado. You get the typical retail drama, but it tends to still be a very close-knit team. There's also a huge opportunity for cross-training in the pharmacy and all departments in the store. My personal manager was great - he put up with a lot more from me than he ever should have, and he provided me probably the most amount of professional growth that any employer has. I would definitely work there again if there were more non-customer-facing positions available."
good,Fast pace environment. There is always something to do. Great people work here. Hardest part might be having to work on holidays.
good,Co-workers were always friendly and helped maintain a calm and enjoyable workplace. Management of all levels in the distribution center were also very understanding and lead more through example than explanation.
good,"mgr needs to have employees cdl work complete on time"
good,Walgreens is an awesome place to work at. I'm lucky to have such great managers and co-workers. The hardest part of the job is when youre focused to get your work done but others are disinterested in doing their job.It makes my job harder because after I complete my work if my coworkers don't finish their list then sometimes I am asked by my manager if I can finish it. The most enjoyable part of my job is assisting people and making the customers happy.

I enjoy working for such a positive workplace and look forward to taking what I have learned from them and applying it at other businesses.
good,"As a Beauty Advisor here at Walgreens, I get to utilize my skills by providing information about products with their features and benefits to customers.

good,"Working for Walgreens was a great experience, as well as a fantastic  starting point into my medical carer. The staff on duty was a well functioning team that it in itself is a rarity to see."
good,"I'd walk in the back room, clock in, then go out to the photo section to see what needed to be done. I would take customer photo orders and have them ready for them in usually less than 10 minutes depending on how busy we were. Management was okay, but we had just had a management switch about a week after I showed up so it kind of threw things off balance. Most of my co-workers were nice and funny, but there was one that was really negative and somewhat rude to myself and customers. I enjoyed helping people get the pictures they wanted. the hardest part of the job was changing the picture paper because there was no dark room so you had to do it in a tent-like structure without being able to see what you were doing."
good,"Management is very efficient, they were accommodating when it came to me quitting to take care of my family and go back to school. Even though there was room to advance the timing was off. The pay is acceptable, learning new skills is a must, and the computer systems and work load is east to learn."

good,"Typical day at Walgreens is full of customers that in some way need assistance in their life. Usually this need is medically speaking. That's where I do the absolute most to make sure they leave the store happy and of course healthy. I'm on my feet for 8+ hours of the day and always striving to get more and more done in those hours. If I'm not with a customer face-to-face I'm on the phone. I handle insurance claim and problems that arise immediately. "

good,I believe in the beginning it was a great company to work for my reviews were excellent and then they started cutting back on benefits and thats why i left.

good,"Great company, with excellent compensation, fair chance at promotion and solid culture.  In the time a worked there employees started with full time jobs and health benefits.  I know that has changed with the times  of this countries current economy.  Management used to be responsible but these days their quality is not as it should be.  All in all my time there was good and if not for personal reasons I would still work there."
good,"Mainly work the front register , however, enjoy the interaction with the customers and my coworkers. Everything at Walgreens is easy to do and learn ."

The typical day a work includes helping customers find things that they need. Putting out and straightening the weekly inventory. The hardest part is dealing with frustrated customers/co-workers. You don't get them all the time but, it is life and sometimes you just have one of those days. The most enjoyable part of the job is after helping customers or finishing a project. I don't know just the feeling of accomplishment."
good,Management is great with associates. Always willing to promote and listen to others employees ideas. Paid time off and vacation for full time employees.
good,"A typical day as a shift lead with Walgreens consists of remerchandising displays throughout the store, providing customers with a great shopping experience along with helping find solutions to customer concerns and daily cash handling and closing out of registers."
good,"At Walgreens, you will have endless ways to grow.  If you are not a go-getter, you do not belong here.  Walgreens will challenge you on a daily basis to differentiate yourself and drive you to be a more well rounded business professional.

good,"I enjoy working at Walgreens for temporary time because it was part of school program (workability). I learn experience on this job ,so when I want to find a new job it will not be that difficult even do they still have to training you. The hard part of it is that sometimes when you will be in the freezer stocking items it will be cold. With all my co-workers I got along and with manager and assistant. They really glad to have me there working. I learn how to updates the items, stocking, fixing the mess and clean the store also bring the cars from the outside to the inside."

good,great enviornment with great people. It  is a joy when the customers you service are happy with you and the job that you do well for them
good,"My job is really repetitive, i do all the same tasks basically every night.   I work third shifts, so as soon as i go in i am at the front register. While greeting and assisting customers i go back and forth from working in the photo lab to also ringing on the front register. After my manager pulls drawers i re count and confirm money pulls from given registers. When customer flow stops i start straightening and facing every isle in the front half of the store. When i'm done with that task, i sweep and mop the floors and then attend to the bathrooms. After that is finished i put up any returns in the store, and then move on to filling and stocking products that are low. Occasionally ill have certain goals that need to be met, like resetting a isle according to planogram, or doing outdates on certain sections. I am responsible for monthly maintenance in our photo lab, as well as monthly cigarette counts. Basically i do anything and everything to get the store in tip top shape for the following day. I've learned a lot about marketing strategies and sales, and how to meet standards in given times. The hardest part of my job is the hours, and busy holidays. Its just me and my manager working as a team to fulfill customers needs, and at times we take on tasks of four people, just us two. The most enjoyable part of my job would definitely be the atmosphere and the customers. We make sure at Walgreens everyone feels welcomed  and important. I love helping our customers in any way i can, even if its just as simple as telling them to have a good day. The littlest things, can impact a"
good,"I was hired as a Beauty Advisor. But to get more hours, I worked front register and helped in other areas of the store. I did reset and planagrams, assisted customers any way I could and really enjoyed going to work everyday. I loved my manager. She was tough, worked us hard, but didnt ask us to do anything, she herself would'nt do. It was my responsibilty to clean the public restrooms, and straighten aisles and restock merchandise and  run POS terminal. When our manager gave us praise, she meant it! WHich is why we all worked hard and happily each day. If you had a problem, you could always talk to her about it. I was very sad when I had to leave but there were circumstances  not enough hours to live on, and my living arrangement at the time, and my former boss needed me back, since I had worked for her longer, I felt I didnt have a choice but to go with the fulltime she was offering me. It was a very hard decision. One which I regret to this day."
good,Very nice work enviorment. I had three good months there during my internship but the company already had enough employees on the payroll.
good,i worked for my mom in the cafeteria i loved the kids i worked with i learned a lot from the kids and the basics for serving children their lunch
good,"Always a very busy atomosphere at Walgreens(Clearlake location). I have enjoyed it all so very much. I got to know customers by name and faces...it helped make their experience a quick and better one. I believe it trying to make everyone feel Important. My thoughts are that a person walks in Walgreens (most of the time) not feeling well. I try to look at that person as I would a "" family member or Friend"" who is not feeling well. I treat each person with respect. There is one Pharmacist in particular that I have a lot of respect for...she does her job excellent. She cares for the patient ..but also goes by the law. She knows what she is doing. My co-workers all work very hard. We work in a very busy store. We try to help each other out as much as possible. The hardest part of the job ...is trying to keep the patient calm while trying to explain what the issue is ..whether it be pertaining to insurance, the patient not having refills or problems with the Script the doctor sent over (DELAYS). My most enjoyable part is actually EVERYTHING...even the problems..when I get them fixed , the patient being grateful for the help,etc...."
good,"One of the best places to start working. Great managers, great company, great health benefits! Working overnights was hard, but the money was worth it. The holidays may be very busy, but helping the customers was a great plus side!"
good,"On a typical day working at Walgreens, there was never anything that i felt was ever too hard for me to do.  This was because all of my managers as well as my co-workers were always so helpful and nice.  Everyone always got along at Walgreens.  It was like we were a big family and i liked it.  That was the most enjoyable part of the job for me.  What i have learned from working at Walgreens is, being early to a job is one of the most important things.  It never hurts to be early to a job."
good,"given multiple jobs with low pay and not a lot of hours."
good,"I worked the cash register, I  gave breaks, I stocked and made new displays, customer service."
good,"i worked at Walgreen on a temporary position so i didn't get to work on cash register, but overall i really enjoyed the experience. Great co workers, management was awesome. Hardest part i can say was nothing, all my task i believe they never gave me anything i couldnt handle ."
good,"Walgreens was a great experience. It was an amazing family-type staff with good hours. Management was really helpful and accommodating to schedule hours and personal issues. I learned a lot here such as how to be part of a team, how to sell and how to keep a job looking nice. The hardest part was when you ran out of items to stock or things to clean. The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers while having a great time with staff."

good,"no one day is the same!!!"
good,"Basically, the job requires you to be very flexible. Furthermore on truck days, you must put things up in a good fashion. The co-workers are extremely nice. They are willing to work with you on any and everything. Management is very precise. Depending on what volume store you are in. The hardest part is you are constantly working with customers. Most of which maybe too pushy or too needy. The most enjoyable part is the benefits, advancement opportunities, and points that you get for good customer services."

good,The typical day at work is hectic but the teamwork and relaxed environment between co-workers relieves a lot of the stress. The rotation from filling to customer service stations is a great way to ensure that everyone gets the same time on the more enjoyable parts of being a pharmacy technician. I learned all about policies and functions of the pharmacy as well as state restrictions and opportunities for advancement. The hardest part of the job is the work load and time demand from the patients but offering prompt service and care is the most enjoyable part. 
good,I like working here. I am  just look for another part time job to help support myself through college
good,Walgreens is innovative in expanding pharmacy care services and provides a challenging but rewarding place to grow as a pharmacist. 
good,I really enjoyed working with Walgreen's. I loved the people and all of our wonderful customers. I really got to learn a lot working for this company. They helped me get certified as a pharmacy technician and I got to learn a lot in the process from the pharmacists as well as the other technicians. I ended up becoming one of the senior technicians. I absolutely loved the face paced environment and staying busy constantly. I would say there was not one thing I did not like about my time and position with Walgreen's.
good,"A job in retail, especially as a store manager, is a busy demanding position.  But I love it because I was really good at my job and I like helping people.  Whenever I moved to another store the secret shopper scores always went way up.  The clerks all enjoyed my management style, firm but fair.  Company was building lots of stores so assistant managers were being promoted quickly."
good,On a daily basis it is a great place to work. We have a very close team and we all preform to better ourselves and the company. The majority of our customers are regulars and we get to learn and grow with them!

good,"Best company I have ever worked for, that is why I took this consulting job there."
good,"At Walgreens I was a cashier. I had more responsibility since I had to sell ciggars to people. At the same time I had two isles I had to straighten out while I had no customers. Sometimes, I would get switched with the cosmetics departments when a co-worker would not show up to work. Towards the end of the day, we had to make sure the entire store was clean and things were in their proper place."
good,Performed a six-week externship under the supervision of a Registered Pharmacist
good,great place to work. treated with respect. unfortunatly because of sales they are forced to cut hours. one down fall with walgreens is that when you have resets and revisions to do they do not have all the proper tools to get job done the firdt time
good,"My typical day as of right now is unloading tucks and putting product out on display. Before for that it was in the pharmacy, where I would answer phones, get scripts ready for patients, enter insurance polices, and handle insurance issues for patients, and work with pharmacist in handling patients needs. The hardest part of the job was learning the computer program, that deals with insurance companies. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with really great people, who enjoy their jobs and work really hard at providing great service."

good,"I was at Walgreens pharmacy for my externship program and the job was pretty straight forward. I got to learn a lot from the pharmacy manager and the technicians. They helped me a lot to learn about different medications and get me ready to take my PTCB. The job itself was fun, it was hectic with standing for a long period of time but the breaks they gave was great to get the energy back. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the staff."
good,My typical day at work would be to
good,Walgreens is a stable company. Concerns of employees are always addressed.The company is always moving in a different directions to attract more customers and revenue. It is a great company to work for.The co- workers are team players and always willing to help if the need arises.
good,Great work environment. Community based pharmacy that genuinely cares for customers and workers. Employee satisfaction meetings to see what the workers would like to change. Great Front store management. Some of the pharmacy managers aren't people persons though. Upward mobility for pharmacy technicians is based on how long people have been there and prefential treatment from the pharmacy manager. Someone who doesn't show up/call out for work and hides to play on their cell phone can be promoted to head technician based on the pharmacy manager even after customer complaints of attitude problems.
good,"Learned a lot from management about how to merchandise, excel sales, build great rapport with customers."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me being at the register taking customer, cleaning my counter and front of the store, helping co-workers with whatever they needed me to do & making sure I was on task with what management needed done. I learned great customer service skills there, how to man a till for hours on end and take a high volume of customer transactions, money counting skills & how to scan in new items. Management can sometimes be biased and play favorites but there are some great managers in the company that look out for the best interests of their employees. I never really was too fond of a lot of my co-workers because of their immature,childish nature. I did make some great friends there thoughin spite of that fact. The hardest part of the job was the fluctuating hours and my boss calling me at all times of the day to come in to cover for someone. The most enjoyale part of the job was the customers i loved them. This is a job I would strongly recommend to anyone looking for a stable but has bigger things in store for themselves"
good,"Walgreens is a very secure company to work for. The company has many opportunities for advancement and growth. When you work hard and display the ability to lead and learn new things, your advancement within the company will be good."

good,A typical day at work is scanning product and sending it to the shipping department.
good,interacting with many customers per day
good,"I usually got there punched in and talked to the person that had the shift before me to see if there was something that she needed me to finish up or any new projects.The priority was the customers and my department which was the cosmetics department. During most of your shift u just ring up customers and make sure everything is in its place.At night each employee has a section that they must face(push everything forward and make sure its in its right spot). I was there for many years and I wouldn't be the person I am if I didn't have the experience of working for Walgreens.When you work in the photo department you definitely have to do more because you have to use three different machines. Maintenance must be done very often. You have to work with chemicals. There are different types of managers just depends which one u get. There are some that are strict and by the book, but still nice. There are others that are more lenient but less hands on involved.The hardest part of this job is that it is life consuming if you work full time. 75% of the time you will be at work and you have to schedule your life around your work schedule. The most enjoyable part is that you can meet different kinds of people from different back rounds and help the customer with what they need :)"

The best part was no two days were ever the same."
good,started my job history....great place to advance.....can rotate between store
good,"Walgreens is a good company that values their employees. They offer good benefits and even profit sharing. Unfortunately, many of their stores have experienced cutbacks and are no longer open 24 hours. Full time positions can be hard to attain and keep. Training is good and management was great."
good,"Great place to work,very productive. Great team work and management. Very flexible for my school schedule and good benefits."

good,"I enjoyed working with people, helping them with their purchases. When working at Walgreens is like working as a team for the same desired goal. My managers were easy to talk to if I needed to change my schedule. The hardest part of the job was making sure all the planagrams and wall resets were done as Walgreens wanted when we didn't have the required space. The best part of working at Walgreens was being able to help the customers and feeling like I was making a positive difference in my community."

good,"Good training, work environment, and management overall. Was able to move up quickly but the pay pretty much caps out after a few raises. Good flexibility for work/life balance."
good,Walgreens  is a good place to work forr good people to work with no over time available its just a part time job ii worked 3rd shift at the 24 hr store
good,Having the opportunity to deal with different types of customers and being able to work in the pharmacy gave me a different out look at life.Being able to be around people that actually like helping out each other and experiencing new things .
good,I learned that being patient is the best way to get through the day. The hardest part of the job is not only balancing your own life but being able to handle difficult customers. You learn to love the people you work with and appreciate the relationships you build overtime.

good,"Walgreens is a wonderful place, management is okay, I loved working there. They do tend to cut hours if you are part time, if you are full time you get 40 hours."
good,This company is fast paced and physically demanding. They train you for your area and often cross train you incase of shortages. They are a smoke free campus. But you often work over your scheduled hours due to high order rates.
good,I like it a lot. Very fast-paced and was quite enjoyable to work. The managers were nice and very helpful. I like you to learn a lot and people are willing to help each other out
good,"Easily one of the easiest jobs, management was very lenient, and gave me space to manage my store. Good people usually work there. Easy opening and closing procedures, pretty good room for progression/ promotion. Sometimes hires from outside sources. But usually promotes from within. And the pay was decent for the type of work you had to do. But when I had to transfer it was not easy to keep my position"
good,"The pay was great, benefits are offered after a certain time period of working there, they were very flexible with scheduling, you get a lunch break and smoke break (if necessary). My co-workers were easy to get along with and helped as much as they could. It is a customer service position so obviously there will be times when things get stressful and busy. There are also hard to deal with customers. That is a given but if you can handle that then you're good."
good,"It was a good time working at Walgreen's. The hours were good and I got a decent pay. They provided the training for any job I was expected to perform, and clear instructions were  given for any task. I got along well with my bosses and things ran pretty smoothly. Sometimes it got hectic when we had a lot of people come in at once. They were also very willing to work with my schedule, not having me come in on Sundays so I could go to church."
good,Shifts are busy usually. Staff and management are very nice and helpful. Atmosphere is typically relaxed. The hardest part of the job is  the customers.

good,Greeting customers attending to their needs and making sure they leave satisfied. Correct errors and make sure patients get their medication in a timely manner.
good,They used a lot of positive reinforcement.  Sometimes the manager would call me at my register to tell me I was doing a good job and to keep it up.  Not a lot of employers are like that anymore so it was nice.
good,"I worked part time as I already had a full time job, just needed the extra money.  The management at my store was very conscientious about labor laws etc. It's a fun place to work at, sometimes busy, sometimes slow.  The discount is great!"

Management from team leads up listen to complaints with an open mind and are willing make changes to improve the work experience.  Pay and benefits are competitive. I wish I never left, it was just too far of a drive."
good,"The environment is very friendly and laid back. The hardest part of the job is helping with stock and working with customers, if you can do those two things you are good to go. Every person who works there, including leadership, is very friendly and always willing to lend a helping hand."
good,"Absolutely the best place I ever worked! Definitely recommend. For retail, the management was amazing & never expected you to do any job outside your pay grade. Customers were pleasant more often than not. The only downside is, they don’t close on holidays."
good,"good place to work. there was a lot of great people that work at walgreens, making the working enviroment a great one to work at, being at walgreens was a good experice"
good,"Walgreens is a fun place to work at if you enjoy customer service and can multitask. Also, if you enjoy helping others walgreens would be the place and you get to work with very nice people."
good,I've been able to grow as a person here while also growing as an employee. My experience has been overwhelmingly positive. I started as a cashier and over 4 years ended up becoming a pharmacy technition. We get paid vacation and the customers are great !
good,Walgreens was a great place to work until they sold us to IBM. Walgreens had a world class IT department. Once there were no longer Walgreen family members on the board they started to farm out and sell off IT support. I is very sad to see what they have done and how terrible the support for the stores and customers is now.
good,High volume call center at times. No real procedure to follow to appease customers just what you can do mostly cool environment. They have incentives to keep u engaged with what's going on and make work day fun

good,"Worked with and met a lot of great people in my time here. My manager had a great influence on me and taught a lot on how to manage time, people, and tasks."
good,"It's a family. Everyone got along for the most part, higher management invested 1:1 meetings monthly to talk about progress and what you can do better. Everyone was happy to help and we were encouraged to help eachother with tasks and always be walking around the store to give great customer service."
good,Progressive and fun place to work. I have enjoyed working for the last 13 years at Walgreens. They support a diversified staff including the Disability community.
good,"Your experience is going to vary drastically depending on what store you work at. My first store I loved, my coworkers were friendly and encouraging. They made the job fun. My second store was terrible, everyone was rude to the customers and to each other. Lots of passive aggressive remarks. Very unprofessional. But I always found the work rewarding and therapeutic. Find a store where you like the people."
good,Siendo una Farmacia 24/7 con un alto volumen de recetas la dinamica es rapida y demandante. Trae un alto nivel de retos para resolver manteniendo sentido de urgencia ligada a alta calidad en la entrega de medicamentos.
good,The options for me were limited as I was only allowed to work a certain number of hours a month. Most shift leads and pharmacists need full time.  Hours are flexible
good,"Loved it. It was an awesome place to work. I wish they paid more. Excellent team and flexible scheduling, Perfect for students and employees with multiple jobs."
good,"Enjoyed working with people. Everyday was an learning day. Always room for advancements. "
good,"pretty good work culture"
good,"Constant interaction with customers on a daily basis. Be ready to have enough patience with new people. ""Rush hour"" is true at a certain time of day. It will get annoying when there are not enough employees in one shift."
good,Walgreens is great if you enjoy working with the public.  I miss my regular customers.  Nice employee discount.  Felt like family during my time of employment!
good,"It’s a very nice place to work, the managers are great and the work is steady, although it can get slow during evening shifts! I’m a part-time worker so I get little hours but the pay is good, although maybe not that great if you live alone or support yourself."
good,i would look every shelf for anything out of date and working in the back room in the fridge and the back room of Walgreen and restock everything and working with the customer and talk to coworker on are free time
good,"Constantly cutting hours, makes for a stressful work day with loads of demands on what all needs to be done daily. But I  love everyone who works in my store."
good,Fun place to work with a lot of room to move up. All of management is relaxed and make the workplace fun. Hours are flexible and can be worked around schedules.
good,A typical day as a shift manager would be interaction with multiple customers. Checking in multiple vendors and filing receipts. Walking the store to make sure the shelves are filled and neat. Managing a staff of at least three employees at the front of the store and at least 3 pharmacy techs. Answering phone calls and dealing with customers concerns and complaints. Unloading merchandise from trucks and placing them in their correct location on the sales floor. Managing the flow of the money. The workplace as a whole is a nice environment to work in. I've learned how to manage a team and have them trust my ability to lead them in the right direction. I've also learned how to receive and give constructive criticism. One of the hardest part of my job is making sure everyone is happy with their position in the workplace. The most enjoyable thing at my job is listening to the customer surveys and realizing that we're actually making a difference.
good,It was a fun place and time to work there. I did a lot and got a lot done. There was nothing i didnt know and all together was a fun and exciting first job.
good,"I had very good experience, very professional employees, managers. Flexible schedule. Manager very supported. "
good,When I worked for Walgreens Distribution Center their productivity was sometimes hard to reach in certain departments but overall it averaged itself out. The HR dept and management was professional for the most part.
good,"I was working at walgreens to complete my 100 hours as a requirement for the pharmacy technician certification and I enjoyed working there. I left because it wasn’t really a job, it was for school."
good,Recommend this company for a great job. Flexible hrs and paid vacation within the first year. Only problem is the management lacks management skills in the location I worked.
good,Working in Walgreens Pharmacy was the first job I ever had. It taught me a lot and I was able to experience all kinds of different roles within the company.
good,Good entry level position to enter into the health field. Plenty of opportunity for knowledge and growth if you plan on pursuing pharmacy. Very flexible hours and Walgreens offers tuition assistance to those currently in pharmacy school.
good,I learned a lot from this experience. Helping customer was my favorite. Got along well my co-workers and managers. The hardest part would probably be unloading the truck. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers.
good,I love working here. My management was super great at working with me on my schedule and the district manager always remembered my name and everything I told him. Within a year I went from a DH to a Pharmacy Tech with two raises. But the drama started and I just couldn’t handle it anymore and left
good,management cared for all there employees and always followed the rules and it was always team work to meet goals. birthdays were celebrated for all employees and awards for employees of the month were given. schedules were changed from 12-9 which isn't for someone that has a family. Other then that i looked forward to coming to work with a good attitude and ready to work.
good,"The training in Walgreens is wonderful, they take the time to show you each process of everything you need to do.  If you needed time off they would work with you.  As a manager you are given opportunities not only in the store but the pharmacy as well.  The pay is very fair, the benefits are awesome.  If you ever needed help they were always there guiding you and helping you along the way to make sure that you understood.  They are a very employee first work place."
good,"Walgreens is a great corner store in every community that offers amazing customer service, cheap prices, and just an all around good atmospehere. I worked at Walgreens until I became a shift lead. My day cosisted of opening and closing the store, helping the public and working different departments of the store."
good,"I started out as a part-time associate, and because I would agree to come in to work when co-workers called out I was bumped to full time.  I learned at Walgreens that I had exceptional sales skills.  We would have items each moth that we would have to push for suggestive sales, and I was the top suggestive sales person every month that I worked for Walgreens and one of the top in the district I worked in."
good,"A typical day at work included working the register, helping customers and stocking shelves. I learned a lot about cosmetics and product placement. the management was fair and helpful. the workplace was fun and fast paced. the hardest part of the job was moving product shelves. the most enjoyable part was assisting customers."
good,"Communication from higher positions, as well as with other employees"
good,"Typical day includes greeting customers, customer service to find and locate products, stocking shelves, operating photo lab equipment and preparing orders."
good,"Great hours, great location, fast Pace environment, great manager..fun work place, great customer. Fare wages.vacation pay.sick pay.work around your schedule"
good,"Working at Walgreens was so refreshing. Being young and new to the job, working at a fast pace meant the job wasn’t boring. I suggest studying pharmacy material so you don’t have to ask as many questions and you’ll be able to work more smoothly."
good,"unlimited sources to seek help when needed. positive team members, offered training, fast paced, the ability to practice multi task abilities, customer service skills, meeting the needs of others, working as a team, performing computer skills, communication with healthcare professionals, management offers a lot of flexibility."
good,I loved working for Walgreens because I had an amazing team. In order for a pharmacy to run smoothly and achieve daily goals is solely based on the team. My team was the reason I enjoyed going to work.
good,Retail pharmacy is not for the faint of heart or timid. But the patients that come in and bring a smile to your face make it all worth it. Great group of people to work for as well.
good,"Management was good, scheduling was easy and flexible. It was easy to get along with everybody i worked with and we were able to have fun while working."
good,"Walgreens Co. really prides themselves on getting their employees ready for the next step.  Walgreens is a great place to retire from, they have great benefits,"
good,"Pleasure working with the company , had a lot of fun and learned a lot about everything."
good,"The job at Walgreen's was okay there was a lot of safety training, and sales goals, sale strategy, and overall price changes on a regular basis. I was hired as a service associate with the intention of being in the pharmacy. It was not their managements intention to get me into the pharmacy. Had I known I had no opportunity the job would have ended much sooner. I watched as they hired new pharmacy technicians after 3 years the manager let me know that I did not have enough hours there to be in the pharmacy not asking me in the beginning would I be willing to add more hours to get the opportunity. So unfortunately I felt led on with no progression and eventually fed up and gave my resignation."
good,"8 hour work day with 2 days work from home. Great benefits and if paired with the right management team, work can be a dream. Workplace environment is very relaxed and easy going."
good,"Work in any community pharmacy is hectic and can be hard. It requires you to move quickly for extended periods and multi-task effectively, while maintaining absolute accuracy for patient safety. Mistakes can be costly. Walgreens has it faults -- under-staffing the pharmacy is a widespread problem. Communication is sometimes very poor or even absent. Quality of management is inconsistent from one location to the next. However, corporate resources for employees abound, if one knows where to look, to resolve conflicts with management, and employees are protected by a robust non-retaliation policy, structured and extended disciplinary process, employee improvement program. All management from the bottom up are expected to promote from within before hiring, and cross-training is a valued effort. Team unity and group problem-solving is prioritized. Licensure and certification are pushed as soon as possible and reimbursed for the technician position. Transferring locations is typically without obstacle, as an established technician is always preferred to a new-hire. Let it be said clearly: It is not an easy job, and corporate can often disappoint, frustrate, even enrage! But know your benefits and protections, get involved with your team, work hard and improve yourself, and you will find your efforts rewarded."
good,"The store at 16th St and Glendale in Phoenix, Az is amazing from the  GM on down all the employees there are happy and up beat. It broke my heart to leave them and if it were possible I'd do it all over again just have been able to work with them again."
good,"Great first job, coworkers were friendly and welcoming. Simple tasks and responsibilities. Customers at the location were nice and welcoming. Reasonable scheduling."
good,"Walgreens does a great job of appreciating they’re employees, no matter the position. Pretty good with fixing problems at hand whenever a situation presents itself. Good benefits."
good,GOOD company to work for. Team work is not always used. GOOD   learning job. THE pharmacy is great and also have great tech pharmacy which  all members are of management must do .I work photo lab reciveing .I had to two in th pharmacy every day. I did 5min meeting every morning.
good,"Over the years, Walgreens has changed.  It is not about thinking and growing, but it became about doing things like a diagram.  Individuality was not encouraged at the end.  I have had great managers and not so good managers, but it is about if you can learn to adjust to mediocre managers."
good,there is always a task to do which is extremely helpful because i like to be busy. more organized environment  and very reliable co-workers. customers are typically satisfied with their experience and regularly visit the store
good,"A typical day at Walgreen's would insist in me making sure I have the correct amount of money in my drawer to start the day off with,make sure all the cigarettes and coolers are full to capacity,and make sure all the clothes products are folded."
good,"Very flexible hours, with an amazing staff. Not stressful what so ever. Nice little benefits such as paid time off, and holiday pay. Would recommend to a friend."
good,"Great company with plenty of benefits. Great place to work at. Staff and coworkers awesome to be with.  The hardest part of the job (although, not a hard task)  is dealing with insurances and not being able to resolve issues right away and not being able to release medications to customers. But other than that no cons on this company"
good,"Typically we all work together on the floor, everyone learns multiple positions at the store so things are more flexible. I've learned how to build multiple things in the photo department. I've had to learn about their specific technology and machines, like their registers and kiosks for photo, the photo machines and how to change paper and turn machines on and off, how to use scanners for inventory. Time management is important along with organizational skills because of organizing bays and stocking and keeping things neat in storage in the back. Working with others is important, they care a lot about the customers so either you really like people or you're really good at pretending to. Walgreen's feels a little more warm fuzzy and personal compared to a massive store. We have regular customers a lot. It's a nice work place if you have good management."
good,I enjoy the flexible schedule and being able to maintain a positive and open-minded relationship with management. I also enjoy the many benefits that comes with the job.
good,It’s very quick pace job. You’ll always be helping people find something. You’ll be busy with things around the store. Co-workers are always helping each other out.
good,Fun workplace. Great job for Younger or older person. Pay was too low to be a full time job for me. I worked about 20-25 hours per week as a second job.
good,"I am very glad I chose to complete my pharmacy externship at Walgreens. They were very lenient and understanding with me throughout the entire experience. The faculty were always chatting and making me feel like I had been working there forever. I learned customer handling, communication, and quality working skills. The management were very nice. They made sure to help me when I needed it and loved teaching me how to do things around the pharmacy. Its workplace culture was always a genuine caring for one another, whether it was patients or co-workers. None of us were/are judgmental, we are empathetic; we always try to put ourselves in the other person's shoes. The hardest part of the job would be getting there. I had a lot of car troubles during my duration of the externship but the pharmacists were thoughtful and understanding about it. The most enjoyable part of the job was building new friendships and connections and being able to help out patients."
good,Always an opportunity for advancement if you show initiative and hard working skills with strong attention to details and professionalism. Never enough payroll hours to cover all the team members in order to have all the work done.
good,"The hardest part is working short staffed "
good,Walgreens is a great place to work at. I would recommend everyone to work there. The pay is good & so are the hours. The management & employees are so nice & helpful.
good,"I learned a lot such us inventory, cash reports, and many more. But most importantly is Team Work. Working on a certain task as a team works more effectively and efficient."
good,You meet different people you get to help folks feel better and know that you contributed to their improvement of health. Having fun on a daily basis.
good,"My schedule varies from opening shifts and closing shifts. The work done is almost the same everyday, with a few different jobs in between. The best part about working at Walgreens is that I get to help everyone who walks through the door as best as I can."
good,This is a quiet friendly place. The management here is great. They are decently nice people and they are pretty lenient with you with everything you have to do.
good,"Typical day at Walgreens, very busy at my location. Quick paced, awesome customers and employees. Hardest part was watching customers be rude to management. What I enjoyed was the positive environment of working together and learning to keep the store going at the best of my ability."
good,"Me encantó trabajar para la empresa ,aprendí junto a mis compañeros una experiencia extraordinaria con Muchas ganas de haberme quedado en su empresa ..gracias por permitir laborar junto a ustedes"
good,"Fun Environment, "
good,"I would answer the phones, talk to insurance when i needed to know why they weren't approving patients medication. Help the Pharmacists with any tasks that needed to be done. Fill the prescriptions when they would come in. Type the prescriptions when the doctors would send them to us electronically or by paper with the patients. Ring up the patients medication at the registers."
good,"great place to work but lots of policies, shifts go by quick but they ask a lot from  you for the wage you get, management was great and parties lots of the time for successful retailing"
good,I loved my daily actives at work and helping others.  Great customers and crew.  Everyday was a great experience and I built relationships and strong bonds
good,There are a variety of tasks that you can be assigned to. Not everyday is the same. Great opportunity to gain customer service skills and cash handling experience. Management will work with you to adjust schedules if needed.
good,I loved working because of the management.  The benefits is great. Overtime is welcome.  The hours is great and flexible.  Awesome teamwork.  Good with competitive areas
good,Great place to work. Learned alot from experienced managers. The training was very detailed and they took the time to train me. Most of what I know came from what I learned at Walgreens
good,"Much like working in a restaurant, most retail stores boast of having flexible hours. They claim to be willing to work with both your class and extracurricular schedule. Some stores may do this, and it's a fabulous set up for you at Walgreens the hours were extremely flexible"
good,Greeting customers as they walked through the door. Helped customers with complaints and always remained positive. Management was awesome and understanding.
good,"I actually loved being at Walgreens but, even with me enjoying been there the management had gotten to be very overwhelming, the store manager was a very immature man who did not know how to run his own job let along trying to tell us how to run ours."
good,"Great first job "
good,"Great opportunity for Advancement"
good,"This work environment is a fun, exciting, and stable place to work. Everyday task are never the same, which makes it interesting. Team work is always there, whether it is on day shift or night shift."
good,Management was very friendly and helpful. Online education to enhance your skills was available and required. It is a physically demanding job requiring working the register while stocking shelves. Doing store cleaning at the end of the night shift. The hours are inconsistent fluctuating between day and evening shifts which affects your sleeping habits and daily schedule.Management was flexible when time was needed off work with advance notice. Staff is treated in a respectful manner. Benefit options are available which the company matches your funds. It is a good place to advance your career.Overall I would rate it as a good company to work for.
good,if you want to work extremely hard and make some money walgreens is a good place to start but the more you move up the less chairs there are to sit in and the pharmacists will get promoted before anybody else.
good,"Working at Walgreen's was a great experience. It wasn't to stressful, hours were consistent and I was treated nicely by management. Even if you don't like talking to customers there are jobs for stocking and doing inventory"
good,"This job was easy. They gave me the hours that worked best for me which were the night shift. This job wanted me to become assistant manager, but I had to go back to college."
good,"the work was very easy and not complicated.  I learned how to pretty much run a receiving dept in a warehouse.  The management was not perfect, but definitely did a great job overall."
good,Great atmosphere and people.  Love working with the public and my customer.  Convenient location.  Collaborative work environment with friendly staff!
good,"A typical day at Walgreens consist of restocking the shelves making sure every thing is properly faced, Walgreens is really big on customer service and making sure every customer is satisfied."
good,"Great business, friendly staff, always something to do, and the opportunity to advance and learn hands on; whether its in the photo lab, cosmetics counter, or pharmacy lab. Stress free environment."
good,"The copany is good and well organized, benefits are good, retirement execellent, but some of the managers are so bad they undermined their assistant managers.The worse did to me is to lie and set me up to fire me because am black and intellegent, hardworking and earning $20.00hr and as a good future."
good,working for walgreens is very exciting;busy paste(just the environment I like).friendly and family like pharmacy.every one care about patients and each other.need better pharmacy management.
good,"It is an amazing place to work at, I would definitely recommend it for my friends if they need a job. I had a lot of fun and great time working there and I hope I can come back soon."
good,This was a nice place to work that it gave me the experience on a lot of things that I can use for future jobs I would most definitely recommend it to a friend
good,"Walgreens is a fun, friendly place to work at. Weather you work in the front(cashier), photo, cosmetics or pharmacy, everyone communicates with each other to ensure great customer service. Managers are great. You can also transfer to another department to learn more about Walgreens in another area. Overall Walgreens is a convenient place to work at."
good,very positive environment and a job i would love to take back. the managers where amazing and very organized. i loved being involved with the customers and being apart of such a great team
good,"The work is so fun, this is my favorite job I have had. You stock products, assist customers to find products, rotate product, organize stock room, face and clean store, check customers out, and set up endstands and endcaps."
good,I appreciate the exposure to learn working in retail.  I really enjoy people and working with the public.  I like making people feel special.  I like learning new things
good,"I loved working at walgreens. I had great managers! I think the best part was getting to know your customers and employees. They become part of your family. Walgreens could pay their full time and Shift leads a little more, but its retail! Overall a great retail place to work!"
good,"I loved working here and would suggest this to anyone the people are cool , management is pretty cool , getting to know people is all fun and productive."
good,"A good place to work overall. The only reason I plan on leaving is my family is moving to a bigger area. Other wise I believe I would stay with Walgreen's in Platteville, WI."
good,"Good job for someone who does not require a large salary, great starter job. People are very nice, you receive discounts as a perk of employment. Learned a lot about retail from working along side Walgreens."
good,A typical day would start at 8 am i would begin the starting process on the photo machine and setup my work area. my associates and managers were always professional smiling and ready to start the day
good,I LOVED THE FACT THAT I CAN DO SO MANY DIFFERENT JOBS IN ONE COMPANY. I enjoy working with people and helping so many customers that come through. YES
good,I never would have left. Great career most rewarding job I have ever had. Love the coaching training.........................................................
good,"The Clinic Managers do a wonderful job and are always available. "
good,the work is simple and easy to understand. The other employees are always happy to help new-comers. Customers are friendly and regulars become friends. Turn over rates are low. Plenty of chances to advance and/or get raises. Good benefits even for part time. Overall great job.
good,"Fun, easy going environment. Can get very busy with lots of customers in and out. Management is ok, but shift leads are great. Fun work environment, not stressful."
good,"this company is a great place to start off your career in the pharmacy, if you are looking for a fast paced enviroment this is the place to be. I loved it!!!"
good,I worked as a technician for 5 years. They gave me my start in the field. They sent me to PTCB classes and paid for my testing. The staff was great even when customers were rough sometimes. We were like a big family. The front store staff is wonderful along with the pharmacy staff. The management respects the employees and goes above and beyond for us. You can always walk out of there with some crazy stories. The pay could be better but what you lack in profit you make up in relationships. The discount is great and so is the profit sharing options. They also are very accomidating with schedule.
good,"Working at Walgreens has been a honor. It was very fun for it to be my first job interacting with hundreds of different people everyday. Working long hours , standing on my feet and being held accountable and responsible to handle tasks."
good,"Good company to work for, great benefits I was trained in different departments, therefor could cover more than one area, I enjoy working and conversing with my customers, when I was head photo, I was in charge of 1 department, ordering , fixing any problems."
good,"Working at Walgreen's means, you always have something to do and/or something to learn. If it means learning more about the floor, or the photo department, people will be willing to train you."
good,The work itself is not difficult but can be a little stressful when you cannot see your cash register while you are stocking.  That is my worst complaint when I worked there as a cashier.
good,I enjoy the hours and the great customers but mostly the young ladies I work with and for! Best group of people I have been with for nearly 20 years! They let me dress up for Halloween!!
good,"There's always room to move up in the company, it's an ever changing enviroment and Walgreens does it's best to keep up with trends of the day. Walgreens puts alot of time and effort in training and as long as the person getting hired takes it seriously they will succeed."
good,"Started out as a cashier and quickly moved up to beauty consultant. "
good,"I enjoyed working for them. It fast working, I ready to come in with a smile when costumers come in. I would say the enjoyable art of the job would be helping people find what they are looking for. Hardest part for me was making for the code and the product were in the same place. Management was great about there workers and i learned a lot from them also with costumers."
good,"A relaxed, positive environment with comprehensible tasks and fair hours. respectable coworkers and a flexible manager. Learned how to withhold expectations and provide help to those who were in need."
good,"Customer service and sales"
good,"I was in charge of the beauty department. We would compete with other regional stores for sales and customer satisfaction ratings and were raining champions for quite a while. It was my job to assist customers with their needs, give general information about products, sugest products that would work for the individual customer and provide fast and effective check out service as well."
good,"like working at a typical pharmacy. fast paced. the work is easy if you know what you are doing. The only reason why i left is because for a company who's main purpose is pharmacy, grocery store technicians start off at a higher pay."
good,"It was a great place, great coworkers, great management. Every work day was fast paced, and nonstop moving all day. Although it was very busy, the job was fun. Everyone got along well as a team. If you ever need help or a second opinion about anything everyone was willing ti lend a helping hand. The atmosphere was great. There was no negativity from any of the staff, just great support."
good,"short breaks, told me they would schedule me morning hours on a permanent shift then placed me on evening and graveyard shift without choice. Transfer you to different  stores without notice,"
good,"Walgreens has really helped me tremendously! From learning pharmacy, to becoming a supervisor. i would definitely recommend this place to anyone. Benefits and discounts are great."
good,"I have been employed at Walgreens since 1-11-2011. I have enjoyed my time here, the team members make my work place a good environment. Working in different departments made my Career more educated, I have learned a lot. I would recommend Walgreens to anyone."
good,"I had a great experience at walgreens, overall rating for the walgreens i worked at was 5 stars. every one was very nice.walgreens is a very busy business. customer service is tops"
good,"was my clinical rotation, had a great time for the most part. i got to see return customers a month later which showed me how much i had learned in the short amount of time i was there"
good,I had a great time working there. workers became like family. still interact with many old workers. managers still ask how I am doing and make sure I'm still looking for a career.
good,"I loved working for walgreens, I had a blast. management is awesome. never one had a problem. compensation is a big problem. no advancement because of over saturation"
good,I love the staff that I work with! They are like a second family! We have one of the best managers and is very kind and caring of us as a person. Great company to work for!
good,"filling prescriptions and selling said prescriptions to customers was my main job, handling and maintaining inventory. the hardest part of the job was it being busy which would increase the chances of a mistake taken place so i definitely had to stay alert at all times"
good,It may have gotten busy in the summer but it was located by the beach so it was expected the management was good really understanding of there employee needs
good,it was a fun working environment. I enjoyed helping customers develop photos and all staff was easy to get along with. I would recommend this job to anyone needing a part time job.
good,"As an intern, I was overwhelmed with the workload and my coworkers are barely helping with the work. It taught me to rely more on myself and observe others on how they manage orders."
good,Exciting workplace. I enjoyed the environment and coworkers and management.  I learned important skills. I enjoyed my customers.  I loved the ability to advance from within.
good,Family sraff store manager awesome always something to do. Wish harder working employees more hr. Customers were awesome. Hours were perfect. Cool people work there
good,It's a wonderful first job for anyone. Walgreens definitely gives people a chance to learn how to communicate and interact with customers and coworkers. It helps that they offer employees a 15% discount.
good,"Walgreens as a company is a great place to work. As a company, they take care of their employees. Their company is set up for individual success if the employee desires."
good,Enjoyed working for walgreens and have no complaints at all. My time always flew by and pay was great and management was fair at all times and friendly.
good,"Day usually goes by fast, always having something to do and very productive.The management is pretty decent, usually very easy going good at giving directions."
good,"Walgreens is an overall good place to work. My store always felt like home to me. We had a strong bond and a lot of teamwork within our store. The opportunities my store manager offered to me were great. I was given the opportunities to travel to different stores and collaborate with new team members, and I was also given the opportunity to learn within our pharmacy and even obtain my pharmaceutical license."
good,It is nicely put together. Felt and straight to the point. My job was laid back and customers are like family. It was always a nice and clean environment. Happy and healthy was always the motto we lived up to.
good,"	Prepare and process a wide variety of shipments; pull and package merchandise. Operate pallet mover and picker to transport, stage, and store freight. Load and unload trucks, perform cycle counts, and utilize computer to track shipments and inventory."
good,"During my time at I learned excellent customer service. Daily, I worked on monetary sales, and inventory. Promote certain products, and meet goals doing so. I helped in all departments of the store. Including the pharmacy if needed."
good,I love working at Walgreen's.  The pay and the hours are the only down fall.  It is minimum wage and you work as though you are an expert and have responsibilities of knowing what medicine over the counter people are looking for when they describe their symptoms.  You have to ask for training if it is available.
good,"It is a fun place to work, coworkers are fun, and I enjoy helping customers find the products they are looking for. I wish I had more hours, and that I was less busy outside of school and could work more!"
good,"A typical day at walgreens , well anything and everything would happen . Their was good days fun day and bad days but over all it was a great place to work at. Meet great funny people, during my time their was fun i loved working hard everyday and taking to co workers and giving outstanding customer service."
good,I was there the night someone was shot in the parking lot and had to wait for the police to let us go. Had a customer fall in the parking lot and the EMS had to be called due to he split his forehead open. Had the truant officer at the local high school come looking for kids.
good,"A typical day included coming in and facing shelves and helping customers as they ask. Some days, I'd help check dates on products, stock newly delivered products, or run the register. I learned store upkeep and new technology to complete my duties. The management was respectful of my physical limitations and let me sit when I needed to. At the end of our training, we could have had the opportunity to become a permanent employee. The hardest part of the job for me was the physical aspect. The most enjoyable part was cashiering."
good,"A typical day at Walgreen's would consist of assisting customers, managing inventory, and working assigned task that are assigned daily. Task are subject to change based on dependency and reliable, but overall great work environment."
good,Nice place to work.  Supportive co-workers.  Need to be extremely flexible due to the work schedule hours given.  Ongoing education is available with mandatory courses.
good,Decent enough place to work. After I left the pharmacy full time my schedule is much more variable and subject to change but I can't complain because stress levels are much lower on the floor.
good,Nice work place very steady and easy. No one is stressed. If there was an issue the team strategies solutions. Management also recognizes all progress.
good,"Few issues early on with scheduling, but it was right after they got a new scheduling software. Hours are always available, but was working full-time hours without full-time title or benefits"
good,I learned how to conduct good management because of what they taught me. And because of the good atmosphere I was able to advance to what I wanted to do.
good,I loved working for this company and it was a shame when they had to lay me off. I loved my coworkers. It was a fairly easy job and paid rather well for being such an easy job. I was able to snag as many extra shifts as were available. I let my managers know that I could pretty much work anytime. and they allowed me.
good,"if you like fast pace, and a wide range of job duties then this is the job for you. Insurances, data entry, customer service, and working all under the state and federal laws this is a great experience to acknowledge the drugs of sorts and the combo variety. Ton of job duties as prior authorizations with sorts of Insurances, dealing with doctors offices. ""Customers appreciated you if they knew you went out of you way to get them a great discount or the prior authorization."" It was great when they gave their words of gratitude and rewarded us with treats. Seriously Walgreens has the most updated Software to assist not only the patients but the staff. Once you compare to other retail pharmacy software, you'll totally appreciate how far advance and easy. I've worked for Walgreens 2 times in my life and the Management has ""always"" been great. They have some great pharmacist and technicians. That are the best of the best. I've done Hospital pharmacy and Retail pharmacy and they both are hard jobs. The enjoyable would be all around from management to coworkers in Pharmacy and throughout the store. Everyone works as a team, I can honestly say there are days of short staff, and shortage of hours. But when you have a solid crew then it's alright. Team work is the most powerful source and being appreciated by patients and management go's a long way."
good,Walgreens was a company that was fast paced and constantly kept you busy. Management was easy to get along with as well and they supported you and had your back when difficult decisions had to be made. The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying a customer's request.
good,I was fired for something that I should've been just put back through training but the boss at that time didn't see it that way. But before that everything was great from the costumer to employees I had the pleasure meeting and working with.
good,"It is a very fast paced job, but that makes time go by faster. You talk to over 100 customers daily and verbal communication skills are necessary. The management there are really caring."
good,"thats about it, not  a lot to say. some say mr cottonfot jim slithersinto the egg basket at night to wet his whistle on a dirty rock. others say its just a plastic bag stuck on a stick."
good,"*Arrive to work, receive instructions (they prefer to give instructions cause each day has its own needs), get to work immediately, welcome/attend/help each customer, work at the register, lunch, maintain areas clean, ""do facing"" and close store with management."
good,"The Pharmacy in Walgreen's is a stressful, yet rewarding experience. As a technician, there is little advancement unless one wishes to take the next path of a pharmacist. It is definitely a place I would recommend to anyone that likes chaotic, while organized environments."
good,i haven't worked for walgreens in about 6 or 7 years. well it was pleasant the manager was great the hours were great. it was challenging and i am always up for a challenge. i love meeting new people so that was great.
good,"I had a very nice time working there, I learned how to communicate and work well with my coworkers and customers. It was a very calm and positive environment, of course it would get tough and hectic at times, but I feel like those instances were handled well."
good,"Good management, friendly faces, easy to understand tasks, and was pretty flexible. I really got a lot of experience out of this and I hope it helps me in future job choices."
good,"I learned to be patient while helping people. I worked mostly in the photo department and that was difficult, but in time I found the job to be very satisfying and enjoyed my time there."
good,"How I wish to go back to walgreens!! What a great place to work with great working environment, friendly coworkers and you get cross-trained to work in every position even pharmacy! Work can be heavy on truck days but on other days everyone has their own role and gets assigned multiple tasks to complete throughout the shift. If I could go back to work there, I will in a heartbeat!"
good,I liked the fact that it was across the street from UC Berkeley Campus. The students were so friendly and I loved helping them. I had such compassion for them.
good,"This job is a good job for a high school student looking for better pay than a minimum wage job. There is a lot of repetitive, keep busy work, and little time to actually engage with customers."
good,"Walgreens made me open up to the world, I had to greet everyone coming and leaving... I amswered the phone and point everyone in which direction they needed to be going. We helped people take out things if they needed help (it wasn't mandatory) but it was being nice. I loved working there!"
good,walgreens requires a lot of mini projects that requires time managements. its a friendly enviroment and very productive place. management is great and thoroughly trains employees in every skill.
good,Good Company but not enough pay. Need better management. Great benefits in the company. The hardest part about working for Walgreens is that we have to take the slack for working harder because short of employees because of no hours to give..
good,I loved working for walgreens. i learned so much and became a great aspect to my job knowing even more ten what i was hired for. i moved up from working photo to knowing the entire store even pharmacy.
good,"Very fun place to work, great interaction with  customers. Was able to advance and received great educational tools to do my job, also excellent benefits."
good,"working in beauty department consisted of "
good,great place to work depending on your  management team. PTO is accrued based on hours worked and you get great health benefits and profit sharing. Sometimes you do feel like they hold you back from advancement to suit their needs which is a little off putting especially since they preach that they want you to advance in their company
good,"There are opportunities for advancement but it is very limited and it takes time. It seems that overtime will never be available even though most days seem like help is needed. But lets say someone call out and I am already at 40 hrs for the week management will not ask me to stay. Management would ask someone with about 15 hrs, not because the employee has less hours but because the employee has under 40 hrs. Got me?"
good,I was in the process of doing my externship for my pharmacy technician training program that I completed at a local community college.  I complete 120 hours as required by my program and it is a suitable working environment.  I gained the skills and knowledge I need to function in the chosen profession.  Now I'm looking to become a pharmacy technician at any pharmacy where I can benefit from my experience.
good,My Walgreen's family meant a lot to me. I will genuinely miss being with them. My manager was fantastic. Couldn't have asked for a better crew of people.
good,"I worked walgreens as a second job for awhile I enjoyed working there, holidays were extremely hectic but over it's a good company. Management was fairly laid back as long as your were being productive, and some were helicopters but there was a balance so it worked."
good,"Loved working at walgreens. Woud not mind going back there to work. Awesome co-workers and management. ALways willing to help each other out, never had much disagreements with anyone. There was alway an opportunity to learn new things."
good,Walgreens is a great place to work. Management works well with you around your schedule if you are going to school. You will be required to usually work on the weekends and holidays but OT/holiday pay is offered.
good,"I mainly work at nights and manage over the cashier and help out with the pharmacist in the back when ever they need me. On a typical day its just learning how to remodel and get the store looking new for another business day to have customers want to come back especially when you have the good deals for the season popping out at you as soon as you get in the door. The workplace doesn't discriminate on cultural believes as long as your comfy to want to be a part of the time is all that will keep us moving forward even if you do want your a lone days still isn't a problem but I will try to get a smile on your face before you leave your shift. There really isn't any hard part to the job to me considering that working at nights i typically get the same things mostly every week. However, the most enjoyable part is to see new customers and being able to change up the store to make benefits like you can express yourself and think outside the box."
good,"It's very busy work, there's always something to do, never a dull moment. The staff are amazing and the customers are great. Corporate, not so much. They micromanage everything and make the job a lot harder than it needs to be."
good,Great customer experience. Learn a lot from the managers. Team work is really important. Flexible hours. Work 7 days of the week. You'll have to get more than 30 hours a week for 2 to 3 moths to get the benefits.
good,"A great place to work especially if you plan on entering any PharmD programs. Primary responsibilities were to assist patients in retrieving, filling, and refilling prescriptions. Fast paced depending on the time of the year. Learn how to process insurance."
good,"filled prescriptions, stocked shelves, loaded prescription filling machine with bottles and medications. Handled register taking payments for prescriptions. Checked customers ID's to ensure the customers were getting the right prescriptions"
good,"This was one of the best jobs I had. I would have loved to stay if management was not so horrible. It was easy some days, and fast others, but never too much."
good,"Busy all day taking care of customers needs. How to put into consideration regarding our customers and co-workers needs. Being pleasant to them even if they were going through something needing attention and direction. Loved my managers, got alone with them. Fast paced work place but enjoyable. I loved and enjoyed our customers. Till today I still keep in touch with some of them."
good,"As a Customer Service Associate, it's more than just working the register. You have to answer the phone, do the inventory, and manage the displays. Inventory can be a handful especially if you don't have enough people on the floor managing the store while inventory in being done. Ad tags can be a handful especially in the cosmetics section. The store is always changing due to constant resets but make you at least learn where each section is located, people will ask you to help them find things all the time. Your experience at Walgreens will depend on your store manager so no Walgreens is exactly the same."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Walgreens but it really depends on what you do there. Register isn't that great as you don't get as much freedom as working the cosmetic counter or photo counter. With cosmetics and photo you get more freedoms to help a manager with a project, help customers, organize the back or stock shelves. Coworkers made it really fun though."
good,"Keeping up with Technology and innovations."
good,Walgreen's' is a great place to work everyone is very supportive and encouraging.  It's a place where not only do you get the opportunity to develop others but in turn you get the opportunity to learn and grow.
good,i would be the opener cashier i would stock the coolers then dust n sweep the area. go thur check dates on food and candy. then prosess orders in the photo lab take passport pics
good,I worked her in between deciding to go to school. The work environment was good. The pay is not that great and it takes a long time to climb the ladder.
good,A typical day at work included me stocking my department and making sure it was clean and helping customers find their desired product. I also had to make sure i hit my sales goal every night in my department.
good,This is a very easy job. I really enjoyed working there. I would help customers find items they were looking for in the store. I would work a little bit of the truck that would come in. Make sure the photo orders were under control during my shift. Put up the sale signs and take them down. At night I would recover a little bit. You are there to make it enjoyable for the customer and to make it easier on them. Hardest part of the job was that I would run out of things to do and the pay. Pay was minimum wage. Best part was everything else. Managers are all very nice and help you out when you are having trouble doing something.
good,"Loved working in the pharmacy at walgreens, some things are confusing and may be hard to understand but its a lot of fun. You learn so much everyday you go in."
good,I worked with customers so that made my day go by pretty fast.  I loved being a cashier and seeing new faces. This was a great experience for me as it was also my first time working.
good,"Great company"
good,"Walgreens has offered me many networking experiences and unlimited opportunities for growth. I have built strong professional relationships with my district manager and with the area manager. It is a fun environment to work in, but also fast paced."
good,The work at Walgreens is very exciting. Helping others with sale choices or savings for the week is ongoing every minute.  Management is helping and training is awesome. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting the customers.

good,"-A typical day at walgreens is having to work in a positive environment while learning about retail "
good,"Everyone who is apart of the Walgreens team interact like family. Everyone knows each other on a personal level, and we all have become close friends. The work load is simple and easy to handle, and the management is very accommodating to everyones needs."
good,"At Walgreens Specialty Community Pharmacy, I spend most of my time with the LGBT community and built many relationships with patients. I gained knowledge on specialty disease states, especially HIV/AIDS and Hepatitis C and learned the importance of showing empathy toward specific patient populations. A typical day at work is following up on refill reminders to make sure patients get their medications on time. Adherence counseling, side effect management, and disease state/medication counseling are all important parts of my job."
good,A stressful job may always be subsided when you have a team that makes you feel relaxed by substituting work into fun and laughter. Working with a team always makes the work easier.
good,"You will be challenged to improve yourself while working at Walgreens but you will also be given the tools and training you need to do so.  Walgreens is a great company that is continually investing in it's employees.  You will work hard and much will be expected of you but you will be well rewarded with your pay and benefits.  There are also a lot of fun activities throughout the year to participate in and you will form lifelong friendships with your co-workers. Management truly listens and implements the teams ideas.  If you want to move up in a company this is the place.  All you have to do is show up, have a willingness to learn and you can go from cashier to shift lead in no time at all."
good,This was my first job. I really enjoyed the staff and management. I think it was a very fun and smart first job. I got to Learn how to handle money and deal with many different types of costumers.
good,"I enjoyed working at this Walgreens in San Jose because I got to work in a very friendly environment.My job was to advise customers about products that meet their needs. However, the location was not safe."
good,walgreens is a great place to work there friendly they make it as though its a family company.they am to please and anyone would love it. I would reccomend this job to anyone.
good,"This was a training course through my grade school. I am forever great full for this experience. Working in retail has taught me more about customer services and customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers with anything they may need to finding things throughout the store shelves. I also liked  working the cash register, which I was ringing the items that the customer has purchased."
good,"Working at walgreens was one of the best jobs i've had. It wasn't stressful, very"
good,"Our job as Pharmacy Technicians blends with customer service as well as technical competence. Being able to assist the customers with insurance issues as well as getting the computer system to process the information in order for us to fill their prescriptions is only one of our tasks. We also have to divide the work load among everyone and work as a unit in order to help the multitude of customers, as we efficiently providing them with the medications that they need."
good,"Maintained a balanced cashier’s drawer and closed with a zero negative balance, greeted customers entering the store and assisted them with various request, provided an elevated customer service experience to generate a loyal clientele base, described products to customers and accurately explain details and care of merchandise."
good,"Walgreens is a nice place to work, they help you build a balance between work and life with flexible . i was initially employed as a part - time employee but i later requested to work more hours as a full time employee , even though the hours were not available at my store, i was given the privilege to work additional hours in another nearby Walgreens to meet up with my need. When the hours became available at my initial store ,i was scheduled full time and had all my hours within my store. The management is very considerate ."
good,The company is great and treat the employees amazing This company has helped me grow into the person i am today. I would recommend working here the culture is great the people are great

good,over all i loved working for walgreens unfortunately my time the was cut short but i would go back if offered the chance. i learned so much and i am very happy that i had the chance to be part of the company
good,I have worked for this company when it was a debt free company almost 14 years ago.  I am really good at merchandising and working in customer service.  I worked my way into management in 2009.  In 2012 after working hard to prove myself the company took the position away and we had to step down to a Shift Leader's.  I then moved to 3rd shift to make extra money.  I was in charge of store conditioning for the next shift and assuring store operations ran smoothly.  I would help my pharmacist when needed and helped with inventory control and price management.  The thing I enjoyed the most about my job was merchandising and stocking the store.  I made a lot of wonderful friends here and will always appreciate everything I learned from it.
good,"I participated in a 5-week externship at Walgreen's as part of my Pharmacy Technician program.  We were not paid for this training.  The pharmacist was very knowledgeable, and his team of techs worked well together.  They all accepted me, and offered information on how the pharmacy was run.  I enjoyed my time there."
good,"Walgreens is a great employer, there are very few job advance opportunities. Meanwhile for entry level technicians it is a great place to start learning and growing in your career."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job as an Externship student was getting to know the pharmacist and the staff members. I enjoyed working as a team and providing the best customer service.
good,"A typical work day would consist of working the front register, as well as being able to go back and forth throughout isles in order to straighten them between customers. Other days you may get scheduled to unload the truck and stock shelves, or you may even be placed to work the cosmetics section of the store."

good,"I really enjoyed working with the employees and the Pharmacist in Charge, Everyone was treated equal and respected."
good,This was for my externship I mainly fill in pills when ask by the pharmacist. Most day were busy some days were not. Some stuff would upset the pharmacist because they believe in perfection. Even if its just a little error.
good,"Everyday was enjoyable, coming to work was well worth getting up from bed. All my coworkers were always ready to engage in any conversations and making me feel welcome since i was new."
good,"The staff was great and they were very patient with me when starting out."
good,"I have been working for Walgreens for almost 3 years now, and it has been a good experience. As a full-time college student, Walgreens has provided me with good opportunities and benefits. Management works with my schedule, and the hours are also pretty good. The hardest part of the job is getting used to the inconsistency that there is. Meaning that there are different types of customers, and that requires some getting used to."
good,Walgreens has many great programs going on to move the company forward and they are very open about involvement and open for new ideas from staff. They do use or try ideas from within and treat everyone with respect. The management was very upbeat and I enjoyed making and striving to hit my sales goals for the day/week. Unfortunately I only parted with them due to a pay and position increase that would not allow me to stay part time.

As far as management goes everybody was about business.I loved working with each and every person I worked with at Walgreen's. The hardest part about the job was some of the people could not afford their medication. Sometimes depending on what the medication was i would pay out of my pocket so the customer could get their medication. I loved every minute of the job. It is fast paced just how I like my work environment to be.
good,"A typical day in the Pharmacy consisted of opening the gates in the morning, entering controlled substance prescriptions due that day into the system, doing morning counts on drugs that we have in stock to keep our numbers correct in case we need to order more.  From there we would focus on filling incoming prescriptions throughout the day which numbered anywhere from 300 to 500 per day.  We are also required to run a drive through and the pharmacy front counter where we would work with customers on insurance claims, doctor approvals, and consultations on drug interactions as well as entering for immunizations."

I enjoyed mostly, assisting customers/tourist from all over the world and trying to sell them a product while they knew zero english. Some sharades worked."
good,"I learned how to have patience with customers, respect different opinions and let go problems I could not control.

I am most satisfied with my job when I am able to make a customers experience at the store pleasant."

Working as a cashier I improved my multi-tasking skills; while ringing up the customers one has to welcome every customer to the store and man the customer service phone line.

good,"At the time I worked for this company I learned so much and it really helped me come out of my shell and develop my own personality to better serve my customers. The company is a great company to work for. However, the management they put in place towards the end of my time there was very unprofessional and honestly abusive in ways. Other than that I learned so much from this company and would go back in a heart beat."
good,"Usually, I go into work and count the safe and get change for any register. Throughout the day I work on various tasks including changing displays and coaching employees on new products and how to approach a new situation. At the end of the day, I count down all the draws and manage other closing tasks."

good,"I have a history of being teamed with people who care about and are willing to invest the effort into succeeding, and my current experience continues that streak. I consider the managers (I've had) at my location to be mentors as well as teachers, each bringing a unique perspective and contributing to my experience an understanding of what it takes to keep a competitive retail operation running, through actions and through some pretty educational conversations. "
good,i loved working for walgreens. great people and a great company. i started as a cashier then i into the photo lab and was given the oppurtunity to travel around the region and reset stores in the area. when that was done i went on to become a pharmacy technician and then when i left i had been promoted to Sr. photo specialist

good,"I worked my way up from PT cashier to store manager by the age of 23.  I worked for excellent management when hired and for my first 5 years. I assisted as needed in every department of the store including many, many hours in a very busy pharmacy. "
good,"Good Culture"
good,"There's always a lot to do at work , typical day includes putting away merchandise and ringing up customers. Everyone there is wonderful, I love my coworkers, we're like a mini family. The customers are awesome, especially the regulars. I enjoy working for Walgreens."

good,"Walgreens is a nice place for someone to work if they're looking for experience in customer service. I worked at Walgreens for eight months and I loved working there, providing great customer service and interacting with the people I worked with."
good,"Pretty chilled job. Customers in the gables will always be a pain always wanting stuff for free and such. Nothing is free in this world haha. I learned to cashier and stocking and overall I feel like I'm the best in the store mainly because I work 5 days a week, sometimes 6 because they usually call me for overtime! Stocking requires a little bit of physical work not really that much like people say it is. Maybe if you work in a HUGE store but I work in the 3rd most busiest walgreens in Florida, I think. Truck is pretty easy for being the 3rd most busiest store. Management is pretty amazing. I feel like the store is being maintained very well and have the right people for the job. Co-workers are mainly a bunch of oldies because they usually avoid problems unlike the youngsters like myself. the Youngsters usually have a lot of problems like coming in late or just calling sick. Hardest job is just dealing with REALLY GREEDY customers. Enjoyable part is probably talking to customers because most of the time I have interesting conversation with most people! mainly cause I'm really likable."
good,"This was a great work Environment, that focus both on patient care as well as productivity.  There are ups and downs, but I felt as if the management actually cared about each individual that worked there."

good,This company encouraged me to go to school. They were able to work around my school schedule. The management was good and the company was successful.
good,"First thing to do was to count the office cash to make sure it was in balance at the beginning of my shift. Meet with the store manager to see what my tasks and the other associates tasks were. I would let the others know what to do and if it was done we could leave on time. I would go about my tasks until an associate or customer needed my assistance. There were days I would Open the store or close the store. Never had a problem with my team, all worked well together. Some days went smooth, some would be hectic."
good,"I enjoyed learning new things at this job, the co-workers were very helpful and worked great together as a team that welcomed you and made you feel like your family."

good,I enjoyed working for this company. They take care of their employees and their families. Very up to date with technology.
good,"At Walgreens I would stock shelves of new merchandise, scan items to locate or mark down, and also clean the store. The managers at Walgreens were very welcoming to me, and always found jobs to keep me busy. A typical work day would start by finding a manager to tell me my daily duties. I would then get a cart to fill with whatever merchandise they wanted me to stock, and get busy. If I finished before the shift was over, I would ask the manager for another job. I learned that I really do enjoy going somewhere to do something during my day. It was fun to get dressed for a job, and I felt accomplished when I completed my assigned tasks. My co-workers were very helpful and accommodating. They were always there to answer my questions, and I felt like I was a part of their team. The hardest part of my job was reading the small printed numbers on the UPC codes, but I found a way to overcome that obstacle. The most enjoyable part of the job was using the scanner gun. I also enjoyed the smiles on the faces of my supervisors."
good,Walgreens has been a great place for the past 5 years.  It gave me an opportunity to learn about the retail industry and also allow me to use my skills in all my tasks.  I am a floater in all departments including working in the Pharmacy.  Manager has allowed me to grow by teaching various skills and also learn to appreciate our customers.
good,"Provided assistance with the customer, Handling medications and refills. Walgreens Enviroment was very warming and each day was excited.  The company expect a lot from the employees but gave us bonus and show great appreciation during the holidays. The most enjoyable part of the jobs was knowing I was appreciated on the job."
good,"On a typical day I would stock or rearrange shelves when I was not checking customers out. I learned the importance of customer service and how being friendly can make or break a persons day. The hardest part of the job was getting everything perfectly neat by the end of the shift between checking out customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of knowing that the customer you helped left happy. They are the corner of happy and healthy. I wish I still worked for them ""sometimes""."
good,"Have managers that I can come to if there's a problem at work, enjoy working there. The managers always have my back when there's a problem with customers."

good,Customer service is very important at Walgreen's. The shift leaders were great and friendly. The managers were understanding and attended to everyone's needs appropriately. All and all I had a great experience working for this company.
good,"A fast pace environment most of the time, depending on your store, where you have to know whats going on constantly or you WILL fall behind. Most of the day your dealing out medications to patients or counting pills, then the other parts consist of scanning, typing, and filing prescriptions, solving insurance errors and calling for consultations. It's a place you have to be up for working hard and following the rules, not to mention paying attention to what you're doing constantly; mistakes are potentially life threatening in this workplace and aren't ever taken lightly. Though one of the upsides, apart from time going by really fast because you're always busy, is the satisfaction of when a patient is totally satisfied by your service, like when you solve an insurance problem that prevented them from getting the medication they need to live. It's very rewarding in its own way. I would definitely recommend this job to anyone that takes pride in their work and holds responsibility close to home."
good,"I loved my job at Walgreens. Although it involved a lot of repetitive tasks, I was proud of what I was doing. I learned a lot about pharmacy operations.  I was satisfied with management and their support.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was the physical labor and sometimes heavy lifting.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having the opportunity to make a difference with my contributions, including attention to detail, knowing I was providing a valuable service to the patients."
good,"•	Currently have Texas State Board of Pharmacy Technician Trainee License (expires 09/30/2016)"

I would set up my money drawer, restock my front end products, clean front end counters, greet customer when entering the store, assist customer with finding items, assist customers with checkout, balance my money drawer and restock items upon closing."
good,"A typical day consists of opening or closing the store, overseeing employees and their tasks, training employees on how to properly do their job. Most enjoyable part of the job is your co-workers. Walgreens hires some of the most amazing people and they will support you no matter what. ."
good,"My time as a Walgreens customer service associate was fun, productive, and challenging. A typical day at work consisted to the area assigned by the weekly schedule, as well as any other projects the manager needed done for that day or week. Being a team player is a big part of getting the larger jobs completed efficiently, and made the workload more enjoyable. The most enjoyable part of the job was the different rearrangement of the store, it keeps the job from becoming dull or staying the same. The store changes appearance with new promotions, seasons, and holidays and that keeps the atmosphere alive."

good,Had good relationships with co-workers and managers.Enjoyed providing excellent level of customer service to customers.
good,"Most of the co workers get along. so it makes it easy to get along and make work easy. Every day is a learning experience with new insurances, new patients with new medications. with the exception of a few managers they all do pretty well at helping when help is needed. Because we all work so close to each other and we need to communicate a lot of information. we have all become pretty close kind of like a little family. It gets difficult to deal with a lot of upset customers. we never know if they will come in mad or get mad because of an insurance problem or us not having some thing in stock. But by giving patients options most of them understand. It is always a plus to go to work with people you like and get along with and even more when you get customers that you know and have build a relationship with."

Being in this situations, you are always on your feet and learning something new about the store or company. The hardest part about being a manager, is always making sure employees understand what their expectations are and what needs to be done today. Its not always easy to make sure everyone is on the same page, when everyone works different times, The best part of the job is that there is always something new happening with a customer or coworker, there is never a dual moment. "
good,Walgreens' a fine corporation that serves the community well.
good,This is a good company to work for and I give this company a 5. I enjoy working with the staff and I have learned a lot of skills. Working In the profession helping customer in anyway I can.
good,I enjoy working for walgreens
good,I was able to work for Walgreens as I attended college. they were more than flexible in accommodating my schedule.
good,"Customers of all ages and cultures visit our store for health and personal reasons. They seek out advice and product knowledge from our team. The management is great and always keeps the team stable to the best of their ability. Everyday consists of customers first, store maintenance, inventory, cash handling and merchandising in the cosmetic department. The easiest and most enjoyable part of this position is building and maintaining strong relationships with customers/guests in order to help keep business strong. The most difficult part is the constant changes in how the company operates and frequent merchandising alterations. However, it is easy to adapt."
good,"I was not an employee, I completed my Externship of 110 hours there."
good,"I enjoyed working for Walgreens they have great benefits for full-time as well as part-time employees. I enjoyed working with a fun and creative group of co-workers, and the customers in my area was warm and friendly. I think the most frustrating part of the job was being on your feet for 8 hours and only receiving a 30 min unpaid lunch break, when you should have received a 30 min unpaid lunch and a paid 15 min break. Other than that the managers were great and emphasized team work to be productive as a whole."
good,"Check the over nght camras,I learn to more alert, My boss was a out going Person he use to come pick me up for work, The other workers where nice and helpful, Catching people stealing and having them locked up, The part of my job I like was my boss and the co-workers."
good,"Productive fun place to work for, great pay the people and co-works were enjoyanble. Would work there again,"
good,"I started this job as a cashier , and i worked my way up to a assistant Management, I have learned many stuff in this company, merchandising, advertising, Sales promoting, Supervising, Reporting, Loss Prevention. I get along with everyone at work, i am a fast learner. To me there is no hard part because whatever is given to me i will learn and give my best. I enjoy being part of a team and part of a well respected company . I have put all my knowledge and skills to keep maintaining the reputation of this company i work for . A typical day at work would be Merchandising, Cash Handling , helping customers with any type of problem, setting platforms for special products, Loss prevention , Supervising group of employees.Opening and closing the store."
good,"Entered prescriptions into the computer to be filled,"
good,"Working in the front office here was very interesting. You begin to learn more and more about the pharmaceutical part of the medical field, and what diseases require what kind of medication. The management is very kind and fun to be around, and your co-workers were polite and more than willing to help. I think that the most difficult part of the job was making sure that the calls that cam in were transferred to the appropriate people, especially when those few that called in were unsure of who they needed to talk to in the first place. The most enjoyable part of the job was, quite honestly, the people I worked with. They are an awesome group, and I would recommend this company to anyone."
good,"Fill prescriptions and provide customer service. Extremely busy. Prescription filling process is approximately the same with all pharmacies but i have learned to use a new dispensing machine and compunding equipment at Walgreens. Definately learned how to be more patient and manage customers better due to the high volume of customers we have. My co-workers are great. We are all good at working together. Managment has been good so far. The pharmacy manager as well as store managers are good at helping when needed and providing employee personal assitance too. The most enjoyable part of my job I would have to say is that no matter how hectic, as a team we can all laugh throughout the craziness. Also, I enjoy being up to date on all things medicine."
good,"There is never a typical day at Walgreens, whether you are stocking shelves, doing revisions/resets, merchandising, inventory, or simply providing efficient customer service. I came into the store only knowing how to provide excellent customer service and learned all the necessary functions to become a team lead. Management has been very helpful as well as co-workers. The hardest part of the job is when truck comes in because there tends to be very heavy items I have to take off the belt. The most enjoyable part of my job is being in constant communication with customers."
good,The co-workers were ones that you had to be careful as to who you spoke with. Overall I enjoyed my time at Walgreens.
good,Best managers and coworkers you could ask for. Kept me busy and taught me all the essentials to working alone and as part of a team.
good,"A typical day starts out with evaluating the employees I have coming in writing a list of daily/weekly/monthly objectives. I then delegate out that list to both clerks and lower members of mgt. I have instilled multiple levels of empowerment and training to ensure that the overall team is continuing to develop and run efficiently. I work at the busiest location in downtown St. Louis, which carries daily challenges with both employees and clientele. I very much enjoy the location and the challenges, however, Walgreens, while a tremendous company to work for has very much saturated the market and advancement revolves around people quitting and getting fired rather than one's performance. I have received a performance rating of Exceeds Expectations the last 2 years and very much enjoy all aspects of management."
good,My team mates and managers are wonderful! One thing that is tough to get threw some days is the patients yelling at you about the price of there medications when we have nothing to do with the price and assume that we do. Keeping a smile on my face at all times is wonderful for me to help me know they are truly not taking out on me. Yet I love the smiles I get from them when I am able to make there day when a medication is ready for pic up and when they come in state that they love my voice over the phone that it is always so friendly!
good,A great company with an outstanding staff and very helpful coworkers.
good,great staff and company to work for. workers were great and management was good

good,"A fun team to work with and learned a lot more about cash handling process and also teamwork. Every night to close the store we have to clean all the lanes in the store and until the store in neat and clean we cannot leave. Teamwork was a major part, since being the youngest in the team. I volunteered to do most of the work because the other people working with me were above 30, 40, and over 60 years old. But together we still managed to clean the store everyday and managed to finish our shifts at a convenient time."
good,"A typical day at work would include the tasks of retrieving prescription orders from customers that came into Walgreens, counting; pouring; measuring; weighing tablets and medications,"
good,"Typical day at work consisted of inputing prescriptions into database, fill and file prescriptions accordingly, operate drive thru window and register in store for pick up/drop off and restock products that were used. I learned how to multi task in a fast paced enviornment and still be able to work under pressure. The managers and co-workers that I worked with were very helpful, understanding, and friendly from day one. The hardest part of the job was converting some of the prescriptions into a liquid dose amount. What I enjoyed most however was just the opportunity I was given to learn more about a career that I had been looking into."
good,I have enjoyed my short time at Walgreens but I took the job to help pay my bills from college. I am looking for something more career oriented.
good,"For my externship hours that i completed was 140 hrs and the environment there at walgreens was very fun, fast pace, and great people to work with. I had a great experience and learned alot for the employees there."

good,Typical day at walgreens is helping and serving customers to the best of my ablility. Providing them nice quality pictures. Unloading and packaging truck once it's delivered. Lifting up to 50lbs daily. Dealing with management/ co-workers are the best.
good,work consisted of packing products into boxes putting on conveyor belt and picking product to be packed and shipped.most hardest part of the job was staying on your feet for hours.i enjoyed working with my co-workers.management seemed to be concerned about the workers as human beings and not just workers.
good,"This job was one of my favorite jobs, because it actually offered all kinds of benefits and medical. Everyone was friendly and understanding, and the chances to excel to next level was greater too."
good,It was a very nice and less stressful place to work for back in the day but I must say I learned and experienced a lot my years of employment with the company. It made me very productive and dependable .
good,"Love it, and miss it, great friends, Money and benefits was the best in the business."
good,Great customers
good,"typical work day is fast sontantly moving from one stations to another keepin baker cells fully stocked ,answering the phone and filling prscritions in a timely manner. keeping pharmacy clean and shelves stocked on a daily basis"
good,I can always ask questions and someone will always be able to answer for me. I learn and grow everyday.
good,"I worked at Walgreens for 5 years of my life and I can tell you that even though the pay was not good, I came away from Walgreens with great work ethics and friends for life."
good,Friendly atmosphere in which I have developed several relationships. They are great with working around my class schedule. The only reason I am looking elsewhere is to expand my knowledge and experience new things that will help me in the long run.
good,"Work in dialy basic with services issue on Windows Base PC, Windows Base Server, Linux Base Server, Lexmark Printer, Cisco Router and Switch, Fuji Photo Labs, and Wireless Com. The most enjoyable part of our job is that we received constantly updates and new equipment wich developed ours skills."
good,"I worked in the photo department, I greeted customers stocked shelves handled money. Assisted managers with nightly count down. I have opened and closed the photo department. This was a fun job but as a single mom with 2 kids I needed more income. I have nothing negative to say...."
good,"the retail pharmacy is a great experience, i did my externship here, great atmosphere and we were always busy"
good,"Clean, fun work place. Nice management. Friendly employees"
good,"Walgreens is the best job I ever had. I enjoyed the management staff. I would have enjoyed the opportunity to stay. Unfortunately, Walgreens was not hiring at that time."
good,"Walgreens was one of the best jobs I had. Working here I learned so much. You meet someone new everyday and it is always busy. I loved the atmosphere. It was always clean, very inviting, and a wonderful place to work. The hardest part about the job was seeing so many sick people come in for meds. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. Here you were able to build a rapport with the customers. The hours were flexible and management was GREAT!"
good,Everyone socialize with everyone. Very pleasant work environment.
good,8 hours day
good,"Good place to work at, friendly management good career opportunity."
good,Walgreens is a great place to work and shop. I enjoy working with great co-workers and meeting new customers that sometimes have good advice or stories to share.I have learned good time management and multi- tasking skills since I started working there. the most enjoyable part of the job is seeing people happy and knowing that i was able to help. There really isn't anything i do not like about Walgreens
good,I loved this job. They worked around my schedule and taught me alot of basic need to know details of the retail business
good,I was an intern during the summer at our local Walgreens store. The internship allowed me great managerial experience and hands-on knowledge! Would recommend their internship program to any student!
good,"They say what they mean.This company is all about pleasing the customer,and they give you choices on holiday work schedules.Everyone works together,without high pressure"
good,The environment was laid back and productive. Never a rush to get anything done or accomplished. No strong push to sell products. Employees and staff were very friendly and easy to work with.
good,Overall this us a very good company to work for. This company offers execellent benefits.
good,Great place to work. Competitive salaries. Wage increase every 6 months. Great benefits. Friendly co-workers. Will train new employees.
good,Fast paced environment with excellent training. Advancement opportunities abound for self motivators.
good,"Processed new prescriptions and refills, work in drive-thru. Made phone calls to insurance company and doctor office. Costumer services and cashier. Good place to work."
good,"Depending on your store manager, you can dye your hair any color and have piercings. For me I went in with natural hair color because I wasn't sure of their policies until later on. It's best to ask lots of questions, even if you think you know how to do something ask just to double check."
good,"I work specifically in the specialty pharmacy. Clear advancement, encouraging boss, boss wants staff to succeed, great staff, learning a lot. Pharmacists will take the time to help and work with their staff. Travel is hard from NH to Boston, working with multiple pharmacist (7) can be hard to learn all their preferences."
good,I greatly enjoyed working at Walgreen's. It afforded me the opportunity to apply problem solving skills & the ability to enhance customer experiences.
good,Walgreens has become one of the reasons I would like to go back to school.  Working at Walgreens pharmacy as a pharmacist is my next goal. I would recommend Walgreens for a person of any age.
good,"Possibilities are endless so what are you waiting for. Excellent benefits and fun, supportive people to work for. Balance family-work life. Easy to internally apply for positions for advancement."
good,"at this place, you're always on your hands and feet because the amount of patients that come in. you're always learning something new and co-workers are super friendly"
good,"The managers at Walgreens was amazing. The pharmacists were so full of knowledge and worked hard to help other employees. The only downside of this job was how stressful it could be in the pharmacy due to customers, but the staff was always respectful to customers and employees as well."
good,i enjoyed working here for my externship; management was very nice and helpful along with the employees; they seem to really have a great relationship with customers
good,"I spent most of my time in the front as a cashier, I did task like stock the front registers items, clean the front, and they had a chore chart that was mixed up everyday. They occasionally forgot that I was upfront and I didn't let me off in time to do my chores, so I had to rush through. But other than that, I had a great time."
good,Good work place great customers great coworkers management is very understandable and flexible plenty of room for advancement employees are long-term and knowledgeable always friendly and ready to help out either any questions you may have
good,They are a great place to work. Have wonderful benefits for their employees. Do however tend to work odd hours. But everyone becomes like a family. Overall great place.
good,"Starting pay needs to increase and pay should be better over all for the work we have to do"
good,"Walgreens was my first job as a teenager. I really enjoyed the experience and learned a lot that is still applicable in my everyday work. It is a good company that offers, discounts and benefits. The work environment is positive and I would recommend working here."
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens because I felt welcomed by my co workers and customers. I learned how to work in the warehouse and was given patience whenever I was learning something new.
good,This company is a great one! I’d recommend this branch to anyone. I wish I could’ve stayed longer. I left to have a baby. All of the co workers were friendly.
good,A typical work day includes working with customers in a very fast paced environment. The work is challenging and exciting. The job offered an opportunity to work various tasks.
good,"Walgreens was a fun place to learn more about working with a bigger staff, as well as a bigger walgreens. I had the chance to see what the needs are for tourist weekly. The customer service was the same for me and the service I try to provide. Thank you."
good,"Amazing support from management, great people, constantly have upward movement and they push and encourage you to make your way up the chain! It’s busy so you’re constantly moving so shifts seem short and easy!"
good,customer servie is top prioity ! i learn new things everyday  my mangement is very great the work culture is great the hardest part of my job is when there is not a part in my job i love a challange .
good,I learned how to use a cash register and how to face a store. It was a great experience but it wasn’t for me. They worked me too many hours for being a minor.
good,"It’s not anyone’s dream job, but I’ve had a great run so far. "
good,"Working at Walgreens is a great place to work if you’re looking for a job to make a career out of. My favorite part of the job was interacting with people on a daily basis and providing customer service promotion is completely unbiased and is given in a timely manner. Plus if you become a manager, other managers show you the ropes and are very patient"
good,"Cool job and great atmosphere..... the pay is decent, sometimes it’s slow paced, but it picks up around holidays.......I loved working here. The store manager is awesome."
good,"My experience at Walgreens was at times stressful considering that it was previously a Rite Aid pharmacy. However, overall the experience working at the Glenwood Springs location of Walgreens Co. was very relaxed and not too demanding of an average every day worker."
good,It was a great place to work. It has it moment. It gets stressful as any job. When you have phones ringing customers in your face yelling it seems to get to you
good,"I loved working at Walgreens! It is a smaller store so you get to know your coworkers pretty well, plenty of opportunities to advance your career, and the store was set up in a way that it was pretty easy to find items that were needed."
good,First I have to say it was a school program that allowed me to get this job and it was not permit but it was a amazing place to be at and the coworkers and managers where the best a lot of work got done and the shift were not bad at all I highly recommend this job to the highest degree.
good,It was an amazing job to have. I enjoyed the company for its growing experience in Customer service and becoming a team member. The customers were great.
good,Fun and fast paced. Pharmacist was very nice. Walgreens will pay for you to get your pharmacy technician license as long as you first have a trainee license
good,"If you're looking for a great retail work environment Walgreens is the place to be. Associates are like family, management is supportive, the store stays well kept and organized. Daily/weekly goals are clear and simplified. Employee discount is generous."
good,"The typical day for someone in my position consisted of:"
good,"A day. at work never felt stressful and every employee walked into work with a smile, ready for the day. Management made sure to train me right and explained that if I did not understand something they would further explain. Walgreens is definitely"
good,My experience in Walgreens was a way to show me how a working environment is like and what I should prepare for in the near future and I hope my experience can be of any help.
good,Really enjoyed worked at Walgreens. The people and culture were fabulous and I still stay in touch with some of them.  Leadership is good as well. My manager was spectacular!
good,"Mostly busy."
good,"It was a great place to be at, you were always busy with something to do. I learned that you really need to manage your time well. My manager was the sweetest person on earth. She was very reasonable. Everyone was nice there. Hardest part was looking for a time to stop and chill for a second. In all it was all great."
good,"Team work is very common as employees work together most of the time. I learned and processed all digital photos, films and reprints. Received in coming and out going calls. Helped customers locate items on shelves. It was had to process ink and wet lab products like films and prints because of the side effects and bad odors of developer chemicals. When dry lab was installed at work, it was the best place for me work."
good,Easy to get promoted if you work hard. District management takes concerns seriously. If the pharmacy is closed due to a major holiday the store should be too. It’s not a vital service and does not not help work/life balance.
good,Walgreens is a great company. It's always evolving and finding ways to stay on top of the game and help improve customer experience! The pharmacy is where the money is for Walgreens. Prices are inflating. Product availability is expanding
good,"Walgreens was a great company to work for, good benefits, great hours, and awesome management. Only downside was not much room for growth within the company."
good,Very friendly staff and management. Great customer service was offered. Benefits for the position are very much appreciated. Work ended due to it being a ROP internship
good,I have been with Walgreens for 3 years. I love the customers that come in. There is always room to advance just depends on what you want to do. Yearly raises are a bonus too!
good,"good workplace for people who want to work hard. "
good,"I started in high school and I quit this year. I loved everyone I worked with, management was wonderful, and I couldn't ask for better. I would highly recommend."
good,I love working for walgreens. Walgreens is a great company and work experience. The customer are wonderful and it’s a stress free environment. Management make sure all employees are comfortable and well trained.
good,I've worked at 2 different Walgreens and helped out at 4 others. Each Walgreens has their own environment but it's a good one and you feel good going to work.
good,Working at Walgreens was wonderful! I really enjoyed my job. My bosses were the best. They always took care of me. People would come and go but where I worked it felt like family.
good,"Awesome company to work for they are fair with their hours "
good,"In a day at work in the pharmacy my duties are to interact with patients, dispense medications, organize and clean the workplace, and assist the pharmacist in any way I can. I have learned attention to detail, patience, and knowledge of medications. I would say that the hardest part of the job is the pressure of making sure every pill count is correct because it can affect the life of the patient. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the knowledge gained in this line of work. Another enjoyable part is the personal relationships you build with the patients."
good,"Best company that I have ever worked for. Currently inquiring about going back. They host community evens (relay for life, etc) very good culture and management."
good,"Hard work and long hours , but rewarding work.  Excellent pay, great benefits and chance to transfer to other cities/states are easy within the company. You are given the equipment to do accurate work and had great check points to prevent errors. When working in different stores , everything was arranged the same and workflow was easy to follow."
good,"I've been working for Walgreens for a while now, and have become more and more accustomed to working as a Photo Technician. It's an enjoyable department to work in, especially after learning how to make several of the products, such as magnets, canvases, wood panels, photo cubes, and posters. I also do other things such as taking passport photos (I work at a Walgreens in North Phoenix that is right down the street from a location where people go to get passports, so many passport photos are taken), and taking in traditional film orders. A lot of time is also spent helping customers on the kiosks when it comes to loading their photos from an external device and helping them put together their order. Overall, I enjoy working as a Photo Technician and will definitely continue to develop in that department. FedEx and Western Union transactions are also done in the photo department, and since developing more in photo I've become more accustomed to those things as well."
good,At Walgreens there was never a dull moment. It was fun to work with different people but at times it can be difficult. Everything was fast paced. Your always busy.
good,"Lucked out in my first store with a great management team. The next store was a bit disorganized, but still a fun job depending on your willingness to get along with coworkers."
good,It's not a negative experience and the fact that managers want you to improve and do your best drives employees to better themselves as workers and as people.
good,"I loved working here.  They were very flexible in general but rarely offer set schedules that's the only negative I have, oh maybe pay alittle more as it is a multi billion dollar company.  "
good,"walgreens challenges me, I was able to grow and learn, i earned experience with different customers and different problems. I was able  grow and become a better person."
good,"A better place to work at for the beginners where they can learn and grow for further advancement opportunities... but only if you are committed and have passion for to show how much you care for every customer that walks in to the store whether you are a main cashier, photo clerk, beauty care associate, or a pharmacy tech..."
good,"Friendly staff, flexible hours, management was understanding. I had some medical issues while working there, the manager was very understanding, and even showed me the resources the company had that I could use."
good,"It's a great job to get as a cashier , that's all you do is ring and there isn't much to the job , it's just a basic cashier job. If you decide to be able to be in pharmacy, no hours would be present."
good,"Walgreens was my first job and I would definitely say I was lucky to have it as such. Co-workers were like a family, but the clientele added quite some stress. Most customers were fair and kind, although we did have some bad apples that seemed to enjoy ruining your mood.  I believe this strengthens the bond between the Walgreens family, and taught me valuable lessons on how to deal with stress."
good,"Needs more unity , and fairness . People there only seem to care for themselves so you must do the same . Older employees get special treatment compared to the newer employees"
good,"Very good work environment at times, team players ,but can be a lot of talking and less work so managers have to redirect at times,customers are very nice"
good,"While working at Walgreens, I was in training for a position. The various duties included processing of prescriptions and receiving medications upon delivery, restocking pharmacy medication supplies."
good,Great place to work and get some experience and if your looking to move up in the company there’s room for promotions. The employees are very welcoming and friendly environment to work in.
good,"This job is such an amazing first job for a teenager. Managemyis super great to work with, they are very reasonable and understand that life happens. It can get stressful at times but that is the territory of a retail job. Hours are pretty flexible. Coworkers are super nice. Over all a great job. I don’t know about being a life long career. But for a teenager it’s great."
good,"Nothing to say. I really would rather not put how my job was, as I feel I am not in the right to say how a job at Walgreens fully represents, compared to what others could say."
good,A typical day at work would consist of meeting with Manager to find out what needs to be done to complete daily duties.  Training new employees.  Solving customer problems.  Maintaining store inventory.  I learned a new inventory system at Walgreens.  I also learned more about customer service.  I also learned about what a pharmacy does and their rules and regulations.  The management at Walgreens is diverse and have good training. They also offer to advance career from current staff.  The workplace culture is the same as most retail outlets.  The hardest part of my job was to train old employees on new ideas.  The most enjoyable part of my job was learning the new inventory system.
good,"I loved working for Walgreens as a beauty Advisor.  Working in cosmetics was fun, enjoyable and you basically worked on your own with very little supervision. Setting up cosmetic displays was challenging but fun."
good,"While I had this job, I was single and without children so I didn't mind the extra hours. But there were times where I needed a day off and as long as I found a co-worker to switch with and we both agreed to the shift switch the managers had no problem with us changing. The managers were also great in letting us as customer service associates create displays and promotional aisles that we felt were better and then they would oversee the work and if it worked out for the customer experience it was kept. I also got many different opportunities to open stores and work with new products before others and also was given the opportunity to oversee a department at the Flagship Store in Hawaii."
good,Great company to work for I spent 3 years at Walgreens basically grew up with the company I was promoted several times within months of working for the company.
good,I spent 3 years in Walgreens as a csa and a sfl although it can be frustrating at times I always found that my team would find ways to make the days fun. Staff and management are great worst part is dealing with annoying customers.
good,Nice work place everybody is friendly and willing to work with you no matter what it is get payed a good amount for someone who doesn’t really have any responsibilities such as bills etc. good for college students that way they can be making a bit more money for themselves
good,I've been at Walgreens going on 4 year's now and I love my team they so far have been the best company I have worked for. Every employee is caring and compassionate. They help their employees exceed in their work and drive them to be the best they can be.
good,"All pharmacy duties required, and must focus on customers, and must be abel to type in perscriptions, and must be reqquired to bill insurance to correct them."
good,The pharmacist was professional and took the time to explain what needed to be performed for tasks as a Pharmacy Technician. The team at times could get stressed but overall everyone took the time to complete the tasks they were assigned for their position.
good,"I have been with Walgreens for almost 15 years. Its been a great company to work for, however, in the recent years, there have been many budget cuts, pay cuts, and the talent is lacking."
good,"the atmosphere at walgreens was pleasant. I saw the regulars that would always go. they knew who I was, always said I was friendly and helpful. the employees would always ask what they needed to do, management always had something to get done that day. the hardest part of the job was when we are short staffed cause we didn't have that many fillers or pharmacy techs."
good,"In my opinion, Walgreens is a great company to work for. I had been an employee for 10 years before I moved here to CA, and I would love to work for them since I know the software system but so far I have no offers, which makes me sad that a great company like them letting go of an employee, who worked with them for 10 years. I started as a technician, then soon was promoted to Certified Senior tech, then I started Pharmacy school and became an intern. Close to graduation, I was the only intern who got promoted to be Graduate intern out of nine interns total. I was blessed but then I had to move to CA. I believe in this company and would love to be a part of it again."
good,very stressful demanding and takes a special kind of person to work under these conditions. I float from store to stores to help out other places as well as my own.
good,"I was only there for four weeks and I learned a lot about pharmacy operations. The only thing I was not allowed to do was handle the cash register due to liability reasons. But I learned every other aspect of the pharmacy aspect in a friendly, professional environment."
good,I was a lead photo specialist and I loved every day at my job. I was severely disappointed when they got rid of dept lead positions. This limited my pay and I had to make the choice to seek employment elsewhere.
good,"a typical say at work would be stocking and having store presentable. "
good,"Fun work environment. Fast paced so your on your feet go go going alot but overall a great job and people to work with, customers and coworkers alike."
good,"My review is only tailored to the Walgreens I worked for.  The whole store and everybody in it was a wonderful experience!"
good,"What you're looking for is Walgreens. They will care about you, guide you towards promotions if you're willing to make the effort, and are sad to see you go."
good,Walgreens cares and provides multiple advancement opportunities.They pride themselves on team engagement. They are more than willing to work with you and build you.
good,A typical work day starts with clocking in the jumping to cashier to relieve a co-worker for lunch. After off to the back to grab a box to start stocking up. Once i needed at the photo section I rush over and help the customer with any question or need. The environment was decent i made a few friends that I still talk with today.
good,It’s a very nice and welcome place to work. The staff is very friendly and willing to work with anyone to solve a costumers problems and needs. Great staff
good,Filling prescriptions for patients. Handling orders and payments as well as the drive-thru. Reffering certain medications to the Pharmacist and for them to answer certain type questions to customer.
good,"Walgreens is a company that puts it's customers first and prioritizes them to allow their experience to feel unique. With quality customer care and the value that Walgreens shows it's employees, this company has allowed me to be able to share ideas and values and contribute to it as a whole."
good,"Walgreens is a good company to work for, and has many opportunities for advancement. I have gone to school throughout my pharmacy career and Walgreens has supported me along the way."
good,"Good place to work, nice salary, I did learn lot of stuff about warehouse work, lots of good memories, I worked there for ten years and probably I would be still there if it did not closed down."
good,"A typical day consists  of talking to doctors, insurance companies, and patients. I've learned many organizational practices and skills. I know how to defuse situations and rearranged multiple pharmacies to create an efficient work space. the hardest part was dealing with angry customers and not having managers to step in when they should. The job is not hard just a lot of work involved in it"
good,"A good place to start entering the workforce, but not much room for promotion or advancement. Great managers who encourage and help you learn new skills."
good,I loved working at Walgreen. This is a career for someone who is into retail. Great co-workers and nice environment. I would recommend this job at any given time.
good,"was amazing and i miss everyone there. the work environment was very lax and very laid back, but we were all hard workers who got the job done. i enjoyed the company from every worker there. "
good,"Walgreens is great company does everything by the book. Fixed schedules , depending on management you can get a little wiggle room if you have family or school. The pay is good once you become a senior floor lead, but you’ll be competing with everyone whenever there’s a opening. You could be with the company for years and make minimum wage until you hit management."
good,I love what i do and the people i work with. My coworkers have become my family. We help each other out when needing feedback and to train new employees.
good,"This was a great job, lots of room to move up and the management was professional. The main reason I left was scheduling, I was tired of working a shift from 2PM-10:30PM then having to work a shift from 7:00AM-3:00PM the next day. Other than that the environment was great we had daily meetings and supported a lot of charities which was fun to be a part of."
good,"- Managers were very understanding and caring about their employees."
good,Walgreens management and corporation really do care for their employees. The open door policy does hold true to this company. All team members always were willing to help each other out.
good,Walgreen's is a great place to work. the greatest challenges are dealing with the offhand moody customer and the low pay. Besides that you are generally given a generous amount of freedom to complete your work. Management is constantly reaching out to employees for there insights and opinions for feedback to improve store performance. Daily tasks are generally very repetitive and predictable. Hours are very flexible.
good,a typical day at work was putting candy where they go. i like the working the co workers was really fun  i love the job i learn how to work by myself and put stuff where they needed to be
good,Loved working here! Worked once when i was 16 and again when i was 27 and enjoyed both times alot of room for growth. Only issue i had was the ever changing goals that were set by corporate as many were hard to reach and sometimes made our store look bad to corporate even though we were doing really well. Ie not every customer wants to do a survey.
good,I was able to work 6 days on and 5 days off.  It was a great job to have overnight but when we kept having too many robberies at the store they decided to close the store down at 11 pm at night so that eliminated my night time position.  That is how I ended up at Kidacious. Plus I needed the experience for school as well.
good,After working for Walgreens for the past 2 years I have never experienced a more positive environment. I am always being pushed to excel and given opportunities within the company that helps push me to become a better employee.
good,"My day would vary, but mostly sales and customers service.  Heavy cash handling, and stocking products.  The atmosphere was great because to customers would look for me to tell them about our beauty products.  The hardest part of the job was on truck day, I had to pull heavy totes on a large boat and then put each makeup item and other cosmetic products on the shelves.  But the most ejoyable part of the job was selling and helping the customers."
good,"Great to be at pharmacy end not so much front end,  hours can be lacking and training is not long enough, management position are great that’s if though for front end"
good,"As any other company, there is never a shortage of tasks to be done. In this environment, we can get lots of work done with the customer experience in mind. Build friendly relationships with co workers that make the days very enjoyable."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreen's.  Love meeting and helping people with there purchase. Management was always helpful.  Great benefits, discounts. Room for advancements."
good,I truly enjoyed working at Walgreens as a CPhT. I learned so much there and it has also opened doors for other opportunities for me. On the job training is what I love most. I didn’t have to go to school for it and got paid good to be so young.
good,"Talking to customers and meeting new people was awesome!! Always something to do, from helping customers to cleaning , stocking.  Didn't like working in the evenings, preferred mornings! But the only way to get hire is to agree to flexible hours."
good,"Walgreen's was definitely a hard place to work. There was a lot of physical activity required from stocking, cleaning, running the photo lab, and making sure all of the customer's needs were taken care of. However, the culture of the people who worked there made it a fun and enjoyable place to work. Management was awesome."
good,"Management is very receptive to individual needs. After working for a while, the team members you work with are like family, they are very friendly and supportive. The entire staff works together to make the job run smoothly and provide extraordinary customer service. I would say the hardest part of the job is the amount of hours that are given to the staff. There are definitely times when we need another team member scheduled, but we don't have the budgeted hours to do so. I would say thought that the most enjoyable part of the job is having such a supportive environment. The team often holds huddles which empowers and inspires team members to be the best that they can be."
good,"I enjoyed working for such an upbeat community.  Like every job in retail, it had its ups and downs, however I would consider working for them again. They worked with my schedule for school and understood when I took my leave for the summer."
good,I was fortunate to be able to complete the retail portion of my internship at the same Walgreen's I was hired by. I floated between the 3 stores within our area
good,"My first job as a technician was at Walgreen's. I had never step foot into a pharmac, and after my time with this company I was not only proficient in working in a retail setting but in a hospital as well. I received excellent training and was given many opportunities for advancement."
good,"I really enjoyed coming to work knowing I would get to interact with people and as well as my coworkers, that was very exciting I also liked when I came to work there was always a new project to do each day, Walgreens taught me how to be more independent and how to always keep a smile on my face. I love the atmosphere that Walgreen's have always happy and welcoming. I would say the hardest part about my job was when a customer would have a question that I did not have the answer to but I'll always find someone who I know would be able to help. The most enjoyable part about my job was helping out and putting smiles on their faces."
good,"Over all, It was a decently fun job. I learned a lot. if you are younger and get a job like this, all of the older people will take you under their wing & help you figure out the job."
good,"I am all about of working atmosphere , appreciation and feel taken into account, welcoming of new ideas, continuous training, reachable and open door policy"
good,"Loved the company, never would have left if my store wouldn't have closed down. I liked the hours I was given and my boss worked with me on my schedule because I had two jobs. Good company treat there employees well"
good,"Great place to work"
good,"I enjoy to be part of my crew and how we work. "
good,Walgreens has a distinctive plan to make the Customers adore their environment. We were taught to make the Customers feel welcomed and provide them with Extraordinary Customer Care.
good,Walgreen's has truly been a blessing  to me and my family. The culture that Walgreen's instills in its workers is above all others. The focus on teamwork and team building skills place the company of Walgreen's above all others.
good,I really enjoyed working at Walgreen's. Management was very nice. They are flexible with scheduling and willing to work with you. Co-workers were nice too. Downfall was pay rate.
good,The store that I worked with has a very good Management. Nice culture. They care a lot about helping the customers. the hardest part of the job is having one tech most of the time while at least the work place needs two techs
good,Walgreens was a great place to work it was a very busy place you was always busy which I loved staying busy. I learned how to face Items and stock them very well and at a fast pace. I learned how to work with others at a very large store and company.the hardest part is that you always have to be fully alert because the place is so busy even at night I was working the overnight shift. You also had to be very flexable with your shift I had to work every weekend which I didnt mind Because I was always open my kids are grown.
good,"I enjoy the company and the environment, They are flexible with hours and school schedules if you are a student. You often get close to your regular customers and co-workers."
good,"The culture at Walgreens is a great thing to be around everyday. Everyone is willing to collaborate and work with one another. Working in the corporate office has some politics to navigate around, just as any other corporate job. I'm not sure how I feel about the new ""Frontier"" way of managing things. My boss ""DPR"" was an awesome person and manager in my opinion."
good,"Most of the time when I come into work, everything is fine until the rush come in. Most of the time our pharmacy is calling IC3 and nobody from the front wants to help us out. The custimers start to get mad and we explain to them that we do not have coverage and they go on a rant and call coperate. Most of the time it's not our fault we try the best that we can. It does get annoying when your calling for back up multiple times and nobody responds."
good,"A typical day at Walgreen's was faced-paced and fun.  This was an order distribution center and a cash cow for the industry.  While the facility was old, safety was a priority and accuracy for pulling was imperative.  They required mandatory overtime so each day was different.  This made the day fast and long.  the expectation was that you showed up to work and do a great job.  The culture was team focused and each area shared human resources.  My two area teams were fast and we often finished early and supported other areas.  I was a hands-on supervisor so I spent a lot of time on the line, picking, checking for quality and accuracy.  Dealt with employee issues, attendance and evaluations."
good,"Back to back calls."
good,"The Walgreens I specifically work at is comfortable. Theres 150 scripts on average done everyday, on top of that, we do patient calls to those who haven't picked up their meds, clean up, pull out expirees etc. I learned a lot over here regarding cooperation, team work, consistency, attention to detail, critical thinking. Management was superb. Hardest part was juggling work with school. I enjoyed getting to help patients."
good,Customer service is key at this company. The job was pretty relaxed. You had to make sure that each customer was greeted upon walking in and walking out. Shelves had to look nice and neat at the end of each shift.
good,"I liked working there had benefits, but I felt it was only getting busier and crazier the area where my store was with all the seniors of Sun City coming in."
good,I miss work there it been a long time the people u meet help around the we all have great customer service we got along well u have some up in down but for the  Most part of it it’s great
good,"A typical day at work included kind coworkers who helped if I needed any help, as well as customers who are in need of help or regulars. I learned how to work the photo department and how to organize the items. I really liked the managers because they were all helpful and I was able to have a connection with them. Overall, the culture was good. The hardest part of the job was dealing with hostile customers every once and a while. The most enjoyable part was helping the customers because most of them were really nice and personable."
good,"Run of the mill retail work, it was a bit taxing because it was a very busy store and we were understaffed for the majority of my time there so i'm trying to look at my experience there objectively."
good,It was a great place to work. The management there was fair and fun to work around I respect there kindness to me. work was not as hard the customer service there primary for those to take care each customer
good,"I really enjoyed working at walgreens, easy for a student who is in school looking for a part time job. great discounts and benefits, also learned lots of new skills."
good,"I enjoyed the customers that came into the store,they made the day or evening fun.Management was always coming up with contests against other stores for different charities."
good,I loved the company and my customers. I very much enjoyed learning all aspects of the store and being able to help out where ever I was needed. I was trained efficiently in each department.
good,Walgreens has a great work/life balance. I was impressed with the flexibility I was able to experience while being in school as well. Walgreens is definitely a no judgement zone
good,I enjoyed being able to do my externship here. Everyone was nice and helpful. The  work environment was good also.If I had a chance to do it all over I would.
good,"I found  Walgreens to be a fun, hard working, stressful, and etc. The people at Walgreens taught me how work hard and fast. To always pay attention to everything that is going in the store."
good,Despite it being my first job they were the best 3 years I've spent working the manager were amazing and the employees were just as good like! Leaving was something personally out of my power but I personally would recommend Walgreens
good,"I loved working for Walgreens, the pay wasn't the best but overall Walgreens is a great place to work. The staff and the customers are amazing to work with."
good,"One of the greatest jobs I have worked."
good,"Most days are fairly easy."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreens and the regular customers that would come in. My boss was a very nice woman and she was a good boss, kept things running smoothly. Overall management was well and they could definitely help you with whatever situation."
good,This was a nice place to work even though it was fast-paced.  Other employees and management enjoyed their jobs as well as I.  Management cared about you.
good,"A typical day was filling the containers for film development(before digital cameras), printing photos, counting cash drawer, before and after work."
good,"My day starts out by counting money in the safe and logging it into the computer and see if everything balances and hand out drawers to the registers they belong to. Then i do inventory and price changes and mark downs for the store. I also have to handle all vendors that come to the store and check deliveries and and sign for them after checking the products they bring into the store. I also answer calls to the pharmacy when needed so i have had to recieve my pharmacy tech license to be able to go back and help when needed to fill precscriptions and front desk and handling medications and giving them to the customers, as a shift lead you are to know all departments and that was cosmetics, photo, pharmacy and front end. we also had to work with FedEx and Western Union. The management was awesome and great to work with and being part of management was a amazing experience for me to learn so many different things that i now have experience in. My bosses and and employees were my favorite part of the job but the hardest part of the job was the hours and my balancing my life for my family."
good,This job was enjoyable and fast pace there was always something to do.  As a newly licensed pharmacy technician I was able to gain a very strong foundation of pharmacy procedures.
good,its cool too work here thats all i really have to say their making me write all this so im jus typing to get this part over with im almost there only a few more characters.... YESSSSSS
good,A great place to work if you like productivity at a relaxed pace.The management was always kind and helpful so I never felt bad for asking questions or asking for advice. The job also offers an excellent 401k plan.
good,"We would work hard but have fun doing so. I learned to use an electric pallet jack, a Rf scanner, how to run inventory, and how to us the intercom more effectively. the most enjoyable part of the job was the friendships I made while I was there, we were like a family."
good,"I enjoyed working for them, loved the employees they were like family there. Until i was working as a cashier, a customer took my money from register and ran out door and i screamed and employee came and ran after him. that was a no no he could of got hurt."
good,"Its a typical retail company, daily activities involve customer service,stocking, pulling out of date merchandise. There are different tasks for each position."
good,"So good, would go back if I could live off of it. The environment was great. The management was super. I could talk to them without feeling like they would punish me."
good,"Typical day at Walgreens is usually a calm one. See about a couple hundred people a day but never too hectic unless its a holiday."
good,It was a very relaxed environment and learning new things was easy. Management was great and scheduling was never an issue. Pay started out great but advancement was difficult.
good,if you work here you must be good directly working with customers happy or mad. customer service is a must along with basic mathematics skills of giving exact change and learning to rotate stock and inventory
good,I enjoyed working at Walgreens. Management was great. Nice place to work and comfortable atmosphere. Great location. *********************************
good,"I love working at Walgreen's. It honestly becomes like home. My only issue as a Beauty consultant is that there is not really Any chance of being promoted.  For example, the management positions are all taken,  and there's no way to apply for promotion at another store without your manager finding out."
good,"Management was super friendly, there wasn't a lot of associates so it was easier to communicate with everyone. Getting everything done with simple and fast. the only down fall is not receiving a lot of hours but its perfect for someone who just wants to have income if going to school or just wants a side job."
good,Walgreen is super friendly and very organize as well. Pharmacy tech have nice way to balance work between all area. They are good team players and help out. Even pharmacist Manager was very nice to help me out on my PTCB test
good,I really appreciated the patience and understanding of the management. Everyone working there was very kind and flexible with questions and helping out.
good,"the company is always looking to advance people from the inside, if they're willing. they are usually quite cooperative with scheduling, the more difficult part of the position I had was balancing customer service and maintaining store condition (cleaning, facing, other tasks given to me at the time)."
good,"Its a great store to work at, if you like the fast pace life. Alot of walking and standing. Lifting, climbing. The atmosphere when i was there, was postive all the time."
good,"This is always a busy store. I learned how to work in cosmetics. The management were very disorganized. There were no hard parts in my job. I would just go to work, do what I was asked to do and go home at the end of the day."
good,I think it is a great place to work. It just sucks that you have to be exactly how the store manager want you to be or they will do anything to put you out. I spent 10 years with this company but you let me go jus because of complaints
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for they are very family oriented. And great with working around ur scheduling needs. The benefits with this company are the best I have found yet.
good,"I was in almost every position possible there. When I started in 2010 I was paid 8.25 as an associate. If you learn the photo lab or become what they call a designated hitter (helps in any location in the store including pharmacy) you get a raise. They have a wonderful culture. Every different position I held there was paid fairly in my opinion. It was not too stressful of a job, even as a shift lead"
good,I enjoyed working there. They made learning knew things fun an easy ... I would love to go back working for walgreens. great benefits. Great customer services
good,Was a great experience I’m still here working just looking for a stay at home job I can do to earn some more money. The managers all vary but most are fun to talk to and are great friends
good,"basically Walgreens is a very good company to peruse your career at. I can not deny that at some times of the year like flu season and before holidays it becomes busy , but it is a good place to work at wish good management. they listen to employees, and recognize their effort.  good benefits, and payment. nice managers, nice co-workers. that's all i'm looking for in a work place."
good,it was a job nothing to crazy. it paid the bill at home. the bosses where good but it started to get weird. what they teach you it was good. overall i enjoy working there
good,"Loved working here as a high school student great hours, benefits, and promotions to move up a position when seen doing good. Also easy going people with simple tasks and learning advancements in daily life situations."
good,"Walgreen's is your typical convenience store/pharmacy. As a cashier your biggest challenge will be staying busy during slow hours along with cashing out difficult customers. Regular customers brighten up your day. Management was great, and attitude was laid back. There's room for advancement to photo and pharmacy positions. Benefits are great as well."
good,I enjoy working  here pleasant environment its nice to be able to assist customers with questions and produc information and use . I enjoy all the stuff that has to be done I dont think its an ugly place to be and yes I would recommend it
good,"Walgreens is a very great place to work, the managers ive seen come through there should have managing trainer prior to managing such a great store as such."
good,"I worked for Walgreens for 3.4 years. I was head cashier after 6mos. I enjoyed working there and it's a good place to start working for, a stepping stone to getting out in the world."
good,Everyone works real hard there no manager isnt working as hard as the employees except a few if the walgreens the manager manager sometimes doesnt think they should be working. The one I worked at on 64 my manager Did fundrasers recieving and a lot to improve company store
good,"This  particular store has an amazing staff starting with an excellent and kind store manager . It's in a small town and we are like a family . Everybody gets along and it has a great morale . Everyone's birthdays are acknowledged every month. "
good,"Good place to work and I have been here 5 1/2 years. I was able to get my certification and pharmacy license in 3 states (alabama, texas and maryland)."
good,It was a great job and I still do love it very much . Just going through some hard stuff right now and am looking for a different job but only for those reasons
good,"The people were great, but the pay was not enough. The management are very knowledgeable and helpful and really flexible if you have an emergency that needs attention."
good,"I love my conversations with my customers. A lot of the customers that came into Walgreens were considered to be regulars, meaning that they came into the store many times through out the day or week."
good,Walgreens is a good place to start out at and get experience. You can move on up in the company if you stay their long enough and work hard for it. It will also help you work on customer service skills.
good,Great customer service job. Opportunity to work either cosmetics or photo once hired. Pay is not that that great but the experience is worth it and pay gets better when you get promoted.
good,"I learned how to be more open socially and learned great working skills such as working as a team, being a leader, being more efficient and fast thinking."
good,"a typical day is productive: 5 minute meeting, inventory checks, truck and setting the store. i learned that every customer has their own personal personality but all are nice and no matter the attitude all deserve respect and excellent customer service. the management is absoluty wondefull at my store. hardest part of the job well there really isnt one because we all teach each other what we dont know. most enjoyable is the customers and the team work"
good,"I think that walgreens is a great place to work. The management, pay, and flexibility are great points of working there. There is also a lot of opportunity for advancement"
good,Its a great place to start if you are looking to get into the pharmacy industry. Gives a good basic knowledge of medications and getting you familiar with them.
good,"Training on the job and chance for advancement, multitasking is a must. opportunity for all ages and cultures. great management and leadership teams in multiple stores."
good,Loved filling prescriptions and gaining knowledge  about all aspects of pharmacy.. was certified and licensed in azthis was a great company to read for
good,"I make the schedules at work throughout the week on top of multitasking. Inventory control keeping the bins and computer cleaned up for patients prescriptions is a constant task. Filling scripts on time, typing scripts and the accuracy you need to have is the biggest task throughout the day. There are many codes and things you need to know in the pharmacy. Calling doctors and insurance companies to solve issues such as clarifying the scripts or to get them covered by ones insurance is very important with having communication skills. Its a serious job with lives in your hand. I never stress it enough to my team that its all fast pace but take time to catch your breath and focus harder on the screen in front of you, reread your work before submitting. We cant make mistakes back there and always have to be on our toes constantly moving."
good,The environment is so nice an fast pace the type of people are good. the customers. I was black so they loved me cause wasn't a lot of black workers there I learned alot
good,"I like that Walgreens has a vision, which makes it a workplace with a future. That's also why the company seems to be so progressive, and why i don't mind working for her"
good,"We all have specific jobs that we are do to, until certain time, and then we all switch. We always had fun and it was never too hard on us.  Other than that, we are fast pace, and hands down."
good,i loved working for Walgreens the management went great and were willing to work with me cause i might be a little late thanks to the bus and i got along wonderfully with my coworkers who i consider my frinds
good,"My experience was as an internship, but I learned a lot about the workings of a retail pharmacy and never felt uncomfortable asking questions. I enjoyed the people I worked with and found the fast pace made the days fly by. Overall I enjoyed my experience."
good,"Senior Pharmacy technicians cannot advance unless you do a ""side-step"" to SFL and train in the front of the store for management. "
good,At the Walgreen's i first worked at is where i began to love the company the management there was extraordinary! The staff was like a family. A home away from home.
good,"I loved working here. it a day went by extremely slow it was somewhat hard to get through the day simple because I was stuck at a counter all day! Management was pretty cool, they some had their shady moments her and there."
good,Assisting customers in what they needed in their everyday life. I had worked with five different Store Managers and had certain ways they wanted things done and to me it was a challenge and a lot of adjusting. But overall it was all about satisfying our customers.
good,"Stayed busy in this fast-paced environment.  Caring employer - they reach out to others. "
good,I worked in a fun place and this job I learned to have strong organizational skills and problem solver. The hardest part of this job was having to drive in traffic daily.
good,"Great place to work, but long hours and weird scheduling might not be for everyone. Can be stressful, but overall, it is one of the best chain pharmacy jobs."
good,Working in photo gave me the chance to meet a lot of interesting people and just get to talk to them and since I'm a people person it was a great experience.
good,I was there 8 years and got hit with merger changes. But its a wonderful place to work with many incentives. I changed career fields but i love the time i spent there.
good,"great company  to start with. You can learn lot of skills, to success in the retail world like customer service skill, phone skills, team work, friendly atmosphere."
good,"Working at Walgreens on a daily basis is very pleasance, high standard and fast pace environment for the employees. Everyone has to have an open mind and creativity once you enter the door. It is a safe environment for the employees and customers."
good,I worked in the back most of the time breaking down boxes and re stocking the floor. Its an easy laid back job. The team was great to work with at the location
good,"Front store was easy and  fun to work in, it was always busy and helpful, I really don't have complaints. I think they need more opportunities to move into Pharmacy."
good,I was a pharmacy technician and I was able to help patients in getting their prescriptions filled in a timely manner. I learned that there is a lot more to the job than filling the medication. Management was very polite and fair. They worked with my school schedule as best they could. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry patients. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to assist patients in returning back to good health.
good,"Manager made sure to schedule me only on my availability.  Sometimes understaffed which made it difficult to accomplish assigned duties. Other employees were able to advance, go into the pharmacy. I wasn't interested, wanted only part time work"
good,"Awesome place to begin a career in pharmacy, great educational benefits. Great workplace environment, well balanced, fun, inclusive customer relations and service."
good,There is always something to do. Hard workers will have many chances at advancements. You must prioritize your work to be done. Fun and friendly teams.
good,"It was a great experience to work there . It's provided me with a lot of opportunity to interact with people, to learn and to get lot of experiences in the field of pharmacy."
good,We did lots of work in a group. It was good team building and very good communication building. We connected with different types of people in the same work environment and helped each other out
good,I learned a lot working for this company.  Was able to move up really fast.  Had the most wonderful boss and co-workers.  I spent several years working for this company.  Made wonderful life long friends.
good,"Good working environment, everyone was very kind and understanding, worked with my home problems, gave me time off in my state of emergency, willing to work around my schedule"
good,"I'm glad I had the opportunity to work at Walgreens. I worked part-time as a Customer Service Associate. Overall, the customers are friendlier than in fast food, the work is somewhat repetitive (although you're always learning new things). I met one of my best friends there, got along very well with the managers, and we would have assessment times to qualify for raises. If I hadn't been offered higher pay and a promotion at another job, by all means I would have stayed here and accepted the shift leader promotion there. Would definitely consider re-applying."
good,"My typical day/shift at walgreens I would be the front/main cashier to help customers on purchasing items, or finding a certain item in the store. Answer the phone call, and transfer them to where they need to be transferred or help the person on the phone find a certain item. I would stock the floor since I was the closing cashier."
good,Walgreens is a great place to work but also can get hectic because of how amazing the sales are. Good to keep a steady mind and not to overwhelm yourself.
good,Work environment was your typical retail work environment. Location was fast paced and team was very supportive and friendly. There is opportunities to advance to management.
good,a typical day at work is a fun and learning environment for technicians  and the pharmacist cares and provides detail information of what you need to do. This job is a great for entry level technicians
good,Walgreens was my first job and it really heped me understand and gain customer service skills. i worked at a 24 hr Walgreens so you had a choice of when you wanted to come in. They were very flexible while in school and understanding. The discount was really nice because you got 15% off of walgreens merhandise and 25% off of walgreens brand merchandise.
good,"I like working at Walgreens, I felt I really contributed to the work there and I was confident in myself during the work experience that I had. I really enjoyed my time there and it was one of my favorite places to work for. I hope to find more work places that are just as rewarding as this one was for me."
good,"Checkout customers, assist customers, stock, organize, and maintain overall good shelve presentation. Management was nice and friendly to work with. Schedules were made a couple weeks in advance so you could make plans."
good,Working as the youngest clerk and surprising customers with my knowledge of the job kept encouraging me to work even harder. Employee of the month only the fourth week was another plus in my motivation for this particular job.
good,Always have to multi-task and handle stress well. Understand the basics and being able to learn fast material is necessary. Adopt to changes well and be flexible.
good,"Great place to learn and grow constantly everyday. The pace was high managable, but constant. Great place to gather all types of pharmacy insrance infromation to better serve the coustomer and team work was the top priority"
good,There is a lot of opportunity in Walgreens you just have to find the right people to take advantage of it. Management could be better and more exclusive and the DM's tend to be chosen politically and not by experience and qualifications
good,Me and my coworkers at Walgreens was always teamplayers when i was done with my tasks i would always help out in a different department . When my coworkers was done with there task they would always help me
good,I loved this job and my over night hours. fast paced with structure. Bad thing was management changed constantly therefore different rules and attitudes.
good,"* Upon clocking in, the management would brief my team and I on what needed to be done for the day. I worked 8-hour shifts, with 30-minute breaks after 4 hours."
good,"Overall Walgreens is a very nice place to work and all of the team members are very nice, friendly and helpful. You'll never feel too overwhelmed because there's always someone there to help you. All you have to do is ask. I love it."
good,"Working as a CSA gave me opportunities to work in each part of the store.  I was able to experience many different jobs with restocking, training others, registers, cleaning, signage, tagging and markdowns, and working with others.  The jobs were relatively simple and repetitive to do."
good,"Enjoyed my time at Walgreens, as it was my first independent job as a high school student. Great coworkers, great managers, flexible hours, and easy to advance in the workplace. Started as a Sales Associate and ended as a Beauty Advisor."
good,"Walgreens is a wonderful place to work at. Although some days it might be stressful, managers communicate well and answer questions thoroughly to help decrease the amount of mistakes that are made during a project. There are multiple advantages with working at Walgreens: the customer/employee friendships, the ability to gain knowledge on new products coming out, and the amount of balanced responsibility that each employee has."
good,"Enjoyed the job.  I was part-time and newly hired.  Unfortunately the last five hired had to be laid off and i was one of them, as well as an assistant manager."
good,The general staff as well as the Management staff are very friendly and help full. They are eager to help you learn and the opertunities for advancement are great.
good,"I was working at Walgreens Onsite Pharmacy in the Houston Medical Center.  Kept me interested because I was working with Prescribers and their staff dealing with Transplant and Cancer Patients. I was taught how to work with insurances to get Specialty Medicines approved. Also was able to visit Patients in the Hospital and go over their medicines with them.  Also did compounding for Pediatric patients at Texas Childrens Hospital. It was a family atmosphere and very enjoyable.  Also traveled to do Immunizations for companies in the Houston area.  "
good,Managers and employees were always fun to work with kept it interesting day in and day out but day to day it was very slow so you had to manage time very wisely to constantly be doing things
good,Received training to work in all areas of customer service including the photo area. Great fellow employees who care about each other.  Manager was very nice to set my work hours around my school schedule.  The hardest part of the job is stocking the shelves but it does help you become familiar with the products and where they are located in the store.
good,"This was one of my favorite places to work. I really enjoyed the fact that the hours were perfect. The customers who came in were amazing, you would have your usual's of course, but everyone who came in it was a simple, I scan your items and you leave. I enjoyed everyone I worked with, it was very easy to make friends. I learned a lot about the different departments with in the store. The management was very understanding & fun. The most enjoyable about the job was the employees. The hardest was the pay. I was working there for quite some time & I knew literally everything about the store, from filling prescriptions to printing off photos to what make up product would be the best, but I felt like I wasn't getting paid enough for the knowledge that I had, and that is why I left. "
good,"My job is good for some things.  It is a steady position with flexibility in the time I work and do not work.  I have paid hours off which I earn after I have been there a year.  I have a way to save money for retirement.  "
good,"Love the Walgreens Company. I wish they were a little more family friendly. I truly enjoyed going to work while I worked for them, and I would still be with them had I not relocated to a city that had no current openings."
good,"You are not just another employee for Walgreens, you become part of a family and the company sets you in place with ample opportunities for betterment of education as well as advanced growth in the company. The only con is work is very demanding and unpredictable at times."
good,"I would come into work and start my shift off by helping customers, counting money from the register, and also checking the floor to make sure everything was in its place. I would then get my daily list duties that needed to be completed by the end of my shift."
good,"A typical day at work, it was good pay, i learned to be patient with customers and how retail works. The hardest part of the job was how slow the day went by."
good,Walgreens gives its employees the opportunity to grow and learn new things. The management team is super helpful and gives really good feedback. Would recommend working here.
good,Working in the pharmacy was great. what i enjoyed most was getting to see returning customers every week and being able to build up good relationships with them. Hardest part of my job was not being able to help patients as much as i wanted to. Whether it be insurance overlaps or medications not being covered.
good,I had a great manager that taught me so much! I moved up to Head of the Camera Dept and from there moved up from there to be the Head Cosmologists. Great company!
good,"The company is easy going pretty much as long as you are doing what you are supposed to, you'll have no trouble at all. The work day just consists of mundane tasks, stocking shelves, helping customers. It's an easy first job or part time."
good,Great workplace to start. They work with students that are going to school. A typical day at work can be fun or hectic depending on the customers you encounter.
good,"Very little overtime. Believe in family first. Easy to advance. "
good,A typical work day was restocking shelves and ringing customers items out at check out. My co-workers were very helpful and nice. My favorite part of the job was building relationships with co-workers and seeing new faces everyday.

good,"Walgreen's was a fun place to work. the management were hands on and were very helpfull. I learned a lot at walgreens like planograms, p&l statements, set displays, ordering and all aspects of running a big box location."
good,Walgreens was my first customer service job and it was very difficult at first but getting the chance to work with such amazing managers that cared and wanted to see you advance in the company has definitely helped given me the courage and knowledge I have now.
good,"Day went by fast, hard work on your feet all day. Wonderful coworkers great benefits.  Breaks are split into two time frames they are short but helps keep you moving so you don't slow done.  Vending Machines are available to purchase items for lunch but very over priced.  Some days it was very hot working condition's but dress approapate and its not an issue"
good,This was a nice job to take on straight out of high school. It was really enjoyable day in and day out. I worked 4 days out the week (10:30a.m-8:30pm)
good,"I held daily meetings, 5 minute meetings, before shifts to outline objectives, give kudos, and constructively identify areas to focus on for improvement.  Forwarding information from upper management to my team members and keeping the chain of information flowing clearly from top to bottom was key in keeping this work environment running smoothly.  Not only that, but it allowed the team to make necessary adjustments when problems arose more easily."
good,"I have changed my schedule so many times due to changing from high school to college and getting another job. They are very flexible and nice about it. A typical work day was good, I spoke with many customers and helped them out while working on other tasks the management assigned me."
good,Walgreens is an exciting and very fast paced environment. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement. There are different departments to work in at a Walgreens Pharmacy.
good,Deben emplear a más personas para el área de recetario ya que hay mucho volumen de recetas.
good,I loved working for Walgreens! You had to be fast paced but it was fun! The customers were always friendly and the management was great too. This was a wonderful company to work for.
good,Amazing work team good pay great customers I love my job I have an amazing Boss and  store manager... get along with everybody I just wish there were more people to flex that when you needed coverage and are in the same position as myself being a single parent
good,"The most part of my job that enjoyed working there was meeting new people and being able to help them out with there needs , finding products or giving different help  to people,  getting to know them."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my fellow co-workers, they made the job much more interesting and made it feel like less of a job! Along with feeling like I had responsibility, it gave me satisfaction when I was able to do what my job required of me"
good,"Walgreens provides a great environment for it's employees. It promotes growth from within and enhances the work experience by providing continuing education opportunities."
good,"I enjoyed my job, I was a shift Lead which is a non salary member of management. I learned a lot from my little time about balancing and accounting"
good,"I was pregnant while working for Walgreen's, and not once did I ever have a problem with any of my fellow employees or the management. All of us employees were treated very well by the management team, and they were very willing to work with anyone's personal schedule to a point. I never had a customer complain to Mr about other employees, and always heard about how helpful other people on the floor during shift were. I would definitely recommend this as a place for people looking for their first or a second part time job to apply for. I would go back to this employer in a heartbeat."
good,"This store was always busy and was an amazing challenge to conquer. From helping non english speaking customers to go that extra mile for customers service,  to the team work that was done by myself and my co workers. I have learned so much from being at walgreens and it helped me grow my resume without all the job hopping."
good,Management is wonderful. They sincerely care about their employees. This is a great position if you are searching for part-time hours as a college student.
good,"I started out as a cashier and filled in for lunch breaks in the pharmacy, I was eventually retained as full time in the pharmacy department and became certified and  promoted to senior technician.The hardest part of the job is patience in all situations. I meet many people with different languages and backgrounds. My days go by quickly, There is always something to do. Everyone has a story and I know many by name, I enjoy chatting with return customers and seeing their children grow up and become customers as well."
good,"The managers I worked for were very understanding and the company as a whole believe in rewarding good behavior and good work. I was able to train and learn, whatever and however much I wanted."
good,"Walgreens has given me the opportunity to develop as a leader, and trusted me with a challenging job, with the training necessary to grow. Excellent place to start a job experience."
good,Walgreens on 6th Sprague Tacoma WA is a great place to work. Management is reasonable and your fellow employees are very friendly. Work is medium paced and accuracy is more important than anything.
good,"Overall, the people and corporate structure at the Walgreens Corporate Office is sound and mindful of employee needs. By far, some of the brightest and considerate co-workers I have ever had the pleasure of working with. I would recommend working for this company to anyone that is qualified."
good,"My career at Walgreens has been epic in providing Pharmaceutical as well as retail services for my community.  Making a difference by serving my neighbors shows a great example of Duty and Service. On December 31, Walgreens took its products and services to the four corners of the world with the completion of its merger with Alliance Boots, a leading international pharmacy-led health and beauty group. With the completion of the merger comes the formation of a new global company, Walgreens Boots Alliance, combining two leading companies with iconic brands, complementary geographic footprints, shared values and a heritage of trusted health care services through pharmaceutical wholesaling and community pharmacy care, dating back more than 100 years each."
good,"I was treated very well and felt I had a real voice in scheduling my shifts, off time, ect."
good,I had the luck to have excellent coworkers during my time at Walgreens. In my time I was also being considered for a management position so I got to learn a lot about being a manager. Overall I think an excellent job if you're looking for a smaller retail environment.
good,Great benefits but very demanding management position. Very busy store.. sometimes hard to give patients individual counseling they need and get work done
good,Loved working at Walgreens. And I would defiantly recommend working there. It's extremely hard to move from departments because Walgreens is very strict on hiring and they need to cover your spot before you can move.
good,I love to work with the people here especially the manager is very nice and welcoming. He is my favorite person out of all places that i worked. I wish to come back there to work if i have time
good,"I loved working for Walgreens and the challenges that it provided to me.  Everyday was different and allowed me to get to know my community better, as well as my position.  The company offered plenty of room for advancement, but unfortunately I was unable to further my employment due to relocating to another state."
good,Lifetime experience and great skills gained records set in place.Leadership was very supportive and was always available. I would recommend Walgreens to anyone for employment or a great shopping experience.

good,"A typical day at work is helping customers with there needs and stocking and working the cashier."
good,Walgreens was an amazing learning experience. Very thankful for the crew and the most awesome pharmacy manager. Retail can be trying but I think this was the best place to start off as a pharmacy technician.

good,Walgreen was a great place to work. You will always be busy. I had the most fun on the days that we received our stock. Walgreens allowed me opportunities to grow with the company.
good,"Walgreen was a nice place to work at, i made a life time  of friends, i was able to transfer to any store, i like, the pay was good"
good,"Excellent job experience, Constantly troubleshooting and communicating wit corp IT to fix issues. I was the go to guy for every new project to implement in the building."
good,The manager at this store is truly awesome to work for.  Compensation and benefits are weak though as in any at a large discount chain.   The minimum wage in my state has increased since my employment experience here.  I would recommend.
good,I appreciated the fact that each department was staffed. This allowed employees to meet the needs of customers and complete daily task. Management was available to help and give support when needed.
good,I love how my managers where able to get things done on time without making it really seem like if it was work. They also made sure that the employees were taken care of. It was honest work.
good,"my typical day of work involve typing, filling and taking in prescription orders from costumers. I get the opportunity to assist different costumers based on their needs, for instant calling their insurance on their behalf, or educating and showing  them the location of something they want to buy in the store. i have a supportive co-workers and  we work together as a team and we recognize and celebrate each others birthdays. the hardest part of my job is when dealing with rude and upset costumers."
good,Great work environment. I work with a great group of hardworking people. Management encourages growth within the company.  Love helping the customers.
good,"I work the front end & photo. Absolutely love it. My regular customers are great and I look forward to seeing them. Since I've started working there only one of our great managers has been moved by we got another great one. All 4 of them are wonderful to be around and work with. They will stop what they're doing to help or check out if we are busy. Pharmacy staff is wonderful as well, we're all a big family. Would recommend this company to anyone. However a super D was converted to a Walgreens less than half a mile away so out business as slowed some because of them."
good,"Great company to work for, advancement available if you are willing to learn, be dependable and able to multi-task. I have had a wonderful job experience with this company."
good,I enjoyed my time working at Walgreen's being a supervisor and help promote employees. I had a high risk pregnancy so I had to leave the company but its a overall good experience.
good,"No day was a typical day at work. Working at Walgreens, I was fortunate enough to learn a lot about how the pharmacy ran smoothly  without many mistakes. To have a successful team, management is where it starts: communication. It was a fun and challenging job juggling between the whole store as well as the pharmacy. Getting  the appropriate job done using time management and being efficient with management and the team members, allowed everyone to be more positive and productive as they felt good at a job well done and to have the customers leave satisfied."
good,Management is great at Walgreen's. I appreciated the schedule flexibility that was provided for me while I was in school. Coworkers were reliable and friendly and contributed to a team spirit overall. I enjoyed my position in the photo department because I had the flexibility to create with customers and interact with them for an overall great experience.
good,"Its always busy, but I have learned a lot from the people I work with. Everyone is super helpful and nice to work with and be around. The hardest part of my job is when its extremely busy, people are waiting and the phones are going off like crazy. The most enjoyable part is solving problems for people making their life easier and happy customers."
good,"I learned accepting new prescriptions from the patient, interpreting the prescription's signa, entering patient, prescriber, and medication information into the pharmacy's information system. Counting and pouring the correct medication, labeling prescription bottles. preparing unit-dose medications."
good,"Typical Day includes, customer service,  stocking the shelves, performing resets and revisions, ordering and receiving of products, helping where needed in departments i.e. photo, pharmacy, beauty, balancing monies and organizing departments."
good,"The Walgreens that I worked at in particular was absolutely wonderful. All of my managers were great, my coworkers were great, there were rarely any problems with the customers. However, cooperate seems to be an entirely different entity and I have a lot of issues with them."
good,Productive because management was very involved with keeping employees happy. hardest part of the job is given many tasks but not enough time tocomplete.
good,I loved working at Walgreens. I just didn't get enough hours to handle my responsibilities. I later found new employment but I always visit the company I worked for and laugh and joke with them.
good,What I learned at this job was how to take on multiple tasks at once. At Walgreen I learned how to do totes and tell which items are basic from the ones that did not belong in the store. My store manager attitude is disgusting but however the shift managers are great and have a great relationship with all other workers.
good,"I loved working at Walgreens. All the staff and managers made the work environment fun and rewarding. They were very organized and they followed my specific requests with my schedule. They worked with me to teach me most of what I know about inventory, re-sets, and all my retail skills/costumer service skills."
good,I enjoyed working here very much.  We all worked together to get the daily jobs accomplished.  Management worked with us when needed and was very understanding if any of us had personal issues or illness to take care of.
good,learned a lot of valuable information and gained the right amount of experience about the filed I was going into. very nice place to do an inter-ship.
good,"I worked at Walgreens all through high school.  I loved the job, I loved the experience and the team effort was awesome.  For a first job, Walgreens was a great experience.  See resume for daily duties."
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for.  The pay is great and they also offer insurance, profit sharing, and stock.  And you can progress in the company if you desire to."
good,"I've been with this company for 11 years but I feel I need a change in my career. I wish I would have found Walgreens before I put in 8 years at my previous employer, Sam's Club. I am appreciated at Walgreens & could excel at that company if I choose to."
good,Walgreens paid very well however they mandated 4 - 6 hours overtime when they wanted and frankly you ended getting burned out.
good,"I enjoyed my externship there, very awesome company & staff. Staff was very accommodating & helpful. I would love to be employed with this company."
good,I have been with this company for 9+ years and love it. The culture is something I will miss when I move and must change companies.
good,"So sad to leaved Walgreens CPO. I lost my job because they closed operations as a Central Fill and my position eliminated; if that had not happened, I will continue my career with Walgreens until retirement. Walgreens is a very good company and a family fun workplace."
good,"Working at Walgreens was great. although the work was hectic at times, I still enjoyed the atmosphere. My co-workers were amazing and we helped each other with various tasks. I often miss the work meetings, merchandising, and the customer service that the job entailed."
good,"I ended up in a great store to work at but I have worked at others and some can be disorganized. The work load can be crazy with some slow periods. Overall, I love Walgreen's but I wish they would pay technicians a little more than 11.25 for being certified."
good,Had an awesome time working for Walgreens Respiratory and Infusion services learn a lot from my supervisors who had trust and put their faith in me. Had a wonderful time working at this company until this division was bought from another company.
good,Working at Walgreens was very time consuming. The people there were always so nice. My customer service skills got better after working there.
good,"Work Environment was great compared to many other warehouses. They treat with respect and value you. Working conditions are by far better than most warehouses in Ontario area. If you get in here....stay  and appreciate it, unless you plan on going into another field or back to school. If school maybe ask if you can work part time, I think Walgreens is a good company to stay with."
good,"The first duty of cashier is to greet the customers entering into organization"
good,"After working many years at this Pharmacy, the most enjoyable part of the job were my frequent customers. This was a people friendly place of employment whose only satisfaction were to make sure the customers were satisfied. Loved working for such a great company!"
good,"Awesome atmosphere that is non selfish, charity and very giving, pay wage could use improvement, Since Walgreens expresses Health I would suggest on no longer selling cigerets this only make sense if we are to Truly Walk into Health and then Happiness."
good,pleasant company to work for. The management team strives to be better than the other stores and offers incentives to obtain that goal.
good,I was very happy there and would loved to have stayed longer. I was there to complete a project. When the project was completed my job was over. Very good experience.
good,"A normal day is pretty laid back. The most important thing about the job is smiling and being happy to assist customers and it was genuinely pleasant to deal with people, even the angry ones. The company has great ethics and the coworkers at both stores I worked for were amazing. The hardest part was standing on your feet for so long but it is nothing. I really enjoyed the experience as a whole."
good,"This store is always busy. It's right by a hospital, and so just about every prescription is routed through our pharmacy. People who get their medications here also do a lot of shopping while they wait, and this means that any bad or good experience is amplified by word-of-mouth to customers family. This makes it extremely important to maintain a positive attitude, and the managers take that into consideration in assigning shifts and allowing vacation."
good,There is always something to do in a busy store like Walgreen's so that it never gets boring or stagnant. There is potential to meet various types of people and it is easy to advance at the job positions as long as you are willing.
good,"Taking in new prescriptions,refills and phone calls about all of the above."
good,"Walgreens was a great place to work, the salaries were competitive and they care about their employees. The managers did not micromanage employees."
good,"I learned how to work in retail pharmacy, the stuff was very friendly "
good,My typical day here was ok. I helped a lot of customers. Some of them I really got to know personally. I learned a lot here. Smiling is a must even when you are hurting and having a bad day. My coworkers were out of sight we had a great time. We got alone really well management too. The hardest part was that my job was in the evening I couldn't see my kids until late at night they were almost sleep or sleep when I got home. My weekend were tied up a lot. They did offer benefits.
good,Working at Walgreens has changed me into the worker I am today. I learned how to work with customers and adapt to the situation at hand.
good,"Its a great place to work with awesome co workers. "
good,"During a typical day at work, I would:"
good,"Learned a lot about working in a pharmacy and production of filling prescriptions and communicating with the patients."
good,good job good environment fast paced warehouse job open door policy for management good benefits competitive pay learned to work as a team
good,"It was My retail extern site. "
good,"Walgreens Sleep and Respiratory was acquired by Lincare at the end of March (2015).  Walgreens Drug stores remain open - Lincare had staff to do most of the work, so a good deal of Walgreens staff has left/is leaving. Have enjoyed the fact that Management notices good work and rewards such.  Co-workers have all been friendly, co-operative, helpful and smart."
good,"A typical day of work consisted of scanning prescriptions at the drive thru window or drop off window, working the cash register, dusting the shelves, filing prescriptions and organizing prepared prescriptions in the designated bins.  I learned how to have patience and have a smile on my face no matter what happened at work.  All of my co-workers where great to work with, the hardest part of the job was standing still in one place for 8 hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job was having all the pharmacy clients go home happy with their medication"
good,"A normal day at work included restocking shelves, keeping the store well maintained and fulfilling customers needs. I learned customer service, communication, team work. It was easy work so I had to always find new tasks to do. The management was great. They taught me everything I needed to know prior to working at my job and if I ever needed help they were always available. My coworkers were also amazing. We all had a great work relationship and helped each other out when we needed it. The hardest part of my job was keeping myself busy on the slow days. I had to sometimes find ways to keep myself busy when I finished all my tasks early or even on time. The most enjoyable part of my job was when I made a customer's experience in the store great! I also enjoyed working with my coworkers they were really reat people."
good,"Great job for starting out. you learn so much! Management is great, just don't like the ""upselling"" of vaccinations and services."
good,"I enjoyed working for Walgreens, it's a great job for who is just starting and learning to work. They could have done better by raising the pay when you switched from one department to another. For example, if you worked upfront (register) and you advanced to the photo department, they should have given you a raise for the bigger responsibility."
good,management is awesome. staff is great. friendly. easy going environment. always room for advancement. great incentives. company pot lucks. tuition reinburstment. whats no to love about a great employer.
good,I loved working for Walgreen Infusion life circumstances had my family to move back to the Jefferson County area so that was the reason why I left the customer.

good,"I loved helping the customers. most are not feeling very well or are very elderly. So when people come in with children i would give them a coloing page.  Working for walgreens is very challenging something different each day. i learned a lot about insurance, and the different medicines and there uses.The  people we call are all ways happy that you are personally checking up to see that there are getting better. the manager is very understanding to all."
good,This job was great when i was in highschool to keep me out of trouble. As i got older and wanted a career it seemed like i could stay here and continue to advance. I would have been able to had i not chose a completely different career path.
good,"Walgreen is a very good company to work for. All my skill and experience and registration in Pharmacy Operation I owe to Walgreen. Excellent management in Central Fill , coworkers became family members. The hard part was when sorter machine broke down and you stay until all is finish (longer hour) Any holiday time was fun,"
good,"I had a great manager experience from working at Walgreens and  great training. However, everyone took a pay cut and I had worked for Walgreens for six years so this indeed did not benefit me at all."
good,"Bank deposits, inventory management, internal store reports, maintaining photo laboratory, sales and customer services. Scheduling and managing employees"
good,"ok for a temporary job, wouldn't consider long-term unless part-time, staff was awesome and amazing, boss was young, but great"
good,this was definitely one of my favorite jobs i was allowed to move down to part-time hours for school and back up in between the bosses were so understanding and didn't feel the need to intimidate the workers. I honestly wanted to do my job based on my coworkers alone. I wouldn't have quit if i didn't have to
good,"Getting to work and being able to profile my daily productivity quota."
good,I have worked retail before but Walgreen's really takes care of its employees treating then fairly and helps them learn and grow

good,"* good benefits"
good,I enjoyed interacting with customers on a daily basis and also got along very well with all of my co-workers and members of management.
good,worked a full 8hrs each day but depended on how high and low the volume was sometimes if we had a low volume they would volunteer for early outs. The important things I learned was how to manage my own work area and the skills that I gained from it. My co-workers were awesome very easy to get along with and work with. The hardest part of the job was possibly when we had a very big volume and the tags we get were sometimes very big that it would take about 3 to 5 hours to complete depending on how much we got. Id say the most enjoyable part of this job was the intensity in the work environment the challenges were always fun and working on a line that required 2 people to finish it was awesome.
good,Learned how to properly manage and communicate with co-workers. Co-workers were excellent and always willing to help.
good,"The Day at Walgreens will get start by preparing the equipment for the day and preparing your best smile.I learned Team work it's what it's going to work!,If you have a positive actitude you will solve all the obstacles and that will give you a better end of the day.

good,Walgreens was my first official job. I started off as a clerk and became a photo technician months after being there. Before resigning I was in the management trainee program.
good,"My employment at the Anderson Walgreens Distribution Center was a great one. The company is wonderful to work for with great benefits and I had some of the greatest coworkers, we were like a family. A typical day for me was consumed with completing paperwork for the drivers to take when they released trailers and also making sure that we got the product to the stores in a timely manner. I kept important information in Excel and Access. I also did alot of email traffic back and forth to the stores to ensure they received the items they need to serve the customers. The most enjoyable part about my job is interacting with the stores and drivers on a daily basis. The hardest part of my job is when we have very busy days and I may be so busy that I am not able to help all of the stores that may need my help. Overall, my work experience at Walgreens has been enjoyable."

good,A typical day began with deleting old patient medications which no longer needed automatic refilling and then I would move on to submitting the smart count of 10 medications already programmed. Everyday was a great learning experience for me and I am glad to say I had great leaders and managers working with me to guide me and show me the best way to be proficient as well as provide the best customer service. The most challenging step for me was learning the billing portion of the pharmacy technician job description but I am someone who adapts well to new environments and was able to work my way thru a few obstacles which in turn led me to learn new ways of the Intercom system.
good,"Fast-paced, stressful working environment. No defined schedule, but plentiful hours if desired. Great experience for the healthcare field!"
good,"Working with Walgreens company is hard because it is a big company and sometimes you can go unnoticed. The store i worked for was great.

good,Walgreens was a great place to work. I really enjoyed all my co-workers and managers. This organization took pride in taking care of their customers and so did I. The hardest part of the job was trying to please upset customers in the Pharmacy. Most of these issues were due to insurance and things we could not control and that was difficult to swallow sometimes because we were in no place to help them. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to just be sharing life with regular customers and co-workers.

good,"Atypical day at work would be filling prescriptions, I learned many short cuts through the system and how to work the systems. Management was great and co workers were comforting just like family. The hardest part would be making sure every customer leaves happy and right away"
good,"The particular Walgreens where I work fosters a feel of comfortable relationships between co-workers, meaning even the tension that happens can be worked-through usually.  As a corporation, it seems a little overbearing about how customers want to encounter their Walgreens, making funny-sounding lines for us to say to people and little outfits for each of us that just seem like a waste of money sometimes.  But over-all I have really enjoyed the opportunities that are available to me, and the stable structure that makes each Walgreens uniform so that no matter where a customer is, their Walgreens will feel like home."

I learned how to properly fill and handle procedures, pharmacy operations, and really enjoyed the customer relations. It was challenging to work at the pace required and I enjoyed the fast pace though! It was a pleasure to work for this company, I was sad when I had to leave due to medical reasons, since resolved, before having enough time off to ensure my position would be available. I have not be able to be rehired with this company due to a lack of available positions."

I learned to multitask on a lot of things such as ringer customers up, answering the phones, restocking on all items threw out the store and also developing photos and refilling ink cartridges. The management was very good kept everything in order . All my co-workers were very nice and friendly and warm loving helped me with any questions or just to see if I needed any help what so ever. Was being in photo the reason is because they had a very old developing machine and eat would leak and ruin pictures . I enjoyed being a beauty adviser and helping customers with makeup and hair products ."
good,"I loved working at walgreens, help was fairly good, but not dedicated to their work. I opened up and did business with the best technical pieces of equipement. The people, help, customers were the most enjoyable part of the job.  But it was not a job, I love being a pharmacist."

I have managed to be able to not only be aware of all pharmacy situations from payroll to shrink but also as an assistant mamanger for store operations a s well.  My hardest part of my job is the travel.  I am very punctual and somtimes its hard to sit in traffic to and from a 23 mile commute.  My most enjoyable part of my job is the seeing the KPI's every day and seeing the gradual improvement in our store and know that you had alot to do with that.  Also watching the employees you have trained learn and grow.  Helping the customers with the understanding of pharmacy operations and awareness of the insuarance policies so they are not frustrated by the time they leave."
good,"I really enjoyed my work experience at walgreens, I loved helping customers each day while balancing school and work.

I would have to say not having the specific item(s) that a customer was asking for would have to be the hardest part of that job. Because that way, the customer has to leave dissatisfied.

I would start assisting the pharmacist once all my morning duties were completed.

good,"I worked for Walgreens for 27 years. I quit to take care of my elderlly parents who are now both deceased. I would like to rejoin Walgreens company.  I did many different jobs from cashier,price administrator and photo technician."
good,Very good company to work for in the corporate level. Atmosphere at work was encouraging and helpful. We managed to achieve great things there together
good,"I arrive about 20 minutes early before work. I get my caffeine and got into the break room. I am greeted very kindly by my manager. I am learning where all the products go. I check out a key so I can unlock goods for the customers. I am learning the Point of Sale register, how to do returns, Western Union, rain checks, voids and more."
good,"It’s okay, there is much more they can do with the company such as getting new management and getting new jobs. When they add new jobs they should offer people more money"
good,This place works hard to fit your schedule. Friendly environment. The only thing that was a problem is management. You have to stay on top of them or what you need will not be done.
good,They provide you training to advance your career. They encourage you to grow. Great benefits. The people you work with care about helping you. My only complaint is scheduling but it’s due to the options that I have based on religious beliefs. All that aside my schedule does not conflict with that and that’s most important. I’m happy and thankful for the opportunity to work from home.
good,Great company. Would like a better work life balance and  better scheduling. Didn’t like the long hours we had to work on the holidays. The pay is great and there is a lot of upward mobility
good,"Company is committed to sdvancement, training and the well being of their employees. Company is willing to ensure specific employee goals and safety. Walgreens innovates and is committed to success."

good,"15 minute breaks"
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work, i’d recommend this job to anyone. Great environment, great jump start to a pharmacy career or anyone who likes customer service and retail."
good,The RWJ Walgreens is a fantastic place to learn more about outpatient management of specialty drugs.  Their work with the management of transplant patients is interesting and necessary
good,"I’ve worked a fair amount of hard jobs, this is not one of them. Everything you do has to do with making the store look nice and presentable for the customers who shop there. There’s not much more to it than that. Resets and The hollidays are where most of the work gets done. Walgreens is a small store, so it’s easier to keep up with all of the products the store carries."
good,"A typical day at work includes checking emails, answering calls, managing time for projects, working on projects, fulfilling duties designated to each technician, helping teammates figure out solutions to their problems, and collaborating with coworkers to finish tasks."
good,"I have been with Walgreens for 10 years.  It is like family.  You can talk to management , treated and spoken to like you matter. They are fair  and have continuous learning applications. The customers and co workers always make for a better day.  Hardest part is when we are short handed and have much to do."
good,This job is amazing unlike this website. This job is way less tedious than filling out this review I don't know what you want from me. Let me move on.
good,"I enjoyed working here. Getting to know customers, employees and building great relationships with different people. They were very hands on so you the the opportunity to learn more things. And they very helpful in training. Very professional work environment. And all leadership was very helpful and supportive of work related and personal related situations."
good,Walgreens was one of the best jobs that I had ever had! They were very helpful and nice at all times. Walgreens helped me gain better leadership skills.
good,Very great place to work and they have great benefits and discount and the people are nice i really love diana and the management is very understanding
good,I loved the team I worked with as well as my managers. Pharmacy had a great staff as well. It all felt like a family once you got to know the team members. It was a home away from home for me.
good,"Regular Presentation with inbound and outbound managers enhanced the professional skills."
good,"I love the customer they make me happy when they happy also I like to see the customers smile makes me know I’m"
good,"Walgreens is a very good place to work.  The benefits are great.  The workload can be challenging at times, but there are many support systems in place."
good,Loved working with the pharmacy staff. I had great management and senior technicians. Long hours but great pay and benefits. Really enjoyed my time as a pharmacy technician there.
good,Its a fun place to work and have good benefits. Always a lot of great sales and great holiday stuff every year. A nice place to shop for anything. Would recommend someone to work there for short or long term
good,"Walgreens has been my favorite job to date, with a fantastic focus on team building and strength amongst staff there was an excellent level of communication between management and staff. Unlike other jobs, Walgreens didn't divide their management and floor teams. Everybody worked together to stock the shelves, help the customer, and clean the store. There was never any apprehension about asking for help or clarification, and coming into work was always a great time."
good,"I enjoyed training there, I learned a lot and I would recommend anyone to train there. I didn't do a lot of phone prescription but I did a lot filling the prescription."
good,Compared to other retail stores it was great. They start at 10-10.50 in Ohio where I am at the stores. At the Distribtuon center you always get your 40 hours but once August hits and Halloween/Christmas comes those turn into mandatory 9-10 hour days until January at least 3 times a week. Management anywhere in the company is absolutely amazing. They really care and walgreens has awesome perks and benefits
good,Nice atmosphere with many opportunities for advancement.  Not all Walgreens are the same.  The one I worked at was amazing!  The managers were all professional and ready to train.
good,When u frst walk in my job u c how high is the volume and the i c what when the day before in different departments there and the i c who im working with and how meny boxes i got to cut the night
good,I thoroughly enjoyed my job with this company. If it wasn't for the certification issues I would still be with this company today. The company helped in any way they could to provide you with what ever tools you needed to do your best & be well educated.
good,"I had a very pleasant experience working there at Walgreens and the management there was pretty awesome to work with if I didn’t have another full time job I’m sure that Walgreens would have been my main job, the atmosphere and engaging with the customers everyday was always a plus. You would definitely have to be a people person to be there and definitely not mind standing for long periods."
good,I loved working there but they went from being open 24 hours to16 hours and some of us were displaced. I was transferred to the store in Marina Del Rey and couldn't continue because there was no busses back to my home at that hour at night.that
good,The customers made the job very easy. Getting to see the customers smile daily was great. I ran the front end of the store handled money and deposits. Worked trucks. Places and printed price changed and sale signs. Each day had a new task. I enjoy it greatly.
good,"I started working at Walgreens as a means to receive a steady flow of income while I finished my degree, but while working there I ended up getting many opportunities to move up the ladder that before I knew almost 3 years had flown by. If this was the field I wanted to dedicate my life to I could see myself staying with the company and hopefully continuing to grow and climb, but I also believe that it is a great starting point for those who are young and still inexperienced in the work place."
good,"Great Company to work for family oriented. Challenging. Great staff."
good,"I had fun there. My bosses loved me, the coworkers who stayed there with me were awesome and we all got along well. They were like my best friends, even my managers. Everyone was clear on what was expected, but was also flexible with your needs and preferences."
good,I love working for Walgreens!! My Managers are the best!! Everyone works as a team to get things done! Working here is an all around great experience!!
good,"A typical day at work was being professional, establishing good relations with the customers, assist other employees when needed, maintaining a positive attitude, and just overall job performance."
good,"people are nice , "
good,long hours but it is worth the money career advancement opportunities employee discounts just stay focus and it will pay off in a few years great place to work
good,"The job is pretty enjoyable, starting the day we do streches an appreciations for people who went above an beyond their job. Management seems really nice an helpful with a bit of understanding. Training is a 6 week period which is nice, not expecting you to have the job down in a few days or less, but is isnt hard to learn at all"
good,Walgreens as been my favorite job today and I have not been able to find one to compare sense. Resources they offer are truly astonishing and not kept hidden from employees. Overall work inviroment is a little cut troagh; slyly pushing you down when upper management is looking and actin oblivouse to the face of porpuosly making your peers look like inept leaders. But still genuinely nice people and when a position is not pleasant to work with.
good,"Loved working at Walgreens in Fountain Valley just had personal reasons why I couldn’t stay at that one . Everyone there was great  , pleasure to work with I’ve learned so much from the whole staff there , I was so upset because I had to leave . Manager left me as rehirable ,"
good,"My team was the best! Lots of support & hard working, dedicated individuals!! I learned a lot from my Walgreens Family and every store I've had the opportunity to visit or work have been so awesome and helpful!"
good,"Greet customers with a smile and assist with any needs pertaining to pharmaceutical needs. Prepare medication for customers, clarify medical insurance and process payment."
good,"A typical day at Walgreens has interesting, and usually nice, customers telling you about their day, coworkers being productive and talking with one another, and the peace of leaving after clocking out for the day."
good,"Working at Walgreens in the pharmacy , you have no idea what you are walking into until you actually get back there. However, the environment is always enlightening. I love to see new faces and also my regulars."
good,"I loved working for walgreens. My specific management team was amazing and was always there for us whenever we needed them. Not all stores have the experience that I was priviledge to get, which is why I was so sad when I had to leave due to relocating. Most people don't leave the company because they really do look out for their employees."
good,Awesome company to work for and great opportunity a happy and healthy work environment Pleasant customer Pleasant sale Associates all around awesome company to work for
good,"You sometimes have to find your team at Walgreens, or will have to make it work at the location you got. A great thing about this company is how simple it is to transfer from one state to the next."
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for. I would recommend anyone seeking meaning employment to apply, especially teens because Walgreens has an education assistance program which assists high school graduates with paying for college."
good,I worked part time as a high school student and it was a great experience for me. The coworkers and customers together made it a nice experience. The flexible hours were great for after school.
good,Never met friendly staff and management team in my years of working and volunteering. Everyone takes their job very seriously but is able to make it feel stress free. Management team is always understanding to unfavorable circumstances and allow employees to freely discuss issues and bring up ideas to fix them. Coworkers and pharmacy team are over friendly with each other as well as customers. Perfect work place
good,"Its one of the best company in the nation to work with.Fast pace, good training and good work ethics.Team work is supreme and expectations are here .Patient care and satisfaction is the ultimate goal"
good,"Taking in vendors to make sure that sales for that day would be productive."
good,One of the first places I worked it was a great introduction to work life. The coworkers are friendly always willing to lend a hand the managers are reasonable and they also do their share.

good,"Everyone works together , engaging customers in sincere conversation is fun . Must keep busy at all times and look happy performing your job ,no exceptions ."
good,"I personally really enjoy working for Walgreens. The people you work with really make a difference about your experience. The management was really kind, any and all questions got answered and clear that I understood how something went. The hardest part would have to be unloading truck. It's a little draining on the body sometimes, but you make it through it. If you do not stretch properly, you will definitely be sore later on. Another difficult thing would have to be ID'ing individuals who are well over the age limit. Most of our regular customers understand it is apart of our policy now, which is great! There's just some individuals who are not familiar and make scenes when we refuse to sell them tobacco/alcohol if they do not want to show us their ID or they do not have it. Overall, working for Walgreens has been fun. You meet interesting people everyday."
good,I had started here after graduating college only meaning to stay a short time. That short time turned into 4 years and I can honestly say it’s probably the best retail company to work at. You can start there and work your way up the ladder if you want within a short time. Of course it being a retail job it comes with the good and the bad-sometimes coworkers don’t get along or shift leads and managers are hard to swallow but overall you can definitely learn a lot here and grow as a professional and as a person. I have nothing but love for this company and very many good memories. I wish I never left. 💖
good,"Walgreens is also flexible for college students and Interns.  Those wanting to advance to the pharmacy must be serious and persistent.  No-call no-shows are not tolerated at Walgreens, just like any other company!"
good,"Obviously, Walgreens is a long standing company with a great reputation. Great benefits. Advancement opportunities. Fast paced environment. Great people to work with."
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for. I used to LOVE my job. The pay was good. The benefits like insurance was ok. But other benefits like getting into the children museum or the Brookfield zoo and all the museum in downtown Chicago for free was great.  If you put the work in you will succeed in this work environment.  Some employees are very rude and unprofessional. I was with the company for almost a year and moved up to a shift lead. Great job skills you will learn to further yourself.  If your at the right Walgreens with the right boss and the right team this job is nothing but amazing. "
good,"•	Analyze User Stories by interacting with Business Analysts and Developers."

good,I have worked for Walgreens for 12 years going on 13. I started as a cashier and upper management saw potential and gave me every opportunity to succeed.
good,This company for the most part is a great starter company to get your foot in the door. If your in school for anything business related you will gain the tools needed to run you own company. If your in school for anything else the scheduling is flexible around your school schedule. You can also become a pharmacy tech within 3 years with paid on the job training and a quarter of the cost as a trade or traditional school.
good,"Great place to work. Great hours. Lots of perks. Four/ ten hour shifts, good benefits. Weekends off in my department. Been there for 5 years, you top out on pay after just 3 years when I started."

good,A great company to be a contractor with. They do a nice job of field leadership management integration with the corporate leadership teams. The operations team is top notch!
good,The job is very easy and the family you make with the other employees is lifelong. What tends to mess up the atmosphere is bad management but that is on the people not the job itself. Overall it is a great place to work.
good,"Assist customer with their shopping needs "
good,Customers received prompt service and appreciated that! It makes the workplace an enjoyable one when everyone is satisfied. Smiles are easiest when greeting satisfied customers.

good,"Great management team at store 1933.  I have called all 3 Walgreens in my area and they are consistently full. No one ever "
good,"love the schedule, love the staff, friendly environment, care for the staff and the customers , job isn't hard. gets kind of hectic but its nothing you can't handle"
good,good job and well paid for what you do but it is a 9 per hour job which sucks but its about right  for what you do in there. Good job culture and they work around your schedule for the most part.
good,I loved my time working at Walgreen's. The co-workers were encouraging and confident. They laid out a smooth and stress free work environment. The managers could be easily contacted at any time of the day. They were great with understanding personal schedules and appointments. I enjoyed every day of working there and wish I could of had more time at that job.
good,"This job has been great to me. I have built connections with the other managers as well as the CSA’s. My customers are very kind and we also have bonds from being in the same city, and me seeing them outside of work."
good,"Everyone is inviting and willing to show you the ropes and assisted in helping anyone in need of a hand. After working a little over a year, it was bittersweet to leave, but was assured I always had a place to come back to."
good,Spending 5yrs with the company i enjoyed the atmosphere and team work with all staff members. Unfortunatley i did not feel that pay raises were adequate and fair.
good,"I always looked forward going to work "
good,I love working for Walgreens. It's a great company. I make decent money. I've received quite a few pay raises in the last couple of years.  It's easy going and our pharmacy is very fast paced. Management always steps up when needed and helps out .
good,"While Walgreens does take care of it's employees, if can be stressful at times, we are all human after all. However, my overall experience with the company was positive and a great learning experience for future employment! I was offered to manage myself, for the most part and I had to co-workers who were more than happy to help me out if the need arose. I did have issues with one of my co-workers, but those issues were few and far between and I am easy to forgive as my sensitive nature does not allow me to hold grudges."
good,"They are a great pharmacy to work for they are very busy and fast paced. Not too"
good,Working as a Beauty Consultant at Walgreens was a lot of fun! I really like this employer's approach to managing workplace activity; Walgreens cross-trains their employees so employees don't get bored so easily from performing a single task monotonously. Beauty Consultant training was a blast!
good,I have been successful while working for Walgreens. I have grown my entire career with this company and have built great relationships! Good benefits too!

good,"It was a great job. Nothing bad to say about the company. I think walgreens is the best pharmacy there is. No complaints for me. I would love to work here again,"
good,Walgreen's is a great company to grow a career. Easy to move up and great people to work with.  Pay is slightly not as great as competition. Unfortunately Walgreens is open every holiday and corporate holds their customers at a higher level than their employees.
good,"the over all Culture was good in the majority of store's and  shared by most, while the company was not perfect they did well by there customer first and did well by there employees. had a great open door policy for all there employees posted COO down information. They cared, Management were encouraged to  live by the four way test rule. look it up "
good,"A typical day would be performing customer service as soon as the customer comes in the door. Answering all their questions and make their visit as painless as possible. Getting them in and out as soon as possible to get on with their day. I've learned a lot about dealing with different kind of people and different personalities. The hardest part of the job would have to be multitasking; as the main cashier I had to maintain a certain area, as well as check customers out, and we would be so busy that I had to wait until we were closed to complete all the tasks I had to do as well as the ending tasks. I loved working at that walgreens because I had coworkers that helped with any questions and was always there standing together."
good,"I really needed a job at that momment and they gave me a chance"

good,"Walgreen's have been my best job yet and its also has great benefits"
good,Fun store to work in due to employees. Work a little bit tedious but simple. Overall great experience and learned a few things about work environment. Hardest part about the job is rearranging store and shelves.; Most enjoyable part was the environment.
good,Very customer friendly and good teamwork. Never a hard or too difficult task. The hardest part about the job was stopping theft. The most enjoyable art of the job was bonding with the customers.
good,"worked in a lot a departments at  walgreens overnight sales associate, planogram associate, cashier, customer service, learned how to operate a folk lift"
good,I loved working there over all because everything was great. Benefits work environment clean peaceful but you had to be quick which I like . There’s always something to do I like to be busy. Pay was just fine for me. Light rail very close
good,ive worked at walgreens for about three months now. it started out great. i had good hours co workers were friendly and loved customers. it is very productive on truck days when we have to stock shelves. the bad thing is though is that they lower hours due to budget cuts
good,Walgreens was a fun and detailed oriented job to work for especially dealing with makeup you learned a lot about people’s different looks and the type of looks that they were going for

good,Overall working at Walgreens was very beneficial however there were some conflicts with scheduling and time off. I  learned a lot working there and I   am thankful for the newfound knowledge I   received but the way they handled scheduling was unprofessional.
good,I didn't work there my internship was just there however they treated me like one of the team members. They taught me to do everything that they do in the pharmacy.
good,I was always pushed to grow and developed. I started on the front register and made my way into management within 8 months. I worked my way up to Store Manager if I didn't have to relocate I would still be there. They care about their employees and their families.
good,Walgreens was a great place to work! I loved interacting with the customers and making sure all their needs were met. The staff was friendly & knowlegable.
good,People there are nice and management are fairly well. At least for my location. Although sometimes they would move you to other locations if not enough hours are set for you but you get to know new people.
good,Walgreens was a great company to work for They are one of the most wonderful companies to have a job with. They always offer you different ways to go about things wether is is for yourself or to help meet customer needs on a day to day basis
good,I really loved helping the customers with their prescriptions and answering any questions they had about their insurance coverage for their medications.
good,I overall love working at Walgreens. Management works well with everyone and company goals are met with everyone working together. I am just ready to leave only because I am ready to move on to what is going to help me in Nursing School.

good,"Retail sucks but I was fortunate enough to work with amazing people that made it bearable. Walgreens pays decently, and offers benefits like health insurance and profit sharing."
good,Overall it was a great job . I learned a lot and the pressure of being a manager taught me there is no pressure when things are always under cogntrol.
good,"My shifts here were usually 8-11 hour shifts. I learned how to adapt to different working environment. I am a hard working, fast paced multitasker who can work well under stress while staying positive, and I have great customer service skills. I learned how to handle issues with angry customers and thoroughly explain what the problem was and how I addressed it as well as assuring them they were well taken of so they can stay as a faithful customer. I loved my regular customers. I also answered phone calls addressing third party insurance issues and speaking with doctor offices regarding private patient information. My team had a different pharmacist just about every other day which was changeling at times but I was always confident the job would get done properly"
good,"On an average day shift at Walgreen's, it can be both fast yet slow. During the day, customers are quite frequent and typically starts to die down at about 7:30 and 8 ish. The management is understanding and willing to work with you and listen to your opinions. I'm always learning new things about the store and how to handle register errors/problems. What I enjoy most about working is either stocking shelves or working the photo department. At Walgreen's you always have a helping hand when needed and the team members are very nice."
good,"Well calm place to work at, i learned that you would have to put yourself first before anyone else. The management was alright easy to get along with."
good,Everyone works very hard to make it feel like family. Managers are very open on communication. I've learned time management and how to properly communicate with customers. It's very busy but very enjoyable.
good,I loved everything about my job! My boss was amazing as well as my coworkers! Everything was ran great! The work environment is definitely great to be around!
good,It can be a fun place but where this Walgreens is located it can get busy.  The management and employees are great to work with.  Excellent store manager.
good,"Day consist of assisting and checking out customers, stocking and cleaning. They had mandatory meetings and every associate has to attend that was held before the store open. They are competitive"
good,I love Walgreens and all of the different people there. during my time there I learned how to lead my team while maintaining the company core values. I also bult long lasting relationships with my customers.
good,Walgreen's provided me with the appropriate experience and knowledge base to successfully and confidently work and serve as a Pharmacist upon graduation. I have had many positive experiences that have helped shape and teach me how to handle many different kinds of situations.
good,"I have worked here for a few years and the benefits are definitely worth it. the tasks are not hard, the environment I work in is a positive and fun environment and I seriously enjoy where I am at. the hardest part is receiving product and working it out, but the easiest is working on tasks and assisting customers."
good,"A general day at Walgreens is typically relaxed and stress free as a regular Customer Service Associate, there are set days that everything is done so it's organized. For example, Saturdays you always hang weekly tags and on Wednesdays you will always unload the truck. It very easy and mostly enjoyable."
good,"walgreens offers more than just health and vacation benefits, they have many other perks and discounts with so many organizations. This is a great place to start work and make great connections with your community"
good,I have only been with the company for one month now. In just a few days the management and senior staff made a welcoming presents to me and helped me a lot with learning everything I need for the job. Managers have a an open door policy and are welcoming to any questions or complaints.
good,"Good place to work and alright pay, not really an understanding company don't seem to care if you are having family issues or absent due to something completely out of your hands(weather, children sick, or family matters)"
good,"I have worked for Walgreens 32 years, so actually I really enjoyed my job, I'm always willing to learn something different, everyday is different there different clientele. Put in an application"
good,I have loved Walgreens for a long time. I was always cared about. My manager was amazing. He scheduled us to have our birthdays off so we didn't have to try and use our pto for it. We could call him and he understood if life happened or our kids needed us. His management style was stern but fair and we all were listened to and respected.
good,Working at Walgreens is like being brought into a family. We all lookout for and encourage each other. My time at Walgreens has by far been the best working experience I could imagine. I love this company.
good,Fun working environment. Laid back for the most part but not to the point that it distracts from productivity. Greatly depends on the manager on duty.
good,I loved everything about Walgreen's company. Started as a Pharmacy Cashier and motivated me to become a technician. They genuinely care about your well being. Give you many learning opportunities to grow within the company and as a technician. Pay was decent even as a cashier.
good,"It has its days where it is very stressful, just because I work in the pharmacy as well as the front of the store. So, being a designated hitter has its days to where you are mentally and physically drained."
good,"This was my first job ever, I worked as a cashier and it was honestly such a wonderful place. Coworkers were extremely sweet and friendly like family, even customers were super nice! Of course there were bad ones here and there but the majority were great to talk to. The store can get pretty busy at times but another coworker will help you out during a rush. On top of being a cashier I occasionally worked truck and stocked shelves  + tagged items, put up sales tags, vacuumed and had go backs. My schedule was fixed but my manager was kind and understanding and would try his best to adjust my schedule if it was needed for something like school."
good,"Each day the routine changed however I learned a lot regarding cashiering stocking, and customer service. The manager an the coworkers were all helpful and was also encouraging in the learning process."
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for they treats their employees and customers amazing! The pay is decent and hours are here and there depending on the season and how many hours the company allows, which is the only downfall."

good,It’s a good place to work with all the employees they are all nice and very helpful.Its easy to learn a lot of things from this store from stocking on the register and cleaning there’s always something to do rather it’s a busy day or not.
good,"Really fast paced job, but great place to work. Managers keep you busy and help you out so you can do your work good with no problem. They make sure you are safe and following procedures so you won’t get hurt. When you start your shift you start with stretches to help you at work."
good,"A nice place to work, took about 2 weeks from the time I turned in my application to first day of work. "
good,"It is a great place to learn inventory skills, and it is a fun place to work! This is pretty much i can ssy for now.each team members collaborate tadk"
good,"My experience with working at Walgreens was a great, my team and I became more like a family than coworkers. I first began at the first courter as a service clerk than I move to the cosmetics department where I became the senior beauty advisor. It is very easy to climb the ladder of management in Walgreens. Management is always looking for hard working dependable candidates to fill management positions"
good,I have worked with an amazing group of coworkers who support each other. I have huge respect for the store managers & have learned some new techniques on doing things.
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for because they give you many changes to work in certain areas. Also, great decision routine of givingpromotions"
good,"Sometimes you will have time to catch a break and then other times you may just be too busy to blink an eye. I would say that if customer service is your thing and if you are well knowledgeable about the items in your store, policies and procedures, and how things work then you will be fine. The co-workers and managers were easy to talk to and will make any day good or bad, go by smoothly. I would recommend this type of job setting if your are energized, fast paced and ready to work!"
good,"Love the job, great place to work,and a great atmosphere. I had a boss who was open minded to new ideas for the store and allowed me to grow. He also encourage me to go forward in my career."
good,Very friendly environment fast pace work very organized. Security was good. Help stock work cashier customers service close store and train new starters.
good,"Honestly, Walgreens was my favorite jpb. I did it while I was mainly in high school, but I  worked good hours, and they start out higher than min wage, in my state at least. Great people, always had great customers, never a complaint about it."
good,very good company to work for the environment and the people was very good and they were always willing to lend a helping hand. Im glad i chose that company to work for
good,"job is pretty much relaxed but it’s fast paced but not like fast food fast paced. Morning shifts consist of doing cashier work your entire shift if you get assigned the register. If your on floors then you usually check in all the vendors that come in like Coca Cola, milk man, bread man, the guy that delivers the chips, the one who brings the packed food. & also you usually stock the entire morning shift & help out customers on the phone department. Nigth shift is pretty much the same thing and setting up display. And grave yard shift is the same thing but more focused on cleaning the store and making it look well stocked for morning shift and focused on unloading the walgreens truck. The job is pretty cool."
good,"•	Managing pharmacy operations, medication distribution and control systems, human resources, facilities and equipments "
good,would recommend to someone with no children a really good oppertunity for someone intrested in the pharmacy this company offers free onthe job traingfor pharmacy tec.
good,"great staff, good position to work as intern.  Staff provided great support.  Great environment, very clean and professional.  Only stressful area was number of prescriptions to be filled, adequate staff to complete tasks"
good,The best part of my job would be helping a patient and them leaving being completely satisfied with your service and thanking you and making your day .
good,Walgreen's is a fun environment to work. everyone there loves to laugh and help each other. it is a very team work oriented place. A normal work day is helping and being available  to assist customers. making sure nightly and daily tasks that are giving by the store manager are done. the hardest part of the job I would have to say is keep others focused on what our original goal is. the most enjoyable part of being a shift lead is being able to inspire other to do well and work together.
good,The manager was very clear with instruction and always helped me when i had questions my co-workers were helpful i didnt have any problems with my work place i would recommend working here for anyone who is looking for a job where you are constantly moving
good,great place to work if you want part time or full time customers for most part are friendly. you might have to work on a holiday ever now and then but not to bad.
good,It was a fun place to work at and everyone helped each other. we would have lunches every 2 months. we were like family. I still keep in contact with some of the co-workers.
good,"I managed up to 20 employees, between the front of the store and the pharmacy. Handle customer issues and employee issues. Weekly inventory, daily cash management."
good,"Although most employees are hired to fill specific positions in the store, it's more than likely those hired will be performing tasks all around the store as well. Becoming familiar with the ins and outs of daily procedure gives employees opportunities to go above and beyond their required work duty, potentially leading to promotions or raises."
good,"Walgreens helped build my confidence and made me appreciate giving customers great customer service. Work Culture is great, management take pride in our store and ensures that both customers and staff are happy."
good,"A typical day at work includes running the cash register and selling tobacco, beer, wine, and other products. What I learned while on the job was to face my aisles while it was not busy, also on Saturday nights we would pull old ad tags. What I learned while working there was how to do photo orders and check to see if the photo looked professional or not. Management was great and they had your back if a customer was upset about a policy. Workplace culture was very diverse all sorts of people from around the world worked there. The most hardest part of the job was finishing truck on time so the next day the morning crew sometimes had to finish truck. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I got to help unload truck and learn how to organize things."
good,I learned a lot from working at Walgreens' especially how to prioritize on the task that was given to me. We all worked as a team and helped each other.
good,"everyone have  a great attitude and willingness to work under brand standards. all team members have a passion for delivering the best customer service, who are confident and knowledgeable, make all the difference."
good,"I had good days, but there were days that were a little stressful, but handled it very well. I learned how to do returns, I love working with the public"
good,"Walgreens is a very laid back place to work at, but there are also times where it can be very stressful. All in all its a relatively easy job, great for a student in college."
good,I am interested in helping the company by giving them my best. I feeli have knowledge in different areas that would be helpful. I also get along well with others.
good,"You had to be quick in the pharmacy and accurate."
good,"Very busy job, so much more loyal customers"
good,"I was with this company for more then 12 years and in those years I have had so many awesome experiences that allowed me to learn from hands on experience different trainings that excelled me to move forward and get licensed as an state certified Pharmacy technician, only due to medical reasons is why I was not able to continue with this wonderful company"
good,"they work around your schedule if need be ,co workers got along willing to help each other out ,management was easy to get along with as well ,easy to talk mto"
good,The environment was busy and productive in every way. I would always find things to do even if it was a little slow in the beginning of the day. I loved that there was so much to do and I balanced it the best I could. I got the job done no matter how busy and demanding the job was. I wouldn't have liked it any other way. I was motivated every day.
good,"Coworkers and management were very nice and helpful. Worked around your schedule, helped you out when needed, also helped you find answers that you didn't know"
good,"In the job you are always moving."
good,Great people to work around. Management is professional and understanding about flexible hours for students. Opportunity for growth within the company is a plus.
good,There were clearly defined assignments and expectations. I learned to work with others in a diverse environment.  Camaraderie was encouraged.   Cross training was encouraged.
good,I liked this job but we was always short handed. You couldn't move up the ladder unless you had a college degree. The hardest part of the job is not having enough workers to unload the truck.
good,"I work at one of the busiest pharmacy in Charlotte, Nc, so yrs it can be very stressful at times. However with the right management, it's great. The benefits are fabulous if you use them and there is definitely potential to move up in the company, but more on the front end than the pharmacy. Still a great place to work"
good,It is a good job for those who do not have much experience in customer service or need a college job. It is not to difficult as long as you do what management tells you to do.
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work.  I'd only like a career advancement, this is the reason of posting my resume.  I have 25+ designing, developing, building, deploying information systems, would like to stay in the area."
good,"I expect the experience will vary widely from store to store and manager to manger, but for what it's worth- my experience was largely positive. I had good managers who noted and appreciated my work, and the coworkers were enjoyable to share shifts with."
good,I feel that the volunteer did more work then the real works. and that not right. it was a fun place to work at everybody was nice i became friends some of my coworkers.
good,All staff members were friendly and hard working.  Opportunities for advancement were there for anyone wanting to take a bite of the apple.  Job security and financial stability are embedded within the company.  No worries of company buyout or selling was an issue.
good,"Worked as an intern under the direct supervision of a registered Pharmacist."
good,I enjoyed the experience of the job due to the fact I gained skills of customer service from the time me being there . Not only gaining a lot of knowledge but being able to apply it to a future position in any fields I decide to go
good,Walgreens has been a wonderful job for me these past 7 yrs. I have enjoyed the customers and always have gotten along with colleagues and management. Our store is the only one in town and customers are loyal and most appreciate our dedication to their satisfaction and fulfillment of their needs.
good,I was fortunate to find a part time job at Walgreens.  Management was easy to work with. Training was organized and easy to complete. Co-workers were nice people and willing to help. Hardest part of the job was inspecting large products for expired dates.
good,"I was working there as a lead, I started as a forklift driver.it was a nice place to work, but for my first time, it was hard for me to drive a forklift.but I enjoyed it."
good,"Overall, I loved the job. I enjoyed all of my co-workers. I was a Designated Hitter which means I worked every department such as Photo, Cosmetics, Front Register and Pharmacy."
good,"Would recommend this job to a great friend. I had a great relationship with the manager who was very wonderful and always helped out around the store. We were a team even though it was only three of us in the store every night, the manager was on the floor with me making sure the store was in shape, cleaned and in order."
good,"Walgreens treats their employees with respect and kindness. I learned so much during my years working there. I was prepare properly for my position in the office, out on the floor and in the pharmacy."
good,"I was a cashier (Customer Service Associate) at Walgreen for a few months. I would definitely recommend this job for anyone looking for a  short term or even long term job. I was paid 9 dollars an hour, reasonable for a cashier. The workplace was fun and I felt everyone was really nice and understanding. The customers are well, customers, but the majority are nice people. I was never asked to work unreasonable hours. "
good,"I love Walgreens. Everyone is kind and wants you to become better at all aspects of your job. It is a great place to start out and provides many advancement opportunities if that is what you are looking for. I would stay with them for a long time if it wasn't for the 9.00 an hour wage. It is a fair wage for the tasks being preformed, just need more to live."
good,"Quick paced"
good,We have a meeting about what is required of us for the week. Then we go over safety regulations and make sure we are following them. Then we break up and get to work for the long night ahead.
good,This was an amazing workplace that lead me to grow professionally and in general just gave me a helping hand in helping me obtain a job in the future.
good,"Keep your head on a swivel."
good,Walgreens was a nice place to work in. I made the hours I needed and the work was easy. The managers and workers were very respectful and treated everyone equally.
good,"I love Walgreens. Its just hard to advance.There are too many steps to take to advance to the next level. The DM is awesome, and friendly. The customers are greatful. The welcome can be a bit ""robotic"", as some customers have said."
good,Great company but salary not equal to job duties and almost always in overtime. Learned an enormous amount about specialty drugs. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with Synagis patients and obtaining the medication for infants.
good,I loved the customers that I met at walgreens some where happy and others were angry. But I was kept on my toes cause there were always somerhing different when I came to work.
good,"Walgreen's is a GREAT place to work. It was the first job I ever had and was hired at the age of 16 as a beauty adviser in 2014. I left after 8 months to pursue newer interests and job opportunity. The workplace in itself is rewarding when it comes to the customers/patients. You'll have daily regulars and you'll grow exceedingly to them and to the company. I currently work at Walgreen's again because I love the company that much. I have been here again for a solid 9 months. This company is rewarding and it allows growth, it honestly promotes it. It also gives character and discipline."
good,"I really enjoyed working at the distribution center. The job was ridiculously easy. You basically just had to show up. As long as you hit your productivity for the night, no one paid much attention. I became a trainer and that was the most boring few months of my life, but it was easy money. Overtime is almost unlimited around the Christmas season. The pay is good for what you do there."
good,"Start by making sure my area is clean and neat. Wait on customers. Stock merchandise if needed.Do resets,if needed( rearranging merchandise to make room for new stuff)."
good,"Great place to work, able to work different areas , learn new jobs within the store, a safe environment (security available), Customer Service is remarkable, staff and managers work as one team.....GREAT TEAM PLAYERS!!!/ Have good community outreach resources, great locations worldwide, able to transfer store locations from state to state. Pharmacy is opened 7 days a week including Holidays & Weekends."
good,"It’s a great place to start working here as your first job many experiences. I love this place but we are always understaffed , we have a lot to do. There are several more stuff. But it was a real rollercoaster ride ."
good,I really enjoyed working for Walgreens and advanced really quickly from Pharmacy Tech to ASM. I would recommend being open to relocating and go the extra mile.
good,I started on overnights which worked great. They had to change me to days and I could not handle standing for 8 plus hours with my disability. it was great working and getting the discounts. I think I spent my paycheck every week there. If I could have kept my overnights I would still be there.
good,I liked the how quickly they moved me into a department on my own after working well at the front register. I appreciated how understanding my managers were when family issues arose and always checked up on my work during a shift.
good,I work at the photo department and I have the opportunity to help customers with different needs. My coworkers are nice and helpful and I have had good relation with management
good,"Great to work there.  I like being busy."
good,The company is very professional. There is always a good communication to the employees about any changes in the policy. Open door policy and a very good hierarchy in the management.
good,"It's retail there are good and bad points to retail jobs but I would have to say that the Walgreen's I have been in and worked at are very clean, easy to get around in and the employees are extremely helpful and kind. They are all very much customer orientated."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walgreen's. I only worked as an intern in the pharmacy, so my time there was not long or paid. Depending on the time of day, the work is very fast paced. Some mornings and nights are slow."
good,Enjoyed working here. You get a discount on merchandise which is great. The only think that would make this job better is if they paid more than minimum wage.
good,Daily work is conducted without micromanagement. There is a lot of opportunity to learn new technologies and wear many hats as you grow with the company. Work/life balance is great.
good,"I had a good day for most part , works when by fast when you focused and making customers happy . I was a fast paced learned and always made sure the customers were happy leaving and got everything they needed ."
good,"The people I work with are like a second family. We support each other in and out of work.  We could use more training time for new employees, as well as, new to the work force."
good,A wonderful place to work. Great customers and employees. Management was not so well but everyone has a different experience. Everyone is friendly and very helpful.
good,"A work day was slow, customers knew what they came in for so didn't really need our help. I learned the difference between normal and gel nail polish."
good,"I enjoy my work at Walgreens.I process photo order for customers that are created in store or online. Typical items are prints of various sizes, canvases, posters, calanders, and photo books. There are other tasks to do through out the store as well."
good,"It's a great job to have. You will learn lots of things about retail. The only two things I don't like about Walgreens are, having to work every holiday, and the lack of raises you can receive."
good,"Working at Walgreens is truly a really good place to start at. You can always advance if you want to go towards management and even towards the pharmacy. You have to like repeated tasks (printing pictures, ringing up customers, doing outdates, move stuff to move stuff, clean surfaces). You learn how to give excellent customer service here. The management that I've had so far has been very good but have had a rough store manager. The hardest part about the job is dealing with rude customers but anywhere you go will include that whether it be customers, patients, or coworkers. Other than that, I have enjoyed my time at Walgreens!"
good,"I loved everyone I worked with at my walgreens. However, promotions were slow. One of my managers has been there for years, is excellent, and had yet to receive a promotion. Definitely a family vibe amongst coworkers so that was nice."
good,Slow and learn of thing and career advanced and co-worker help each other and make customer happy and management said thank you end of your shift go home
good,"My experience at Walgreens was really good. The store I was at had managers that made the shifts fun. The customers there were kind and usually understanding. Obviously there were upset customer that you could not please, but they were not the norm."
good,"Money handling, opening store, closing store, counting registers, receiving merchandise, receiving  vendor order, making vendor orders, making task sheet for all emploeyes, photo printing in photo lab, helping fill prescriptions  in the pharmacy,  store resets, stocking, merchandise  online orders, cashier, customer service."
good,Learned how to work with my co workers and help my customers and help them any way I could. Our managers were the the ones who thought us wrong and right
good,Walgreens is a great well balanced pharmacy. Their valise are outstanding. Other the other had lack of proper management can harm behind the scene out of customers sight.
good,"Great place to work"
good,"I loved working at Walgreens the hours were great for pharmacy, the training was a little tough but necessary, they offer being certified which is great, and they thoroughly educate you"
good,"Love working here! The co-workers and managers are all very positive and encouraging. It is very much like a big happy family here on staff at Walgreens. I have learned so much in my time here with the company and look forward to learning more and more here and at any other company in the future. Getting to learn new things and meet new people, as well as getting to serve customers is what I look for in a job and that is certainly what I have received here at Walgreens."
good,"Working at the pharmacy in Walgreens I would encounter a wide range of problems I would have to solve. It was important to keep a open line of communication with the patient and the other employees. Walgreens team was excellent at working together to effectively produce a solution to any problem including: finding lower priced generic prescriptions, keeping specific medication in stock because of customer preference, speaking to insurance regarding pricing and patient preference. The hardest part about the job is working with difficult patients but that is also the most rewarding part. When you are able to solve an issue and bring the patient a sense of peace that is when you've worked your hardest"
good,LOVED working here! Management gets to accomodate all your needs even last minute within reason. Coworkers are fun. Definitely will challenge you especially in the pharmacy. There's a lot to learn.
good,"It can be super stressful depending on the given situation, but overall I really enjoy working there. But, I am looking for a job that correlates with my college major."
good,no complaints about this job. You can move up quickly with this company. the benefits are okay. Management needs a little improvement but for the most part pretty good.
good,"I love working at Walgreens management is wonderful. You don't have anyone watching your every move . Laid back "
good,"Plenty of support, training, and staff back in 2006 when I was there but with new CEO huge pharmacist lay offs and hour cut backs ruined a great progressive job with limitless advance opportunities."
good,"I found many friends within my work environment. I would recommend the job to anyone who asks. I advanced more than I expected in skills and as a person. "
good,"Walgreen's is a good company to work for. They are very accepting and patient with people who have special needs. Even though the hours are not that great sometimes, I would definitely recommend them."
good,The employees where very helpful to me and able to teach me hands on when I was learning new skills. It was fast paced but I was able to pick up on particular skills that was required for the job.
good,I would stock up all the shelfs and help costumers with finding products. The managers were very nice and friendly. I would defiantly go back and work there again if I could.
good,"Printing and processing media orders including: printed photos (digital and 35 millimeter) posters, canvases, photo books, and greeting cards, calendars, and media transfers,Instructional service on kiosks and maintenance of photo lab equipment."
good,"The job was to fill the sales floor and help the customer. In the department of photos we worked with fujifilm machinery and developed 35mm and digital. They worked for salary. It was a full time job and had full medical coverage, dental plan, sick days and vacations."
good,"managers are very understanding. they have never mistreated me. very fun place to work, sometimes have to deal with complicated customers but i take it as a challenge"
good,"Wasn't able to work there for a while, but for the time I did, the work was pretty decent. Everyone was pretty friendly to me and helped me learn quick"
good,Working in a fast paced atmosphere and meeting people. After I started working I quickly advanced to Head Photo Specialist. During my working experience I meet people in a lot of different positions.
good,Everybody was easy to get along with. I enjoyed my work environment. My managers were always helpful and so were my coworkers. My time spent there was awesome.
good,Great place to work entire staff is very friendly and helpful I love the fact that we all work together and get the job done I have learned so many new task that is essential for my position that I was not aware of management is great very easy to talk to open door policy the hardest part of the job for me is sometimes I forget new task  but I enjoy my co-workers they are all very helpful they assist me during that  a time with an understanding attitude and no question is dumb the most enjoyable part for me is working with a great group of people and meeting new people and assisting helping them.
good,"great people it was a blast  to work, great com0pany, needed more pay though , you needed some work shoes , I learned how to work with others and do unloading"
good,"Lots of help with training, very nice employed to work with. Updated equipment. No overtime aloud, great place for advancement, different departments you can work in"
good,Mis deseos es seguir superándome son buena empresa
good,"During my time working for the Walgreen Corporation, I have gained exceptional skills working with daily customers, and working in a fast-paced setting learning new things everyday."
good,"Loved working for this company but needed another job, not enough hours per week. Working environment is great, associates are treated like family. I will love to returned one day."
good,"A typical day at work means getting your daily duties for your shift from your manager. You communicate with the person that worked the shift before you on that day to see where they left off on their list to see what was or was not finished."
good,I would not work for any other chain pharmacy. The technology is superior to any other chain and management is very supportive. Hours can be long in certain stores.
good,"This is a good company to work for with good benefits. They are an equal opportunity employer that promotes from within. You continue to learn as you work your way up. They are willing to teach you on the job and in some cases will reimburse you for classes.  They have over 8000 stores, many distribution centers and since the company merged with Boots/Alliance they are now a global company."

good,"A typical day at Walgreen is busy doing resets, ordering, periodic counts, customer service, multitasking, stocking, receiving, cashiering and much more."
good,Learning new strategies and ways to help the patients to the best of your abilities. You always get recognized for your great efforts and terrific customer service. The policies and procedures are very candid.
good,Great benefits. Great company. I wish I never left. Had a decent store manager but my pharmacy manager was awesome. I'd go back in a heartbeat if I could.
good,"wonderful place to work. Great advancement opportunities, clean and busy store, organized, management was very good at what they do. Would love to go back. You"
good,"great opportunity"
good,"Employment with Walgreens was very educational and promising. I was promoted several times with several pay raises as well. I had a lot of responsibility and mostly enjoyed dealing with customers, resetting and revising the store plan and ensuring that our customers needs were exceeded beyond expectation. My coworkers were all helpful and depended on me tremendously to carry out orders, tasks and deadlines for each day."
good,"Working here is great, I enjoy working here but the customers are something else! They get really upset at you for the stores policy and it's just nerve racking!"
good,On a daily basis you primary focus is to help the customers with their needs. On occasion you are required to help with the stocking of merchandise and the maintenance and appearance of the store.
good,"Working here you'll gain many skills that you can carry with you into other jobs, working at Walgreens will leave you with many benefits, you can also start a career with this company"

They take great pride in their customers and their employees , They are Good with Customer service and there Sales are Great too. Every week there is a Sale on Items that I use or my Family and Friends Need .Very Convenient.."
good,fun place to work if you can stand for hours and you have great customer service. you do have to stand for hours but if you can withstand it you will like it.
good,"The location was a longer commute, however the pharmacy staff including the store manager and sales. Associates where respectful and helpful, made going to work a good environment for such a low pay salary."
good,"Management is good, co-workers are good, flexible with the hours because of school, pay is average, not too bad. Very customer focused. Opportunity for advancement in position and pay."
good,"After working here for a short period of time, I can say that most everyone was professional and friendly (of course there are the few that weren't). They value employee involvement, and promote throughout the company, although sometimes its appears as if was based off of popularity as opposed to hard work. Unfortunately I had to leave because they dragged their feet when it came to  accommodating my school."
good,"When I first started, it was management was kind of a wreck, as the pharmacy manager had left concurrently to the hiring of me.  But within a month or so, they hired a new manager that was excellent, and did his best to keep all of his employees happy, and really showed he cared for all of us as a team."
good,"very competent mgmt, professional work environment focused on delivering above average customer service. management enables employee to handle situations to care for customers to ensure they will remain customers. employees work well together and share responsibility of complete customer care."

good,"Every jobs have up and its downs but everyone works to get past it. Managers help work along side and respond to things when needed. Whether it be to help with a long line, double check facing, or help the customers needs beyong that of just a customer service representative. It makes me want to strive to better my abilities and skills."
good,"This has been a great place to work for the past 5 years. I really like my current management team, and co-workers, although sometimes there can be drama of course. I love that Walgreens finally added the DH job title of someone who works on the floor but goes to help the pharmacy when needed. Gives the harder workers the compensation they deserve, without forcing them into management if they don't desire to advance."
good,"This job gave me security that's what i loved the most. Gained lots of product knowledge, inventory maintenance, and floor resets. Great company to work for in general."
good,"Its very easy in my opinion. Just help guests, try to answer questions the best way you can and if you can't then call the manager. A lot of guests are rude but when your dealing with customer service its a huge chance people will be rude with you. Always smile and be nice. Giving beauty advice to anyone who has any questions about it."
good,A great company to work for. They want their employees to be flexible and they are very flexible as well which is very convenient for a person with children.
good,Company is great to work for. Various opportunities in advancement. Opportunities to relocate. Benefits are excellent. Work shifts can be very busy and hours vary by location.

good,"Walgreens is a great starting place, great for a forever job if the hours work for you. They offer many advancement opportunities and work with you to help you achieve your goals."
good,"Its fun, you learn new things. I recommend this job especially as an entry level, theres plenty of opportunities to move up in management or pharmacy should you wish."
good,"Walgreens was a very balanced setting. Typically, it was slow during the week and very busy on the weekends. The management was great, the customers were fun to be around and the environment was an enjoyable setting"

good,"managers are bossy, lots of work needed for little pay, expect you to bend over backwards for customers that don't deserve it and hardly ever a thank you"
good,I worked for 5 weeks straight. I mainly filled prescriptions and interacted with the customers. I had a great team who helped me very much. I also worked the drive thru for the first time. The hardest part is because I was new and still in school I did not get to much experience with typing or phone calls. The most enjoyable was filling and interacting with the customers.
good,"Walgreens is a great company. They give you a lot of opportunities, I would have never expected to have been a Pharmacy Tech but the managers of my store gave me a chance that I honestly didn't want to do in the first place. Even shocked when they had asked me and I could never thank them enough. If it wasn't for the circumstances that had happened with me, I would still be there right now."
good,"It is a good company to work for, but there are times where you need another employee and like most companies there just isn't anyone else. Other than that I don't have too many complaints."

good,The shirt time I worked a for Walgreens was great. I learner some many new job skills. One of my first jobs. Wouldn't mind working for Walgreens again. As a beauty advisory I also had the chance ti earn commission on certain cosmetic items.
good,"I haven't been working there for that long, but the day just starts off with the bus riders coming for bus passes. It is pretty slow during the morning. I am not much of a smoker but i am starting to know the brands due to customers request. Some managers are great to work with but there are a few where thy make the job just mundane. Like the managers some are great and others not so great but overall the coworkers there are the best. Hardest part is still trying to figure out where products go where. Enjoyable part is when i get to meet new people."
good,Everyday was different. No two jobs were the same. This was a unique position. Liked working with the team members in Lighting Support. They were good people. Everyone pulled together when someone else was struggling.
good,I loved working at Walgreens. The people I worked with were great. I loved working in photo. Walgreens was helping me pursue my dream of becoming a photographer. It was a great experience and the pay wasn't half bad.
good,I love my job and my coworkers. The only negative i have is that they could pay us a little more.I am looking for a part time job to go with this job.
good,Nice speedy work day. Never a dull moment to be around the employees. My co-workers were amazing people who were fun to be around.

good,Has been a good place to work for the last 10 years.  Also great team members.  Benefits are somewhat expensive.  Have gotten great experience from good store managers.
good,"Most fays depending on what shift worked vary in what as was done and not done. Morning/ day shift usually were the ones who would build end stands put up stock or work on truck. Night shift was more focused on busy lines and customer assistance since truck was usually completed by then."
good,I really enjoyed my time at Walgreens. Had the hours not been cut back I would still be there. We did have trouble keeping a pharmacy manager while I was there which made some tasks difficult. The store manager at the time wasn't my favorite but it is a great company with great benefits.

good,"Honestly it depends on which store you work at, the managers can have their own rules. But my store was amazing and it made me believe walgreens was one of the best companies out there."
good,I have worked at a couple of retail pharmacies and Walgreens was the best to work for.  Walgreens knew exactly how to run a pharmacy and working there compared to other retail pharmacies the were the most experienced and had the latest technology and still does.  The only reason for leaving Walgreens was to start my own pharmacy.
good,"I love working here for this company.  The computer system is amazing and comprehensive, which makes your life as a pharmacist so much easier."
good,"Walgreens I would say is a any ordinary drug store."
good,"As a Beauty Advisor, I was in charge of maintaining and supervising the beauty department. My daily job function was to oversee a team of 3 to 4 team members in ensuring customer overall satisfaction and product quality control. Upon hiring, I was involved in the process of deciding whether employee would be a good candidate for the department. Once hired I trained employees one on one on how to maintain and ensure the best customer service possible."
good,if you want to shop at a drug store who does things well...this is the one for you! always ontop of prices and resets and carry most items your looking for. Most managers stay ontop of employees to do their best and also most employees get along...if there is any rift it is resolved with a manger to regain the smooth running of the store
good,"Management is good, its nice getting the regular customers. The tasks are pretty simple, they keep you occupied so the shift goes pretty smooth and i work with nice people so makes it a nice place to be. Learn some people skills, and how to use new items as in electronics"
good,"The employees and customers where great. Being open on all holidays rain or storm was a little stressful at times. I worked 10 am to 8 pm 5 days a week,"
good,"My shifts range by department. I start with a company purchased smock and pink shirt (cosmetics), but add self purchased comfortable uniform, (tan pants, comfy shoes for walking and standing for 8 to 10 hours).  "

I really have to say the customers are one of the main reasons I'm still there."
good,"Great organization to work for, everyday is a new experience. Employees care about the customers and customers are loyal."
good,Walgreens is always full of surprises mainly due to the very diverse group of customers. Some days are busy and seems to never end. On other days you actually are able to relax and build these great bonds with your co workers and customers. The hardest part of the job is to deal with the unhappy people especially when it is something that you are unable to resolve. The best part is the management. They are always willing to help you on the job and off the job. They really care about you and your life.
good,"There's a lot of routine to working at Walgreen's. I loved coming in, knowing what I'm supposed to do and what department I would be working in. Though that wasn't the case all the time, it happened often."
good,"As a Beauty Advisor, one of the first things I had to do after punching in was check up the up-and-coming products our store would carry. It was helpful to be familiar with the products so I could suggest it to any customer for whom it would be a perfect fit!"
good,I would do 10 hour days providing customers with much needed support .I was in charge of 8 staff members intake vendor orders all cash nightly deposits and proof of closing general ledger before deadlines. I had written employee  reviews as well as well as hiring and firing of staff.

good,"Walgreens is a company you have to understand in order to move forward. I really had some great experiences at this company. My first ever promotion came from working here. I was with the company for a very long time. It is dishearting and bittersweet that I didn't fully take advantage of the opportunities that were given or didn't seek. I learned about hard work, putting your best foot forward and persistence. Management and employees were okay."
good,"•	Assisted customers to find requested items, and recommended merchandise based on customer needs and desires."
good,"constant changes allow for contact center management experience in many aspects, from phone calls, to contacts."
good,Get customer exposure and opportunity to be familiar to the community around you.  Co-works were great to be with and if a question comes up I always have someone willing to help out.  Hardest part is trying to familiarize yourself with primary and secondary insurance claims and reasons why some constantly do not go through for the patients.  Occasionally an angry patient will come in when we are Out of Stock of certain medication.  Most enjoyable part is that time truly does go by fast.
good,"My experience with working at Walgreens I not only was a great cashier, I was able to learn how to stock shelves and unload trucks with inventory.

good,"I loved working at Walgreens. When I first got my job there, I worked in the Cosmetics department. I was known for creating eye catching displays when we would get in new products. After some time, my Store Manager approached me and asked if I would like to train to be a Pharmacy Technician. I jumped at the chance. When I first started there, I was mostly in charged of ringing up guests' prescriptions. As time went on, I asked for more responsibility. I began Doctors' offices for refill requests and eventually, started dealing with insurance companies. My co workers were wonderful.

My co workers helped me out and taught me a lot. I learned how to operate a cash register, drive thru, computer systems, type new prescriptions, refills, fill vials, stock the shelves with meds, call doctors' offices for refill requests and other questions. I always made sure I stayed busy. If it got slow, I would clean the counters or dust the whole pharmacy! I also vacuumed. I am not the type of person to just stand around being lazy and not getting a single thing accomplished. I made sure I was doing something productive, and if there was nothing to do, I would ask the Pharmacist on duty. The hardest part of this job was the complaints. At our store, we never had enough help, so prescriptions were not ready at the promised time, so that caused a lot of angry customers! I enjoyed meeting a lot of nice people. I learned so much from my coworkers along with the phamacists'. I wish I never had left, but I had no choice but to put in my two weeks due to the loss of hours from Walgreens loosing Express Scripts customers. This was my favorite job I've ever had. I learned the most at Walgreens!"

The members of the management team are reliable, collaborate well to get the job done at hand, in addition to being accountable for their own actions by sharing humility. The only diffucult moment I may face on my job is seeing the dissapointment in a customer face when we do not have a particular item in stock. I feel as though providing excellent customer care is a priority and that is my intention throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of my job is receiving compliments from the customers about our associates, as well as management staff. It is my priority to ensure that customers have a friendly visit at our establiment."

Despite the work tending to be overwhelming at times, Walgreens is a fun place to work with a clean environment and job culture that makes it easy to get along with other workers. Walgreens is a wonderful place to work if you want to learn more about/gain experience in the field of customer service since the company's major emphasis is on providing excellent customer care over daily duties. Like any job, some co-workers were difficult and lacked motivation to do their work and would leave it for others to do or would treat other employees with disrespect, but overall the employees I worked with had a good sense of humor and were able to joke around and pick on each other while also remaining professional with one another. No matter who I worked with I was always able to have a good time with them and get along just fine. The hardest part of the job tends to be routine intricate tasks that require long-term focus  such as running back and forth between the candy isle and register, checking every single candy bar for it's expiration date while still trying to check people out. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was working with people and getting them what they needed in a friendly, timely manner while also enjoying the company of fun co-workers.

Now that I have over 1 year exp at my current job the juggling isn't near as hard,"
good,"Depending on which Walgreens you attend, there are anywhere from three to zero technicians at a certain time. There are always two pharmacist working on any day except Sundays. A typical day begins with filling prescriptions and seeing what problems have to be resolved for that day. Then while dealing with patients picking up and dropping off prescriptions, we try to call doctors offices for prescription refills and prior auths. We call insurances for any problems that may arise while processing prescriptions. Later on in the day we order any medication that we didn't have in stock or had to partial. At the end of the day we clean up and restock everything that the next day pharmacist would need. I have learned so much, from names or drugs and their use, to compounds how to calculate almost anything that a pharmacist or a technician needs.

good,"I enjoyed working at Walgreens, the managers were kind and co workers were welcoming I worked at 2 different ones so I can end up being closer to home.

There is always room for advancement"
good,Walgreens is a great company to work for because they are family oriented and care about their employees.  The only downfall that I have encountered is the way they cut hours.  This year has been the hardest since I started with Walgreens but the management at my store makes sure they are fair with the cut hours.

good,I loved working for Walgreens it was very structured. The company had good work ethic and empathy for the employees.

good,"A fastpaced and busy store with many duties to keep you busy.  Direct managers were fantastic,  there is a lot of training however and you must keep up with that as well.  Keeping stock and merchandising changed and re-set was sometimes challenging but it became enjoyable too.  My favorite part is alway the merchandising."

The hardest part of the job is working with sick customers from time to time, however they just want to feel better and helping them makes you feel like your making a difference."
good,Management helps you perform as different from driving you to perform. Well defined goals. Encourages you to give feedbacks. The feedbacks are responded to and action plans are developed based on such feedbacks. The work life balance is ensured by adhering 40 hour week schedules. The large number of branches make keep commute time and stress under check.

good,Enjoy working for Walgreens.  Always evolving and changing with the times.  Creates change of pace and opportunities  to learn new things.   Benifits are good.

good,I really enjoyed my time with Walgreens. I left when my mother developed dementia and was no longer able to care for herself.

good,"I loved my job, both in the photo department and in the pharmacy. Photo was my favorite. I had great co-workers and great managers. The store manager I worked for should be the model for all retail store managers. My customers were great! I could fill any role in the store if needed. I learned how to do everything I could. I had a lot of responsibility but it never felt like it. I don't know that every store is as good to work for as the one I worked for, but they should be. There was a lot to learn to be able to run the photo department and also to become a pharmacy technician. Both jobs require a lot of attention to detail, in addition to great customer service."

good,I always recommend working for Walgreens to anyone who says they are looking for a job. This company really took care of me and kept me with them even when I had to relocate suddenly and didn't give them any notice. My managers genuinely cared for me and I was always sure of my role and importance to the company.
good,"As a retail pharmacist, you are required to spend long hours standing and become proficient at multi-tasking! The system is fairly easy to use. Overall, great retail company to work for."

During this job I learned how to communicate quickly and precisely to get customers what they wanted right away. The team of people I worked with were incredibly collaborative and we all got along very well and it became like a little family. I would have to say that the hardest part of that job was actually seeing dozens of people everyday and scanning over 800 items per day but the most enjoyable part was actually how close I got to come of the regulars, in fact I still am in touch with some."

The work place was a bit fast paced around holidays. The hardest part of the job was having a schedule that constantly changed every week. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the customers, who shopped there regularly and the products they liked."
good,"Depending on where you're working at, at Walgreens, you could either be laid paid waiting for someone to come to your register or in a face pace environment in the pharmacy considering it never stops in there."
good,"I absolutely loved working at Walgreens, there is so much room to grow. The employees are great, my only issue working at Walgreens was my house. Having to work a lot of nights and weekends is not ideal."
good,"I loved working with all of my managers and coworkers, Walgreens is also a very open minded company where all opinions are heard, their pay rate could be higher as well compared to other cashier stores."
good,A typical day at work was just restocking and putting the return merchandises back where it belongs. I learned how to use the bar code when needing to find where it belongs. Management was super great.
good,Walgreens has been a great place to work and a good working experience. The district managers and store managers have been very helpful for transition into Walgreens.
good,This is a great place to work. They hire many with disabilities and give everyone a fair chance to succeed. I would recommend this company to anyone who asks me.

good,"we were all a big family. we all worked well together, our managers listened, and HEARD what we were saying. "
good,I loved my job as an Assistant manager at Walgreens. This company is all about development and training their employees to be better. They give you the best training and job opportunities. They like ti promote from within instead of hiring outside of the company. The only thing I didn't like about this company was being open all the time no holidays off and there was not a set schedule.
good,It was very exciting to work at Walgreens I have many different experiences the managers were great coworkers I learned a lot throughout every department even the pharmacy
good,"Excellent place to work for students or retirees. Flexible hours and very friendly management. Easy training and great health benefit, along with flexible pay and great job discount."

good,"Typical day at work consisted of checking customers out at the front desk. Mild cleaning upfront. Stocking upfront merchandise and displays. Keeping the front clean, neat, and tidy. Greeting people as they walked in."
good,"Dealing with irate or very ill clients gives you a chance to work on your patience and keep a level head. Dealing with insurance and having to tell clients that a particular drug is not covered or that they insist on having the brand name drug. Learning from your pharmacist on how to enter prescriptions that are difficult is always appreciated. Sometimes it can be a bit stressful when clients are demanding and not felling well.  I found that if you work harder at entering the prescriptions quicker, the less stress you put on yourself and  others. I truly enjoyed working here with other technicians as well as pharmacists. I still keep in contact with them from time to time."

The culture of Walgreens is to ensure that its consumers live a healthy, and a well-structured life, in both health and in practical areas of life.  The typical day at work, included interacting with, and helping customers find products for better health and awareness. The best part of the job was blowing up the balloons to promote the store's sales and promotions.

good,Typical to work from either 9-5 or 12-9pm. Hardest part are Monday morning because they are extra busy.But otherwise its a great and friendly place to work.
good,"My overall experience at Walgreens was great. I made pretty good money there and they offered good benefits. I had to find other employment because of a new rule they had which required all of the mailorder rx/pharmacy customer service reps had to pass a pharmacy test and if the person did not pass the test, they would drop their pay. Unfortunately I missed the test by 3 points and I worked there for 5 yrs...the pay cut would've been too great of a cut so I pursued employment elsewhere."
good,"Managers were always acknowledging the employees doing a great job. Awesome team work. Friendly managers. They care about employees well being. After requesting something, management team always makes sure you are taken care of. They worked with my schedule of availability, They were eager to promote and teach new things to us who wanted to learn or advance."

The customers specifically came to me to advise them which products would best suit their needs. I then was advanced to senior beauty advisor. I was head of the beauty department. I was learning new product weekly, dispalying new products and tagging new products. To me there was not a hard part of the job. I enjoyed doing what I did at Walgreens. Management and co workers were always friendly and helpful."
good,"Working at Walgreens Pharmacy is very dynamic because the employee is continuously multitasking from taking in prescriptions, to selling filled medications, transcribing the original prescription into the computer program IC+ (which is used to fill the prescriptions.) The co-workers are what make the place a pleasure to be in because they are very nice, patient oriented and together with the staff and pharmacy manager we work as a team to provide patients with their medication in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible."

My Manager also had very positive vibe and constantly strive for the store to be at its best. while i was there i have learned how to manage money and to work fast paced environment. though there was never a hard part about the jobs. the most enjoyable part was helping the costumers non stop its sort of gives me this rush.
good,"Working at Walgreens on a daily basis is very fun yet educating. I have learned many different health, and pharmaceutical fundamentals with the year I have been with the company. The management there are highly understandable and very easy to work with. The most difficult part of my day on the job was be teaching myself patients when I first started working there, but working with the team I have completely changes my mood and day in the best way."
good,"I learned a lot working at Walgreens. I gained management skills and was able to put my previous skills, such as customer service and translating, to use. "
good,"A typical day at work would start either with stocking or helping customers at the front register, sometimes handling returns, or directing them in the store, greeting every customer as they walk in, and making small talk, then as the day progressed I would rotate from that to stocking and inventory, sometimes ringing out long lines in beauty department, and then finishing the day with facing the aisles in my department, replacing sale tags, and changing trash bins at each register and the bathrooms, and restocking drinks in the refrigerated aisle, and after the store closed my co-workers and I would all face the store for the next day and the shift lead or what ever manager was present that day would collect the money from all the registers and go to the back room to count and right before it was time to go, he/she would call us to confirm his counting was correct. "
good,"A typical day starts with you being told where the person left off. They would tell you what they had done and what the manager said needed to be done. You would verify with a manager to make sure it was what they still wanted to be done, and normally it was. Being at Walgreens taught me to work as a team, to work closely with those around you and that being helped was not a bad thing. Management, despite going through different managers, was over all really good. I've grown to love all the managers there and still go there to visit with some of the co-workers, though I do not stray them from their jobs. The hardest part of the job was the over all abundance of customers that would come in right at the end of the day. There was always a long line. However, the most enjoyable part of the job was talking to people, getting to know them, making friends and recognizing the regulars that would come in."
good,Very well organized company.  Working in the pharmacy you get to interact and meet people from all different cultures.  You get to learn many the everyday operations of a pharmacy and get to operate and manage a pharmacy.  Management is very understanding and makes time to work with you if any issues arise.  Walgreens is a huge team-oriented workplace
good,I was part of the management to open this building and recruit work force from zero. We recruited 40% team members with disabilities. I was the go to guy o implement or be part of the task force to implement new processes or system. I work directly with marketing dept in Corp to promote Walgreens product in TV shows like Rachel and Good Morning America.
good,"A nice place to work. As a tech, you answer the phone, file scripts, type scripts, work the registered, inventory and much more. It's a rewarding career choice. Management was amazing, they were on top of everything when I was their. Co workers was lovely. hardest part was getting hours. Most enjoyable part was just being their working."
good,"Part of my high school program, had great experience with other employees. "
good,"Working at Walgreens was a great experience for me, it gave me a fair amount of responsibility to handle without being told what to do all the time.  As a photo technician I was responsible for helping customers with their photo orders along with constructing various gift items.  When there wasn't much going on in photo I would constantly either be helping with merchandise resets around the store or assisting my co-workers with any of their tasks."
good,I have only been with Walgreens for a month but I love it so far. The atmosphere is really positive and they definitely seem to be open for advancement.
good,"Fast paced, and customer driven work environment.  I have learned how to be a leader and a skilled manager. Hardest part of the job is not being able to please everyone.  The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to work with a lot different individuals who broaden my experiences."
good,Very fast paced and wonderful coworkers.  It was a good job for retail and I would go back for a management position if the opportunity was perfect.
good,"I really enjoyed these positions in my two year term with Walgreens. I was able to grow from a head cashier to a team lead and be able to release my abilities to bloom as a hard worker and get productivity from everyone and their very best, as well."
good,"I enjoyed working very much for Walgreens but mainly because of the Pharmacy Manager and pharmacy staff, everyone was very dedicated and friendly. When you enjoyed the people so much, working harder always felt good. Cons: since it is a corporate business, no over time was ever allowed and hours were randomly cut back all the time."
good,Enjoyed working with my co-workers and developing relationships with the customers. The hardest part of the job was not being of age to see or stock alcohol.
good,"Walgreen's is one of those companies that makes sure that their employees are well taken care of by offering several healthcare and savings plans from the first day. I had learned more from this job than I had with any other job in the past, especially since I was able to learn the ins and outs of the store, from the cashiering process to the order and stocking of the store. The hardest part of the job was working on Christmas day, seeing as this was the only store open in the area, but other than that, it was a great job and very enjoyable."
good,i learned how to fill medications and translate orders. i also learnt how to communicate with customers in a pleasant manner with smiles.
good,"I learned more from this job than any other I have ever had. It taught me to be much more proactive and never wait for work to come to me, but for me to seek it out. A very tight crew with an open door policy from the higher ups. To this day it has been the most exciting and fulfilling job I have had."
good,Walgreens is a great place to work. There is opportunity to grow in the company if one desires. There is also a great culture within the company.
good,The managers here are great! The staff is always so kind. You become a family once you work there. Get comissions on simple items and the scheduling was always great.
good,A very pleasant place to work. Can't say anything bad about it. My experience was great and I would stay if they had been able to offer me more opportunities to grow within the company.
good,"Working at over 6 Walgreens stores all were pretty cool to work at. Usually you get a nice store manager. One of them had her moments where she was mean but if you keep a positive attitude most customers make your day...unless you're in the pharmacy department. Never worked back there but I know it gets stressful so be prepared and have a thick skin! It all works out though. If you want to become a pharmacy tech, Walgreens will help you get certified. "
good,"I would go into work and start running for the rest of the day and not stop till I clock out. It was always very busy here, but that is what I enjoyed most about it because time went by very fast. I learn a great deal at this job especially with insurances and more on the medications. My pharmacy manager was awesome and I had a great team to work with. there was never a dull moment there. Dealing with difficult patients who were not understanding when a situation is out of our hands until the Dr. or insurance would approve the med. meeting all the great people."

good,"I loved getting to Walgreens every day and for my surprise my favorite day was Wednesdays why? because it was truck day. We spent the day unloading the truck, stocking shelf's making sure everything was in place. But typically a normal day would be clock in make sure every thing was nice, neat and stocked I loved my customers never had a problem with any of them I was glad I always helped them in there needs. My managers where all amazing and understandable. They recognized your hard work always and even reward you. I loved getting new tasks here and there also going from being a simple cashier to promoted as a beauty advisor witch made me super excited."
good,"hay buenos beneficios , exigencias en el trabajo , pero la paga debiera ser mejor excelentes beneficios 401k, plan medico etc la parte mas dificil era lidiar con el estado de animo de companeros y clientes , la mas agradable tu satisfaccion al hacer tus tareas y que tu store manager te lo reconozca"
good,"Walgreens over the years, has transformed into a advertising moving machine. The company is utilizing a variety resources to communicate and reach ever demographic possible. The transformation can weigh-in as positive and negative for long-term employees and loyal customers, who aren't capable of change. "
good,"I've only been at Walgreen's in Brattleboro, VT for about 2 months, but it is an excellent place to work.  The Manager's are all very helpful and great teachers.  The other employees are very nice and always willing to help or teach a new employee something.   "

good,"A typical day for an intern included taking take backs to the back, restocking, facing, and setting up displays. Coworkers were friendly and willing to help, and customers are often polite and easy to handle as well. One always knows where things are and who to go to.

good,It is very busy life.  Sometime work and life load is hard to balance.  There is always opportunity to advance.  Co workers are your family. There hardest part of the job is managing personalities.
good,"Working at Walgreens was a great experience in a warehouse. I enjoyed working with the other team members. I've learned a lot about how distribution centers work (i.e. receiving, stocking, filling orders, and shipping). Within the six years I have worked there I've learned other functions in different departments and how crucial each one is to the process. The management team was always there to help and make sure everything was done with quality assurance. I enjoyed working in the receiving department; every load was different but similar in a way."
good,"Busy and fasted - paced filling prescriptions , checked out patients answered phones , Assisted the phamacist answered customers questions."
good,"I worked as a Photography Specialist, We kept the store neat and provided excellent customer service!"
good,"The Walgreen's work-at-home program was structured around a Walgreen's-owned secure computer work-station for either 8-hour or 10-hour days with timed and scheduled 30 minute lunch and two 15 minute breaks.  Prescription images were data and clinically reviewed for accuracy and appropriateness with personnel held to rigid standards and accelerated pace.

good,"I enjoy filling prescriptions and working with customers. I like the set up of walgreens and enjoy what is appreciated from their employees, such as great customer service and promoting health."
good,A typical day at work would be a busy day. Always lots of traffic. What I have learned from this company is how to make a big profit off of an inexpensive item. As far is management is concern. I love my position and I believe in team work. My co-workers was nice and fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was closing because everything had to be picture perfect and ready to run in the morning. The most enjoyable part of the job was making friends with the customers/employees.
good,Every staff member is motivated to complete all job duties effectively and efficiently. Management was supportive in all areas requiring assistance from other staff.
good,"A typical day at work is very busy with a lot of running. I like the fast-paced environment and I love continually helping people. I have learned a lot of people skills. I am very good with people naturally, so I was more excited that I was able to learn how to build something out of nothing here. Having to build displays, put isles together after completely taking them apart; was definitely one of my favorite parts. I really enjoy putting things together, whether it be metaphorically having to build relationships with people or companies, or literally having to build something. As a manager the hardest part of the job would be trying to be in two places at once, but with an excellent team it is way easier to do."
good,A typical day of work would consist of me assisting customers with there purchases. Ive learned to provide friendly customer service. The hardest part of the day would be leaving and the most enjoyable part of the day would be seeing and making new friends!
good,"I loved everything about my job with Walgreens. The benefits were great, customers at times were amazing. I learned that my hard work always paid off. The hardest thing about my job was not being able to please everyone. I have enjoyed all of my co-workers and upper management. I miss everything about being in the pharmacy with Walgreens.

good,"On a typical day it is very fast-paced. This type of environment allows you to be quick on your feet enhancing your abilities to think quickly. This workplace also encourages growth and the team concept. There are many occasions which allowed me as a manager to instruct more then one employee to help me get things done. This allows employees to really see how valuable they are to the company. When it came time for breaks, we also made sure to make a schedule and stood by it so that there would be a good balance at work as well as when employees went home to their families."
good,"a typical day consisted of assisting customers with questions about products, and ringing up there purchases."

good,"I learned mostly everything of what I know about running a department of a store from this job! Management was great, very busy store. My co-workers were friendly and very easy to work with. The hardest part of my job I would say was the multi-tasking and making sure I stayed on top of absolutely everything going on during my shift in my department. The most enjoyable part of my job was absolutely everything I did, but especially the women customers that came in and asked my advice on our products, sales, and Favorited merchandise."
good,"Responsibilities: highlight:"

good,"This company made me feel important. They recognized my talents and abilities early and rewarded me with increased responsibility and compensation. Honestly, one of my favorite places to work!"
good,"•	Responsible for the profitability of the Acworth, GA shop."
good,"The pharmacy is a very welcoming environment. I love to work one-on-one with the patients, and giving them the utmost pleasurable experience, given the circumstances that nobody likes to be sick. Helping them feel better gives me validation that working in customer service is the right path for me to go in. The hardest part of the job would have to be letting the patients know that their medications aren't covered by insurances, or that there will be a delay in the filling process, because they did not choose to be sick, therefore it is our job to try and get them in and out of there as soon as possible."
good,It was fun doing pictures and seeing different things. Everyone is like family that you work with. The down fall is the pay was not good considering I was there 6 years. The management could have been better.

I help them with their past port pictures, making albums and just printing regular pictures from and SD card, negatives, and some slide. I also did printer cartridges, posters and banners. I learned to handle my time, to be productive, and how to make a customer happy. The management is great they help anyone who needs help. the co-works are very helpful too. The hardest part was getting used to having a job. I enjoyed learning everything they taught me."
good,"Customer Services."
good,A typical day at work was always exciting and fun.  Helping patients become shoppers prior to or after getting medication. I learned the importance of treating everyone fairly and taking care of all and issues to satisfy the customer. The management team in this company is wonderful. The associates and co-workers were again just a wonderful as management. The hardest part of this job was leaving! The entire experience was enjoyable.
good,"Walgreens is a great company to work for. We are one Big Family helping our customers Get, Stay, and Live Well!"
good,Great compnay to work for.  Very challenging and fullfilling work.
good,Walgreens was not a hard job at all it was pretty easy to help all the customers find what they need and best fit them with the right product.

My co-workers were very easy to get along with. It was never a hard part of my job It was always easy and fun. The most enjoyable part of my job was building my displays for the new products that we were releasing in the store and some Saturdays I would do make overs in my department
good,Employees are very good and the team atmosphere is positive. Management is positive and they are very helpful. The hardest part is dealing with difficult customers but these can be taken as life lessons and problem solving under stressful situation.

good,"I had a lot of support from staff at this work place when I started and enjoyed it very much there, as they practiced holistic health and really emphasized proactive health care."
good,"I am about to graduate college and am seeking an entry level engineering position.  I have worked at Walgreens for just about my entire college career.  It was really ideal for me because they are very flexible and work with my school schedule.  We are given a fair amount of paid time off and usually approve requests for days off.  The managers created a great balance of being easy going with their employees and being productive.  The only thing that may use improvement is the pay.  You are started off at minimum wage and are given very small raises  every 6 months.  I have been there for 3 and a half years and earn only $7.90/hr.  Other than that, I would strongly recommend working for Walgreens for the job security and flexibility."
good,"I enjoyed the work environment. I would enter prescriptions from drop off window, fill prescriptions, answer phones, resolve insurance claims,and control inventory. The management and coworkers worked well together we were a great team. The hardest part of the job was flu season. Lots to do. I enjoyed my co-workers, patients and enjoy helping people."
good,"I work the overnights. I get the store ready for the next day."
good,"Sure customers can be unruly, but its your attitude that finally wins out."
good,"Data entry of pharmacy details such as prescriptions and patient information, contacting patients and prescribers. I learned how to apply confidentiality and agility to improve my work and trust with patients and management. Great management and human resources team.

Most enjoyable part of job was working with patients and helping them get the medications they need in a timely manner."
good,"I loved working at Walgreens!! A typical day at Walgreens consists of restocking the shelves in the cosmetic department, setting up cosmetic displays, helping customers with finding certain products. I learned how to match certain make up to any type of skin tone. I learned how to be more creative when it came to the cosmetic displays. Management to me was okay. There were a couple of people in management that really didn't take my work seriously. The hardest part of the job was knowing that I had trained for a certain position for six months only for it to be given to someone who had been there for only two months and had no experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was the job itself. I enjoyed working at Walgreens immensely!! I would love to work there again!!"
good,"i would get to work and i would start at the cashier until the truck comes. Then another employee would replace me so me and another male co-worker would unload the truck with the new merchandise. Next we would unpack the boxes and place items on the selves. Them go back and clean up the warehouse part of the store, throw away the boxes, and stock extra items in the bac"
good,it helped me gain experience ina small store knowing my customers by first name
good,"I loved that I got sick, vacation, and special days even as a part time employee. I was also eligible for the benefits. I was a pharm tech, and I loved how our pharmacy was set up. The employee who came in last takes over drive through, then someone else comes in when they're scheduled and takes over drive through. It's awesome. :)"
good,"Very business atmosphere. This is good for getting work done, however after awhile turns your employees into drones that are not very personable. Balance is important in the workplace. Management was pretty good, however there were a few managers that I had that would sit in the office and text on their phones, or keep their phones in my department and text, I really did not think that was professional of someone in a management position. It did not set a good example for employees under them for how they should behave at work. Most enjoyable part of this job was seeing all my customers special vacations and events in their lives. Printing pictures of new babies, and grandkids, such a treat to be invited into those experiences and hear how proud people are gushing over the details of their new family member."
good,I loved working at Walgreens. I was an Assistant Manager that left due to me having my baby and wanting to be a stay at home mom. Loved everything about Walgreens.

A typical day at work includes hanging price changes, helping customers, answering the phone, changing trash out, cleaning bathrooms, hanging ad tags if it is tag day, and putting away totes full of items onto shelves if it is truck day. It also includes ringing up items for the customers and bagging their items neatly along with trying to upsell our items of the month. I absolutely love my management and my co-workers. we all fit together like a family. if their is ever a problem we can all come together to come to a solution that works for everyone. The most enjoyable part of the job is when customers are really happy that you were able to help them find what they were looking for, or getting compliments for doing such a great job."
good,"Overnight pharmacist at busiest store in the district; plenty of good help until 2AM, then alone till 8AM."
good,"Day consisted of multiple tasks from being a cashier, to developing photos, to filling prescriptions in pharmacy and assisting the manager."
good,this company plans the most for customer service. has more employees per shift and dedicated cosmetics and photo counters.
good,"My days though monotonous, were very satisfying. I learned about all types of customers, and their different needs with Walgreens. My managers were extremely professional, and some of the best people I have ever met. My co-workers are still some of my favorite friends I am still in contact with. The hardest part of my job, was leaving it. I had cards from everyone and choked back tears all day my last day. In turn that is what made it the best part of my job too. I couldn't go into another Walgreens and feel the same. I still frequent my old store, and miss them dearly."
good,"-Got along with co-workers"
good,"I enjoyed working at the Central Pharmacy Operations center in Tempe, Arizona. A typical day at work was data entry via pharmacy software for various states. Management cared and treated their employees with respect. They encouraged promotion and provided constant training.

good,This was the best place I've worked at. I was really sorry to have to leave it. I probably would have stayed here until I was ready to retire if things had worked out differently.
good,"Though the training was a litttle vauge, you get use to the enviorment and the rountine fairly quick depending on how much you are put on the clock. The most important part to be completly honest, is the social part of it. No mater who you are, you become a more sociable, better people person, because your constantly in contact with customers. It doesnt matter if your working the floor (stocking shelves, putting up tags, etc.) working CKO( working the register) or even doing lab or COS. Odds are, a customer is going to have a question about something or needs help finding something. Management is extremley freindly and is always willing to help out. Never feel pressured to talk to them about something. My co-workers consists of some other teenagers my age, (highschool- college) some middle aged adults and some older adults. very close with all of them and have a good time at work everytime i go there. The hardest art of the job is being under 21 and having to call someone to ring up alcohol everytime someone wants to buy it, which is often. The best part of the job is hard to say. its just an overall fun job and theres something new to do everyday."
good,"Good compensation and benefits, flexible schedule. Good staff and management, there are oportunities to move up."

The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the community and getting to know people."
good,"I loved working here. The managers and team lead where great, easy to talk to and cared about all employees. I learned a lot about the photo lab and how it works, and how to best help customers. There really wasn't anything i disliked about the job, they worked with me on the schedule, were fair about giving everyone every other weekend off, and made sure everyone got the hours they needed. And the people i worked with were great, we always had fun and liked going to work everyday. Things did get stressful but we all worked together very well."
good,"A typical day on the job included managing employees and overseeing store duties. I learned a lot at this company and continued to grow as an employee. The hardest part was when I had to take a personal leave for a family crisis and was unable to return for a year. When I was able to return, I found out that there was a hiring freeze going on and I was not ale to get hired back at my store. I enjoyed my moments as an Assistant Manger it was a new career field that I truly loved!"

There is always something to do, so one never becomes bored or has ""free-time."" Walgreens gives its beauty advisors projects to do that helps make the time go by fast. I've learned how to give customers the proper beauty products to fit their lives. The management is amazing; hard workers, always available to help, and always pushes its employers to do their best. My co-workers are hardworking individuals that are willing to help you if need-be. The hardest part of the job is trying to direct customers to the exact products they could use because there are so many products out on the market. Although, the most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and seeing the satisfaction in their faces that I helped to create!"
good,I enjoyed this job as it kept me very busy with increased decision making responsibilities. The training was good and the software was up to date.

good,"Working at Walgreens helped me expand my organizational skills. Being in the pharmacy used alot of energy and could sometimes become very stressful. My co-workers and management team were amazing. The hardest part of the job was the stress of filling and filing so many prescriptions in a timely manor, while also, keeping the patients satisfied."
good,This position offered me growth and knowledge which I have applied to almost every position since. I also met great co-workers and enjoyed the job I did on a daily basis. I also was afforded the ability to work more shifts at other stores if I wanted.
good,"Absolutely loved working here. The people were awesome! It's a very busy place, keeps you moving. Most of the staff are awesome people and they care! Like with any retail company they are always open and you have to be available to work many different shifts. This company actually cares about their employees and customers and are willing to work with you. There is room to move forward in the company and the store manager in this location is one of the first to step up and help you move forward and succeed."
good,Working for Walgreens was very rewarding both with the service level I could provide our customers as well as the opportunity to learn and advance within the organization. There was always an opportunity for me to learn new things as well as help others learn.
good,a typical day at work usually consists of customer service and working with coworkers. my customer service skills have improved drastically since i started working with Walgreen's. the management is mostly consistent but at times quite frustrating. working with coworkers has never been an issue. the hardest part about this job would have to be closing the store due to all that needs to be done before the end of the night. most enjoyable thing about this job is the interaction that I'm exposed to while servicing customers.
good,while in externship they taught me every detail that i have to learned inside a pharmacy. t
good,"Opened the store, counted drawers, void, returns, exchanges, ordered inventory, daily inventory counts, checked in vendors, ordered from vendors, assisted customers, unloaded truck, merchandised products, assisted in Pharmacy. I learned so much about ordering and keeping my inventory at the best numbers. My manager was a great manager, she gave me the opportunity to grow and learn. The hardest part of this job was working nights and weekends away from my family. I most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers and their reaction to how helpful we were in assisting them in their needs."
good,An organization that provides growth opportunities for its employees. Family friendly oriented that offers flexible work schedules.
good,I learned how to do summaries at Walgreen's being on the Safety Action Team. The co- workers always had a problem with work but it was always because they had a claim against them or would not see their ways from a higher position. The hardest parts of the job was listening to complaining co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the work and accomplishments and awards.
good,Walgreens was a wonderful place to work where i had the chance to meet new people and very intersting stories. I learned how to be more personable and open up. The people that i worked with made my days enjoyable and they were very friendly and outgoing.

The management and co-workers were wonderful making the work environmental comfortable and enjoyable.Nothing was really too difficult about the job but the most enjoyable part of the job was building relationships with the customers."
good,"This was a fun place do work, i loved all my managers and staff."
good,"Typical day at work would be greeting every customer that walks through the front door and offering assistance. To also those already in the store. Also checking out those who mostly have cosmetic items over in our cosmetic section. Would mostly do a lot of restocking since it was the most shopped section in the store. You would have your know your products as well. Such as make up, anything for your face and/or body. You would have to answer phone calls. Some call to know if we have a product in store or to ask information about a product and what would also be similar to that product. Helping other sections are a must. If there are too much people in other registers you can offer your help or in helping the other co-workers. At the end of the shift you have to make sure your area is clean and all your tasks are done and if they are not leave a letter, tell the manager or wait for the next person in the shift and pass on the information. I've learn to keep calm and patient dealing with very angry customers and those ""coupon people"". Overall not a very bad place to work."
good,"Atmosphere productive and pleasant to work in. Great co-workers, managers."
good,I learned how to work in a real pharmacy and use the skill i learned at school at a real work place and learned all types of different drugs. Also to help customers with what they needed that was the most enjoyable part of the job to help customers.
good,"I started with walgreens as a cashier, but I didnt wanna stop there, I was also the only guy that worked at the cosmetics register just because I wanted to learn more, then I moved to the photo department, then pharmacy then inventory and eventually to management, all that within a year. I was an assistant manager for the rest of my time with walgreens, thats where I expanded my customer service skills and manager responsibility... It is a great company to work for, they got great benefits from the start, great promotion options and a great work environment.... Of course after 5 years I got fired for no paying attention to what I was doing, so they got rid of me because they wanted to pay someone else $7.00 less than I was making to do the same job. But they got stuck teaching someone for 2 years the same things that I already knew... They gave me an option to come back 5 years after termination. If Im not doing anything important by then, I'll take the offer..."
good,easy management to work for

You learn great customer service here. a typical day a work is the pharmacy being very busy and having to complete important tasks by the end of your shift. The hardest part is making sure you satisfy the customers and get the job done correctly, but it does teaches you patience.

good,"Working at Walgreens is mostly wonderful! I've worked at 4 different locations (I move a lot), and for the most part it is a relatively simple job with great people. Management is usually very friendly and understanding. Hiring is usually kinda vigorous (interview, sometimes 2, background check, drug test, online assessment). So, they filter out the not so great candidates pretty well with some exceptions. I've worked as a cashier, a photo specialist, and currently as a shift lead. Small raises every year, but pay is decent, especially if you're a shift lead or above, but it's better than most places as a cashier still. A lot of opportunity to move up, build connections with regulars (easiest to do in the photo department, and learn a lot of different skills. Great job for high school and college students, and management is a great career to have with decent pay. Full time workers get really great benefits too! Most locations will hire full time if you're looking for that. I've met very few people that work there part time. Definitely work considering!"

good,They were really amazing  all the managers were willing to work with you on your problems. Everyone that was there was nice. They showed you and introduced you I to the team that they have built
good,The work environment was well organized. There was a lack of communication amongst associates and management. It would have been better had management been more involved with associate daily goals and performance.
good,First job right out of Pharm Tech school  Learned a lot about the pharmacy industry.  Was able to use the knowledge gained from school and not only apply it but enhance that skill set.  Also was able to learn and grow professionally with leadership and management.  Great experience.

You had set tasks to perform according to your position however, customer needs always preceded that.  That were also unscheduled assignments that popped up from time to time.  No balking, get in there and take care of that!  It's all for the best.  The management was always keen to ask if everything is going according to schedule and guildelines and there were plenty of meetings to address issues and goals.  I had a great relationship with my customers.  Even when I run into the after having left the Company, they still refer to me as Mr. Walgreens!"
good,The over all experience was great and a great company to work for. Everyone worked together as a team and I was able to build long lasting relationships.
good,"I have worked at Walgreens, Mt Vernon, IL last year and just have experienced for two months. I came in early to work, I was so exaggerated and excited to enjoy to go work my first-time job, I came into the game room and play pool by myself to help get my head on focus. By the time I set alarm on, it was alert me in 15 minutes before to start going in the meeting in the cafeteria room and set my time in. I had fun to start a little exercise and be flexible before going into the mod and different floor, it helps me to be ready and go to work in the mod on a different floor. it was fast pace and sometimes its stressful but I will always ask the co-workers some question to know which way I start fist and which aisle I can go to. My special trainee person helped me to teach myself the proper way that he showed me to do the scan my id and the inventory with my name on it, Its fun to learn but stressful, a fast-pace position I ever have done in my life the first time.  I like my first job and I would love to have the honor to work at Walgreens again."

The amount of information and training given was very clear and extremely useful  I would highly recommend work for Walgreens.
good,"This was my first job, so it was pretty stressful but I think someone with experience would find this to be a very easy place to work in. They train you to work in many areas of the store such as at the counter, in photos, and stocking. They are very flexible with their hours and great at training. The hardest part of the job for me was dealing with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was stocking."
good,"I used to think I wanted to pursue pharmacy as a career, but that has sense changed. This company allowed me to discover what it too to become a pharmacists and how I could make those changes to succeed. I've been with Walgreens for around 2 years now and they have treated me better than any other employer. From vacation time, to flexible schedules and perfect staff. Times can get stressful, but the company always has your back. I would definitely enjoy a career at Walgreens if the schooling didn't require so much."

The hardest part of job was sometime keeping up with the continuing changes with insurance companies policies. I enjoyed the challenges and  the my fellow employees.

good,I verified and processed prescriptions. I counseled new patients and their medication. I talked with Dr's over the phone and processed third party billing of medications.  I love to interact with all of the customers and tell them about their medications.  The drive-thru was very busy at rush hour every day.
good,I had a great experience working with the company. They treat the workers as if they are family. It allowed me to grow as well as learn more about customer service.

good,I loved loved loved working for this company and honestly I would love to work for it again. The management was excellent and flexible with hours. They cared about their employees.
good,I love Walgreens but they should pay their cashiers and low level managers more money. it was a great place to start off in the workforce. I think that they also need to look at competing with CVS
good,The staff makes the job worth while. The company is not the best ran but between the staff and customers it makes the job worth sticking around. Upper management is kinda clueless about the struggle of the hourly employees.

I can say that i actually learned patience with dealing with different people on the daily basis.

I worked a flexible schedule, i most liked working nights. Walgreens is good to their associates, offered very good medical insurance. Managers were always there to help you with any questions"
good,"Walgreens is a great place to work at, of course it depends on who you are working with just because every individual is different. Depending on the individual and yourself, you will probably have a few feuds here and there; but that is normal in a type of relationship. That is why they have different people for different roles in the work environment. I learned that if you don't really take a part of today's culture you will be labeled grandma at 21 even though your whole mindset is about video games , my future, school, and cleanliness. Last time I checked grandma doesn't play video games! I mean can you imagine your grandmother playing VR? If she exist I need to meet her so we can PVP on a few games. As long as people see a future somewhere there is always going to be a Walgreens at the corner of your neighborhood, for grandparents and the youth to gather and get chips, Walgreens might have to install a VR tournament league in their books. Even management was great they understood that school is an important part of having an established mental system to be able to function in this society properly, otherwise you won't have proper communication with anybody and my dream of living in a world where everyone invest their time in a point system of VR is going to go down the drain. Walgreens was made for the future."

good,I ran the front desk and put up stock that was the closest to the front desk. I waited on customers and run the cash register and enjoyed the customers and the associates that around me. The hardest part of the job is when a customer is upset about the ad and I know I cannot help them. I get manager to help the customer and calm them down. Most days and nights our lunch shift was short to take care of the customers. Over all I enjoyed working with the customers and associates.

In addition, If my boss didn't leave any task to complete, I  would start planning for the day. I would walk around the store as well as the stockroom to see what need to get done. I would write task down as I walk around and assigned each task to a member of my team to complete. Further more, I get called a lot when it comes to assisting and solving problems. On average, I probably get called 50 times during an 8 hr shift. Team members come to me if they have any questions.

As you may well know, a retail pharmacy is usually very fast paced and patients need and deserve exceptional care and your dedication to ensure they receive their medications in a timely manner.

Keeping a balance in the pharmacy between working hard and fast and making the patient welcome, well taken care of and part of a family isn't often easy, but so very worth it."

good,"I enjoy Walgreen's and I am always busy with something to do which I like very much.  I learn new things weekly and keep striving to be best I can be. More I know the more knowledgeable I am with customers. Management could use a little work, we think we are on same page but a lot of time communication gets lost. I think everywhere improvements need to be made it happens and we grow from those experiences. There is a good work flow but there are times when there is just a lot of personalities to make every single person happy. I think management could be better about being more personable and care about employees rather then the store as a whole. It needs to be fair with everyone and everyone being treated the same. The most enjoyable part of my job is knowing if there is an emergency or something comes up they are understandable if I need to leave to take care of and not get fired for taking care of emergency. If I have appointment and I already tried switching shifts with some one and can't they will be okay with me leaving hour early. It's nice having that because some places aren't as understanding. I also enjoy knowing I have job that has benefits like health, dental and eye insurance. Over all I love what I do. I have grown up a lot in past 7 years at Walgreen's and it's been very enjoyable."

A typical day at work for an Shift lead would be to make sure the store is ready for customers, making sure we are fully stock with merchandise and the store is absolutely clean and organized. Making sure we have a morning meeting to go over the new information and what the excepted of the employee.

good,"it was a great job to work  a was so sad , just like everyone else that it closed down. caught everyone by surprise. basically all we did was load items from a conveyor belt onto the trucks so it can be shipped to stores ,and unload trucks in receiving"
good,"Shifts usually of 8am-5pm, shape and organize the merchandise then open shop. through out the day employees would reshape and stock shelves, check out costumers, and keep the store tidy. Sometime we would have to deal with shoplifters or other difficult costumers but the job paid very well."
good,"During my time working at Walgreens, I have made many new friends and met nice people. My co-workers and manager always made it a happy environment even when they were not in the best of moods."
good,Walgreen's has really worked with me to pursue my goals. Starting out as a pharmacy technician and working with me to pursue a career after I graduate with a marketing degree.
good,Work didn't feel like work. I made family friends with our regular customers as well as the employees. The job was often challenging which I love daily
good,My all time favorite job. I loved working here. The managers are great other employees are great. This is really like a family. And you have a chance to grow within the company.
good,A typical day at work would be to stock the store. I learned great team skills that keep the job an easy task. The management were great. The culture of the work place was positive. The hardest part of the job was putting the makeup where it needed to be. The most enjoyable part was on my break getting to interact with staff.
good,I helped customers find whath they needed and checking them out at the register. It was all new to me so I learned how to work a register and handle cash. As well as working ith customers and helping them get what they need for the best experience. It as a great enviroment that gave room to grow and learn more to move up. Hardest part was when I couldn't help customers find what they needed. The most enjoyable was working with customers everyday and getting to know them and see them everytime they came back.

It might not be the happiest place to be in like most of the tech companies but if you want to learn new things, we cannot suggest a better place to you than Amazon. Here you will be given different assignments where you have to deal with difficult clients, an extra load of tasks and what not. But the benefit out of doing such jobs is that you tend to become a stronger person in the work field and become more prone to success in the future."
good,"Love working with amazing staff, very helpful and very professional. My pharmacy manager is one of the best, also my store manger. I have been with this company for more then 12 years and just the fact that I'm no longer working with one of the best staff hurts. Wish I didn't have to move.. We were very productive...."
good,"Most days it is a busy day, but with help from other co-workers it helps make the day less stressful on you. All the other employees are there at your side lending a helping hand when needed. Sometimes the hardes part is customer service, making sure everyone is taken care and that they are taken care of correctly. It makes it difficult to solve a situation if you have more customer showing up that need help and are primary in the customer service line. Most enjoyably is the co-workers, without them the atmosphere of the whole work day would be too stressful to handle. Also seeing how people are in pain or how much the prescriptions and what just a slight discount card that saves $10 does to put a smile on the customers face."
good,Working here was okay if there was anything that I could say is that it got a little boring after the first year of working there. And I had to move to a different location so it made it very easy for me to leave.

good,A typical work day calls for a lot of tasks to be completed. I like the freedom that we are given to get the work done. We work as a team to complete the work. My personal goal there is always to exceed the expectations of a typical work day. The fast-paced environment and little bit of competition allows for some push to work harder each day. The most enjoyable part of the job is the positive encouragement and feedback that is given. The hardest part of the job is that each pharmacy location works differently from the other so adapting to each store is sometimes harder that it seems.
good,"My store averages about 600 prescriptions daily, and we're always working with barely enough help. The managers aren't always able to come back and help. I always ackowledge every customer that's waiting to be helped. it gets to be overwhelming at times. I love what i do."

But I have found that from my experience at Walgreens, it was well worth any struggles that I had to overcome.  Some work days were stressful, but ultimately not terribly difficult.  I learned 4 different software systems, how to work a photo developing machine, became trained in the pharmacy, effectively worked through product as it came into the store.  The store manager was very understanding, exceptionally hard working, and fair.  The culture struggled at times because of some coworkers that could not let go of petty behavior, but otherwise it was strong.  Coworkers for the most part got along, and almost all of them were able to work well together. The hardest part was the initial struggle of learning a new system, but that became easier the more you performed the tasks.  The most enjoyable part being the ability to learn and grow as a person/employee - if you wanted to."
good,"My typical day at work was check out interesting customers the first 2 hours of my shift, then work the floor. (stocking, setting, customer service, etc.) Every night was a different task, but with same beginning to shift and ending to shift. It was a great place to grow. I really didn't want to leave, but outside circumstances left me no choice. I learned how to delegate my time and communicate more effectively. I learned alot of things from management as the dynamics of convenient pharmacy grocery store. I also learned what over the counter medications are best suggested for everyday allergies or your average cold. I'd say the hardest part about the job, was just the shift itself. I enjoyed working overnights, but it started taking a toll on me when I had a few errands to run. The most enjoyable part of the job, was the family environment Walgreens provided. The collaboration within the team was great."
good,"It is a good place to work. They provide good benefits. Your are given your task for the work day.  If anything else needs immediate attention, they will kindly ask for your assistance."

good,I was a Shift Lead Manager for Walgreens for a little over 5yrs. I loved it because everyday posed new challenges. I also learned how to work in the pharmacy filling scripts. The only reason I left was because there was an unfortunate event that happened on my closing shift and there was nowhere to transfer me within our district or nearby districts for my peace of mind. Walgreens was a part and still is a large part of my and my families lives. My mother was a store manager who worked from a cashier on up the ladder.

good,"Greeting the customers of Walgreens was always so exciting. Hearing different life stories, and giving your feedback is often helpful for some who are just in need of a listening ear. Management was wonderful, I learned so much about myself in the sense that I started as a very shy person but left with enough confidence to talk to almost anyone."

Not only did i work, but it was not work to me, and i qoute the statement ""If you love what you do then you don't have to work a day in your life"".

good,"Best manager I've had. Wonderful crew to work with. Just sorry things couldn't work out on my part. If only they could hire me back, I'd go back in a heartbeat. Manager treats staff like human beings, which has been rare in my experience. Crew has been allowed to have fun at work -- also a rarity for me."

good,A typical day at work is getting registers from the office and going into the pharmacy. Then logging into the computer and immediately start typing prescriptions. Also working the drive thru and front counter. I've learned how to input insurance and to figure TPR's. The hardest part of the job is the figuring out how to solve the TPR's and do it correctly. What I like about the job are the friendly customers and my awesome coworkers.

good,"The job was at your pace but also self competitive with keeping your productivity rate up high. I learned how to operate a jack pallet. The management was outstanding.

good,"I work at the Walgreens Call Center in Muscle Shoals Alabama.  I can honestly say this is the best job I've ever had.  If you report to work when you are scheduled, do what you are trained to do and do it well, the management staff will work with you on any issue you may have come up.  It has the most relaxed attendance policy I personally ever worked under.  It allows 12 points before review for termination, and has numerous opportunities to get points off by going 90 days without any unexcused time, multiple occurrence point reductions, and numerous opportunities to take same day paid time off or unpaid voluntary unpaid time off..which is good if you haven't been with the company long enough to earn paid time off.  You can build a career here, all of the supervisors and managers came from the bottom and worked their way to their current position.  There are numerous lateral positions available within the call center to be promoted into other departments (Quality, Human Resources, IT, etc), all of which are good paying jobs.  The entire management team are constantly doing engagement activities for the team members to keep us happy."
good,"Mostly I like working for Walgreen's,  Most of the employees are good.  The job can be fun.  I got the schedule I want.  The payed days off are nice if you are in school too."
good,Excellent atmosphere where employees work as a team. The manager is always available for questions and concerns. The pay is great as well. The stre is always near and clean.
good,I didn't have a flexible schedule so their schedule changes made it hard to accommodate for the position I was in in the Help Desk. Overall it was a great place to work.
good,"Professional atmosphere but very down to earth. Work life balance is a focus here, very forward thinking in that regard. Happy and Healthy is how we roll!"
good,The moment i got into the pharmacy i started working immediately. I worked in the back mostly counting pills and filling prescription bottles pretty much the whole 8 hours i was there for. The other techs were very helpful when i asked for assistance because they understood what its like to be new. Working in the front of the pharmacy was a whole different experience. The front was usually very slow and it was just for the most part people picking up their prescriptions.
good,"Globalization is changing the corporate culture.  Fair scheduling, competitive  benefits, professional atmosphere, patient focus, great discounts of everyday items."
good,"this job was great, my head manager was stuck on himself, but the store managers were easy to work with. the insurance was out of this world!"
good,Great company to start with. This company helps train you to be a certified tech.  A very fast paced pharmacy.  Always learning something about medication or insurance requirements.
good,I loved working here but I recently had a child when I first started. Working holidays were a must even Christmas and Thanksgiving. Being a new mom I had a problem with this at first as I didn't want to miss out on any of my child's first times. Now it's different and she's older so working those days and hours would be easier for me.

It made it very easy for me to do well in school.  I learned all the basics of retailing at Walgreens.  I had both good and bad managers and it was all a good experience.  This was my first long term job and the culture was fine for me, it was fast moving, never ending useful work and definitely opportunities to move up or forward.
