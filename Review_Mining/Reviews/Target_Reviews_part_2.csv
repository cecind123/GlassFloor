rating,review
good,"It's a fine job with bad management and communication skills. They give you false promises and expect you to work yourself to the bone because they're not paying minimum wage. Good money though, if they like you."
good,If the management was better it’d be a great place to work otherwise it’s horrible if you hate the area you’re in and try to ask to move areas they refuse to move you areas or say they will then never do
good,"the store i worked as was terrible. very, VERY unprofessional. Tried moving up within twice with two different stores and got overlooked both times. youre promoted if they like you and are friends with you, not if you do your job well."
good,"I loved working there when I started, was even proud to say I worked there. However as of late they have treated their members more like numbers instead of the people we ""used"" to be. Now"
good,Most of the people I work with are great! The management staff in the 2 years I have worked here have changed frequently and things are constantly changing back and fourth. If you dont like change dont work for target.
good,"I worked seasonal for black friday of 2017 and a bit of  2018 the job was not horrible just not something I would return too, just for some reasons that are more personal such as holding checks"
good,"Target is a unique place to work with a open environment and fast pace office. the information provided when starting the job was not accurate but once you get over that the company does have some good benefits, just ensure you are being told correct and accurate information before starting."
good,I did enjoy working at target. It does seem that they constantly add more to do and no more time to do it. Job security is a huge issue. I feel like Target does not give you the tools to be successful and many employees seek other employment because of how unstable the environment is.
good,Great job just seasonal  managers werent the best but wasntto hard to get along with them the job was easy but fast paced but still enjoyable at the same time
good,Management is lacking and so are hours but it pays well at $13/hour currently. Coworkers are nice enough but the workload can be a bit ridiculous at times.
good,At first I was very excited about becoming a team member at Target  but 2 months after I noticed that I would try my best and it was never enough for my team leader.The more we do the more stress that is put on us.
good,"Cool place to work"
good,"I worked there over the holidays to make some extra cash. It was pretty easy to pick up extra shifts, but the hours were pretty bad. I was working from 10 PM until about 6 AM and even longer because of the holiday rush. I could not see myself working there for multiple years."
good,"My job started wonderfully. I loved my duties, I loved my coworkers. Then Corporate changed us. They introduced too many new things for us to do and didn’t give any more hours to do it. I wanted to advance to a management or supervisory position, but they hired a girl from American Eagle. They are very understanding, however I don’t see myself growing."
good,It was fine to work there. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the pay...until my hours went from 32-40 to 4-8 within 2 weeks.  Everybody ends up quitting
good,"Target gave me a chance & hired me when I was out of work for a while due to medical issues I had to take care of. I appreciate them for this. I’ve been there now about 2 years & there really is no way to move to full-time, or have steady hours. You cannot live on the pay from Target. I had to make a decision & that was to go back to school and I am now a full-time student & work at Target only weekend"
good,"If you want retail, Target offers state of the art in retail. You'll learn all aspects of the way people shop (online and in store), and how Target successfully combines all methods into a convenience for the shopper."
good,"When I first started at Target it was going well, nothing too serious and after a month Management began to give you more task, with little time and any mistake was taken very seriously. The managers rarely worked and relied on the employees alot"
good,Target boasts they're raising their minimum wage to the present living wages (just above poverty) But you'll never see enough hours to live it. You would still need another income to live. Management works you hard and there's never enough people scheduled to get the work done.
good,"I had a seasonal position, after which I was one of only 3 out of 15 who were laid off, due to being a student. Not a great place to work, but it pays $13 an hour as of Aug 2019."
good,long day very hard to get everything done too much to do and not enough time or people. moral is low because of unrealistic expectations and everyone is very stressed out.
good,"Target has been a great starting job. I have met so many great people there. However the management is touch and go. Either you love them or hate them. Also, you are not guaranteed hours. I don’t recommend this job for people looking for a set amount of hours each week or if you have any set of physical limitations. While they will work with you if you have any limitations, it is harder on your body than you would initially think. Overall not a bad job, just not a forever job unless you are looking at management positions."
good,"I had good and bad experiences while working at Target. I started as a food court worker and truth be told, they payed little to no attention to me over there. I was constantly left in a bad position due to other coworkers not doing their part and i was constantly left to make-up for their shortcomings, which wasn't a big deal until it became a regular occurrence. Once the food court closed and I became a regular cashier things became easier and I received a little more attention. There were a few times i almost missed breaks due to us being understaffed on occasion and that's nobodies fault. Overall the experience was good and i received beneficial customer service experience."
good,This was my first legitimate job where I had to punch in and punch out. I learned a lot about using the cash register and dealing with troublesome customers. I also learned a lot about their products and the subculture of the retail community.
good,"With the retail environment constantly evolving, no two days at work were ever the same. Target provided me the opportunity to learn more about building trust with my team members and being able to successfully lead them in the right direction. Being directly involved with hiring and training, it was very enjoyable to see the development of team members success and being able to give constructive and positive feedback towards their work experience. It's a very fast paced and productive environment, centered around teamwork and most importantly guest satisfaction. Overall Target provides a very friendly and team oriented work environment. Although at the management level being highly involved in all store operations, it becomes increasingly difficult to find a comfortable work/life balance."
good,"No comment. The normal part of a day would be a normal part of a cashier job position. You need to always be friendly to the customer but always allow them to be right at the same time, even though they annoy you.  ( If they do, you could always get a manager to speak with them.)"
good,"Management is forced to rush most employees constantly, with a never-ending workload and having to replace employees rather than train them to be capable of doing the job they applied for. Not much communication amongst management, either."
good,"My time here at Target is biased due to the store I work at, but it's an overall good company to work for and the pay is decent compared to most. My position is new for Target so there's alot I dealt with that most won't go through. If you're looking to be in this position, be aware it won't be like what you're use to. It's alot of training, everyone, even your own bosses, on what it is that you do."
good,"As an executive, you are required to work some long grueling hours to complete all the work.  Payroll was extremely tight, and you could not deviate from month-to-month.  It was nice that payroll was on a monthly cycle; therefore, if you had slower weeks, you could plan accordingly.  Management was fantastic for my first 3 years, but shifted terribly in my last year.  First the regional manager left, and he was an amazing leader, and then my district manager left, whom was also a great leader.  The new district manager is terrible, and is still there.  He tries to lead through fear."
good,The typical day of work at Target is not extremely stressful and/or difficult to maintain. Hours seem to be hard to come by because management tends to over hire or under work employees. Management tends to set expectations higher for team members than for themselves and/or other members of management. A good work ethic and a desire to work are essential.
good,"I’d ask anyone who wants to apply here to rethink their decision. Save for two team leads, the management is not there to work or even lift a finger. It’s not rare to find two or three TLs standing around whispering and gossiping about team members, or just goofing off. The only time they’re not standing around gossiping is when they’re sitting at Starbucks or in the offices gossiping!"
good,"After clocking in, I would usually report to my department with my known routine tasks to do, but sometimes I would get stopped by a Team Lead and would be given different duties for the day. Sometimes they were one or two things added to my list of stuff to get done, other times I would be screwed over and would have to push back my workload to prioritize my new tasks at hand. The reason I explain this is because I had specific stuff to get done by the end of every week and when I fell behind, they would scold me on my time management and efficiency, because they would just give and give and overload me with work that was way too much for one person alone to handle. However they always bragged about how good they would be if the were in my position and how quick they could get all that stuff done but not even consider providing their own team with assistance. Now there were a lot of opportunities that I was given to cross-train and learn a lot of things working at Target. I could do almost anyone's job there with the knowledge I gained working so many different positions. It also proved to be a bit of a burden. I would be relied on too much to help others that I would end up doing that said individual's job rather being able to train them properly. Let me include as well how horrible the human resources department was. It may have just been the store I worked at but who knows if this is what it's like at other stores. They don't care. They can't be trusted. Anytime you had a reason to go to HR and talk to them about something/someone they would mention your name to others and"
good,"You put in your time and to be honest sometimes you can't do everything you managers want you to do and it's not your fault. It's just due to bad planning, no hours, and a lack of team members. It's how Target is chosen to run itself. All you can do is just do your best and hope it's ok."
good,"Target is a great place to work at. They work with the availability you give them especially if you are a student. However, whenever top management decides to cut hours, the employees more than those in supervisory roles are affected a lot. From what I see, when you are new, you get a lot of hours, but as you stay there longer, you are more likely one of the firsts whose hours get cut and then they keep hiring more new people. This is not helpful especially if the employee in question has family to feed and take care of."
good,"Target places a large emphasis on the team and tries to build an everyone should work harder if things aren't going well. I lucked out and got a store with an amazing leadership ladder who were understanding and always kept a positive attitude. The only downside here was the hours/pay, Hours could go for 30+ to 16 from week to week which kills job security. When reviews came around it didn't matter how well you did as raises were between 10-20 cents."
good,"I worked as a stock person. I unloaded trucks, stocked shelves in the backroom, stocked shelves on the sales floor. I helped customers bring large items to their vehicles. It was a decent job."
good,Good job for short-term work. Attendance and big performance is closely reviewed in the first 90 days. Flexible schedules for students only. Just be able to be experts in several areas in order to get 40 hours.
good,"This was my first job, and as a person with mental health (depression, anxiety, and DPD/DR) it was extremely taxing, stressful, and overall unenjoyable. My ""training"" was a total of one day (first day) and consisted of being paired with another newbie and being told: ""Here's the cash register, don't do this, and you'll be fine"", worked for an hour with them, then on your own for the other 6 hours."
good,The pay is decent but the lack of hours really hurt your paycheck. You're only part-time and lucky if you get 20hrs a week. It's a lot of work as well.
good,"Typical day is coming in checking what needs to be re-stocked unless its a truck day so it changes slightly."
good,Person in each department is assigned tasks for the day that they must get done. Each department is different. Workers help each other out when time permits to do so.
good,"Fun at times but not such a great worker turn over.I think that in the beginning it was my first job and learned just life skills and how to help people and provide great customer service. On the other hand, some requirements were above and beyond the pay grade."
good,"If closing working go backs and zoning to get the store ready for the next day. During the day it’s pushing freight if there is any, go backs, pricing, and additional projects like sales planners or reworking the floor. Culture wise obviously people had favorites and they were able to get away with more. Also when you stick a lot of women together they tend to get into arguments"
good,"well I worked here for 7 years"
good,"A typical day at work employs one opener, one closer, and at most three baristas on the floor during peak. What I've learned about this position is time management. Being the opener often, and occasional closer, you have to figure out what works best to ensure tasks are completed by a certain time. Management depended on the LOD, or leader on duty. This workplace is similar to a corporate Starbucks store, however it lacks of the perks of a stand alone store and partner benefits. Being a licensed store means you're more of a Target team member than a Starbucks barista, and you may occasionally be reassigned to a cashier position when/if needed. The hardest part of the job is the one opener and one closer deployment, if you had at least two people working to open/close, the job might seem more sensible. The most enjoyable part of the job is developing meaningful relationships with regular customers."
good,Overall I loved target and I would recommend it to any one to work. It’s a great working environment the staff was great and whenever you had questions or needed help everyone was willing to help.
good,Target was alright to work for just diddnt get enough pay or enough hours to live on. If they raised the pay and kept hours in the uppers 30s to 40s sure I'd of stayed or I'd come back
good,See review. The expectations since the new model rollout are not possibly to make. No successful way of completing tall since the addition of the optional modernization.
good,The job was just a pass through for me. I needed something quick to help me pay for my schooling and this was it. They kept messing up my schedule though I never changed my availability st all. Poor communication. That’s it.
good,Shifts vary week from week and most of the time you won't get more than 25 hours per week. Management is fine but can be somewhat demanding. expect there to be a quite a bit of people calling off.
good,A great place to work as a first job with several positions that are always hiring.  its all about the efficiency of getting the customer what they need as fast as possible as well as making sure the guest is checked out in a timely manor.
good,"There management is well along with their co-workers, but their hours are really hard to change the way you like it. They have the power to change how much hours you get through the week"
good,I like the culture between team members and the friendships and most the bosses r very nice some not so nice really I enjoyed it alot but lately felt was time for a change
good,i have seen it now and it seems to be better but back in 2017 it was alot more crazy and unprofessional. i saw alot of things not work and alot of broken things
good,"Target allows for experience in multiple areas. That's a good way to figure out which sector of the retail industry in for you or if the industry is for you at all. Pay recently increased to $13/hr, which is a small perch, but may or may not be enough for you personally."
good,I worked for target about 2 years was a good experience. Can't really say anything bad about them loved working there when i did. Learned to do different task which was good.
good,"I was a stocker, we only work 3 SPLIT days mon, wed, fri for 6 hours, I don't think any stocking jobs should be under 12.00 +, co workers were great.  Management played favoritism."
good,"Awful management. My schedule was a mess..... I was supposed to be part time working 20 hours per week instead i got scheduled 40 hours with 8 hour shifts everyday, that would of been fine if i wasnt a student."
good,"it was not bad work experience i have."
good,"The place itself is a good place to work at. A easy job that doesn't require a lot and is pretty stress free. The coworkers are great, at least at my store. The conditions are acceptable, aside from the lack of A/C in the backroom. The real problem come in the management. They seems to make the worst decisions possible and constantly watch you like a hawk."
good,They pay well but in order for them to pay well everyone basically becomes part timers you average 20 hours a week you get no benefits because you have to average 30 hours per week this place is great for high school and college kids but not if you want full time hours
good,Target was my first official job.. I appreciate the experience and retail knowledge I’ve gained but the paid doesn’t equal the work load.. one person would be doing a 2/3 person job. Also short of staff. Management isn’t really appreciative...
good,"I worked for target for almost two years. It was nice money in the beginning, however hours were very unpredictable and I was only living check to check. I could not save anything so every paycheck was gone after all my expenses. In my opinion it is not worth all the stress the managers put on the team members. They are getting paid, and everyone else is just working to make it through the week. I did not like how sometimes there was nothing to do, but they still expected professionalism. I also believe the higher authority did not care about the well being of the average team member. I quit about two weeks ago. They did not respect real life situations, and the way hours were broken up, checks became quite small. Target is an ok place to work if you are retired, but not for  people who really need money to live, unless you are a manager."
good,"Many of the managers will be stressful to deal with, but I liked the people I worked with (team members). The managers will pile on the work without giving you more time and blame you when you don't finish.  They tend to hire new people instead of promoting within. Some people have worked there for several years and still make the same as the new employees"
good,"I would only recommend as a first job because no matter which position you learn many skills you can put on your resume. High Stress job, nothing is ever good enough. High expectations and they continuously try to cut hours and people and still expect the same result for example, they cut a team of 5 to only 1 person and expect them to finish the same workload perfectly. They also don’t give you feedback they just complain about you behind your back so you never improve what you’re doing wrong. They either give you poor hours or they overwork you, there is no in between. They also rarely respect your availability so when your bring it up they make you feel lazy or like you don’t want to work. I only recommend as a first job but other than that don’t do it."
good,"My job was pretty easy there, I helped stock food in the grocery/market area. At first, I thought that it was a good job for what it paid. Then I got a new manager that decided that none of my coworkers or I were nearly doing enough. Since that time we had a small raise, from 12 to 13 dollars an hour. Nevertheless, he still worked us hard and didn't have much sympathy if we couldn't meet his goal for the day. The reason I left was when he decided that the set availability we give to HR isn't important. He started scheduling me on days and times I wasn't available, even though those times were on my availability sheet. He didn't provide any explanation or good reason for doing this, and I couldn't continue like that so I had to quit."
good,"Very little hours for all the work you have assigned to you."
good,"Cutting back hours on certain team members on purpose (favoritism)  , firing people/making people quit that have been working there for years . Customers are rude , thinking they run the place , management not treating other employees with respect and dignity"
good,"It was okay, but when I had a inquire about something, it suddenly damaged my hours. And I was afraid to talk to HR, because they seemed very...stoned faced."
good,"Decent place to work.  Its retail, and should expect some of the same as with other large chains.  Wages are fair, but difficult to live on.  Competent management."
good,"Target is a decent place to work at. Although, the target I worked for in Winston-Salem, management is not the best. Some times they have you doing too many things at once. The most enjoyable part about the job is enjoying the meals they provide from time to time."
good,"My store in Belton, Missouri was wonderful. The management had good communication with all employees and handled any complaints or requests very well. The team was a joy to work with and the store itself had a pleasant atmosphere. "
good,i felt working here that i was able to gain good skills and knowledge as well as good troubleshooting skills. i would reccomend working here if someone wanted a part time or full time starting job while preparing for a career.
good,As the new year begins for Target they will move up the pay to $13hr. WIth this mean higher standards are more work and fewer hrs. I have heard from friends they have cut over 300+hr for Target. So I will leave it at that.
good,"I have worked at Target a couple of times and I liked working there.  However, in the past few years they do not really hire for full time employees.  If you state you want to work 35-40 hours a week you might be able lucky to get 20-25 hours.  In order to make up the hours you can call in everyday to see if someone called in in order to pick up enough hours for the week.  Unless you make an average of 30 hours a week for a year are you eligible for any benefits such as insurance.  Target says they are family friendly but it really takes an effort to get time off to spend with family."
good,"Target was a decent place to work until management kept getting switched out like a pair of socks. The turnover rate at the store is terrible. Management is okay but some of the managers and leads dont know what they're doing... The store manager is half unprofessional and half professional (when it's time to show face). I love the people that I work with, everyone gets along & there's not much drama. They allow you to learn different areas of the store which is a plus because you can develop a variety of skills that'll help you in the long run. HR is amazing and is always helpful whenever you have a problem or need to talk. Overall it's a good place to work but it depends on the location and the relationships you build."
good,"All the managers at this target are young, they have the power to put all the work on you and do nothing else in store. Employees usually experience cuts in hours, and career advancements are usually given to the friends of the managers."
good,Loved working there at first until I began to see all of the issues management had. We went through at least 3 HR leads within 5-6 months. It became clear that management did not talk with each other when making decisions. Jobs were given to a lot of people who did not want to work and those who did were not treated well so many left.
good,I worked there every summer for the past 3 years.  What was really nice was that I was able to work during my Winter and Spring breaks as well.  Enjoyed having physical work to do instead of just standing behind the register.
good,"the bosses were nice and didn't take things to seriously.  But its retail so it's not great, it's hard work for basically minimum wage. Also a lot of people didn't take their breaks which was weird."
good,The team members for the most part were great to work with. Management was really not your friend. But as long as you did your job than you were ok. Jus like many jobs if you work retail than there's no such thing as weekends and holidays off.
good,"co workers are enjoyable. always willing to help, was getting 32+ hours now  21. But favorites get the hours Always making promises and excuses but never follow through. If you want a part-time job and no benefits it would be great."
good,"To frustrating to be changing jobs and departments daily. I enjoyed looking for the lost merchandise, i did not like not knowing my role each day but was willing to do what was needed of me."
good,Working at target as a front end team  member is very stressful. When the GSTL isn't there it's  all on you to make team members and  guess happy. Management at my store are not helpful in anyway. Most of them don't know what they are doing either. But I guess all of this is changing is June of 2019.
good,"The leadership at Target was not great, not all but most of the supervisor there feel it’s better to yell and scream to get a job done. They felt that that was more effective then having a normal conversation with team members, the pay was low and during curtain period of the year your hours were cut down to the bear minimum."
good,"working at target as a cashier and as a self checkout supervisor was very slow paced. Flexible schedules were nonexistent, my availability was ignored and I was scheduled at any time."
good,"If you like having Christmas ruined for you, then work retail. This job made you wonder about society in general. And how rude dome people can be just because they didn't want a couple extra buck for an item."
good,Target is just an okay job for okay pay. There are not many advancement opportunities. Management is often disconnected from other workers. Pay is not high enough for the extra work you'll be asked to do.
good,"Target is a great place to work if you in school or just want to work part time. I worked for Target for 12 years and was laid off because I left the company one to try and work for CAT (warehouse). It didn't work out, so I went back to work for Target (Ship from Store). I loved it was really good at flex fufillment and store picks ups and  had perfect attendance. Since Target is going to the $15 an hour in 2020 they have drastically changed. They dont keep people around like they used to, plan to keep people at seasional and drastically cut hours to reduce overall costs to the company."
good,would wait till last minute until pointing out what is wrong with your space and enforce you to stay later working on it. some management isn't too bad it involved a lot of running around and helping customers.
good,Seasonal is busy but fun. Flexibility is a plus. Long hours during seasonal. Discounts. Teamwork. Reachable goals. Training is sufficient. Guests over customers
good,I loved my co-workers and thetempo of the work. Only problem I could see was there was little to zero room for advancment within the company. They seem to prefer hiring from outside the company itself which resulted in a high turnover rate for upper management. This resulted in me pursuing a different direction for employment.
good,"While working at Target, I can safely say that I had a great yet unpleasant experience while working there. I learned many things useful things from my boss, and you'll learn much more along the way. However, many of my co-workers were sloppy when it came to doing their job which made every difficult. There were many nonchalant workers who didn't put much effort into what they did; Which resulted in sloppy isles or misplaced items. knowing items were misplaced our team leads never did anything to address the problem. I've had many customers complain about the organization and the ""mess"" that they usually see around the store. Out of common courtesy, I would apologize and say positive things. Despite the crowded stock room with lost items and misplaced products; our team leaders did a well job training their employees. However, I feel as if only some took away useful skills from their training to incorporate int their daily working habits."
good,"Co-workers are a diversity loved that,  clean store,manager is gd, just that they change ETL's every few months makes it difficult for leads when you are expected to change routines that you know have failed in the past so that ETL's feel they have accomplished something..and actually have not. Dealt with approx. 6/7 ETL'S in 4 years this affected the department I was in drastically"
good,"The atmosphere at Target was not enjoyable.  It was always stressful and you were constantly asked to do multiple tasks that were needing to be completed about the same time, and if you didn't finish all of it, there wouldn't even be acknowledgement of what you did complete."
good,"The Target I worked at helped me develop a lot of costumer service skills. In Target I dealt with all types of guest with different personalities. So it definitely gave me some leverage on how to help certain types of people. It also taught me how to organize my time so I can set my priorities straight as to what needed to be done. On a typical day I had an assignment to Zone, in short means maintain the area to be visually appealing for the guest. Color coded, priced correctly, organized close to perfection, and at times answer phone calls when HR or the receptionist wasn't present. I took time for all of the guest that approached me for help. By giving them 110% even when I wasn't feeling up to it. I always satisfied the customer first."
good,As a company target is a good place and try to show diversity but with some managers or team leads they have favoritisms and will cut slack for certain ethnicities
good,"At target, the work is more important to the employees and managers than anything."
good,"Quick paced environment. Reliability and quick learning will move you up the ranks quickly. Path to advancement is clear and set, can start at lowest level and move up."
good,"A typical day at work, the mornings were slow so if the signing team had not finished putting up sale signs, I would assist with getting the signs put up on the shelves of merchandise. After that I would spend my day taking customer questions off of a multi-line phone, typically to verify whether or not a piece of merchandise was in stock. I would also monitor the fitting room and put unwanted merchandise back out on the sales floor. At the end of the day I would assist with straightening up the active wear section of clothing as well as finish putting away the last of the unwanted merchandise. The most stressful part of the job was managing phone calls in a timely manner, especially around the holidays. The store was frequently understaffed, so team members were often left with more work than they could manage to finish in a timely manner. Team members were frequently pulled off of the sales floor to act as temporary cashiers when lines became too long."
good,I was next in line for a promotion for months in my district but was passed up several times for a male to get the position even though i was top in my position in my district.
good,"Started at the bottom ,worked my way up to cashier in three years  ,just to get fired for some thing I did not do. New management came in every  changed.It was hard to believe I was  let go with little proof  for thief .The best thing is  not having to work with people  who set me up  to take a fall  thay know who thay are!!!!"
good,Target was a confusing company to work for. Everything was difficult. There was not really any training. Nor was the a certain manager to turn to if you had questions.
good,"It used to be great now they're getting worse with hours and management, the people in charge now don't feel like they're on the side of it's workers "
good,It is ok because you can never fully complain about having a job when the jobs are very few in AV.  However I don't feel like the compensation matches.  Also because it is part time truly not enough to support a family. No room for advancement in my opinion.  You have people doing the same thing for 10 yrs plus.
good,"A day at target was fine we would come get clothes to be ready to be pushed out into the sales floor. They didn't give us enough hours to make good money even though I had worked there over a year. They do not do full time at all, so if you want to work you'll probably just get 3 days a week."
good,"On a typical day depending on what area you work in can be a little stressful, especially with holidays and sales that gone on. Depending on what state you work in management can be ok at times."
good,"stocking, zoning, cleaning, engaging with customers, knowing the business sales, comps., and shortages, pulling merchandise, setting planograms, mark downs products for clearance, and back stock over stock merchandise"
good,I started working 40 hours per week in 2007 and have been now cut down to 30 hours per week.  I have an elderly parent that I take care so the more hours I work the better.
good,"People here are focused on everything but the job you are doing. there was a lot of drama going on, even if you are not involved you will hear about it"
good,"I've worked here for two years and have worked in several positions. , It's a great job for high school students because the hours are flexible. only issue i cam across was the management. They can sometimes a little too persistent and a lot is expected when there is a lot of work. Your work isn't appreciated and the more you do the more you're expected to do. Pay isn't bad but every year when we have reviews the increase can be just a couple cents if you're lucky. Again its a good job for teenagers due to hour flexibility."
good,"A typical day at the Strongsville Target is fast paced and crowded. The front end team works together as much as they can without stepping on the toes of upper management and corporate guidelines. I most enjoyed pulling store orders from the sales floor and receiving ship-store orders when the shipments arrived. I also enjoyed the overall aspect of being on the front end and directly assisting customers with transactions that involved purchases, exchanges, and returns. I learned that being the only/main guest service team member can be challenging but also satisfying. I also learned that a willingness to be cross-trained and flexible to shift work areas during the day are much needed and desirable traits for employees."
good,"Working at Target is fine if you want an entry level job, but it would be difficult to have a successful a career there."
good,Not a place u wanna make a career out of very stressful they over work you wit no Benefits and you don’t get breaks for up to 4 hours later and then it’s cut short by management because they want you to keep working.
good,"Decent job but management will cut your hours so they dont have to cover breaks and lunches, while simultaneously call you in because someone called in for their 4 hour shift, which is all they schedule you for."
good,"It has gotten worse over the years. Overworked, underpaid employees. Terrible management, corporation is getting too corporate. They expect and ask more and more of their employees without compensating them fairly. No respect or benefits for staying on with the company long-term."
good,The job was ok. i didn’t enjoy the job. The job pay was very poor.  I liked That they had a place we could buy food on our lunch break or breaks. Overall the job was ok
good,"Pretty easy to learn positions, depending on position works pretty well with your schedule. They are just starting to have a lot of restructuring so there are a lot of jobs being cut."
good,"Target was not a terrible place to work, not fantastic or recommendable, but that's retail. Team members and managers are pretty okay, the hours are sporadic and there was some favoritism going on while I worked there. I started off in the back as a Flow Team Member, and they decided ""You were so engaging with the customers, we're going to make you a cashier."" I didn't WANT to move, but I had no say in the matter. The reason I did not want to be a cashier was that, at the same time, my brother was training to be a manager, which is a HUGE conflict of interest in any field. I later left so that my brother could hopefully get the promotion and remove the conflict of interest and avoid the favoritism. In case you're wondering, he was passed up for a new female team member."
good,"The Target store in my area has a decent starting pay of 12 dollars an hour. They are flexible but hours are hard to come by depending on the season. Once January is over, many people have to fight for hours. So it's best to plan ahead and find a second job during the slow times. Normally, it will pick up around Easter time. "
good,"If you’re hired by Target, DO NOT AGREE to working in the front end. This means cashier, self check out. They will not move you to a different area of the store no matter how many times you beg. These two jobs, even guest services when there isn’t bullseye to push are the slowest places to work. You’ll spend 6 or more hours a day watching the clock because it is absolutely miserable standing there doing nothing."
good,"My particular Target had excessively toxic team managers. Everyone worked hard and was good at what they did but if someone made a single mistake their whole livelihood was threatened. If you were late or had to call in you were ridiculed and blatantly disrespected in front of the entire team. It was borderline primal how a manager would take someone and make a public example out of them. Again, everyone did their jobs well. But work life and person to person relations were just short of combated. They were criticized so heavily they talking to a co worker was next to frightening because you knew your job would be threatened. A good place to work if you're content with solitude and/or don't put much priority on your income."
good,"Mis managed poor hours unrealistic expectations , with no room for advancement unless you have a degree from college, salary cap at 15.00 dollars and no higher."
good,The management and coworkers are nice people. The work load isn’t a lot at all. The atmosphere is nice. It’s peaceful. But the hours are very limited. They offer other hours in different departments but you can’t gain those hours unless your trained in that particular department.
good,"The environment is very fast paced.  It requires you to wear many hats to make sure the customer experience is pleasant and satisfying.  The only negative is the turnover rate with employees is common, so the constant need to train new employees is substantial.  Management,, specifically team leads appear to be ill-equipped with managing personnel and in most cases lack the necessary skill set to manage."
good,A good place to work for any college student needing some extra money. The company is an overall good company however be prepared for a fast-paced workplace and lots of customer engagments.
good,Have fun working while it lasted. There all kind of people and different ages that are nice and enjoyable. I think the down fall is communication that is something the store lacks.
good,Target in Chambersburg is an OK place to work but there is no real way to advance ones career from blue collar up to white collar. One would have to work a massive amount of overtime during the fall seasons as well.
good,"I worked at target for a little under a year, and honestly your experience will vary on which department you work in. I started on the sales floor, in soft lines, i hated it. Soon I transferred to the front end as a cashier and his area was much better for me, my only complaint was the inconsistency in hours."
good,"Target seemed like such a humble environment. When I got the chance to finally work in this establishment, I was beyond disappointed. The people showed me that not everything is what it seems. I would not like to go into too much detail for the simple fact that I would not want to slander this corporation."
good,The management treated people very unfairly and poorly. If micromanaging is your thing this is the place for you. When they wanted someone to quit who was part time they just cut their hours to nothing.
good,"store manager was bad"
good,Working at target seemed fun but it was outrageous... from not getting my punch Id to never being answered by my fellow workers it just is not a good vibe.
good,"Researching and catching shoplifters was exciting and enjoyable. Standing at the doors was not. We hired a lot of managers right out of college with not a lot of loss prevention experience, so advancement was not something that came with merit. Every time a new manager was hired, they'd have to learn their employees and there was never a focus or track to advance. The culture was mostly relaxed with some emphasis on providing results. Hardest part of the job was managing boredom standing at the doors checking receipts, as well as dealing with insufficient compensation. The most enjoyable part of the job was the rush of creating cases against repeat shoplifters and the excitement in the process of arresting shoplifters."
good,Co workers were great to work with. Great team players. Clean and pleasant working conditions. Great OT hours during holiday season only. Not many hours afterwards.
good,Fun and positive people to work with and also helpful but it is difficult to move up if you are not friends with the managers. Hard work isn’t always recognized correctly.
good,They worked with school schedule yet they would give one employee more hours then another employee when they both work harder.  Always given all the workload
good,I loved working here but once the winter hits the hours are cut tremendously and being scheduled alone is not ideal. Too much work is being put on one person for a night. Not everything can get done and no other tasks are able to be started/finished
good,"Management needs to talk more, the next thing is stop taking Walmart Management and thinking it is a good idea, there is a reason why people like target more then Walmart"
good,"Didn't receive very much training, only the super basics and learned most things from trial and error. While retail is typically a fine place for beginner jobs, it was hard to find out who to go to for what issue."
good,"It is fine work when the management sticks with what they tell you."
good,I made great friendships based off hardships within the company. Given 5-8 hours to complete 10 hours of work then to get reprimanded for incompletion. Doesn't want overtime so you'll have to leave early and leave workload for next shift. Nightshift wouldn't pick up their work leaving next shift with their duties plus dealing with customers and the day shifts current workload. Sometimes feet like slaves with no recognition.
good,Management does not understand work life balance and continually asks people to work off the clock or on off days. Management is constantly demanding more from you but never thanks you or congratulates you on a job well done.
good,"There's always gonna be something to get done, but you may only get so many hours.It's hard to move departments so choose wisely. The pay is good but only if you're actually accumulating hours."
good,"Most upper management is not very personable, have no idea how to do some aspects of the job. They work in clans but expect team members to work individually. "
good,"There are a lot of good, respectful people working at target who really don't discriminate for any reason and are hard working. But there are more bad, vengeful, petty individuals who use their power to maximize their pay and hours at work where lower workers get shorted. Incompetent workers will get and keep jobs just because of family connections, and all part time workers are worked just under full time hours without receiving the benefits."
good,"Logistics Overnight Flow, Temp. It was easy and fun while I learned the first 2-ish weeks from a friendly fellow team member before being promoted. All the new team members were more cooperative and were the friendliest peers. It was easy overall and enjoyed doing quick neat organising (after actually knowing where the items were/are moved to), but after I had no one to teach me about organizing inventory on pallets for the warehouse and other details it was rather frustrating even when I asked. Very rarely got a straight answer. "
good,"The one good thing about Target I can say is that you could easily get into a routine on your work. Clock in go grab your assigned cart of product and begin to stock it on the shelves. That's normally how it would work, but quite often we'd have questionable changes come down from above that were supposed to make things better or more efficient but more often then not did not or had no change. There was also a practice of favoritism at my location."
good,"The logistics team has a physically demanding role and is expected to be quick, which can be a challenge. However, if the managers and team members are fair and trust you the day-to-day process isn't bad. They are great about working with my availability for school."
good,"The managers are what make or break your Target experience. Bad managers make for angry employees, which is a huge problem at my location. There are too many errors when it comes to scheduling (sometimes someone forgot to schedule an opener or a closer and this is absurd). It is a fight for hours. They do not care about your well-being."
good,"Working there was generally frustrating and unfulfilling. Target Cafe members could not agree on anything, couldn't get along and worked together poorly."
good,"In the four years I was at Target I had 3 different managers. My job did not change but management was always changing. During my time with Target is when they wanted to merge Daytons, Mervyns, and Target IT departments."
good,"The short time I worked there the work environment was good. Management is straight forward and help when and where they can. Only con was that it was overnight and I had school during the day, so it was rough."
good,"Working at Target is okay. The pay is a pretty good rate for front-end cashiers. However, working in the front can be quite stressful. On Saturdays and Sundays, it's non-stop for hours at a time. And we don't get breaks until closer to 4 hours into our shifts sometimes. (Our shifts are typically only 5 & 1/2 hours).The customers are sometimes rude, not knowing or caring what we have to deal with at work and otherwise. Some of the managers ""forget"" to send us on break during slower/steadier times. People from other departments are sometimes rude to us when we're checking them out."
good,"Management is inconsistent with communication, and gives bad direction, and guidance. Adding heavy work loads and or tasks that are impossible to complete in a 6-7 hour work day."
good,i enjoyed the people i worked with but management was horrible they didnt care about you or what you thought i also didnt like how i could never no matter how much i asked or tried i could never move up in that company and the pay sucked
good,"It's an okay job, but not if you're looking to advance and move up in the business for a career.  Hire management from outside company and people who know nothing about job."
good,"We were always told different things by many different managers. That would leave us sometimes confused. They did not want to give benefits. they wont let most people work over 40 hours so they don't have to give benefits. they wouldn't care if you worked 1 or 2 days out of the week. they were inconsistent. other than that, I helped guests as much as possible, I made sure my area was clean and taken care of. Most of the customers were nice. My co workers worked as a team, even if management wasn't steady."
good,"Target is a super fast paced work environment. They offer pretty good work/life balance, but it is a grind on most days. Ultimately, its a big corporation, so career and pay advancements are tough to come by."
good,I would work in the back room mostly and stock shelves in the back.Also use the price gun to price items and stuff like that.Would also work upfront t
good,"I enjoyed working there. When they start cutting hours down I was getting stressful. Full-time and hours dropped. They think that you can go to other departments and get hours, when another person is doing the same thing. And to have to use your vacation and personal to make up the hours you lost."
good,"The company culture is not the best. I worked as a Backroom Team Member and didn't see any opportunities for advancement. "
good,its a fun job overall but I would recommend the place to be a little more organized and cleaner for all of the guests that comes there so they wouldn't have to always complain about how they don't like it.
good,Target is a good company just that as a manager your work and life balance isn't ideal.  Working three full weekends in the months of November and December is brutal.
good,"Target was an alright job for someone who wanted to just work part time. Their hours were pretty flexible which created a good work life balance. However, if you were a cashier, you were forced to try and sell their credit card to EVERYONE who came through your line, and that was a deciding factor on whether or not you had the opportunity for advancement, which I think is ridiculous. All the management team cared about was their stupid RedCard sales. If they didn't get sales, some of them would go far enough to open one in their own name or ask other employees to open them so they could reach their quota for the day, which I find extremely wrong. Management would stress and become not very nice if the RedCard sales weren't through the roof. I hated working at Target as a cashier for that reason, plus there is no one who could survive full time on the wage that target pays their cashiers. All in all, I would never work at Target again unless you were something other than a cashier."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job at target is meeting people you work with and the customers you check out at the register.  sometimes meeting friends you haven't seen in a long time.
good,It's retail.  You understand retail when you work it.  There is no overtime.  It's fast paced and people are cranky.  But you get to help some people and that makes the job worthwhile.  Team members are hit or miss.
good,Basic back stock and customer service. A little unorganized at times. I am great at handling stressful situations and learned how to get alot done in a little amount of time there.
good,"Coworkers are great to work with and the daily job is relaxed. However, management is very poor and treats employees very underhandedly. Over all it is a good first job."
good,"At the beginning of the mentioned employment it was rather tedious and repetitive, thus further training in other departments had been sought out continuously over the course of employment. Towards the end of the employment, communication from supervisors and other higher positioned employees of the company at the location became dwindled. With the unnecessary cut in hours, employment elsewhere was needed in order to manage a decent living. This was the decline of what could have possibly been an ideal work environment and position."
good,I love Target in the beginning at the moment my boss was amazing I love the experience. I love the people I love the environment but just like retail managers change and I went from amazing to downhill from there
good,"Working retail is always an experience. But target is ultimately a reliable place to work. granted, during the time after christmas hours will drop. If you get along with your coworkers it can be a fun place to work through college."
good,"Target can be a great company if you like helping others with Customer Service. My title was Soft lines- organizing the shelves, racks with clothing, shoes and jewelry. Also help with the changing rooms- putting clothes away or helping guest through the phone and directing them to correct department."
good,Having to stand on an order picker for 12 hours overnight with no music is not fun. The pay was great but the hours were not. Laid back but also fast paced. You weren't rushing about but you had a quota to meet.
good,If you are just looking for a part time job for extra cash this is the perfect place to work. Target is flexible with hours but they will make sure you will ONLY have part time hours per pay period even if you get full time hours one week if need be you will work one day the following to balance out the part time pay for the next.
good,"I haven't worked there since 2016, its was fast pace. I worked early mornings, I unloaded the truck and stocked the shelves. I help through out the store with stocking"
good,"Overall working for Target was exhausting and I didn't even work in customer service. I was in the shipping department as well as the back room. The pay for seasoned workers is unfair since the promise to raise the minimum to $15 by 2020. After being in charge of a department of 10-20 people and training in multiple departments, I was still making the same amount as the new high school aged team members."
good,"While the managers and co-workers are very kind and welcoming. The company itself does not offer much for its employees the benefit packages are terrible the page is not come close to cost of living, employee discounts for their meals while at work. A 5% discount is given to employees to be used only when not working and cannot be by any family members not even immediate family members such as husbands or kids. They are constantly letting people go in hiring back people before their benefits kick in after almost 2 years. I would never go back to work there and never recommend it to anybody close to me but again the people there make it so worth it. I can only hope that the people that would do work there will sooner or later get better benefits and pay."
good,"The store I worked for was great in the beginning. Then a huge portion of the management team left, and we received new managers who didn’t fit in well. The store manager started making the schedule for the WHOLE store (instead of each team leader making the schedule for their team). The new management made working at Target a drag, and the new manager pays no attention to your desired work hours or availability."
good,"I had been a customer/guest at Target longer than any stores in my area have been open so, I knew what to expect from Target. Things began changing, as things do, but with no clear direction as to why other than ""it's what the customers want"". Long story short, after 11 yrs, the changes were too much and I'd had enough. Work life balance was merely lip service once they started opening on Thanksgiving Day. When I started there were three days I was guaranteed not to work; Easter Sunday, Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. I wasn't going to be a part of that, family is more important to me."
good,there was never anything hard in working for target. it was okay to be in the position that I withheld only for a couple of months had to relocate back to Florida.
good,A typical day at work includes pushing inventory from truck delivery on that day. I learned time management and how to manage time with coworkers via breaks and meal breaks.
good,I only worked there for 25 days. It was an ok experience and I think a lot of it had to do with being hired during Q4(holiday). I did a lot of things that I wasn’t expecting to do. The leadership team was very dismissive and not welcoming.
good,"I had high hopes, but all the typical problems with retail were there, only worse because fundamental roles that need to be in place are not there.  Lack of staffing effects sales, makes store sloppy, can't get shelves stocked, with out help. No one in Toys during Xmas? Not enough cashiers, The backroom is overcrowded, if fundamentals were covered, things would get done, shelves and stock would have a balance.  Several people have left, already. I would like to see things turn around and be better.  The hardest part of the job is equipment not working properly or maintained. Radios and hand held devices not charged properly.  I hurt my self, with a broken radio . Only makes everything else hard to do your job effectively."
good,"Target was very organized from a managerial standpoint, However work culture suffered due to the employment of those unqualified for certain positions and made working there very arduous"
good,It's not a horrible job but upper managment tend to be lazy and expect more than required out of you even if you're a hard worker. People who are lazy get away with it and leadership trys putting on the quality workers. Putting in extra effort and going above what's expected goes un reconized most of the time.
good,"It's retail!  Expect it all.  Fast pace, constant turnover, and micromanagement.  That's the easy part I didn't mind (it's crazy).  I didn't enjoy the unnecessary rigidness of upper managers when I was in school and could only work evenings.  There was no real balance or support from the team to help you get ahead or to just get even.  Unrealistic expectations to complete an insane amount of work in a short amount of time is fine--but to allow an unfair/unbalanced team support was no okay with me.  One person should be given the support of 5 team members while the other person (me) has none.  Equal tasks with unequal support.  They supported crummy people that treated people poorly.  I left for other employment opportunities!"
good,"no care for family life, if your behind on work or its the holiday months, expect mandatory overtime 10 or 12 hour shifts. work 364 day a year, only December 25 off. managers walk on you most of the time but wont help you move up. in my case they tend to use the Team Members to look good but give little to no recognition for them. each department only gets 2-5% vacation at a time, so that's usually only 2-4 ppl that can get a day off and they go of seniority."
good,"Management from store to store is a joke. You will have support from corporate, and the company itself is wonderful. But store management needs an overhaul in training."
good,"Simple place to work with little to no consiquences after your inicial 90 days. Do not expect promotions unless you have been there for several years, this includes promotion to full time. After working there 2+ years I received raises that matched new arrivals (I.E: Target raised their wages to 12 dollars for new hires, so I was raised to 12 dollars)"
good,"it did not feel like leadership ""walked the talk"".  while I learned so much related to interviewing leadership candidates, it was a difficult environment.  this was a long time ago."
good,Everything was changed from how we unload the truck to how we stock and help the customers they made everything worse supervisors were rude half of them didn't do there job
good,There is little chance of upward mobility. They are flexible with school and other commitments. Management was okay. Some managers are better than others.
good,Average retail job experience. Never seemed to have enough people on staff yet always hired a large amount resulting in low work hours with bad managers
good,The work there was okay it suck that it was seasonal I wish I would have continued working there and fortunately I had to have surgery and the position was seasonal so they could not continue my employment
good,"It wasn't necessarily a bad place to work, but management can make it feel like it it. You have all the supervisors always on top of you and it can make it feel more stressful than it actually is."
good,"people are cool to work with, but other than that, it's just a job. Been working here for four years and have had a lot of ups and downs. Now I feel it's time to move on"
good,"arrive shortly before trucks arrive, unload, unpack pallets, scan merchandise and shelve.  I learned how to work the scanners and cashier. The temperatures at times were extreme due to unload of truck pallets in bay. Good teamwork and managers/supervisors. only temporary work, not steady hurs due to the nature of the job."
good,"I liked working there at first. It can be a fun place to work as long as the management isn't treating you poorly. At first the Manager was teaching me new things almost every day, he was training me to become a Team Lead, then he brought in a girl from his old store, made her team lead immediately but after that he didn't teach me new things and the new team lead was not a nice person. So that was the end of the road for me after it was like that for a while I moved on to Macy's Credit Customer Service."
good,"I loved working at Target, but recently my team got a new manager who does not support our out-of-work life, like school or family issues. When asked for school off, I was told “We will think about it.”"
good,The reason i am writing this comment today is because the bozo management or whoever puts the  advertisements that a company is hiring sucks for the Bloomington normal target. How are advertising multiple Job openings but when i call to see about my application now the job is not hiring and they wait weeks till they inform anybody target as a company is a great store I’ve worked there previously.  The only problems i have are that if you are not hiring you shouldn’t have it up on any websites stating that you are that is unprofessional and misleading.
good,"Target is terrible company who doesn't give employees breaks when they deserve them.. also, if I might add the management is terrible as well.DONT WORK FOR TARGET!!!!"
good,"When I started at Target, and for the first year, it was fast-paced but manageable work. Now, thanks to some recent changes to structure and job description, it has become a fast-paced slog to finish the work before your shift ends. I am constantly told that I cannot stay past my shift to finish a task because there aren't enough payroll hours to go around. I am consistently dragged away from one task to take care of another and then berated, by the person that gave me both tasks, for not finishing the first task fast enough."
good,"The management at the target I worked at was very terrible. Most of the managers were very childish and liked to gossip and make up stories about the team members. A lot of people left when I was there because they couldn't take it. I'm sure this was probably an isolated incident and most targets are probably fine to work at, but my experience was horrible. Oh and we almost never got our second 15 min break. I felt too embarrassed to even ask for it half the time cause whenever I did it would almost always be immediately followed up by asking me how far along I was with whatever task I had and it made it feel like you shouldn't be going on break until you finish everything."
good,They are real strict right now because at this time this is when they make the most money so it's not a good time to start right now anything you do that's wrong you will get written up for it even if you wasn't train on it
good,Target offers no incentive for personal growth or growth to move up in the company unless someone is looking out for you! No incentive to grow! Unrealistic expectations and evaluations are trash! Salary is really low for the amount of work they expect to get from you!
good,Had been with the company for a while and was cross trained in multiple departments - could be anywhere in the store on a different day. Had to be prepared and ready to be on the move no matter where you were.
good,Easy work but hours stink. If it is not Christmas time then its a fight to get hours. Mostly required to work at least one day out of the weekend. Late schedules start time from 7pm-11pm.
good,"I would do go backs for the fitting room. The work place was often slow, didn't have much customer interaction. Spent the entire day putting clothes back on the rack."
good,"A typical day as an A&A associate at Target consists of a lot of running around and cleaning up after others, bringing out and modifying fixtures to satisfy new items, and collaborating with other team members. You need to be adaptable to new changes because the company implements them often. Management had a tendency to be not always so understanding which is an obstacle, but then there were other managers that were completely understanding at all times."
good,As an ETL you are constantly working long hours. The retail schedule isn't horrible considering other places you work every weekend. Great experience. Would not recommend to a friend.
good,"I worked as a cashier and it was easy and fun, the holidays got busy but I didn't mind at the time as I was younger. You get moved around a lot to work different positions without getting cross trained from what I remember and that was the most difficult part of the job for me."
good,"depending on the leader, it can really be a fun place to work. Some of the manger can be very shady. The pay is good but the hours are not consistent so it can be bad for people with bills."
good,"The work isn't terrible, but even when you make you availability clear the manger on duty will always seem to neglect when and for how long you can work."
good,"If the US restricted trade with China, Target stores wouldn't have any products"
good,"Grant it that I was a cashier, it wasn't the responsibilities that I didn't enjoy but the environment and type of job which made me feel tired and worn-out at the end of every shift. It was a fight to stay enthusiastic and feel good about your job because at that level of work you are easily replaceable. It can feel purposeless at times. I was a seasonal employee, but at the location, I worked at, my co-workers are what kept me alive and going. It was seeing others happy and customers happy as well that made the difference. I didn't like selling credit or debit Red cards to customers when they weren't necessarily sold on the idea either, which was something that was a constant pressure from managers— it just instilled fear more so in the employees who worked the cash registers. Overall, I liked the people and the work was just menial work, but the pressure and dealing with all kinds of people all day can be taxing on your emotions."
good,This type of job at Target is good for people that need extra money or are in School especially for young students right out of High School. No paid holidays but have to work holidays.
good,"It was a good first job and I learned many skills. ""How can I help you?"" was spoken to guests, but rarely to fellow team members. I congratulate headquarters on attempting to be innovative and trying to improve the company however, forcing the changes to take effect overnight and expecting those changes to work without a hitch is frustrating to say the least. This is the equivalent of taking one step forward and two steps back. There have been many changes to the management process recently, putting more strain on the lower tier employees. If you are someone looking for a first/temporary job, Target is an ok place to work. If you are looking for a longer term position, keep looking. I know I am."
good,"Typical day was stocking the sales hourly quota, and than putting it back into inventory. I learned I would never advance over $18.00 an hour after I maxed out in time. Most of the managers were great when I worked there. The hardest part of the job was the monotony of doing things over and over, and than putting it all back."
good,"The training here was minimal and not very thorough. You have a 4-5 hour orientation that feels more like something you would show to a consumer rather than someone who is about to work there. I was a Cashier, and with no retail experience or anything whatsoever, they put me on a register and watched me for about 20 minutes then left me alone. I'm a fast learner, so I had a routine down within a week, but the lack of support and kind of ""learn on your own"" thing wasn't working for me. The managers were very nice and approachable, customers were usually pretty friendly. The insane renovations were a bit much though. Overall just felt unstable and for my first retail job, not my thing."
good,"working for target has been stressful to say the least. if you can handle doing the jobs of four other people in one persons time, this is the place for you. if your management is good, it’s much better but if they’re subpar, it’s excruciating."
good,"Target was just an OKAY company to work for. They never would move me up in management even after I got my Bachelors degree and had 4 years of experience under my belt. I guess if you knew those people on a PERSONAL level, thats the only way you were going to get moved up into the company."
good,"Wouldnt know much to put on here since it was a seasonal job hired. Christmas time does get really busy so be aware of what stress and chaos will come about, especially during black friday. It may be for one day but it is awful. Well at the least the customer's attitude. Working wise, it was busy and continuous so you didnt feel much of the chaos of all."
good,"For flow team our main job was to unload and handle the freight, but other responsibilities were expected of us as well. You clock in early in the morning depending on the volume of the store, unload and sort the product in order for it to get worked to its home. Then any product that didn't fit would get put away in the backroom."
good,"Company has different point of views compared to before, they are very trendy and competitive, although results are what matters sometimes you have to stop and look at the ways ..."
good,When I first started working at Target management was very good.  However over the years it declined.  After the breach at Target pressure to sell Red Cards was enormous.    The dress code ignored and a general lack of professionalism existed.  Staffing levels dropped and many quest had to wait way to long in line as many times only one cashier at   peak times.
good,"I have learned good customer service , and very challenging to dealt with different kind of attitude of guest , sometimes you will be entertained or vice versa.  Patience and strong sense of humor must be one of the  best characteristics of a  cashier.  You have to connect with the guest in terms of pushing the red card.  I enjoyed working with target."
good,"I loved processing the photos! Never knew what you would get! Helping guest with returns, making payments, look for a particular clothing item at a different target."
good,"I worked with the company growing from a cashier to Leader On Duty. Over the past eight years I have witnessed the slow changes and business adjustments that drove the culture to where it is. With a need to make big changes to how we do business and how we find talent, Target is shifting from an open door supportive work culture to a hostile exclusive environment. The company is offering more money than ever before for base positions. Pay is often higher than competitors, but with high stress levels, very limited resources and flawed training schedules for new team members that are not in executive management."
good,"I was trained in guest service, self-checkout, and cashier. I was frequently overworked because I was trained in all these areas, and I would often be in charge of doing all three at once. It's impossible to do, and made guests upset for something out of my control. Workplace culture is just like any retail job: constantly complaining about how miserably people treat you every day at work. Hardest part of the job was dealing with uncooperative guests, but that's just retail. Most enjoyable part was my coworkers who were generally nice and team-oriented people. The emphasis on getting RedCards is also poorly planned. I was very good at selling them, and they used to reward us with free Starbucks or food if we got a certain quota. When they took away the compensation, they couldn't understand why we weren't as motivated to sell."
good,"Pay was decent, but good look with scheduling. I requested about 20 hours a week, because I am a student, and my first couple weeks I was receiving 30-40 hours a week. Brought it up to my supervisors and they didn't do anything about it for a while. Then the evening shift got cut so I was only working weekends (due to class). I would also request time off and it was not looked at so I would still be scheduled during that time."
good,Supervisors are right out of college with minimal work experience. Target has rules and processes for everything. The problem is nobody enforces them which make for a chaotic work environment. You may follow the processes but the person next to you is not. Very counterproductive.
good,"The environment is very fast paced. As a manager, you have the opportunity to advanced and develop professionally, but you have to be willing to do whatever it takes to stay on top, otherwise, you can easily be  discarded. The culture is everyone is replaceable, which I am sure is not unique to just Target, its just the way of the world."
good,During the peak season it’s pretty busy and slightly stressful and a lot of testing needs to be done within a certain period of time it’s really a simple job it’s just management and supervisors who make it extremely complicated   Specifically in my location is shows if they had favoritism Which is extremely unprofessional
good,"minimal hours, had to finish unloading carts before store opened, had to clean before customers arrived, no organization at all, no way to organize because the warehouse is a zoo"
good,Assisted customer's with returns as well as purchases. Opened credit cards to help promote business for the company. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people's establishing new friendships. Assisted customer's with credit cards payments. target is a great job for people's that's in high school. I learned how to better assist customer's.
good,"Target was not a bad place to work, however it is hard to balance another job when they will schedule you up to that very last second you would have to leave. Benefits are okay but not a job for forever."
good,"usually under staff, a lot of leftover work agenda from the previous day. Systems is down for a while. The company had to separate partnership with target because of bad business."
good,"Inventory  audit"
good,"The people who work with you are generally really laid-back and easy to work with. Management was horrible and you would get in trouble for not shoving their credit card (RedCards) down every customer's throat (even though their credit card is a horrible deal and difficult to cancel). Management prefers to fire its minimum wage, part-time employees over small things like being late or missing a shift because its shift pick-up system is all in-store and on-paper and completely unreliable. It is a decent minimum wage place if you're looking for something temporary."
good,If you are working at a low volume store things can be hard. You may not have enough people to get ever thing done. If management to enforce the standards even though you are short handed then you may be in danger of losing your jobs. Level 3 team leader are supervisor in the middle who will be held the most responsible by store executive. Executive are rarely held responsible.                   You make it to become a level 3 but without a four year degree there is small bottle neck to become a store executive. The training you get is usually great and the training for level 3 is usually great. Most district have annual class room situation for their leader which is very informative. The district to has to be consistent in giving these classes. They do help you become a great leader.                               How smooth the store run depends on the team leader who runs store and experience is premium. Be aware in a store that lack experience if you are in a low volume store. Because if thing become over whelming that well not no how to manage it they just talk about company standard and policies.
good,Took advantage of the fact that i was a good worker. I closed every shift doing boys/girls/infants (worst softlines zone) and when i said o couldnt do it every night they didnt listen. Then they were surprised when I put my two weeks in....
good,"The one positive thing I took out of my job the most was that there are many people from all over the world with many backgrounds. I have met individuals from both U.S. coasts, to individuals from the far east. There are many good stories to have and cultures to learn about. The amount of genuine employees can be wonderful and uplifting. The company adds on an additional bonus to healthy lifestyle clothing and foods, driving for a healthier team. Targets infrastructure for training leaders is quite solid, too. Being able to make leaders out of people that did not expect to ever be. Targets branding was also quite progressive, with inclusiveness of special needs, people of color, and plus-sized models."
good,"I enjoyed the job, but not the bosses. They practically force you into working hours outside of your comfort zone and don't respect requested hours. I enjoy difficult tasks and staying busy but they always over worked team members. Communication definitely lacked at the store I worked in."
good,great first time job to work in. you are able to work in all types of departments and be crossed trained which is great. You are expanding yourself by opening up to new opportunities and challenges.
good,"One week I would received 40 hours, then the next 11 hours! hours are very inconsistent. The raise to $15 is great. But my H.R told me to throw out any applications that where not 100% availability. They do NOT work with second jobs!"
good,"Target has high expectations for all employees and I found that you were never quite able to completely meet goals simply because the job focus or standards changed all the time.  They are currently changing the way they do business in the stores which requires salesfloor team members to be able to do everything back to front which includes pulling stock from backroom and setting sales planners all the way through properly backstocking products all while providing outstanding guest service.  For the front end, they are also working to  make sure they know how to pull and backstock product as well as set sales planners as well as process all guest transactions while offering RedCard Credit or Debit cards and teaching the guests to use their Target Cartwheel App.  They used to have a separate team that processed and pushed trucks and maintained the backroom but those positions have gone away with the new process.  It is a fast-paced environment. In my store, management changed often and not all of them were as willing to work with the team members as others."
good,"Target stands by its moto... Fast fun and friendly. "
good,"I did my internship at Target, so only worked 40 hrs per week. But I know that most managers at Target work more than 60 hrs. It is retail so no set schedule. You always had to work during the weekend."
good,"Loved the work and guest but poor leadership"
good,"This job is good for those first starting out, and the reason Target has a high turn over rate is for numerous reasons. The main reason; sick days are not acceptable. Be careful if you ever so much as miss a day, even with a doctors note. They do not take absense lightly."
good,It is okay for a entry level job or a job to get your feet wet but this is a job that usually centers around pleasing customers and sales. It is very high paced and not well managed.
good,Management changes every 12-18 months. I had 5 diff store managers in less then 5  was a trainer and making same wage as new hires. No one wanted to take the lead and make changes for the better.
good,"i Haven't worked for Target in about 4 years, but I felt like management did a complete unjust action towards me. Unless you were in the inner circle you stood no chance of advancement. Since then i have heard all new management has been put in place. I sincerely hope that this never happens again."
good,I think this company does have some benefits in that I worked for them all throughout my college life. I believe the flexible scheduling is the biggest benefit they had. Though nowadays the hours we were getting per person was very limited.
good,"great for the discount, pretty easy job. very very poor management. they were very condescending and made you feel unappreciated. it was also very fast paced."
good,Fast pace and not enough training. It will be a very nice place to work if they trained you more management and the Fulfillment center is lacking training
good,"The job i do is relatively easy since its just restocking produce but they consistently want you to work at 150%, also the management is very poor, while they hardly do nothing and even sometimes sit around and do nothing, they will come by your area and get on you for doing your job, by telling you something you need to do or get on you for going ""slow""."
good,"Starbucks baristas are overworked and underpaid. They are not allowed tips, and when they need help, it's rare that an employee is even trained enough to help, let alone willing. The job does teach independence and quick thinking, but in a stressful way that doesn't work for everyone. Management doesn't care at all about baristas so long as they make sales and don't complain, and it's a very fast-pasted, very stressful job. Customers are often rude and impatient and are frequently quick to complain to managers if baristas work too slow. Making drinks and giving customers suggestions to help brighten their day is enjoyable, and there are fun aspects of the job, but overall it's highly stressful."
good,"Poor management... Push employees to get Redcards WAY too hard, even go my job threatened over it... Ridiculous. If people don't want it.. they don't want it. There is no forcing it and the company OBVIOUSLY doesn't understand that."
good,I would say working at target has been fun at times but on the other hand the down times it makes it hard to afford ever day items. In short target would be a good place to work for some body that needs a part time job.
good,"Target is going through some changes right now to stay relevant against other competitors, emphasizing customer experience and selling. I have no problem with that as a business model and my managers are good to us. The job culture is low-key with a consistent open-door policy. Over the years, I've been able to grow in my interactions with other people and improve my merchandising skills, both in speed and creativity. However, with open availability, the hours I spend at work leave little time for my family and I want to do something else."
good,"Hours were flexible for college students, not much room for creativity, but was not needed. great opportunity to work with customers and coworkers. Not too difficult. Good job for student as students could leave for classes and come back at the end of the semester with no trouble."
good,i feel target caters to  the workers it wnats to and doensnt take care of it good employees  who been there for a time  who do there job and dont complain
good,"The supervisor was childish and never around it was hard to rely on co workers. Wasn’t trained properly and still had to ask for help regularly, the help didn’t always come quickly leaving customers frustrated."
good,I don’t really enjoy target. Easy job but confusing leaders. I do like that they have fun things for the break room and give food. They say they are flexible with their hours but lack to accept my schedule change.
good,I liked working at Target. I worked in Apparel very and Cashier . It's mind less work. The time goes by super quick and you get to see all the new clothes that are coming out. It was awesome.
good,"The work place is fine if you're younger than 20. It's fast pace and they day goes by really fast. The hardest part is how rude or negitive the costumers can get. You don't get a lot of hours, 20 or maybe 30 a week."
good,"Overnight shifts were relaxed but still fast paced, had to make sure that you stocked all shelfs in the store before it was time to open in the morning. Mostly started at 11 pm and clocked out around 8 am"
good,"When I first stated at target I liked it a lot, it was my first job and I caught on fast. Then as time went by, I slowly found that some of the management tended to take advantage of the employees in regards to their time. They will also push you to get credit cards which is very stressful then they make you feel very degraded."
good,I some what enjoyed working here. The pay was kind of low for a corporation this big. But its retail so it is what it is. Good job for those coming gout of school.
good,"I would work in the clothing section, to me it was very boring, slow and not much space to grow. I learned how to fold clothes and be organized. The workplace environment was very quiet everyone keeps to themselves not much activity going on. Nothing about this job was really hard it was very limiting and didn't enjoy much of my time there."
good,My experience with Target was short but I loved the people. I only left because the manager and I butted heads which caused a stressful work situation for me.
good,When I started at Target I LOVED MY JOB with a great working environment. Things changed with Management. This person while in the begining was ok as time went on the work environment became a little hostile so I chose to leave.
good,"The management at the location I worked for was the most unprofessional, negative, highly stressed, and just all around bad management, that I have ever worked for."
good,Use to be a good company to work for now all they do is work you to the bone with less hrs. Management leader sucks. No overtime unless it's around C.
good,"The company's main goal is to ensure the guest can find and purchase what they are looking for. "
good,Management not friendly  and   They don’t make it easy to avance or get promoted  you can tell they have  preferences to certain employees otherwise nice to work  there
good,"i was responsible for receiving and distribution of all advertising"
good,"See pros/cons. Every manager has different priorities which makes task completion hard, lots of employee appreciation in breakroom. Typical retail store most positions are geared towards young high school adults"
good,"I enjoy learning new skills, to improve my work experience. Such as the dressing room requirements, answering phone calls and transferring. I am someone who enjoys organization and cleanliness, So I found the required tasks, keeping the dressing room area, and surrounding area clean and organized. Enjoyed the cashiering position, and learning the ship from store department."
good,"The job had vast potential, however the people in charge at this location were ill equipped for their particular roles. Other locations may be amazing as I have heard very different stories from others at different locations."
good,"Great compensation"
good,"When I got the job offer to work there it took them over a month to process the paper work, they kept telling me they forgot and were going to get me processed that day but didn't for a whole month. The fellow employees were nice but training and management was the worst. I had ZERO idea who to report to because there were like 8 different managers on site at a time. They said work on a team but its really work alone. My job was litterly to bring the shopping carts from outside and bring them back inside, that is the primary function of my job, otherwise it was clean the store, help customers, clean the bathrooms and walk around the whole store picking up empty baskets that customers just put down and walked away from and never came back for. Training was litterly 1 day and that was it, otherwise there was none. So happy i left the store"
good,"Quick faced work day.  Worked as sales associate.  Learned how to work fast, efficiently & how to provide good service to customers.  Hardest part of job is the lack of hours given.  I enjoyed working with co-workers & availing of employee discount."
good,The job wasn’t hard at all. It was a nice job. The management was constantly changing. We had 4 different HR  since the time I got there. All in all it’s a good place to work
good,the management was very strict and sometimes a little rude. but the other employees were fun and very helpful when you first start out. The job itself wasn't very challenging.
good,"During Game Days was a blast, made shifts go by so quick. Even when attendance was down due to weather or losing streak, there were die hard fans who would stop in to say high. Nice seeing supportive staff and fans in an electric environment."
good,To get ahead it seemed like you had to have a personal relationship with management. No empathy in terms of needing time off for personal issues. Efforts were made for team building.
good,"Having worked at different Targets in my area, I can say that the culture differs from store to store. Some have managers that are engaging and others that just sit back and delegate. "
good,Most PT TM's averaged 20+ hrs a week but when they globally raised the minimum wage to $11 recently many of us have had our work week slashed to 12 to as low as 2 hrs per week
good,"It's not a job I recommend as a career choice. Only if you need the job. I worked as a cashier, it was a fast paced environment. It could be fun at times, but very tedious and repetious"
good,Not a bad place to work.  Good for a first job.  Some management issues.  Pay wasn't great. Easy work environment for everyone.  hardest part of the job is dealing with guests
good,This job is perfect for those right out of college with no experience. If you have a family this position has no work life balance. The pay is great at first but after 2 years the pay becomes less appealing.
good,I worked at Target as a packer and a stocker. I packed and stocked freight throughout the warehouse. The co-workers were very pleasant. The work environment was based on productivity and the workload was very fast-paced.
good,"I enjoyed my time at the company for the most part. My co-workers and the flexible schedule are the main reasons I stayed so long. Towards the end of my time at Target, the head of management, who was there at the time, made the working environment toxic to the point that every employee would feel uncomfortable when he was in the store."
good,I learned about organizing soft line products.
good,"s	Responsible for controlling all loss prevention and security issues and programs for 2 corporate  "
good,There aren't opportunity to advance unless someone leaves the store. Communication is lacking within the store and management. Management is not helpful or cooperative.
good,it was okay but the management showed clear signs of favoritism. they had a great work system going that was proficient. unfortunately good workers get taken advantage of by having to do extra work.
good,"A Typical day at work"
good,"Managing many retail leaders and workers. Conducting numerous roll outs with the company, and worked many, many hours. Good company, but it can be overwhelming often."
good,Well it is a good company but it depends the culture and management. From the start it was great but realize you seeing alot of favoritism and little clicks. It just feels like high school. You could see by how they talk and act to certain employees. Their expectation for TL Food is very unrealistic. Not enough hours to manage and balance routines to be completed. This is not all target stores but again the culture comes to play.
good,"The ability for a flexible schedule is one of the only good things about this place. The job is not that difficult to do but requires some effort and a lot of moving around, depending on what work area you are in. They always expect too much out of you. Pay is not great obviously. You are just a number to them."
good,"Easy place to work. Just stock, fast pace, and make sure you work in an organized manner. Management needs management classes or anger management, their pick. Cussing out new hires, talking down to team members instead of talking to them in a higher authority manner. Freaking out if they think they aren't going to finish the truck in enough time before opening."
good,Ok job to be temporary. Management was fair polite and approachable. Great experience. Nice people. Friendly environment. Fun job but expect to work hard.
good,"Stressful place to work. Not enough employees and high turn over rate. No paid time off, staff area was infested. Some management were great to work with, but they were over worked and under paid."
good,Most employees work hard. Management identifies future leadership well in most cases but takes too long to advance individuals. PAy is improving since I worked with Target which is a good thing.
good,When I was working for Target I was at the age of 17. ( my first job) Aside from being misused for my qualities I was displaying as leadership qualities I was simply to young to advance. Management at the time took that to there advantage by making me produce work I was not being accounted for.
good,"A typical work day had minimal downtime, there was always something to do and kept you very  much on your toes in order to keep everything running. Management did it's best but was always open to criticism though it is unclear whether or not much of that criticism was ever taken into account though the effort and keeping communcation open and stressfree was made."
good,As a team member the only real goal is to sell credit cards to customers. I provided great customer service and did my job well but my managers constantly told me to ask guest to apply for a credit card. I felt like it was hassling people when credit cards were mainly being used for purchase.
good,Depending who you work under makes all the business. Being promoted is a life sentence. If someone you don't like gets promoted above you there is no way for you to be away from their ABSOLUTE control unless promoted yourself and promotions are more than rare. being fired or demoted from a manager position is near impossible so whom ever your superiors are prey that they are decent.
good,"Target has a way of taking those looking or advancement, and shifting them around so that they continue to be the low man on the totem pole in every position.  Aside from management, no one has set or enough hours, and your concerns are often 'forgotten' within moments.  Every position that opens in the leadership team is filled from out of store, leaving those that know the store and job inside and out with no new opportunities."
good,they persist on scheduling me when i have class. I have had to give my shift up for the past 3 days. ( A schedule change was approved in advance of school starting again.) 
good,I started at target as a temporary worker and worked hard to get hired on as a full time employee. I was cross trained in two different departments and drove a fork lift and stock picker for 3 years.
good,"A typical work day would be a eight hour shift, normally only four team members are scheduled the opener, the morning mid, the afternoon mid and the closer. Depending on part of the day you were scheduled to work requires a different set of responsibilities. What I have learned were  numerous amount of recipes for making Starbucks beverages. I've also gained a lot more experience with customer service  because the customer's experience at Starbucks is very imperative to the corporation as well as Target. The workplace culture is very fast paced, formal because we all have certain rules to follow and dress codes to abide by. The culture is also centralized, our senior management makes all the decisions such as promotions, new drinks, set up of the store and discounts. The hardest part of the job is working on weekends,  because it can get very busy and most of the staff is scheduled that day and the area is very small. The most enjoyable day part of the job is interacting with guest when they gives me feedback letting me know it was great, or just having small talk and putting them in a good mood."
good,This place was pretty good to work at the atmosphere was nice but I think management could have been a little better. If you work at Target as a cashier be prepared to ask every single customer if they want to sign up for a credit card.
good,When you're a closer you do not get to leave at the time you're scheduled to leave. Once was scheduled to 10:30 didn't get the ok to leave till 1:30am
good,"Target is not a bad place to work, if you need a part time job while in school. It is not a job you can raise a family on unless you are a manager. The hours are not full time hours unless you work the over night shift and even then I don't think it's a full 40 unless you are a lead."
good,No benefits for the little guy. No hours unless it's the holiday season. There is a lot of favoritism that goes on. Most Co workers are friendly but most do a lot of sucking up.
good,"Target was great initially, but the consistently changing management  in addition to the changes being made to less experienced managers who wanted to shake things up made it impossible to keep up with the newest ""rules"" and systems."
good,"it was extremely stressful, I worked there for a while and people got promoted over me and I had to train them which made no sense why I wasn't promoted instead."
good,"The people I worked with were fantastic. At the time, I was also going to school an hour away. I had to fight constantly with management about working with my school schedule."
good,"Just like any other retail job, you'd get there early in the morning and throw the truck to get all the stuff off so you can take it out on the floor and stock it."
good,"Some very good times that were out weighed by lack of proper scheduling and bad communication of management to employees. All in all, a good summer job, not recommended for longer than a few months."
good,ok place to work at if your a college student and need part time job but wouldn't make it my career.  Its fast paced and you work short handed a lot of the time
good,It’s a great place to work but when you work through the holidays they will cut hours from 40 to 11 ! After you say something to you boss they cut them from 11 to 7! Sunday’s and holidays you get paid time and a half which is great and you get sick time! Just not right how they cut hours like gay though
good,Its a great company and store. The management wasn't always great and all negativity within the team. Always conflict with team members not liking each other.
good,Target really works with your weekly school schedule so that you can at least get a couple hours per day. Been here since my freshman year and I'm glad that I can work in the morning (before class) or in the evening (after class)
good,"I enjoyed working with my coworkers, I made some long term friendships while working there, but scheduling was impossible to fit with your needs, and they say they are flexible, but are not willing to work with you. I had an emergency  come up, and needed some time off, I was denied. I needed to work certain hours, and I was constantly scheduled for the hours I could not work, even after requesting them, and was told that I needed to find someone to cover, and if I could not, then it was my responsibility to cover them. Just impossible! I did not feel as though my work was appreciated, and always tried to go above and beyond my position responsibilities."
good,Working nights you  literally clean up the softlines areas and put away abandons. The management is hard as this is a training store.The hardest part of my job is rude people.The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I come in contact with and feel like I have accomplished something.
good,Hardest part of the job was management always watching you and stuffing the red card down your throat and push guests to enroll in the red card program. The most enjoyable was talking to some of the guests and the discount.;
good,"The company needs management improvement on how to treat subordinates and provide better training to them.  "
good,"This job is pretty relaxed and a cool place to work. Management has lack of communication with the crew, and some tend to look down on people. If the management staff had personality then it will be a great place to work."
good,"They get you with the high starting salary, but you end up working 12 hours days, 5 days a week and can never shut off when you leave the store. Management is not mindful of your time."
good,"Experienced to work in a large departmental store. Served customers with choices for different products in a single store.."
good,Logistics especially flow is a very stressful position at target stores. What I like least is the early hours. It makes for a poor work life balance and effects my family greatly after 2 years with no advance or schedule change.
good,A job is a job. I need work at this moment and I pray my pass occupations influence my obligation in the right way.i'm a hard worker and an people pleasure
good,"Have to be a fan of Red,  uniform is required at all times. Busy and loud place. Different choices of eats, that was my favorite part Pizza Hut and Starbucks is included in this business. You will find everything you need."
good,Stressful work environment. If you want a place where the management does not care about the part time employees then this is a job for you. Nothing too exciting about working there.
good,Management really not fair. Never give you and opportunity to grow within the company. Give seasonal employees more hours. You train the employees and you don't get any credit for your work. You request time off or availability change management looks over you. They try to tell you what to say and do if Corporations office is coming in for a visit. No friendly at all very racist.
good,"High volume package handling and stock rotation is part of the work day. Overall the hours are varying, and can be very different from one store to another and the pay rate is often different for the same post. In some places an unsocial hours payment is $3-00 an hour but in others it drops to 1-00. ALWAYS check especially if you transfer in form one store to another, particularly if crossing a state line to do so."
good,"Honestly, Target isn't a horrible place to work. This is mostly because of the people you work with."
good,Long hours standing. Managers push you to sell red cards and it is an important aspect of your job. Often you get coached if you do not meet expectations.
good,The Company is not the issue it is the lack of mobility and the lack of leadership from the Senior Level and up. Your typical day is non-stop which makes the day go by quickly. Performance matters at a Team Member level but at the Operations Manager position you are not judged on performance but rather on how much face time you can get with the Senior team.
good,"An easy job. Management at the store level is terrible. Lower management TLs, SRTLs, GSAs are young adults with no other work experience and they do not how to manage people and they turn into little tyrants. They are protected by ETLs and the STL. They literally get away from bloody murder. You do meet some great people at Target. The pay is better than other retailers. They provide refreshments around holidays or sometimes on Saturdays. This job is great for students, retired folks and for stay at home parents. You can definitely work your way up and if you have a degree it can open doors for you to be an ETL, STL, and/or more. you have to kiss a lot of (you know what). Quick lunch (30 mins) Team member discount could be better (its currently 10%)...I heard from a older TM that the discount in the 90s was 30% (I haven't been able to confirm). You get an addition 25% off C9/Joy Lab athetlic clothing and PFresh foods (fruit, veggies, etc). Benefits are great if you're full time or management. Some of the ""Guests"" are complete sociopathic nightmares but most are very nice. Management is all about making guests happy, it doesn't matter if they are wrong or belittling a TM."
good,"I like the culture at Target, the people are great as well as the managment but often times the work slows down and they cut people early in the day. I need something more steady."
good,"Too much is expected of too few people.  It starts dayside where they don't have enough cashiers.  Target hates having guests wait for a long time at the registers so they walkie someone from the floor up to help as cashier.  The problem is that this happens countless times per day and the employees on the floor aren't getting tasks done.   Products don't get pulled out of the backroom and/or aren't placed correctly on the floor.  Backstock and random stuff gets piled up in the backroom which makes it harder for backroom team members to do their job. "
good,"Target is an amazing company with many opportunities, however the hiring managers and human resource department are very unfair and biased. They have preferences opposed to looking for qualified people that are able to work. The main human resource person, whose name is Caroline is the worst of them all."
good,"Is Easy a to Learn the skills in target Stores If Or when working there. "
good,Great co-workers. Treat each guest like you want to be treated.  The job gets stressful but you work as a team. We have great guests.  I have learned to listen to what the guest wants.  The hardest part of the job is when equipment/scanners do not work. The most enjoyable part of the job is when a guest recognize your hard work.
good,goals are set but usually cannot be met due to more tasks to complete with too few employees to complete tasks when desired. Management seems indifferent to our needs and complaints.
good,"I helped the remodeling crew at the Carrollton, Texas Target. We worked night shift. The work was even paced. Because it was night some of my co-workers were really grouchy at times. It was only temporary so I easily put up with it."
good,"Management for the most part is ok, and the people who work there are fun, but overall they don't give you any warning signs whether you're doing well or bad, and they fire you completely out of the blue when you yourself have not given any criticism."
good,Very stressful environment to work 12hrs in and the management did a very poor job  all they ever cared about was rate even if you where hitting rate they want you to get more but never said you where doing good just get faster be faster rate rate rate
good,My overall experience was okay. Working at target is great if you are a young student getting by or if you are in need of a second or part-time job. However I did make friends.
good,"With TV, online, weekly advertisements changing constantly, it is hard to keep up with discounts and what is offered on sale on a daily basis."
good,"General duties include customer service, stocking, backroom duties, cashiering, and zoning shelves. Employees were very nice and helpful. Management was efficient."
good,Target was well relaxed not so hard the hours was ok when they never switched them up. Great benefits. It was far from where I was stay but it came together after having my daughter.
good,It was a good job while I was in high school.  They had flexible hours and part time options for a student.  Part time employees do not get time off but they are part time so.
good,Work place was fast paced but never enough help. The supervisors only care about numbers. And some works lack off when not supervised  other then that it was good
good,It’s a fast paced constantly on your feet place to work.  You need to keep up or they will reprimand you and or let you go .you work with a partner and if they don’t keep up you stil get in trouble
good,"Everyday is doing the job of 5 people and expected to get it done before you leave and if not expect to be talked to on why it is not done and you can't say that its because you are by yourself. The only up part is most of the people you work with and a couple of managers, but for the most part everyone will throw you under a bus as fast as possible."
good,Constantly promised advancement opportunities that did not occur. Worked numerous stores including much drive time with very little notice. Overtime was good. raises were nonexistent and promotions were never what was promised
good,"Target is a great place to work in terms of flexible scheduling, laid back environment, and ability to be promoted. The only issue I had when I first started was a lack of communication between managers and employees. There was also a lack of training. . . to me it felt like they just throw you in the deep end and you either sink or swim."
good,"I mainly worked on the sales floor but it was pretty quiet, it seemed like a lot of employees were show offs or seemed like they were in competition with eachother and it made it awkward when working with those people. But other than that everything was alright for the most part. Managers kept getting my name wrong and didn’t seem to care. When I came into work sometimes they didn’t have me assigned anywhere and I had to walk around looking for a manager to ask them for my instructions for the day."
good,"Management staff hovered over your shoulder all of the time, direct supervisor was not fit for the job, worked there for 31/2 to 4 years and new hire were making more then me."
good,"Work was quick paced and hard but very rewarding. Upper Management was poorly chosen and lacked drive in the last store I was in. Prior managers were professional and worked as a team so it is hit and miss. Target as a company is ran well, but with all retail has room for improvement."
good,"Faced paced environment, long hours, difficult to interact with coworkers. Management is decent and they are willing somewhat work around school schedules."
good,Overall target is a great place to work especially if it's your first job. They work around your availability and you can pick up shifts whenever you need or want to.
good,"A typical day for me was stocking shelves with merchandise in the mornings and checking freshness of products throughout the day. Setting up sale items according to planagrams and initiating sales on items with short shelf lives. Also, a lot of time was spent maintaining accurate inventories and clean work and public areas. Management was young and often had no experience in the areas they were responsible for. For the most part, they were pretty high-strung but were good about not micromanaging. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet unrealistic time expectations to perform tasks by management. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people who worked hard but provided a fun working environment."
good,"Heavy workloads for low compensation."
good,"No full-time hours were given to us, everybody is only part-time. The company doesn't know how to take good care of their loyal workers. They over worked you sometimes."
good,"Target did not assure ones worthy of relocation, a position. No matter how hard you work and how much time put in you still may not be able to hold a position or relocate to another store."
good,"Recognition for job execution is minimal. Career advancement is nearly impossible, its all about how much someone likes you. Effort put into work is not properly rewarded through career advancement. Thinking outside the box is not rewarded."
good,A typical work day would be come in and go to my assigned area which would be women's  clothing. Greet the guess and proceed to organize women's clothing by putting things backing into their right location.
good,"The company is a great place to work for if you are hired on full time, but as a seasonal, the pay is not that great, and your co-workers make you feel less."
good,"This was my first job, so this review will be through the eyes of someone with no comparable job experience. A typical day of work on the sales floor includes checking which area the LOD put you in that day and going up to guest service to empty the full go-back bins for that area. If you're unlucky, you'll deal with unreasonable LOD's and rude customers. Your coworkers and you will probably share the same mentality and when things become overwhelming they are the people you can lean on. I say they're the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part is when guests leave items from others zones on random shelves in your area, or worse, just throw everything on the floor, and you leave in twenty minutes."
good,"I have worked for two General Managers, and will say that it all depends upon what their expectations are of you and how involved they choose to be in your work center and day to day functions."
good,"My experience with the company was short lived, however I was challenged daily with executing the weekly goals with my staff. I managed about 20 people and working with people from various age groups taught me about respect very quick. It did not matter what store you were assigned to, presentation and stocked merchandise were always top issues. As an employee, you received a discount and being in a management position, the salary was surprisingly large, compared to other companies."
good,didnt like it but it was something to do for the time being. I wasnt treated like i was part of the family. I busted my butt off for the position and did what i needed to do and safety
good,"No real major pros or cons to mention, it's just a basic retail job. You get good customers and bad customers. Management performs their job exactly up to the point they are paid to do it. Hours are unreliable"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of ringing items through cash, stocking and facing aisles and keeping lane tidy. Management was ok. Hardest part of the job was working in a ""high school like"" environment and the most enjoyable part was helping the customers with everything and anything needed."
good,"I stock shelves with product that comes off of the truck. They require us to get the whole truck stock on the shelves in 5 hours. no way can we do that since our trucks are 2500 pieces "
good,Good team to work with. But no good benefits or time off. Hard to get time off. Jobs are demanding and physical. Good place for younger first job hunters.
good,"I worked here for about a year and the staff now is completely different from who I worked with a year ago. It is poorly managed, and management is very shady. You would think that it would be a fun place to work, but it's not. You have to stay out so late when closing, also they make you do more than what is given to you in your job description."
good,"Fast paced and stressful work environment. Senior team lead at my store was not too trustworthy and played favorites. Overall, Target was not a super bad experience but I would definitely not like to work there again,"
good,"Target is a good starter job. It's a decent place, pretty good people. There was a click for a while, but it solved itself. Pretty high turn over rate. If a "" team leader"" can't whoop the team into shape they get ""fired""I couldn't handle being there any longer, but I also only worked 15hrs a week, requiring a second job. They went through 5 team leaders while I was there."
good,"While working at target the experience was average at best. The faculty was friendly in general, however i felt they provided me little to know help. I was provided mediocre training which resulted in multiple errors and the reason i believed i was dismissed"
good,"Target is the typical big box Corporation, there's very little chance for advancement, very little pay.  Only some employees receive benefits management is not really involved in many processes."
good,"Learned communication and phone skills"
good,target is a good place for part time . they dont be good they treat you like slaves if you aint cool with the higher ups . if you become a team lead you golden its cake
good,I loved working at Target because of my fun co worker. And the fact that I was able to get cross trained in almost all areas of the store. Down side was the low pay and not a steady schedule. We would work 50 hours during holiday season and then it would drop down to 10 hours per week in January
good,Target works really well with scheduling. Whether it be for school and your availability or with a sudden death in the family and you need time off. They do well with moving things around to help you out.
good,"Worked there a long time ago, but it was fun and got to meet a lot of good people there.  Pay never enough there, couldn't advance, other than that, it was just a fun place to work."
good,"We basically just keep getting more and more tasks piled on our plates and less and less hours to complete them in. The team leaders are told not to do any work, but they're the only ones getting any hours so basically what little payroll the store has to work with is wasted on useless team leads who aren't helping with any of the tasks. Also at my store, at least 6 or 7 people have been fired in the past couple months for stupid reasons like swearing while off the clock in the break room (even though the team leads swear all the time while they're on the clock)"
good,"When I worked there, it seemed there were more managers than employees. Needed more support during peak hours, especially when it's a big store and you're the only one on the sales floor."
good,Offers a quick paced atmosphere with plenty of cross training in many areas.  Great experience for first time workers.  No possibility for career advancement within a reasonable amount of time.
good,"Very tough place to work, very numbers/performance related.  Hours are tough, very hot during the summer, cold during the winter, mandatory overtime during the most important family times of the year (summer months, holidays)"
good,"Each day is the same fill floor with freight use the teams you have to drive sales, offer great guest service. I've learned to be flexible and embrace change.  Management is there to run a business not always be your friend so work is always most important, culture is fast and can be fun depending on store leader. Most enjoyable part of the job are all the people I've worked with over the years, things change but they don't."
good,"Great place to work if your going to school or for your first job. "
good,"Target is a great job for college students. I found that they were willing to accommodate my school schedule. As a cashier, I was pressured to get Red Cards. This made my experience very stressful and management played favorites. You could tell that they would base the cashier hours on how many Red Cards you got. I probably would of liked it better if I worked in a different department."
good,I didn't like that they weren't in a constant order when you had to put items away and they had their carts in peoples way or just in the middle of the aisle and just wasn't really clean or up to date on things like computers or their handheld devices or anything else like that.
good,The fist couple of months can be really fun but as soon as you get comfortable you get more hours and thats good and all but igmf someone calls for their job you have to do if you are in hardlines or in softlines. I cant say if all the team leads are like this but some of then take forever to help a guest if they cant help them they just guve then to you.
good,"Everyday has a production plan that can be met by most employees productively. The one thing I can say that I learned by working at Target Distribution is that ""CHANGE"" is constant. I enjoyed working with all the people at Target."
good,Target is an okay job. It does have its problems but throughout everything it's the most engaging job ever. I love the people I work with. The team leads make the job fun.
good,The store was fun and I learned a lot about how to work my own department and be responsible for it looking presentable and still helping customers effectively.
good,"Working for Target can be stressful, not because of customers but because of management. Management puts all the work on the employee if a team leader is gone even if they are not trained. Management expects that you learned everything that you needed to learn with only 1 day of training, i would say thats the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the coworkers. If you want to work for Target, be ready to do more work then what they pay you."
good,Target is a very scattered environment. People are friendly but do slack a lot. Nobody acts like they want to be there and the environment is very unprofessional feeling.
good,Job is very fast paced. Management does not communicate with each other. So you end up doing twice the work or undoing work you have already done. As long as you do your job the bosses are nice.
good,It varies by DC location but in general those who over-see your job functions have no understanding of those functions. Good pay and benefits however.
good,"Fun place to work. I've met a lot of new and friendly faces while at Target. The only issue while I was here was the fact that the pay was very low, and they weren't very keen on giving decent hours. I started as a full time associate but quikly dropped to part time. The managers that were there at the time were very rude and apathetic to their employees. Would still recommend simply because I know a lot has changed since I left. It may be much better"
good,to but the product out on the shelves what i learned was how to work with the other workers to get the job done some of the management was great to work with
good,I learned to ask more questions when you don't understand something and I also learned how to give great service quickly. Management was difficult because they didn't understand my importance of school. Overall the workplace was great. Each team member was willing and able to help me or would find someone who could help me. The hardest part of the job was understanding how to communicate to my manager about school priorities. Most enjoyable part of the job was all the families I met while working in soft-lines
good,"job was fun & fair when i first started but then management changed causing the team leads to become rude and unforgiving. new time to unload the truck came in making which was fine, but the timer was started five to ten minutes before the unload started so when we were five to ten minutes behind we would get in trouble. stockers  were lazy so it made my job harder. i would also get in trouble if i tried to leave when scheduled if there was any cardboard left."
good,Moral and communication between management and team members to improve productivity needs improvement. Scheduling of allocated hours is not done by productivity levels or exceeding timelines but by social status?
good,"Great place to develop retail career, if you are under the age of 35.  Once you hit a certain age, you have reached your ceiling.  Target loves to develop young talent, but does not retain seasoned leadership."
good,Target is a good company to get your foot in the door at a corporate job. The management at each location are what make or break the store. Some locations allow you to prove yourself and grow within the company while some stores trap you forever.
good,My co-workers are absolutely amazing people. Very fun to be around and we have each others back. I would like my job more if I got more hours and management was caring.
good,"Some days are better than others. One day we have the right amount of employees on the floor for work given, other days the ratio is 1:4. The 10% discount is pretty reasonable, the pay is okay."
good,"I was hired as seasonal Christmas employee, so my time there was very short. Compared to my other jobs, working at Target seemed rather bland.Idid not like working in the photo lab."
good,The HR team lead made it hard for everyone to get a good schedule. I had to fight to get my religious days off and bring it up to the store lead. other than that every other lead was easy to get along with.
good,"Management is not clear when the hire you that their ""main priority"" is selling credit cards daily. This is not something they promote or tell you is important till your second day. Even if costumers give your praise, or they or told personally you are a wonderful, fast and efficient employee, that doesn't matter if you are not selling credit cards every day. Which you can be let go, for lack of sales. What I liked most of working here was the variety of people I met, and assisted. Though it is a brief encounter, there was much that I learned and/or was able to share with the customers."
good,"It's a good place to work for if you can handle the pressure and demands of the job. Benefits are good, hours are flexible and they pay pretty well on average."
good,Overall managers were not attentive and seemed noticeably new to their jobs but as far as the environment I worked in it was a very nice place of employment.
good,You get %10 discount. The pay is low. You work hard but It's lonely. Some times you get help. The coworkers are nice. The turnover is high. Its farther away.
good,"Target in College Point was nice... at first. When I first started working there, I learned and did my job as told. Quite easy. It helped me gain time management skills. Later on, my team leaders started treating my unfairly for things like the way I walked other things."
good,I worked at Target Upland and It was the best place to work. Although I was promised promotion after promotion with them and I have seen that a lot of targets do this. I was given an opportunity to promote at another location. I took the promotion. I was placed at Target Ontario. If I knew how horrible that would have been I would have stayed in my entry position. Target is an amazing company but management is horrible at almost every location. period point blank they just don't care.
good,"Decent workplace, work is fairly easy. Management can be very lenient and understanding. I left Target in search of a work environment with better pay"
good,Fast paced work that will have you on your feet. Retail jobs like this one are decent enough. The pay isn't to good and there are hardly any opportunities for overtime.
good,"too much pressure for a simple and easy job. gave me just under 40 hours a week so that i could not receive full time benefits. not the best job, coworkers made it worth it"
good,A typical day at work consisted of I working the customer service counter/cashier.  I would handle all returns and customer issues/concerns.  Management was awesome and very good and answering my questions.  Work place culture was very versatile and pleasant.  Hardest part of the job was working odd hours of the day and spent little time with my family.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to learn and meet new people on a daily basis.
good,"It was OK, leads ask you do to everything while they just walk around the store talking to each other, rarely ever helping. (most of them) You don't get paid enough for the work you will do."
good,"I was working during the transition from Radioshack SCK to Brightstar, and at least at that time the job was a good starting point, but was definitely long term. it was a standard retail sales job, but of course the commission structure was extremely flawed. At that time it was a requirement to sell a certain amount of phones per day, per week. So even if you sold 10 phones in one day, if you also didn't sell at least 5 every other day of the week then you received no compensation"
good,"its not a bad job at all just not something you would wanna do forever , every two weeks and if you don't have another job it may be hard to live from one week to another without money problems"
good,Over all the other coworkers were a joy to work for but the management felt very out of touch with what was happening on the sales floor or front end and would often berate you for not meeting the constant changing and often impossible to meet goals.  The front end was constantly under staffed meaning the sales floor team would have to come for backup which put them behind on their work. We were told to make things right for the guests by one manager and another would berate us for letting someone get away with a scam
good,"Target work force has changed, more concern for speed to get the truck unloaded.  Work pace has increased, allot more errors and injuries to employee's.  No more concern for neatness is stocking shelves-just get the truck done- no matter what.  Not a very friendly environment anymore."
good,Overall you are treated well. they have free lunch once in a while and recognize employees but they only hire young managers and pay them a lower rate instead of experience
good,"Too many chiefs and every supervisor says something different and it causes workers to get in trouble. Tell you not to hit your 5th hour but will force you to work up to 1 minute prior. Discount card is 10% off entire purchase but in order to use it, you have to have their bank card, their loyalty card attached to your bank card or cash, and if you purchase a gift card for your total in order to get your discount, you get in trouble."
good,"Overall this is an excellent company to work for however management does not know how to communicate, the store  has real safety issues such as security using other team members for shields"
good,"Overall, I enjoy working at Target.  I enjoy the 10% discount given to employees.  They are pretty flexible when it comes to hours.  It's a pretty cool place to work."
good,"The management is horrible, they pull you in the office for stupid things, even when you're still learning. It's easy to become eligible to be a team leader, but actually getting a position is nearly impossible. I had four interviews in a year and I'm still in the same place. I get told on a weekly basis that I'm not doing a good job at something I've been doing for 2 months and wasn't really trained on. Even after working for 4 years, they still doubt my abilities and think I can't finish on time. I have about 3 team leaders out of 12 that I can actually trust and rely on, and those 3, aren't my leads."
good,"Minimal training requirements, strict adherence to state and federal laws, great employee discounts, long advancement wait times,  company card solicitation requirements outway good work efforts and slows employee advancement."
good,"An ok place to work while going to school, not so ok if a weirdo guy harasses you and management offers to transfer you. Didn't like how management handled situations. No vacation time was earned only pto, which only occurred after being employed for a year."
good,Its not the best job and not the worst either. if you want a lot of hours i recommend working here. its an easy environment aside from holidays and weekends.
good,"It seems like Target tries to pay its employees the bare minimum and only gives raises in increments of 25-50 cents per year. I am a student and don't plan to work at Target after graduation, so it doesn't matter much to me, but I have talked to the other people who have worked there for longer and they say the raises are tiny and that there is little opportunity for advancement. On the bright side, the company really tries to make its workers feel special and provides snacks in the break room as well as movies and games. Sometimes, if we do exceptionally well during our shift, the managers will even requisition items from the sales floor for the employees, such as food, clothing, Starbucks items, or DVDs to take home!"
good,"Treat employees like androids, ask for the impossible. They take advantage of their status. The obvious use of favoritism, certain people get to choose where they want to work, and get the best hours."
good,Typical day includes balancing/accommodating to a horrendously written schedule made by upper management and then being made to coordinate breaks and tasking in non-ideal or sometimes possible conditions because of call-outs and non-responsive team members.
good,Definitely keeps you on your toes. Expect to constantly be moving from one end of the store to the other. Be prepared to be called upon at any moment to drop what you're doing to help out. The employee savings combined with a redcard can save you a good amount. Main issue was scheduling around school schedule despite having promised to do so upon hiring. Job position requires you to only work the same time slot each day. No changes or exceptions.
good,"Target is headed in the right direction.  Top heavy on Sr. Managers and Directors. Not much room for growth currently. If you are looking for an entry level/associate level exempt role, the competition will be heavy."
good,I love working with my co-workers; however the work expectations are unrealistic. You either are too pushy with the reward services or don't give enough information in the time given.
good,"like making new friends and work area. nice breaks and lunch for a first time job for summer and spring break, last day out of school job. great way to learn about logistics."
good,"most people were nice, some lazy. due to people calling in they would ask me to stay later every day which is annoying and I would often be doing the jobs of 2 people"
good,"its a place to work for a short time, hours and management is a ridiculous  show. no opportunity to grow........................................................"
good,"I think Target turned out to be an okay place to work if needing a change of pace from the usual store of the same similarity, staffing was done very poorly but otherwise thought it was okay due to size of store"
good,Lot of miscommunication or lack of. promises of promotions and help that never occured. People were quiting left and right due to the disrespect from management.
good,"This job is great if you're in high school or college trying to make extra money. It is not a job that promotes from within. Team members would be passed for promotion, even with experience and a degree to someone outside the company. They don't want to promote someone who is ""friends"" with other team members because they believe their leadership will be compromised. Only apply if you want a ETL position, if you start as a team member, the highest you will go is Team Lead."
good,"This being my first job it was ok, but you had to work like 5hrs just for a 15 minute break, also being a shy person when lines would get busy you had to yell so customers would know that your line was open and that just the kind of person I was so that made it awkward."
good,"Overall a pretty boring job. Just stock shelves and deal with customers. The people that work there are very nice and easy to work with, however the managers take the job too seriously and treat it like its a corporate office or workplace. There is no promotions or advancement available."
good,"They have you set an availability and don't even care. They take advantage of your hard work, felt unappreciated the whole time. Worked for two years and only got a 12 cent raise. On sick days I would call out hours ahead and they still had the audacity to ask if I can come in later and when I would say no they would get mad and the next time I would come in they would talk to me about my attendance and how I shouldn't have to call out. (but was still sick)"
good,"If you do your job well and come to work with a good attitude, you'll probably be fine. If you are ok with asking everyone if they'd like to apply for the Target Redcard, that will come in handy because they basically beat it into you and get mad if you forget to ask one person. "
good,"I worked as a seasonal cashier during the holidays and received decent hours and good pay.  However, management was unorganized and hard to deal with."
good,"The leads are very unprofessional, you have to be friends with them in order to advance, too much drug use going on with the employees. I would start the day getting the tills ready for the cashiers, process advances on all tills, see to the overall day of running the front end of the store."
good,"I loved it when I first began because of the manager I started with & then she left. Went downhill from there, was not treated with care or  given the feeling of being appreciated."
good,"Like I had mentioned it is at least an occupational job that is somewhat okay descent and at least it pays , if you know what I mean. Also as well the hours aren't that bad either."
good,"Fast, Fun and Friendly...."
good,"Pretty easy going in the morning but during afternoon its really busy, many times I had to deal with 5/6 customers alone back to back. Working in electronics they ask quite a lot for one person so its great if you can be in two places at once"
good,Given too little time to complete a task. Get scheduled even when you have unavailable on the schedule. Some team leads have favorites and are rude to their workers. Some are very nice and welcoming its a hit and miss. Some of your coworkers become like a second family.
good,They are all serlfish and ungrateful and all about the.money no helping the employee out I had lots of co workers who quit because the job was way to stressful
good,The job itself is fine but there was some annoying things. I had to try and sell these credit cards to people who were in line at the cashier. If I didn't sell enough of these  I would get chastised. But most people in line just wanted to get out of the line and go to their car. I didn't have a whole lot of breaks. I worked late hours.
good,Target has a friendly work environment and a very productive staff. Scheduling can sometimes be an issue especially if you are a college student and need to work around classes.
good,When I first started I enjoyed being there the hours were steady hours but when the holidays came around hours went hectic I was suddenly working 6 days sometimes 7 closing every night and sometimes back to back shifts (closing and opening) they weren't flexible with scheduling no matter what the situation was . We were losing team members and they weren't being replaced causing more strain on the remaining team members I worked in every department except pharamacy and cafe and never received any advancement offers or raise for being cross trained. I interviewed for open positions within the company never heard anything back. Eventyually hours were cut and cut again my hours got so low I was forced to resign.
good,Although this opportunity was seasonal it was great. I was a little disappointed I wasn't able to stay on full time. The co-workers were great to work with and management was reasonable.
good,"I used to work as a Price Accuracy team member and back up cashier.  My training consisted of two days for pricing at another store and only about 2 hours for cashiering.  "
good,this place is good if you are in college since it is only 3-4 days a week.  But the job claims to be full-time despite having to do overtime to reach 40 hours and no benefits
good,"Would have to be at Target by 4AM-6AM depending on when you were scheduled. This was the first job that i was required to wake up that early, and after the first 2 months it started to interfere with school. I felt exhausted."
good,"I found it boring working there constantly, always trying to somehow occupy myself, even if is just tapping things, dancing every now and than but is a good experience for work for a start and helps you to learn about retail."
good,"Target corporation is an incredible company that values diversity in their employees. That is why I stayed as long as I did. They do not have a strict dresd code amd allow you to be, well you. Tattoos, piercings and all that makes you unique. "
good,There is almost no opportunity for advancement from an hourly employee to a salaried employee. The community feel you get while working there is good and they appreciate their team members.
good,"A yesteryear 'Good' company, which is trying to transform and find its place in this digital world with its old style of management & employees."
good,I learned how to deal with difficult people. I learned to deal with difficult situations. I learned to enjoy my job in every situation. I enjoyed interacting with different types of people.
good,"I been there for year and half, i enjoy the job and it easy. but lately to bad business decision the hours became so restrictive that i can go into work for two hours, that not worth my gas. Personally I dont see target have longevity if they dont start to change and not shy away from competition."
good,"A typical work day at work would be... you come in, get ready for your day and you will have someone drilling into your head all day about the red card which is the company's card. Not a big deal but I know my job. What i have learned is how to swindle people into getting this card and not focus on the the guest shopping experience which you are trained to do from the word go.I can't speak for all target management teams, but the one I worked for sucked."
good,"Target is a very employee oriented place, they believe in investing time on the team member's growth. The stores Target has are the amongst the best in the world."
good,I love clothes and am big into fashion so I thought this would be the perfect first job. No big mistake ...they pay bi weekly and it takes forever to become promoted.
good,With good management team have a good work life balance. Always a store near where you live so don't have to travel far for work. They are good at letting you take time off for vacation.
good,"Very chaotic everything is in a time limit"
good,If you are one of the good employees you are expected to work 5 times as hard and pick up everyone's slack. If they paid their employees what they deserved they wouldn't have as many problems keeping people.
good,"the associates that worked under me were my strangth, hardworking, sweet and very determined to make the day a great and productive time there at target, "
good,"regardless of what is stated in reference to the matter at hand, one must feel the burdens of overcompensation. Over compensation that refers specifically to how one is subjected to dictation"
good,"Target was a good place to learn discipline and how to work hard, mainly as a slave as they work you very hard and you get little to no recognition. Management alot of times is not helpful and more encouraging than wanting you to grow and move up. they like their grunts and would rather you stay there than move up."
good,"I love my co workers but the management was very disorganized . Because it is retail the hours vary , Human Resources aren't very helpul , they actually forget everything."
good,"Good place , good people , good environment , but the pay isn't all of what it seems . There alot about target that needs to be fixed but that's not for me to decide ."
good,"I was with the Target Corporation for several years, and while the International Corporation themselves is excellent, my location was not. Our store, specifically, had numerous suspicious firings, high turnover of employees who had been part of the team for years, and new management that fostered a far more unpredictable atmosphere. It was very difficult to thrive there, both as an individual and as a team leader; it was equally as difficult to inspire a team to success."
good,Many of the employees are not very welcoming but this has little to do with how the company deals with overall business. A corrupt supervisor used to work here but was eventually fired for taking advantage of his powers. I respect the fact that Target was able to deal with this situation accordingly.
good,"This job gave me experience in how to talk to people in person. Also, I learned how to use a scanner for finding and putting back products. This was the first time I worked in retail environment during busy holidays."
good,target was my first real job and it sucked at first getting used to working. but then I got used to it and warmed up to my co workers and it was okay for a while. my co workers were great but after Christmas our hours dropped a lot and I was having trouble paying the bills even with a couple roommates. but over all my time at target was good
good,"I like working at Target for the most part, minus celling their red cards and the drive was horrid. I probably would never go back because people their are weird."
good,"I was a cashier/returns.  The part I hated the most was having to go gather carts at midnight when it was sleeting and freezing.  Management was ok, no issues."
good,"Work consist of various things such as using the cash register, assisting guest, stocking and zoning merchandise. Most stores serve hot food and beverages as well."
good,"You will be on your feet all shift, and you will be constantly busy. You have to deal with a lot of rude people so be ready. You get good breaks, but horrible employee discount. Also, you constantly have to annoy customers to sign up for a target red card. If you are a cashier who is closing you will be required to stay to level the whole store, so expect to work until 1am-2am even if you are supposed to get off at 10pm-11pm."
good,Was just overall terrible. Management and work environment. They kept hiring new people and letting old ones go. And could give a straight answer as to why.
good,You'll have to experience and make your own opinion on this job. Everybody's will be a little different. When you do just keep it to yourself and do what you have to do.
good,"I will suggest this to those who do not have any experience working. This can be a good place to start. You can be a sales associate, cashier, work in Starbucks or cafe, trainer, or if you are not the sociable type, you can do backroom jobs, you can also be a visual merchandiser."
good,if the management was much better then i would have still been ther e because the job was fast paced and productive you never had a boring or dull day and it kept me on my feet daily
good,"I enjoy most of the management at Target, my job as Cart Attendant is easy, I'm able to meet the deadlines given to me by the company, and they're easy to get along with.  With that being said, it doesn't pay enough."
good,The company overall great they just need to work on the management. Also work on recognizing team members who do outstanding jobs.
good,"I do not mind the work, but your work always depends on how much the teams around you get done.  You constantly have to pick up the extra slack from others.  "
good,"Like most jobs in capitalist America, a lot is expected of the worker but not much benefit is received. No thank you's, no compensation, no days off, no extra pay."
good,"Target makes things very stressful. The workers are wonderful."
good,Very little opportunities for growth within the company. No chance for full-time employment so this is a good second job for someone or some one in school.
good,"If you have quality store management, then your experience may be good. STL and ETLs treat team members like slaves. ETLs come into position with little or no knowledge of retail, but must at like ""know it alls"". Truly a soul crushing experience."
good,Its a good job for someone who wants to attend college as they have flexible schedules. Its also a good job for first time management workers that want to grow with the company.
good,"Over all, target is fun to work at if you don't plan on doing anything serious with your life, but they suck at ""working with you"" if you are in school trying to do something real with your life. Very stressful during the holidays, they don't appreciate their employees AT ALL. They teach you how to do something one time and except you to remember the next time your on your own. So I taught my self to how to do guest services, soft lines, and some managing with the cashiers. They took advantage of me, because i knew how to manage these areas of the store. I was let go because of an unfair call off warning & because the manager who let me go, didn't like me and i didnt like her. She was rude and didn't know how to talk to guest & employees with respect & humility. There has been MANY complains about her from employees and guests, yet she still works there. They did me a favor letting me go, tho. Got to focus on my school exam & state exam. Working at a better place now earn a real amount of money."
good,"The management do not allow any advancement at all and tell you well that's too bad, we have no more room, we can't just put you there.  Once you take a position for the job there they will never allow you to be in another position.  For instance if you're a cashier, you will never be able to work floor or electronics or back room.  The only positive is they give a raise every year of anything from 5 cents to 25 cents."
good,"good experience. poor upper management good pay for some and good growth. lots of politics, great co-workers. everyone work very hard to earn pay. little recognition"
good,It was a nice place to work but it was not for me. I had no benefits because I was part time there... My co-workers were ok and we had fun working together.
good,"Too much yelling in front of guests, wants the employees to do work that the team leader would not do. There is favoritism, team leaders take longer lunch breaks when they have the same time as the associates."
good,There is a lot of tenure with people working there and a lower turnover rate. There continues to be budget cuts every year that make it difficult to do your job. Everyone is very nice and friendly but there isn't a lot of advancement opportunities.
good,"Retail isn't for everyone. If you are the type of person that do not mind missing holidays, weekends then this is the career for you. There were very specific issues I had with with my store but I'm sure its not the same in all stores."
good,The job was fine I was just unhappy with the working hours and management was unwilling or unable to ensure the hours that were specified on application.
good,Only for people looking for seasonal or part time work.scheduling is EXTREMELY flexible and benifits are only available for full time positions which are few and far between.
good,"they are a very excepting company! will work with schedules so you can go to school or work multiple jobs. High turnover rate, young employees."
good,"I loved being a barista, but in the three month I worked there my schedule and the times they had me working in the system where wrong 50% of the time. If I had a sift on my schedule from 4pm-10pm it wold be put in the system as 10am-4pm it happened way more then it should have."
good,I liked how they had alot of morals and believed in certain beliefs such as integrity etc. There were room for growth and the customers were really nice and patient.
good,"fast pace environment"
good,"I dont know if is my store. But there's zero recognition from management. There's no advancement besides getting cross trained. We work hard and get expire food as compensation for our work. Again, may be my just my Target. Good friendships."
good,"While there were a lot of positives working at Target, there were some very difficult job culture challenges. A typical day at work was I would go in and be expected to know what I was suppose to do. If I didn't I would ask a manager and maybe get told an exact answer. I learned that working as a team was a big help in a workplace such as Target. Without the help of others there was no way I could have gotten everything done. Management wasn't the best. They didn't like to help out nor did they feel it was necessary. Sometimes they would, but it was mostly when higher management was in the store. They also weren't very good at discipline when someone may have needed it. Instead they would find ways around it or blame someone else. Co-workers came and went pretty often but, the ones that stayed were great at helping and working together. The hardest part about working at Target was trying to get along with the managers. No matter how hard you tried to please them nothing was good enough and you were just another small person who they didn't really care to associate with. The most enjoyable part though was helping the customers with what they needed. Because seeing someone smile because you helped them find what they've been looking for or someone leaving happy was the highlight of my day!"
good,This was a part time job. It worked well while I was attending school. It consisted of warehouse type duties as a primary backroom employee. This consisted of organization and inventory of the backroom along with hourly replenishment pulls.
good,"It was a bittersweet experience for me. Mainly due to the fact that I was a cart attendant for 4/5 years I worked there. I recommend it to anyone who wants to move forward, it took me 4 years to be an official full-time electronics team member but it was worth it."
good,"Assist customers throughuot the store, daily clean up after the store is closed.The most enjoyable part of the job was the laided back atmosphere. I learned that customer service is very important to a businesses sucess."
good,Target was my first job and I liked it at first but after so long of being there it was hard to switch positions and kind of boring as well. Doing the same thing is not what I liked.  I like moving around at a job
good,A very friendly management team but what they ask of the associates keeps changing.  While on one hand management is committed to upholding company standards they are not against ignoring these rules while it becomes inconvenient.  What they ask from there associates also differ for each person; while one associate had to follow the rules to the letter but another didn't have too.
good,"The managers were always absent when needed and the associates were ill mannered, but always gave impossible goals that over worked us. This would probably explain the ill manners. I learned how to operate a cash register and drift shopping carts. The most enjoyable part of the job was leaving."
good,I am currently looking for new employment due to various problems I have found working with Target and their management style
good,"hours vary constantly, No reliable health benefits unless you are upper management, can be a fun environment , good for high school student or college age."
good,"Love the people I work with and the overall experience. Very fast paced job while cashiering, and fun interacting with guests. When I was going to school and playing sports they were very flexible with my hours. However communication between management and team members can be pretty difficult."
good,"I enjoyed being with co-workers. Management was well educated, but lacked communication skills. I developed safety and product skills.  The job required interaction with company staff, general public and law enforcement."
good,"I worked at target temporarily while I was home from college. After I put in my two weeks notice, I noticed a change in treatment from one of my bosses. I asked for a personal day because a family emergency and I was told I would be placed on the non-rehire list. I did not know Target would be that insensitive. On another note, this was my first retail job and I was not used to standing on my feet for long periods of time. Please keep in mind that cashiers must talk to people the entire shift, whether you are feeling well or not, as well as stand up. I partly enjoyed working at Target only because of my co-workers, but other than that, it just wasn't the job for me."
good,I like working at target however the management is not well structured and they are only happy when team members get redcards.
good,"Originally was hired for electronics due to my expertise in gaming and computers, but due to over hiring was moved to an unrelated section."
good,I have been there going on four years and graduate in 9 weeks with my BSB and cant move up for the life of me because I do not suck up.
good,Ok company for begging level retail seeking employement. Must be looking to move up the management ladder to obtain serious wage
good,I worked threw my lunch & breaks at time cus we were so busy. It was horrible but I loved the store & the team members. I wish I can go back & see if eligible to work their but it's time to move on I was only a seasonal employee !! & they worked everyone off especially some women who worked their that were pregnant. Making them push carts of go backs & stock a buncha stuff in boxes. Not cool
good,Working at Target was fun. The hardest part of the job was working for Black Friday. We were in the store from sundown until the next morning.
good,Customer Service and interacting with the team members. The team members really needed someone who could identify with them.
good,"a typical work day should remain the same with following cleaning routines and preforming daily tasks. Hot and cold drinks should be prepared the same way and in good faith every time a customer orders a beverage. Greeting the guest with a smile and always offering a food item increases the sale, along with explaining any new promotional items that may be out at the time. maintaining work relationships and balance of possibly being alone for periods of time is often chaotic but manageable. The best part of the day is when you see a guest walk away with a smile on their face and the expression "" that is the best drink I ever had."""
good,"I enjoy going into work knowing everyone is ready to take on the challenge and working together as a unit. I have learned that everything has a schedule and any task that must be completed has to be done within a certain time. My co-workers are friendly, and hard working of course we need a full team to stock and clean the entire store before opening hours. The hardest part about the job is the lack of team members to finish the night with out being physically and emotionally drained. The most enjoyable part was meeting the staff and how our team's hard work paid off at the end."
good,Target had a nice environment and wonderful hours available to work that could accommodate your needs. It is a great company.
good,"I really had a great time at that company, however, the company when it found that you could do more by yourself because of the time you have been there, and are able to train other people the company continues to use you until it can find someone to replace you. The other bad part no communication between management and lead persons."
good,"This is a great company to work for as a first time job."
good,Encourage cashiers to do their best to ensure that all Guests had a great shopping experience.  Co-workers were terrific.
good,"great place to work"
good,My co-workers are great but as far as management I feel like they don't appreciate their employees that well. They don't recognize each team members full potential or lack of.
good,Target is a really fun place to work its the fact that the management isn't so great and they play favorites. It's a joke. I don't like working because we are expected so much and paid so little. The managers are rude and inconsiderate.
good,Co workers were the best. Always willing to help with daily tasks. Job priorities were never defined.Needed more structure in work environment. No support from executives
good,"I would recommend having a backup job, once they start cutting hours after the holiday, but the job itself wasn't too hard. All you do in the backroom is pull stuff out for people to stock, it's a physical job more than anything. Be expected to stand,walk a lot and climb up ladders for the your whole shift."
good,I like interacting and helping people. I don't really have a bad experience with Target. I just want to keep forward with my make up career and so on.
good,"Not everyone there is as motivated as they should be, they should work harder on helping people out, and being more a member of a team"
good,"I did not enjoy working at Target, while they have a lot of employee appreciation, the employees don't have many hours, are treated in the same sense a retail outlet would treat them, and generally has poor to average management."
good,"Learned customer service, cashiering, and management skills."
good,Overall the company is a great place to work. As is the case most of the time in retail the schedule is crazy and you spend very little time with family during the holidays.
good,"Ok place to work. Some staff are great to work with, others not so much, can be clicky ( as if still in high school). Funny they posted this job when works aren't able to get any hours themselves but yet able to hire new people??"
good,"Company have lost the Fast, Fun, and Friendly culture. They bring in these managers who don't anything and expect team members to be okay with that. The turnover rate is horrible. They need to go back to how things was 10 years ago. They just hire anybody these days."
good,Enjoyed working in Target. It has a great cultures of working environment. However it had a random shifts and less hour per week which wasn't enough to survive.
good,Working at target was occasionally a good experience. It is an excellent job to help refine one's salesman skills. The only problem with Target would be the management who would fire employees when they are most needed and being very critical on their employees
good,"Job is easier but tiring, there isn't really any cognitive challenge, the goal to succeeding is being friendly."
good,worked here for 15 years. it was a good job good experience. but im not outgoing enough. i didnt sell the credit or debit cards very well. if your shy and reserved and not very talkative this is not the place for you. i was a cashier
good,"You never know if you will have a good or bad day here. Most of the times it is bad. Sometimes management does not know what they want you to do, they try getting you to do a million things at once when they know it is not possible. It can actually be quite frustrating working here. The coworkers are nice, you actually feel like they are family. It is very frustrating when they only have about two cashiers working and they keep calling you up front for back up when there are assignments you need to complete. Impossible."
good,"As a softlines team member, much of your day is spent picking clothes up off the floor and folding the same shirt for the fifth time."
good,"It was alright, something i picked up on really fast and without a problem. its not really challenging to me. It was okay but i felt like there was to many chiefs and not enough Indians."
good,"Management was insulting, and fickle. Their relationship with new employees were weak, and very unfriendly. Some were very unprofessional, and others expected far too much in such little time. Teamwork isn't always provided. They expect you to find everything on the scanners that many were broken, logged you out, or frozen most of the time, and everyone was fighting for one. We were almost never allowed to call things in, because the scanner should be enough (which it wasn't). Some of management was understanding, others scolded you like a child. I was asked to stay full-time but, I just didn't feel like I was being treated right. I do not expect an employer to praise me, but I do expect respectful constructive criticism, and actual teamwork. They expected a lot from new employees during holiday season in a very short amount of time. Customers were very nice, and pleasant. Co-workers were very informative and helpful more so than some trainers. Target made it feel like I was working hard, and doing well to be constantly scolded at the end of the day. Target needs employees just as much as employees need a job. Working at Target is over-hyped."
good,"Fast pace and fun workplace ,enjoyed my other co workers ,I learned how to operate required machines, hardest part of job was the overnight shifts, poor management in logistics, most enjoyable part was getting to interact with other employees and making new friends"
good,"normally you have to work fast constantly moving that is the most exciting part of the job. nice co- workers but the hours are not very family friendly for the people with babies. you are gone most of  the day. "
good,Great company to work for right after you graduate. You will learn a lot and meet some great and not so great people. Overall experience is decent.
good,"As a place to start accumulating some work experience, Target can get that job done. This job is perfect for high schoolers, because, despite their many shortcomings, Target always seems to want to accommodate a varying schedule. "
good,"should treat there employees better"
good,Target distribution is a decent place to work but really interferes  with your day to day life. I dont not suggest this workplace.
good,"My time at Target was very mixed. I had some great experiences, and I had times where I was ready to walk out the door. I worked overnights, and the lack of sleep certainly made it difficult to maintain a daily life and work. The culture was built around teamwork, but due to constant change of workers, the vets were expected to carry the load. All in all, it wasn't terrible, but I don't miss it either."
good,A typical day at work would be many people actually doing their jobs while a handful are just standing around talking. Although the team leaders are quick to point out the people that they didn't particularly like and accuse them of not doing they're jobs.
good,"I have worked for Target for 2 years now. I typical day at work usually consists of doing several persons jobs outside of your duties. The co-workers are good people and I enjoy working with most everyone. The hardest part of my job is never having holidays off, never having a set schedule and not making enough money to support myself. The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I get to meet and the security of knowing I have a job!"
good,"Great people, but very stressfull environment, with bosses who cant quite understand the positions of anyone lower than them in the store."
good,"A typical day consists of far too many tasks to be completed by one Group Leader.  From the SOS to the EOS there is a feeling that something has been forgotten.  "
good,target is a good place to work if you're just looking for a summer/ part time job. The only way to get a up on the ladder is if you have a degree.
good,"I enjoyed working at Target until things started changing. I know as a company, they have to change and evolve because times are changing, but it was difficult to adjust to new management since we had several in the last year. It was hard to keep up with what was current and expected when management kept changing things and not communicating about them. I really enjoyed my role as brand specialist, which required visual merchandising such as visual adjacency's and setting new folded tables with product. I extremely enjoyed working with my co-workers. We always helped each other out and tried to make an easy going work environment. The hardest part of my job was keeping up with the work load for the week because management wanted to keep payroll low, therefore not scheduling enough coverage on the floor. With that happening, a lot of things were not getting done and that work got put onto to us on top of what we already had to do which put a lot stress on to us. It was really frustrating and challenging since we didn't get the support from our leaders like we needed. My work was not getting done and that bothered me because I'm a very detailed person and perfectionist when it comes to my job. I'm a very hard and dedicated worker and really like what I do. I really love fashion and hope to excel into something bigger in the fashion industry someday."
good,"It was a great experience, but not a place you can work at for the rest of your life. Flexible with your schedule if you are a student or working around another job."
good,"Target is a good place for a first job."
good,"Basic retail job, I mostly did stocking and sometimes cashier when needed.  The job did help me improve on my customer service and interpersonal skills.  Management didn't typically like to communicate so I never felt like I learned what I could from them but other team members were great to work with and we learned a lot from each other.  Hardest part of the job was being able to communicate with my managers since they weren't very interpersonal.  Job was fairly monotonous.  Best part of the job was being working with other team members and helping guests."
good,"I worked at target for a year and a half before i finally had enough and quit. My co-workers were the best part of the job my far. The only pros I can think of is that I honestly think I matured a lot there and I met some of my best friends there. The management was fine. I had two managers who I am convinced lived to make my life horrible. The shifts were long and boring, and they are really bad about shift flexability. You must work weekends and at least 20 hours a week and your shifts will probably always be 8 hours. They also push redcards so much you live, sleep and breath redcards."
good,Fats work pace environment. Plenty of overtime opportunities. Not many opportunities for promotion. A lot of turnover in management
good,Seasonal employment is decent but pay is low and hours can vary greatly. Management is hit or miss depending on which store you're at.
good,work nights was good the team i was in was a team i can always go for help if i needed them management was ok they was there if u needed them
good,"work with a lot of really hardworking people but management is a little distant from the real issues of the employees, hours vary so you can't plan a budget"
good,It was a ok job if you are in college and want to make  some money but overall its ok I guess for the most part I only worked there to get a check for school
good,"Good pay, bad hours. Team environment. Good culture. Little to no room for promotion. Good benefits and discount. Lots of change in leadership."
good,"The pay is great If your willing to sacrifice coming home happy everyday.The  physical demand and production the management team  bases you at work at is unrealistic unless your slaving for those long 12 hours or cutting corners .Everyday the exceptions are higher  and rules change for certain individuals,Goodluck talking to Hr if your having a problem with an individual or a very stressful supervisor your always wrong they are always right and you feel like another number in other words expendable. They hire new Group leaders fresh out of college with no DC or warehouse experience just a rule book.So if you like getting bossed around for high pay by someone who cant revive freight the correct way this job is for you."
good,"On a normal day Im just on the register until I leave. The management there are okay some managers I love, and some I just have to tolerate because they tend to play favoritism and love that select group more than anything. Some of the co-workers are great, some are not since they have a big ego and believe they can boss everyone around. The hardest part about the job is having to come into work and have to listen to the manager brag about their favorite worker and treat them with great prizes when they do the same thing i do."
good,"Depending on where you are placed within this company will determine your work life balance. As an Executive Team Lead you can be expect to be in a position where you have to be knowledgeable of all aspects of the operation. Depending what volume of store you are placed in will negate how much you will have to be physically involved in the operations. The training that is offered is not consistent and many times the trainers (other ETL's) are going to place you with one of their Team Leads to actually train. This is going to place you in a position where you will learn about the basic fundamentals of the day to day lower level employee work, but you will not learn what is expected of you as a Executive Team Lead. In some stores you will find out that there are social groups and if you are not accepted among them, you career may not last long with the company even though you are a stronger manager than your piers. I have witnessed other Executive Team Leads place all mistakes within the operations on other Executives to displace the attention from themselves to ensure their on success. The culture from store to store will vary a lot. I have witness some stores that have a rise together, fall together mentality (which are the ones you what to be apart of) and then there are the ones where there is not an open door mentality and you are going to feel like you are on egg shells and cause you to be worried if they are against you. Many people in each one of the stores are going to talk about payroll hours being reduced. The reason for this because the Store Team Lead is given payroll"
good,"always running around doing work for others, doing my job and a lot of others. I learned to be more aware of others that I am around. management could be better, they are too focused on one thing and not others, they don't really know how to do THEIR job. the hardest part is having different managers tell you to do different things and they want your life to be this job. my co-workers are my favorite part about my job."
good,"Working at Target in the beginning was a good experience. It was nice to assist guests and to go to work everyday and know that I was being productive. Target does have a store card, the REDCard, which as a cashier you have to ask the guest if they'd like to sign up for one. "
good,Generally a fun job experience overall however leadership is always changing at this location so stability of leadership is questionable.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was being around products that I loved and helping customers find what products were right for them.  Some of my co-workers were really supportive professionally and personally and they were all hard-working.
good,"Managers don't back there employees up when miss treated by guest, under staffed with way to much to get done in a day, they constantly cut hour leaving it impossible to complete daily work loads. Management does very little work, they love to delegate everything to team member while they play Ping-Pong in conference room."
good,"target works well with a school schedule, for the people that are trying to better their life worth and make more money."
good,"All day pulling orders, driving all types of heavy equipment"
good,as at any job for the most part you will a couple of lazy coworkers but more than half the team. the same coworkers call out at least once every week. the real problem is my direct supervisor know this but will not fire them and the extra workload is left for me and two others.
good,Fast paced environment with lots of opportunity to learn new skills. Good compensation and benefits package available to team members.
good,"Can potentially be a fun place to work. Co workers are always smiling and for the most part in a good mood. Management is horrible. They expect you to drop everything in your life at their request. They are not very helpful when it comes to personal needs and are not very understanding. For the most part, they tend to let their personal issues get in the way of being good managers. They get too emotional and tend to take it out on employees when they should strictly keep it professional and just focus on getting the job done."
good,Good place for freshers to start career and not for career advancement. Frequent lay-offs and no clarity on current/future road map.
good,"Target is great for someone only looking for part time emploment. There is a lack of hours, and decent benefits. However scheduling is often flexible."
good,"1. A typical day at work: Unload truck and process all softlines. (clothes). Stock all clothes. Move to stock other areas of store as needed. This is only on a truck day. Other day I may do re-shop, work the food truck, zone...anything they tell me to do."
good,"A typical day was to arrive at 6 a.m. (except during the Christmas rush, which was 4:30 a.m. or 11 p.m.-7 a.m.), unload goods from a conveyor system from the delivery truck and stock shelves.  I learned how to read codes depicting departments, aisles, shelves, etc.  Management was sometimes brutally rude or great, depending on which side of the bed they got up on or whether the store was meeting goals no matter how fast or hard everyone worked.  For the most part, co-workers were great and from all walks of life.  The hardest part of the job was being 'tossed to the wolves' with minimal training during the busiest time of the year and working as fast as possible to stock before a certain hour.  The amount of merchandise to stock on most days was mind-blowing.  The most enjoyable part of the job was joking with co-workers."
good,"The people are great and I enjoy going into work and seeing them everyday. I have not met one mean or nasty individual yet that works for the company. I like to think I have proven myself in the tasks given and have asked several times to be cross-trained in other areas or the store incase someone calls out and they need someone to fill the position. I have been told several times for a few weeks now that they are going to train me in other areas, but have not heard anything else about it. I try to talk to them about it and they keep saying they will talk to other departments and keep putting it off. The only other problem I have is the fluctuating hours. I know it is retail and this happens, but when I go from almost 40 hours one week down to under 20 the next because of new hires, it hurts me financially. I cannot live on or take care of my family with so few hours."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target because of my co-workers and some supervisors but the pay for the workload was bare to say the least.  We had to unload an average trailer size of 2300 pieces and take it out to the sales floor in less the an hour and a half with two people in the trailer, one person scanning, one person pushing the product and six people sorting the product.  Then from there we go out to the sales floor and stock all the items that where unloaded from the trailer. The hardest part was keeping up with the timeline with the amount of people that where there.  But the best part about the job was the people around me because they made it fun in a way."
good,"Staff was very pleasant but management was not so flexible at times. Customers in the area were rude and sometimes made experiences difficult. Breaks were very short, at times food was provided. Was one of the worst black Fridays I've had in retail."
good,"I was the operator / fitting room attendant / sales associate / cashier / merchandiser. I learned how to use a PDF. Management was dependent on who was managing that day. All managers except for one were nice, motivational, understanding and treated the employees with respect. The one manager was sometimes nice but mostly disrespectful, uncaring, not understanding, inpatient and led me on to thinking I would get promoted only to get me to do more than my job description and not really going to promote me."
good,"The team mates are amazing. the currant management is killing target slowly from the inside....very sad."
good,"making sure the fitting room is nice and organized, answering phones, making sure everything gets back on the sales floor, as well as, making sure the sales floor is clean."
good,Scheduling made the day much harder than in could be - making coverage for breaks and lunches near impossible sometimes. Incredibly frustrating that open/mid/close shifts were not evenly split between peers.
good,"Although I worked with some amazing people, I believed for the amount of pay, the job could be very strenuous. It was hard to balance out school as well as work. "
good,"Overall it was not a poor experience since I was involved in a lot of areas there with a lot of different learning curves. They were flexible in moving their employees around when they needed to and encouraged continued development in leadership roles or other roles at the place of business. They lacked a grasp on balance with personal life, job ethics, and schooling and some of the bosses were complicated to work with. Hardest part of the job was recovery at the end of the night, too much coaching happened during this time frame. Most enjoyable part is working with the co-workers, some of the bosses, and working with the customers, for the most part."
good,"This place has potential, but the culture needs a overall. A good place to work in a pinch, but not a place you'd want to stay at to long"
good,"- Huddle up and go over the previous day production in all areas. Then review the current day's workload. Stretch for about ten minutes, pick functions and begin working. "
good,"This position is great for a self starter, which I am!  The work load is high and the stress level is higher due to the company's guest service focus and high volume of guests.  My position was low level manager for the front of the store.  Oversight of up to 28 cash registers, dealing with continual guest concerns, managing staff breaks, assisting guest services and photo lab as needed.  The largest portion of this job was managing guest traffic flow on the lanes, eliminating bottlenecks and calling for continual backup from the sales floor."
good,"Target is a very interesting place to work because you get to learn new things as you go along. However, the company is not the best when it comes to good work ethics and efficiency. Full-time employees are decently paid, at the distribution center where I worked. I think they had a lot of warehouse machinery to help with the job and increase production, but the downside to this was that they never had the proper management to push for the maximum production. "
good,"I thought the job was a nice transition job.  Pay wasn't the best for the extent of work we put in in the morning, but most of management were caring and truly wanted to see others succeed.  "
good,a typical day at work is basically performing and completing a task assigned to me in a timely fashion. providing great customer service. making sure the guest is helped and pointed in the right direction to thier needs.
good,"Work like a slave, required to work in areas that you are not qualified for, pay close attention to those around you before taking a shift unless you want to be written up. TONS of favoritism with scheduling and shift requirements. Unfair"
good,Mainly dealt with perishables. Back up Cashier. Learned to be flexible. Worked with many co-workers. Hard dealing with customers at times enjoyed various duties.
good,"At Target my day was very usually very busy. My job was to manage the pharmacy while providing great guest service and maintaining profitability."
good,"I have been with the company for a number of years. I was promoted in pay grades a few times, I have gotten exceptional reviews and have made decent money in doing so. Target is a great company to build your leadership skills. However, at the end of the day, it's retail. You work retail hours, and deal with all the ""cons"" of retail. "
good,"I only worked seasonal during Christmas time, so I can't really speak for the rest of the year. However, the customers were very difficult and unforgiving. They were quick to snap and talk down to you. Management tried to ease it, but they were very dismissive and not really caring about what the customer thought."
good,"Fast pace work, offers some tech training with RF scanners and devices. nice co-workers and leaders, just not enough hours a week."
good,Because of a lot of the recent changes of the company as a whole it has created a lot of pressure for staff at store level.   There is no real job security with this company.  There are a lot of demands and if not met one is easy coached counseled or released. This type of pressure makes it difficult for team members to enjoy what they do. Red cards are great incentive but my guest don't know the pressure team and management are put in to get them.  Can't necessarily managers because they are just as easily expendable as team member.  May Target should invest in some type of rewards cards that are accessible to all guest regardless of credit.  Target must remember guest have lost a lot of trust after that breach and we all are feeling the pressure.  Hours fluctuate and even though pay is significantly improving  there is no way to compensate for this when weeks are low. Yes one can work in different area but this is not always possible.  Dramatic change in culture since I started.  No many opportunities for advancement.  Seeing the company is trying to find room for the staff they already have.  Best of Luck with Changes.  These are not necessarily my complaints these are the complaints of peers who feel their voices are not heard.
good,At the start of my morning shift i would grab a PDA and a walkie and head to the fitting room. Id check the reshop and make sure it was sorted correctly. Id then check the reverse/repackage bin and then communication binder. my shifts consisted of me maintaining the reship area along with the change rooms and the mens department. At the same time id be answering any phone calls that came in. I enjoyed working with everyone apart of the softlines team. My leaders were always there when you needed them. It was a great place to work.
good,"In a typical day I would start by unloading the truck pushing and pulling pallets to destination. do that for 1 1/2 hours then start stocking shelves until time to go home. I used a hand held computer (PDA) that help me find location of merchandise..that was helpful and help get done faster. Didn't care to much for unloading truck, it was hard and very fast past..couldn't keep up.I enjoyed mostly just stocking shelves and seeing the newest merchandise coming in."
good,Team members will pull you down in order to advance and get promoted. Everyone's looking to impress the boss not necessarily improve the business.
good,"I enjoy working at target, only for the people. I was able to work with some really cool people with all different backgrounds."
good,"They make promises to everyone with no intention of promoting the ones that really deserve to be promoted."
good,Working indoor most of the day. Help customers to achieve their needs. Stock shelves where needed. Push Carts inside store. Approach customers to help with needs.
good,"A typical day of work entails firstly coming to the building with a positive and friendly attitude. Next, speaking with manager(s) to ensure daily plans are executed and thoroughly completed. Next, executing the plans laid out while simultaneously friendly speaking to each and every individual and/or family that chooses to step in the building to shop. Lastly, after all plans are executed, reviewing and discussing with manger(s) the completed tasks and improving and/or finalizing any changes necessary to ensure satisfaction with both parties. "
good,Fun place to work. I loved going to work it was a easy job but could be very frustrating when you have to deal with rude Ignorant customers. What I learned is to be patient with some customers and try not to judge. Management was ok went through a lot of managers there. co- workers were friendly fun to work with. hardest part was dealing with the Rude Ignorant customers. the most enjoyable part would be working with great people.
good,A great entry level job for those just entering the work world as a teenager or part time job to make some extra side money. An eye opener for the life of customer service and commitment to team works to support a common goal!
good,worked midnight shift. Tough and stressful work environment. Did what we could as a team to help keep store in good shape and provide great costumer service
good,"Long work day with no help"
good,"It was great working for Target in Alexandria, VA"
good,"when i first started back in 2008, it was a great place to work. but they changed a lot about the store and i started to hate working there. they became understaffed and required the few people working each night to do more and more."
good,I knew how to achieve my goals within my job. I was micro managed on every little thing. I could not make decisions on my own.
good,"you get told which trailers to load and what your goal is for the night and get assigned a task to do before youre conveyor belts fill up with  product to sort and put away. Theres very little teamwork, Management picks and chooses whom they really want to succeeed and fire, is not based on how hard you work.Hardest part of the job... its a very phsycially demanding job. Got very tough to keep up with and  when everyone worked together, made it worth while."
good,"I worked for this place for almost four years, and though i can say some bad things about this place they are probably one of the best paying DC's in the Columbus Ohio area.  Things to expect, very high turnover in the outbound department.  Pretty much the trenches of the DC.  You load up to 10 to 13 trailers at a time playing life size tetris with around 500 boxes an hour coming through your hand, and if you don't you have to go around and sort around 70 something doors.  The trainer's will train you for a few days and cut you loose to learn.  That is when people won't come back.  The supervisors have a fist full of iron management style.  Meaning they carry a lot of weight determining whether you stay or will they walk you out.  The supervisors vary from micro managers to  young clueless former preschool teachers that are ignorant to warehouse operations.  A few are decent but that is all. Far as the workers, some of the hardest working warehouse workers you will find.  The stuff i have seen people do there is amazing and sometimes non human.  A lot of silent supermen.  Don't expect people to be nice or show you any respect until you make it past your 90 days.  Mainly because the turnover is so high.  Outbound at Target DC in West Jefferson is not for the faint of heart, but if you want to earn your every penny and not ever have time to look at a clock this place is right for you.  If you don't have a four degree you will basically be on a treadmill going no where fast but a max out in pay."
good,Solid training program for managers. Schedule not ideal if you have a family. Long hours but great co-workers.
good,"Working in the warehouse is a very physical demanding job, the pay is great for this economy. The benefits are ok.. very basic,  if you're looking for advancement you better have a 4yr degree if not you're not going to advance in the company no matter how hard you work or being the perfect employee. The Target warehouse is a very back stabbing type of environment, finding friends within your co-workers is tough. Management is not your friend, no matter how they pretend, it's truly a you versus them situation. I say this because of they way management interacts with it's employees, how they say things, body language etc.. Now not all of group leaders (managers) are bad people they are just being told what to do by their boss, but most of the good managers leave the company, because they have a problem with what's beings asked of them. When you work in the Target Warehouse you are not a person you are a body, and if you make waves or just not liked by management they will get rid of you. Target wants you to believe that they're this caring company, but its all about the bottom line thats why they hire thru an employment agency now so they can pay people less and not have to truly explain, or have a paper trail when they fire someone."
good,"Atypical day at target consisted of handling returns, rude management, and large quantities of money. I learned to deal with rude customers, co-workers, and management. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with rudeness coming from management, made me feel as though as was one of the customers. The most enjoyable part of job was being recognized for excellent customer service and the way I interacted with the customers. Would I work for target again, maybe if they changed management and some of the co-workers."
good,"The scheduling is very off, at times they change it while your not there and then penalize you for not showing up. Management is awful, they don't communicate at all and try to force to show up to work when sick. I hope all targets are not like this or I will not be shopping or working there ever again"
good,"Very easy repepitive work. Basically if you're a sales floor member you stock shelves reorganize the area you are assigned while preforming duties in other areas as needed. Cashier is even easier you just put stuff in bags and deal with some rude people. Honestly, try and get cashier over other job positions as it is the easiest and you get paid the same as most of your coworkers."
good,Target was really productive because everyone was nice and careful about eachother.
good,"My daily duties are to cook, prep and sell food to guests everday and to clean up at the end of the work day. My team leader is the best, she is flexible, fair but firm when need to be. My co-workers are the best less recongonized team in the store because we work to serve people from breakfast to dinner, some people think that it is easy but its hard work. I enjoy the guests that come and go over time we have built relationships like family. I have learned to be flexable in my daily work, some coworkers may call out of work and I have to close because we need sales so I know the importance of the need to make money in order for us to get paid."
good,"A typical day at target begins as every other days expectation, to come in and work. Although what I expect seldom happens, work at target is a place where you'r challenged to do your best, to provide great customer service and interact with others, whether a team member or customer. One thing I can truly say is that what you signed up for, is not necessarily what you do on an everyday basis. I believe that this is what makes target stand out from the pack of retailers, they give you opportunity's to learn something new, which can than lead to you gaining a promotion. One aspect about target that I don't like is the raise that is given at the end of each year, they are typically between 10-25 cents raised."
good,I was a warehouse associate for Target distribution for three years. The management was more concerned with increasing production than the well-being of their employees. The warehouse in which I worked was a dirty and dangerous environment.
good,"Managing the cash office, scheduling breaks for the day, check and fill endcaps, print signs, set endcaps when needed, assist cashiers and guest service with questions and long lines, help food ave when needed, cover breaks and lunches, assist guests."
good,Working at this company demands a lot of time management and organization skills.  The work is demanding but I am ready for more intellectual and challenge and a work with benefits
good,"Unfortunately, like any other retail place, you have to be cut out for working in a retail environment (High stress, very unpleasant costumers with sometimes borderline aggressive attitude).  The problem starts with the ETL's (High position managers) , most of them happen to just give out orders and not helping their staff. Not to mention sometimes had some very high expectations when someone from corporate would come to visit the store and the ETL'S would switch into ""freak out mode"" and everyone that had the night shift would stay sometimes up to 2 AM making sure the store looked literally ""perfect"", only to find out the next day that the corporate executives decided to go visit another store in the area. One particular manager also gave out ""coachings"" like it was candy (a report where it explains if you did something wrong or something that particular manager didn't like you doing, and then it is emailed to all of the managers). Another thing to be aware of, make sure that if you are working overtime, you get paid for ALL of the hours that you worked, there was a coworker that worked 49 hours in a particular week, but only got paid 42, it was later discovered that management accessed the worked hours log and configured the hours to be 42 worked in total of that particular week (coworker had the before and after logs printed as physical evidence). I quit the job to look for something where I can grow my skills in. I have no idea what happened to my coworker with the unpaid overtime. And to be honest, after so many years of working retail, quitting Target was probably the"
good,It would be beneficial and encouraging if Target was as loyal to their employees as they expect the employees to be to them. At times it seems that management is only concerned with numbers and not with the well being of their staff. Holidays are nice for employees though because Target does provide food and snacks the whole day.
good,"Always happy, I would greet customers entering the establishment, maintain a clean and orderly checkout area, and received payment by cash, check, credit cards, or automatic debits. Target is never overally busy. Managment is alwayshappy and positive but when you need them they seem to be not around and schdeduling is horrible. The co- workers are great and friendly. I didnt find anything hard, i personally like a little challenge. The most enjoyable part was seeing how satisfied guest work with the Target team!"
good,learn things such as working with a sense of urgency teamwork and each day learning how to execute a game plan to accomplish the task also managers allowing us to put a input into the game plan nightly huddles and followed by recognition to team  members
good,working in target I learn to run a team complete my tasks follow-up with new changes always help the guest drive sale everyday ask can I help you find something going up for back-up cashier driving red card. love working in the floor working as a team makes it fun enjoy my team and my peers .
good,"I worked sales floor which wasn't too bad at first. Once I was there for about a month or so, hours started to slow down ALOT. I went from about 35 hours to only 9 hours a week. Which also puts a lot more work on you and was very stressful. Some mornings flow team wouldn't be there so you then have to do flow team pulls, your own pulls, work gobacks, zone, cover other employee's breaks and cashier all at the same time. I don't know if all Targets are like this but that is what I experienced while I was there."
good,"Worked here for almost 3 years and did a lot of work; unloading truck, pushing freight, stocking shelves, gathering carts, operating the cardboard compactor, working the stockroom. You can bend over backwards for the company but get no recognition or even a thank you. Raises are pitiful, I think the most you're allowed is 50 cents. Upper management and the corporate swine just care about profit, they won't listen to your problems. I was harassed by a manager countless times, went to the store manager about it, and the offender promptly went on ""administrative absence"", only to come back 3 months later, to continue the same behavior. Finally 2 store managers later, something was done about the problem. Working here is just not worth putting 100% of your effort into if you want to be rewarded for going the extra mile."
good,"As an Instocks Team Member I scan products that are out of stock to check if we have located in the back room. We have between 8 am till noon to get the whole store scanned while back up casher, and provide fun and friendly guest service."
good,"Target is good chance for young people who need a job same time go college .. It isn't bad for this job , there is random of speed each day of working ."
good,"I feel that I bust my butt most days and don't get an recognition. Everybody has their bad days and I am one of them, but most of the time I bring my A game and push myself to the limit. I try and turn it into a workout just to make it more interesting and to help push myself. But it's never good enough. No matter how fast I went or how much I pushed it never seems to be enough. It's always ""why didn't more get done, or that's all you did?"" It's sort of an ego killer when I think to myself hey I did good, we quick, got a good workout in, and then I get told I didn't do enough, or I wasn't quick enough. And for this reason I find myself looking for other employment where my skills will be noticed and maybe a little appreciated."
good,"Organized and kept company rules in effect for proficient and effective sales."
good,"I have been working for Target for 3 years. It started as a great job that I was proud of. It is now a struggle. Retail companies are lost in the numbers, statistics and surveys stranglehold. nothing matters unless the numbers say so. They also have been putting all of their future in Target Business College - hiring people with zero retail experience as executive just because they have a degree. I have seen dozens of co-workers without college degrees but have years and years of experience get passed up and told they will never advance. Unfortunately, I am moving on to greener pastures."
good,"Setting up and sorting seasonal merchandise and maintaining a fun Christmas spirit for all Target shoppers. occasionally getting called up to run the cash register."
good,"Employees at this location did not work together, in my opinion"
good,the people who work there are awesome! It's got some really great policies but customers who know how nice we are take advantages of the company and not being very grateful. It could hire a few more people to do more quality tasks instead of using one to do 3 people's tasks.
good,Good pay and benefits. The hardest part of the job is lifting for 8 hours a day non-stop and trying to reach certain targets. The environment is very cold because it is food warehouse.
good,"I've been an employee at Target for a decent amount of time. Along the way, I've learned a lot of information that can help me better myself, as well as take the knowledge into a future place of employment. A typical day at work would consist of a high amount of customer-employee interaction, both with promoting products, as well as ensuring that every and all detail(s) is covered. The one priority at Target is to make the customer's shopping experience as easy and efficient as possible, allowing them to leave satisfied. A routine shift in the electronics department requires that the employee has a decent amount of product knowledge for the inventory displayed. In order to make the sale go a lot smoother, it is preferred and helps a lot more if the employee has a deeper product knowledge, rather than just being able to cover the basics. Since this is a retail establishment, making sales goals is the primary course of action. Actually knowing product information and being able to explain it helps that immensely. As an employee, we must provide the best possible shopping experience for the customer, helping them with any questions that they may have, and allowing them to leave happy, resulting in return shopping trips. It is also necessary for the employee(s) to make sure that there is sufficient stock on the shelves being displayed. "
good,"Not a good job if you are trying to live on your own. "
good,"From opening to closing the number one priority is the guest who come to our counter, and call for refills and new scripts. My job entails doing everything from data entry, to filling scripts, to ringing out guests, refilling stock for both drugs and our supplies, returning overstock medications, and sending out outdated pills. As well as filing monthly and yearly records that need to be kept for any certain amount of time. I knew nothing when I first started in the pharmacy, however over the past 5 years I have become very secure in the role i have know, I have been certified for 3 1/2 years. There's not very much room for advancement in the pharmacy at target, so I'd like to find a company where there's room to move up. Most of my co-workers are very nice and easy to work with however I feel like I have to pick up their slack because I work at a faster pace then most my co-workers. The hardest part of my job is the working with people who consistently cause problems. My job is enjoyable to me because I feel very confident in what I do."
good,The hardest part was trying to get more hours in a work week.  Enjoyed working with customers and fellow employees were awesome.
good,Worked in produce department while on college.  Understanding of my school schedule and was able to negotiate hours that were best for me.
good,"Target offers decent pay and benefits and respects above average production in return. After 9 years with an exemplary employment record, I got a new 23 year old department executive and he resigned 4 months later after firing all of the supervisors in the department."
good,Target was great as far as the customers and employees goes the only thing I didn't like was the late night hours.
good,"The average days goals are not hard at all until others ask you to do task for them. Dealing with a lot of task you learn how to juggle jobs more carefully and organize your day. The management for the most part is pretty lousy except for a select few who do everything in there power to make sure things get done. The co-workers are very friendly and welcoming  I couldn't ask for a better group to work with. The hardest part of the job is being alone when people don't show up or on vacation and the workload triples, my job at this store should never just be one person."
good,"It was fine for a starter job."
good,"I started at Target HQ out of college in their very good rotation program.  Very good exposure to many different areas of IT.  After the first 2 years is when the real culture kicks in.  Its a good company overall but if you want to move up and get promotions you need to be popular and overtly outgoing.  Your accomplishments come 2nd to who knows you.  "
good,"Hire, train and supervise 20  to 30 team members in warehouse distribution setting."
good,"Target was a good place to work. There was some management issues but other than that, I enjoyed working there. employees"
good,"Management really sucks at target, my store in flushing NY hardly ever recognized the team for all their hard work and efforts. A typical day was dealing with customer service, price management, packing out the floor, unloading the truck etc."
good,"While some people can do well at Target, for the ninety percent of employees who work at the Hixson branch the future is grim. With a relatively young management team, the store is often in a dramatic chaos as the team leaders keep a firm boundary between themselves and the team members. With Target being an enormous company, it's shocking to see that the maximum raise that an employee can receive only once a year is an embarrassing four percent. Starting at $8.00 an hour is saddening, especially when you are aware that without a promotion, it will be three years before you even hit the $9.00/hr mark."
good,"As vezes normal e as vezes muito corrido"
good,Target was a pretty alrite fit as a secondary employee; As an dept mgr i did get paid a lit more and received a little more benefits then the average employee. Unfortunately it was not great enough for me not to have a second job. I did enjoy the people and responsibilities but in reality after nearly two years of employment and no advancement i had to face reality that my other job was paying more and had far betteer benefits. I eventually had to reach the reality after some talks with my supervisors that with no advancement opportunities and it being my secondary employer. I eventually dropped Target for a company where i was compensated in more cash in exchange for no benefits since my career covered that.
good,"Worked a 3 day 12 hour shift. Learned how shipping, packing and receiving was done in a Target warehouse.  Management was never around since I worked the weekends.  Co-workers were great people and fun to be around inside and out of the workplace. The hardest part of my job was knowing there was no promotions for Team Members.  The most enjoyable part of my job was knowing we were making our guest excited and happy especially during holidays."
good,"I was only there temporarily, but it seemed that nobody tried to help me. I was put on the register right away and had to figure things out on my own. Also when I had a medical issue come up they were not willing to work with me about time off needed for appointments."
good,"Electronics was a fun department, they gave very manageable goals, and I had a lot of wonderful coworkers.  Management was hard to find and could be a mixed bag of great or terrible, but you find that at any job.  Sometimes they made me work until past closing some nights (midnight) and open the next morning (8 a.m.), with a 40-minute drive each way between, which could be very rough.  Even when I explained why this was difficult for me, they still scheduled me that way and it was exhausting.  There was almost always an opportunity to work in different departments, which was nice, too, so it didn't get too stale.  The only thing I truly despised were the call buttons - they tended to understaff electronics (not enough knowledgeable employees), the call buttons would go off, we'd call for help on the walkie-talkies, but no one came to help.  Then we got reprimanded for not responding fast enough - one person for a dozen customers on a Sunday morning is a tough gig.  Pay wasn't bad, had nice coworkers and some managers, but my department was very understaffed."
good,"I really enjoyed learning all the departments.  So you are guaranteed more work hours, fast paced, very diverse company.  The thing I was unhappy about was the fact that you couldn't move up in the company without a college degree.  Years of experience didn't matter, the fact I knew every department and even trained their Executives and still could not be and Exec if I wanted to."
good,It's overall a good place to work. But I love it. You meet good people like either the team members or the guest in the store.I've it makes me feel good knowing that you can change nobodies day just by focusing on them.
good,good job good company but just dont give lots of hours and it was a good learning and well trained with great team work
good,Company as a whole is a great place to work but inconsistent messages from middle and upper management make it currently a difficult place to work at.
good,"pros- its a job, not bad starting pay"
good,"A typical day at work consists of pulling batches that are generated by team leaders (supervisors) based on what the store needs on the shelves.  My team works separately sometimes but as a team overall to meet the needs of the business. The management is very respectable and always trying to their best to lead the team by not just lecture but by example.  The hardest part of the job is sometimes during the holidays my work is really demanding physically and mentally the workload is intense but my coworkers and I always do our best and work together to meet the needs of the business ."
good,"everyone was hostile,  if you didnt help them in any way your no help to them and get treated like dirt."
good,coworkers are all very friendly and a clean work place. team leaders know what their doing.
good,"Perfect for teens coming out of high school, early college students."
good,"Extremely fast paced environment, very enjoyable interaction with guests (customers), High Expectations vs. low support."
good,i hate warehouse jobs. I haven't learned anything working at target. They did what they wanted to do and it was unorganized. They was nice to me. The hardest part of this job was waking up at 6a.m waiting on a call to see if I had to come in or not and most days I got up early and I didn't get called in.
good,All I did was push carts. My pay only went up because a man died on the job. It never ended with the carts. Management could be acceptable but those horrible carts.
good,"Unloaded trucks onto a sorting line, sorted out boxes of goods, then stocked those goods while maintaining a pleasant demeanor and assisting guests in any way possible."
good,very hard work with little compensation. very long hours are worked with not a lot pay.
good,I learned to always move with a sense of urgency and always make sure your guest are comfortable around you.
good,"management is the reason I left the job, too many managers telling you what to do or telling you different ways to do things always getting yelled at instead of talked to. im not speaking on myself but what I witnessed also."
good,"Because of their expansion attempts to compete with Walmart, Target has reduced labor in the stores and every job is that of 3 persons."
good,"This is a very ""team"" oriented company, but management and communication throughout the store I work at is/was very poor. Except for when all the gossip is going around then it's a different story. Oh, if you plan to work the sales-floor keep in mind people know what you're doing, no matter how discreet you think you are being walking around doing practically nothing in a big store. The guests (god forbid, I say ""customers"") aren't all bad, but they're definitely not all that great either. If you plan to work here, just remember to always have a positive and approachable attitude. Team Leaders love to play the favorite game so get on their good side. HR was super friendly and approachable at first, but once you're in that attitude changes real fast. They became rude and unapproachable. I never truly feel comfortable coming to them. You do learn a lot working in different areas of the store with being cross-trained. Just ask. The job isn't all bad if you're in high school or just graduated and need something part-time. That's all you'll ever be though is part-time, unless you're a Team Leader or any position higher than an average Team Member."
good,"I was a sales associate in the clothing department, but I worked all around the store. Management was just bad, plain and simple. I didn't get close to my co-workers. The hardest part of working there was I never got good hours even with open availability and it was also minimum wage. What I did like about it was the benefits and shopping discounts."
good,It's an OK place to work if you like repetitive activities. Most team leads are pretty decent. The hardest part of the job is dealing with some customers who thinks they are owed something. The best part is you get to meet some pretty interesting people.
good,"The work was hard, the hours were long, and recognition was sparse. I loved what I did, but I knew it was not something I would do for the rest of my life."
good,"Was a good job i loved my responsibility, management played favoritism, I realized costumer service is more than taking a product back and handing a costumers money back. Costumers can be very rude but remember to be polite and positive. You can make a big difference in someone's day if you take the time to make sure you do everything you can for the costumers satisfaction"
good,Management at my particular store is not up to par. Overall job duties are not bad but management makes day-to-day activities harder than need be. Great job culture and generally has a fun atmosphere but when management isn't right everything else suffers.
good,"A place for the younger audience to get a job and start working. As an associate for a few years I felt like there was not a lot of room for advancement and if they wanted to let you go, instead of firing you, cut your hours to make you quit."
good,Work for then at least 19 years.  It was great work until I injuried myself then I was treated as a hostile to them.  My injury was a shoulder and knee ( MCL) and I had problems doing my job.  Target let me go 90 days after my surgery was completed.
good,"help me develop strong communication skills. I enjoyed working there, the thing that I didn't like is that target does not promote within he company. that's not good because there are hard working people in the company that deserves a manager position."
good,I loved working for target because it was my very first job and they gave me a chance to make money for my son and learn how it is to work and being responsible. if it weren't for target i honestly wouldn't know if i would of been able to get any other jobs because with out target i wouldn't have any kind of experience.
good,All job duties in a day have to be done by the time the shift ends. My coworkers were fun to work with when we could spend time together.  The hardest part of the job was to get each and every duty done no matter how hard the work load.
good,"Its a good job, not a career. Long days, terrible holiday hours."
good,"Been with the company for over 10 years and seen a lot of changes.  There is a growing ""management"" culture.  By this I mean that managers do little to contribute to the work that needs to be accomplished and spend more time standing and pointing at what needs to be done rather than actually helping.  Being a publicly traded company they are always asking for more from less and now the salaried management is contributing less."
good,"A typical day at work is they give you a part of the store to ""zone"", clean and straighten up to make it easy for guests to shop. Assist guests and respond to back up cashiering. I've learned a lot since being there, mostly a lot of merchandising. Management is decent. The hardest part of the job is they're not willing to work around my school schedule. I'm a full time student and my availability is 20-25 hours and they insist on scheduling me over 30. Every time I speak with HR they tell me to find people to cover and they deny my availability submitted online and won't take hand written schedules. So that can be very frustrating."
good,Stocking and selling is what you do day in and day out as well as zoning.
good,Working was fine with Target until hours were cut severely and was barely able to scrape by with paychecks.
good,"In a typical day I'd start off by making daily announcments over the loud speaker. Then I'd print out sales reports, meal compliance, and other relating reports. Afterwards I'd start on fixing punch corrections and going over schedules made by the Executive department heads to ensure payroll hours are available. Throughout the day I solve employee concerns with paychecks or benefits. Also, I'd post notices around the break and office area. I also controlled the employee entrance by buzzing them in and I also answered the phone, directing each call to its appropriate department. Distributing PDA's and other equipment to employees was another daily task included in my job description."
good,"I have worked for Target for a long time and have seen a lot of positive and negative changes over the years. Target tries to stay up on trends, but it is such a large corporation that it is very slow moving. Changes can take years. Management is hit or miss, depending on the store. Some are micro-managers, and some are really laid-back, helpful people. There is also an uneven way that females are assigned duties, and this is across every store. Ladies, if you want a job on the sales floor, they will put you in apparel. Once you are there, they will not let you out because it is a more challenging area to work. No one else wants to work there. I say this because of the sheer volume of items to be put away. The sales floor staff probably put away a truckload of apparel that was tried on each day. There is very light staff on the floor, especially in apparel. We are a high-volume store and only have three people staffed in apparel for the entire day. You will work very hard, and receive very tiny raises. Average in my store was 15 cents for a year. You will be pestered at team meetings (they are called huddles) to pester the guests. The main reason for this is to give them the false impression that there are more staff than there really are. If you want to learn to do something new, if they like you, you will get a chance to learn it. There can be very uneven treatment, and I see certain people get zeroed in on,and this was encouraged when I was a team leader. My boss told me to coach certain employees for doing the same things that others were doing, just because she didn't like"
good,"A typical day at work would be assisting guest at customer service. Trying to help guests get the best experience and provied them with great service that i could possibly do. I learned to have more patients with guest and provide a better service. Although the management was often changing it was hard to really communicate to them due to the fact that management could keep transfering, but overall ok. Co-workers  varied as well. Some were kind while others were rude but we all worked well as a team. The hardest part of my job was trying to help a frustrated guest. What i enjoyed about my job was providing a fast fun and friendly service."
good,"Enjoying working with pp. from all over the world !"
good,"Awful work life balance even though they emphasize it. My manager was awful and didn't know what he was doing which is pretty common in Target. As an ETL my life was consumed by my store. I had no time to enjoy it. I had a boss who told me every day I was doing a terrible job, which was completely demoralizing."
good,"Worked as an overnight team member during holiday season in 2008 and then attempted to get on as a career in 2011.  The job lasted me 1 week in 2011 and I left due to poor management.  Even during my previous engagement in 2008, I noticed a lot of issues with management being very disrespectful to the people working on the truck, in the stock room, and on the floor.  Maybe it's a different world during the day time and during operating hours, but it's definitely not a place I recommend for work on the overnight shift unless you are able to take a lot of abuse from your management team."
good,"When I started at target it was great. They went above and beyond to demonstrate their appreciation and flexibility, but after the red card scandle started to make very ridiculous changes."
good,Fun but had work. I enoyed my co-workers as well as the guests
good,"Co-workers worked as a team, however, they were picky and unwilling to give people a chance to try different areas.  Overall, I would say that store had more potential fifteen years ago. No overtime except on Black Friday and Christmas, (store isn't open on Christmas by the way)."
good,They are very flex-able for scheduling. They a very good a volunteer work which is nice.
good,"Target is a great place to make friends.  Very, very hard to advance as their interviews are scripted and if you don't secure enough keywords in your answers you will miss on advancement."
good,you have to work there to know how you feel about the place. Upper management needs work.
good,Target as a whole is a great company with great vision. depends on what store as to the business variations. You will meet some really great people there.
good,"Since coming back to Target after a long LOA, the position I now find myself in is very slow and does not keep me active. The Team members I work with are fantastic people, with pleasent and fun personalities. Since the economy has affected all who work at Target, many people are looking for better paying jobs where they can contribute more to what they want to be doing. The hardest part of the job is to remain in a position that has no room for advancement in the company. As I have said before , Team members are what make the job enjoyable and majority of the guests that shop there."
good,"The typical shift at work began with unloading the truck(s) which consisted of 700-2000 items, weighing between 5-80lbs. If not assigned to work on the truck I was assigned to work the line sorting items to their specified location in the store. After unloading and sorting items the next step was stocking items, which consisted of rolling over items while making sure no products had spoiled or were in the wrong location. If there was time left in the shift, picking up trash and cardboard was the next item on the list. "
good,"My typical day is to reset aisles and make sure my team is where they need to in order to be as productive and efficient as possible. I have learned team management, how to get effective productive workers to perform as you would like them to, and also many planning skills.  The management at this store is very stressful the expectations are too high for the leaders in the building.  My co-workers are great but have the same stress that i endure everyday which wheres on us.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the management and the most enjoyable part is the people I work with."
good,"Great company in theory, but difficult hurdles in practice, especially for those in the Information Security field. If you can wear a suit, manage people, and improve profit margins then this is the place for you. But if you want to provide strategic risk and be a respected 'specialist' in your field, this culture won't understand or appreciate such a skill set. Well, at least they didn't before the breach, so who knows if that will change or not."
good,Customer service is rewarding.  I have enjoyed both jobs and the amount of activity involved.
good,"large work stations - no shared desks, fun environment, great employees, good pay, solid training, limited flexibility with scheduling"
good,"hard work unloading truck,separating clothes from boxes, then putting them on shelves etc."
good,When I was working there I either stocked the store at night for a week schedule or I opened the store in my department. I learned about some electronic products that I had not been familiar with before. Did not communicate with my management much but the leads were good at their jobs. My co-workers made my days fun and enjoyable. I don't believe that I had a hard part to my job but when I returned from deployment there was no job position there for me which in all technicality I could sue them for that. I enjoyed the friendships I built there and still have.
good,"I worked for Target for a little over two years. I was a cashier/team trainer. Overall the experience wasn't bad. However, this is not a place to work if you have a family. The schedule is always different, but what can you expect, it's retail. I was constantly told that I should be more flexible with my schedule. Which is pretty hard to do as a mother of two. I hated that they time your cashiering. Sometimes you can't help if the guest is taking forever to count out $30.00 in quarters, nickles, and dimes lol. But I did work with some pretty awesome managers. They tied to make it fun. But ultimately, target is retail. So unless you want to spend your lifetime working their odd schedule, I would suggest making it a go between job, or seasonal."
good,"The hours and pay were bad. My coworkers were nice."
good,"After getting to work at 4am people are grumpy and not very happy. Some workers get into verbal arguments and management does not get on there case. People actually doing there work get yelled at more than the people fooling around because it seems to me that management is a little intimidated by some of the workers. after your shift is over the managers will make sure they find you before you get out the door and ask you to stay longer, it seems to be implied that if you dont get the job done even after your shift is over, that they will find someone who will and it may cost you your job."
good,"Always enter with a smile and hoped to brighten other people. (team members and guests)"
good,"A typical day at work is sum what busy at times. Not too busy in the day and busy in the night. Guest get a little messy by leaving merchandise on the floor and our job is to keep the store zoned and according to floor plan. So trying to pick up after these guest is extremely stressful, but by the end of the day my co-workers and I will always get it all together. I will have multiple calls all at one time and transfer to the right destination. The stressful part of that is our team members will be too busy to answer the call and calls will ring right back. So guest will get angry, but I would end up helping the guest out myself. After all of the team members day we will always help and enjoy each other along with all the managers. The managers will always try to attend to our needs."
good,"Enjoyed working during the holiday season"
good,typical day at target would start off by going to the department i was assigned to. i first gathered the merchandise that needed to be place back in correct spot.insured clothing was size and hung properly. i was also assigned to the register to provide excellent costumer service by assisting customers of any questions or concerns. i also promoted our company debit and credit card. most importantly insuring proper cash handling
good,"cashier, stocker, packaged bags and gifts, and pricing items"
good,"One thing bad, was having to push there 5% credit card or check cashing card when folks just wanted to get out and on there way"
good,"A typical day working at Target was with me either cashiering or doing go backs. I learned how to do go backs in every department. I learned how price accuracy and how to help customs find what they are looking for. The management at Target was a lot nicer when I first started, before I left I felt like the managers were more the new employees and not for people that have been working there first. I felt like my co-workers played games to much and didn't give 100% every time they came to work and as a result I would have to do three more go backs. The hardest part of this job was trying to do a cart full of go backs with in fifteen minutes plus helping three or four customs at a time. I really did enjoy helping customs find what they came for."
good,I feel that the higher management team is about self and not for the store. I've learned a lot when the last store manager was there and she made sure that I leaned everything possible to move up the latter. My co-workers which is not much have moved on because of the store manager.
good,"Target is a good place to work, I think i worked so hard at this company because i enjoyed helping people. I enjoyed learning new things and also teaching others. I think there always is some communication issues between the managers and team members and these were things that got out of hand. You seen a lot of  managers putting down others and really not there to help or teach their team members. But i didn't let that affect me and that was the reason why i did things different and made sure i was there to help out anyone and teach them anything they needed help with. I enjoyed my job and my team members."
good,Worked Target for 4 years and never got anything decent in return. I learned that you need a degree if you want to further rise up in the ranks of management. co-workers range from teens who are fresh out of school to adults who been team members and worked there for several years. pay is by far laughable and each team member my department got a better raise than me and worked there the longest and i've trained every new employee that came in my department. hardest part is dealing with some of the managers and other co-workers.
good,"I enjoyed working at Target, although you were always busy."
good,"Target is a great place to work for your first job out of college. The starting pay for an Executive Team Leader is more than decent and you get a lot of knowledge and experience. One thing that stands out right away is that one is put into a category when first hired: High Potential, Doing well with potential, strong contributor, etc. They quote a change of position approximately every 18 months or so(with an attached increase in pay), but truthfully, unless your in that ""High potential"" or ""Doing well with potential"" category, this is unlikely. They however d keep ""dangling that carrot"" in front of you with more promises they don't intend to keep."
good,It was an okay first job. Everyone sort of did their own thing. No sense of team.
good,A typical day is usually busy. I have learned great team work. Management needs work. Great co-workers. The hardest part of the job is getting hours. The discount.
good,"I checked out items for the customers and held conversations with these people who loved that about me, while others are very rude and anti-social. I loved this job, but i was not appreciated or recognized for all my hard work."
good,this particular store did not care to much for the workers there. they never got equipment for us to do our job effectively.
good,"Very busy, customer oriented. Must be able to move fast. Co-workers were good people. Management is top heavy."
good,Was a fun place to work that lacked upper management skills and experience
good,"A typical day at my job was answering and directing all the phone calls to the store, sorting CARTS of reshop, cleaning my area and making sure it looked presentable and ready for the next day, and leading the team (7-8 people) throughout the night in order to get their jobs done."
good,"I've been trying to move up in the company without success, even though I am more than qualified. Raises are yearly and always les than $.50."
good,"The people I was around made the job easier to work with, the job was pretty mind numbing - throw and work pallets early in the morning. They did change your schedule on you without warning and would publicly call you out on it in front of your peers during team meetings."
good,"Hire, train and supervise a team that responds quickly to guests’ needs, questions or issues, plus keeps check lanes, the parking lot, food service area, restrooms and guest service areas properly signed, clean"
good,"I worked there for a short time during the holiday season. While I expected to be swamped because of that, I was still hoping to get properly trained. First day was cashier training, which was easy to do and kept you busy for the holiday season. The second day was nerve wracking. I was the closing shift for Electronics. Since I had no experience or proper training of the PDA, it was kind of a brutal experience, not only for me, but for the guests."
good,"Working for Target was similar to being in high school again; everyone was gossipy, rude, and the management was sort of like the 'jock squad' that kept it going.  I called in sick only once because I was seriously ill and was reprimanded for it, and was harassed and gossiped about by a male coworker for the entirety of my time working there.  Rumors were spread about myself and other coworkers and the management, including the HR Rep that was supposed to discourage that sort of thing, would often take part in it.  As far as actual work, the training was poor at best, and I was actually trained by an employee who was in a completely different area than me (I was a cashier, she was in the backroom) so she had no idea how to train me, which led to mistakes during the work day, and if someone couldn't keep up with everyone else they were ridiculed about it, often publicly.  Thank goodness I was only a seasonal employee because the short time I was there was almost too long.  I would discourage anyone from applying here."
good,You can be yourself without judgement. Open minded management. Will work with you on any matter that arises.
good,"Target is a GREAT COMPANY, especially of you are Team Leads or Executives. There is nothing you can't learn, every department is fairly easy to work in provided you have the right amount of time and help on the floor."
good,There is a lot of pressure on the cashiers. We are the last impression the guest receive on there shopping experience. We as cashiers could change a bad experience into good one. 
good,"a good job if the ""higher uos"" are good people."
good,"The backroom position is hard physical labor for low pay. You basically carry heavy boxes up and down ladders all day scanning in the merchandise into the company's inventory system using PDAs and you need to work very fast. Management does a poor job of supervising or even helping. Some of your co workers end up slacking off making the work load harder on the good employees."
good,"Worked as temp cashier for 2011 Holiday season. Very High Volume store. The work was ok and hours were plentiful."
good,Target is a good place to work if it's your first job or a side job. They work with you if you need specific days off or need time off. Almost no advancement opportunities and poor pay and benefits.
good,A typical day at work was planned and you knew exactly what the daily workload which needs to be completed. Management team was fair and resourceful when needed. Co-workers were friendly but have to be cautious. Hardest portion of this job is working the 10 hour minimum required from the Executive Team Leader. The most enjoyable part of this job was the team building events.
good,"Every day at the store always brings something different to the table. Throughout my years with the company I have learned a lot of things that will help me as a progress with my professional life. There are many management skills and leadership skills that Target has to offer and team their team members. The most difficult part of the job is making those long term culture changes in both the store and the company, but in the end all the hard work pays off. The best part of the job was the team moral and the relationships developed with the leaders in the building. "
good,I have learned how to communicate with others very well. The hardest part of my job is the people i work with and the most enjoyable part is making the guest smile and going above and beyond to make sure they get exactly what they need.
good,"I learned all my customer service skills working for Target. Never a slow day, Very Fast paced!"
good,"It is a great job to work through school with. They will work with your schooling and any changes that you may have through the school year. Had trouble after 5 years moving up in the company, they tend to let your hard work go unnoticed.  "
good,A typical day at work varies depending on the time of year and day of the week. I have learned much about sales and communicating effectively with guests. Co-workers work usually but sometimes slack when management is not on a close eye. The hardest part of the job would be working with the public during the holidays because of the stress levels with both parties. The most enjoyable part of my job would be satisfying the guest and obtaining the exact item they are looking for.
good,I like helping the guests and fellow employees being a team player when they ask for help! learning differnt work centers in the store. Hardest part of the job is the callouts on the team and dealing with poor performers. 
good,". steady work"
good,"Target is Wal Mart with better public relations. Seriously . . don't let them fool you.  They purposely hire immigrants to unload truck and stock shelves because they know they can work them to death . . but smile . . you're at Target :). Oops, wait, that wasn't ""brand"" If you can kiss the brown bullseye, you'll succeed at the red bullseye. "
good,"Typical day at work I maintain sales floor interact with customers, i learn new things everyday whether its price accuracy, or in customer service.My co workers are very fun and sometimes helpful. Management is okay!"
good,Never had an HR person for longer than 3 months. Managers continually change. Communication was terrible.
good,I was the Electronics Team Member and POG Team Member.
good,"Ambiente di lavoro piacevole, colleghi di lavoro simpatici e affabili."
good,Fast past environment sometimes co workers are not always helpful
good,Too slow for me. I learned about customer service and how to be patient with different situations. Hardest part about the job would be the late shifts. The best part would have been the Target discount.
good,"Maintaining a fast pace to keep up with shipment requirement. The process of shipping products to stores was a learning experience. Management could have been more informative with progress of requirements for job,. Co-workers were very supportive in helping others with progress of job requirement. The hardest part of the job was the hours of work being balance with daily life. Most enjoyable part of the job was accomplishing the task."
good,"I loved the job,and got along well with co workers just was not making enough,and I was not getting enough working hours."
good,I enjoyed working at Target it was a good clean enviroment. I made alot of friends while there and the company was good to work there.
good,got to be outside inter actting with customers fun co-workers good pay loved it
good,Work life balance is not priority. You must work weekends and nights and long hours.
good,"A typical shift at Target consisted of zoning (straightening) shelves, putting away reshop (items returned by guests), covering breaks in the Electronics department (which I was not properly trained for), assisting guests in finding what they needed, and helping out on register when the store was busy. Although I enjoyed helping guests and working with my peers, the management at Target was highly lacking. The communication between team leaders and executives was nonexistent, leading to confusion among team members who were given two or three different projects to work on in a short span of time. Overall I would not recommend this job to others, at least not at this specific location. The highlight of the job for me was guests who were appreciative when I took extra time to assist them finding something or with a price. The hardest part of the job was staying on task, not through any fault of my own, but because I was often asked to juggle many things at once by multiple leaders."
good,it would be better if they let you work longer hours. they only let me work 12 hours at first then took it down to 8
good,did the same thing everyday. just didnt get enough hours enjoyed working with the team members that i worked with
good,"A typical day in target express was an early start to load up the van with deliverys and get ready for the long day ahead,I learned a lot in Target like people skills and dealing with customers on a daily basis."
good,Basic Retail Workplace with only and emphasis on profits and not employees.
good,Owed me back pay from when i was hired and instead of paying me they took the back pay and more out of my banking account after putting the money in my account and they left me at negative. And now they wont answer my calls or see me to get this resolved
good,You are responsible for meeting customers needs in filling and dispensing their prescription needs.
good,A normal day there seems like a lot of work but it's really not unless your actually doing what is needed of you. My learning experience is that things can get easier if you let it. my co-workers are amazing we always have a god time and work really well with one another. But the hardest part is when people leave yo with majority of the work and they just leave you. what i enjoy the most is some of the guest that always comes in to talk I love it.
good,"I would check guests out, bag their merchandise and help them fill out credit card applications."
good,Most people have worked there for so long they are family. People are great.
good,"A typical day starts off with taking abandon carts for your area and putting the items back on the floor. Next, you would check the back for any pulls for your area and work those out onto the floor. During the day you repeat this process until your shift is over. However, for the closing team they would have to start cleaning up their area, or ""zone"", at a certain time which is generally 6 hours before the store closes. Once the zone is completed you run everything you picked up and sort and run them, unless they're other areas' items which you would take up to guest services and have them sort them out. After everything is put away, you have to wait for the Leader On Duty, or ""LOD"" for short, to dismiss you to go home. I have learned how to use a cash register, multi-line phone, multi-task, and how to use a punch clock. Management depends on which manager is working that day, some actually pitch in and help while others merely walk around giving you tasks to do, especially the Store Team Leader or ""STL."" I like my co-workers quite a bit, they're fun to work with in softlines. I think the hardest part of my job is having to work in the fitting room. When you're in the fitting room you not only have to zone the area around it, do re-wraps, find prices for items, clean the fitting rooms, and help guests you also have to act as the store phone operator transferring calls around the store to the appropriate areas or people to handle the call. That means you have to know where everything is in the store in order to send the call to the right area, which is difficult when you only"
good,i went into work at 11pm scanned the product off of the truck then stocked two departments sometimes more...a shift for me would end about 5 or 6 am...i made some really great friends over the years...the hardest part was adjusting to overnight hours...managment was not easy to please and a lot of other people left the company for that reason...i for one did not feel apprciated or valued for being there for so many years... and that is not a good feeling...
good,It was okay untill they started hirring non friendly ETL'S
good,Stocking Shelf's with no customers made it easy. Seeing all new stuff before anyone else is nice.
good,"Low pay, late nights, no benefits. I left for better opportunities."
good,"Overall, Target can have a busy but yet friendly environment. Management can be more productive and better in their communication area. The hardest part of this job is to be able to satisfy every single guest that reports to the customer service desk based on store policies. What I enjoy most is the friendly environment from the guest and the flexible work hours."
good,Target is very organized and good for those who are in high school and are looking to network. You meet tons of people and learn how to use various equipment including a pallet and PDA
good,"Management changes all the time, horrible ""executive"" managers,"
good,Retail job with standard wages at or barely above minimum wage. Store culture where I worked was very political and machiavellian. Advancement was difficult for the average employee and subject to the whims of the store management.
good,"Great place to work if you feeling like being challenged, management challenges you to do your best, but perception culture still there."
good,I worked on the sales floor this job was hard around the holidays. It was really busy then
good,stocking and cashier
good,Overall its an ok work place with fun events that include crafts and food. A typical work begins at 7 am going to specific locations and counting product. The management needs a little improvements in regards appreciating good talent. My co-workers are the people who make the job work.The hardest part of my job it has no opportunity for growth.
good,"A typical day at work depends on the area in which you work, and since I work in numerous work centers it varies. I will not say this for the corporation as a whole, but for the stores that I have worked in there are too many people that have the ability to delegate responsibility for others without the correct communication, thus making it difficult to decipher exactly who's directions should be followed and in what order. The most fulfilling part of the job is also at the the worst. Servicing guests can be very rewarding in helping them obtain what they want, especially children; however it can be difficult dealing with disgruntled guests and generally cleaning their trash and food, often at times without the correct equipment with which to do so. Management could be improved easily with better direction, communication, and care, also if they were more willing to help when short staffed, etc."
good,"I was in the asset protection department so my typical day of work was making sure that nothing goes missing from the store. I learned how to operate security equipments, and how to work with people from different backgrounds. The management was good at getting emplyees prepared and ready for the next step and meeting was always held in the morning to listen to everyone's ideas and complaints to make the job easier and better. I will say that the hardest part about the job was standing on your feet throughout the duration of the shift and the most enjoyable part was meeting people and helping them with their wants."
good,i enjoyed working at roosevelt roller hockey rink. the staff was very inviting and welcomed me as their own. though i only worked there for a few months i learned alot about team work and helping others when they need it.
good,after the holidays are over with your really not getting any hrs
good,Customer Focus is number one at the cost of their employees.
good,"A typical night in logistics, starts off with assigning team members to work centers. The unloading of a GM truck and on a food truck night a food truck."
good,"assisting customers with locating products, ensuring designated area is clean and picked up. cashing customers out."
good,"Target has good pay and benefits, but the schedule makes it hard to have a good work/life balance. Also, if you are not placed in to a high-performer plan early on, your chance for advancement is very slow."
good,"I love working at Target, My main problem is that it takes away so much time from my kids, I always end up having to stay at work late, causing me to miss my childerns mile stones, I almost missed the birth of on of my 4 children."
good,its an ok place but pay and treatment at times are not that great. i learned how to work with others even when your day is not going so well.
good,"Busy. Good Training, Good managers, cool people to work with, stressful most days, working with the public is great."
good,"A typical day at work for me is just making sure the guests get checked out properly and making sure it's done in a fast, fun, and friendly way. I've learned how to work with people and how to interact with people. Some of the management there is okay, but some of the management is a little iffy. Most of my Co-workers are friendly. I don't have a problem with anyone. The hardest part of the job is trying to get the guest to apply for the RedCard which isn't really hard but if people always decline it's like you're not trying but you really are."
good,Management was overall good but lacked consistancy and communication. Showed favortism regularly as well as lack of control.
good,"I started my job at target not quite sure what to expect. Never before had I worked in such a large store, better yet one that was also a sizable retail giant in it's own right. A typical day would usually consist of me maintaining the backroom, ensuring that the shelves were stocked neatly and correctly. I would remove damaged boxes or merchandise to a area where they would be disposed. From 11am to 6pm, I would pull designated merchandise from the shelves on an hourly basis, which would then be taken by sales floor employees who would move it to areas in the store. There were times where I would sometimes need to operate machinery or use a ladder to reach high places where items were kept, as well as lifting heavy objects. In the downtime, I would sweep the floor, empty the garbage, or clean out the cardboard compactor. Occasionally I would need to assist a customer in finding extra quantities of an item we did not have on the sales floor. At times I would also be asked to assist sales floor teams members in setting merchandise. I learned how to perform my duties in a timely and efficient manner, and how to assist customers in need. Management was hit or miss. Both myself and other co-workers felt that some of management was not very efficient or practical, but there were a select few who performed more than adequate. I had little to no conflicts with my co-workers, and some of them are now friends that I spend time with out of the store. For me, the hardest part of the job was staying on time during the more busy times. After working for a few months there, I did improve"
good,Great company to work for but not very understanding of having school or work to do a long with family.
good,Making sure the paperwork is enter for the outbond shipments to the stores. Locating the up coming Ads to ensure the delivery is on time to the Dc. Entering all data for receving of the goods to the DC and scheduling of the Inbound trailers to the DC.
good,Typical day at work is I usually start around 5pm leave a litle after midnight I restock the Grocery department then I start to zone the management is great The co workers are friendly the hardest part of the job would have to be making sure the fresh and full is done in our pfresh department
good,"Turning into Wal-Mart! It was a great place to start a career, but they started trying to get rid of some of the employees who had been there for 10+ years. I decided to leave when I saw what was happening."
good,Target started off exciting but changed when management changed. Job became very stressful and unfair in some instances. The space for advancement is slim due to the fact that management overlooks your work ethic and performance. Your annual raise is depend on the store sales not your individual work. The hardest part about the job working in the HR Dept. was thinking of random acts of kindness for an entire month without repeating it. Random act of kindness means to do something cost efficient but fun and friendly for the team.
good,"its ok i bowl out products stock them i learned how to scan read labels, co workers ok. all products must be off the floor by 8:00am its a challenge but it keeps you busy my supervisor is nice and hard working. i like when the day ends and my job is done."
good,"I was the only logistics team lead to be promoted from within the store. In my seventeen months at Target, I saw three Replenishment Managers leave as well as worked with three temporary Replenishment Managers. In addition to the high manager turnover, the stressful job environment led to high team member turn over."
good,A typical day at work starts with pushing any stock from the back room that has an empty spot on the shelve before the truck is unloaded. Once the truck is unloaded all the boxes are pushed to the aisle and unpacked.
good,"Management has been very encouraging to meet deadlines and in hearing the suggestions of team members. The job is physically demanding but when we are able to work as a team we are very productive and meet deadlines and goals. I have learned a great deal since I have began and plan to continue. Most team members are friendly, helpful, and supportive."
good,"Everyday the workload is the same. No advancements were available to workers. Management would find every which way out of working, then blame you for not finishing. Hardest part of the job is living up to expectations that go beyond physical limits. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to leave on your scheduled time."
good,Management doesnt really care about your needs or your wants to succeed and do better. I would never work there again.
good,"A typical day at work is usually a consist movement, I've learned more about retail, and the requirements that must be met in order for the store to function properly. Management here is young and still learning. I feels like high school often as there's a popularity contest that's going on. My co-works keep me sane, we work together as a real team and always help when need."
good,Great place to work in from time to time. Problems do arise but there are also good times. Love the co-workers and how every one gets along (from my perspective).
good,"Unload truck & unpack merchandise, put all new merchandise on sales floor, answer calls, and questions, deal with problem solving issues. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping other's"
good,Can be a fun place to work. The work days can get boring with not much to do. The management changes alot so if you get lucky with good leaders then it helps.
good,Working at Target was great. The management does has some kinks to work out though.
good,"It was lots of fun, one must be in good shape and not a lager as the pace is fast"
good,I was worth the while but now I'm beginning to get older and have ore responsibilities. Which leads me to say I need a higher salaried paid job
good,"This is likely common with big box retail, but there is constantly way to much going on with too little labor hours. The culture that is promoted is that Target is your life, and everything else falls behind it so there is no respect for a work life balance. However, if you have a high school degree, you can get into the lowest level of management that offers some really excellent insurance and other benefits. There were plenty of managers that stayed with Target simply because they had to have those benefits for their family members."
good,Co-workers are very friendly and easy to get a long with. Depending on the area to work in the team leads can really be on your case.
good,Not muchroom to grow.i worked for target for seven yrs in the recieving dept. And i loved it till i was denied a position to advance morethan a fewtimes
good,"If you are a 20-something-years-old, newly graduate, very ambitious, want to go up the ladder at a fast pace, single with no children, then this job maybe for you. As an ETL-RX (RX Manager), you need to be aware that you will be spending a lot of time on paperwork. The amount of paperwork you'll have to do is enormous, more than any other retail company out there. Every month you'll have to write up ""Leadership Status"" and meet with the store manager (non-pharmacy person). If your pharmacy scores are ""Green"", then it's not too bad. But if they are ""yellow"" or ""red"", be prepared to be chided, criticized like a kid. Since you are also a pharmacist, you will be busy filling prescriptions, you won't have time to do much of your manager tasks during work time. You will end up spending your days off doing paperwork at home to catch up. Benefits and perks are pretty good. Just be aware of the time you'll have to spend on paperwork and meetings, and you won't be compensated for the extra time that you put in for those tasks. Keep your opinions to yourself although you'll be told that they are valuable. Everything you want to do will have to go through the store manager. Things have changed drastically this past year and they are going to get even worse (for pharmacists). Don't believe all the hypes."
good,"Fun people to work with, good learning experience, fairly easy job. Major issues with management playing favorites and not seeing who is really doing all the work."
good,After almost 100 injuries in the first year they couldnt admit that maybe some of the problem was there fault not the employes. You have a better chance of getting a job in manegment if you are hired with a degree and start as a manager. If you get a job and then get a degree the chances of you advancing is slim to none. There words not mine.
good,"It's a retail position where I did everything I was ask, then some, and wasn't compensated for it. I knew how to do most positions, but never promoted."
good,"I worked for target for a little less than a year and i left them because they would not let me advance my employment, nor would they acknowledge the work i did. I enjoyed working there besides the complaints i just listed. Some of the people are nice and very encouraging."
good,Target has a corporate culture that is all it's own. Learning to navigate in that culture can be a full time job in and of itself. Target is ever-changing to stay on top of the market. All employees must learn to adapt to changes in policy and technology very quickly. If you love learning new things and are not afraid of change then this aspect of the job can be very exciting. Target also provides fair compensation and benefits to its employees.
good,"Alway had good time after finsih work, Very easy to ge along with teams."
good,"I worked on the early morning freight crew for two years. The pay was pretty good, especially with the shift differential. The hours varied widely anywhere from 4 hours a day to 12. I never knew when I would be going home, and had to ask for permission daily before ending my shift."
good,"Target as a company is very successful and secure. However, it is very hard to have a work/life balance, especially if you are a parent or have any non-work related responsibilities. It was a great experience and I have learned a ton, but do not recommend."
good,I hated that job because there was favortism. People who did less work were commended more than people who worked hard as well as were promoted before the hard workers.
good,If you end up working in the DC. It's more or less like an unwelcome but welcome greeting. Only a handful of the people are nice. And management kinda sucks. Only one boss around and he's never there when you need him. When I was there I was meeting everything I was asked to meet and I thought I was working effective... But I wasn't fast enough I suppose.
good,"Very flexible hours. Paid biweekly which never works well for me. Lots of work, underpaid. Management is not coordinating as one hierarchy, everyone's in it to win it which causes issues for the employees."
good,"Overall a fun and fast place to work, i personally just ended up worthing with less than decent co-workers. This go around was my second time working here and it was alot better the first time"
good,"It's not a hard job, prepare to be working on inventory and lifting daily. Everyday is either truck shipments or replenishing. It's the same thing every day. The other workers there made it a fun experience. I didn't really learn anything new working here, it's a typical retail job. Hardest part of the job would be finding something to do when theres nothing to be done."
good,Target Management in Alexandria made it clear they were not fond of Marketsource team. Consistently made it clear they were attempting to remove entire unit from Target Team.
good,"Its a good place to work at if youre with the right people but theres just things that they dont prioritize even though they should in Overnight but Dayside seems to getvaway with alot so Overnight is awful,  dayside has people who dont do much and lean back cause no one really checks in on them if they come back with an empty cart from what they had to do"
good,"The pay is pretty decent, but hours keep getting cut because more people keep getting hired...it’s a good part time job if you’re a student or have another job."
good,"This job was great when I was in community college, and even as a buffer when I got out of college. Management was sometimes fickle and would tell you one thing, when they really mean another. I had trouble with a couple team leads and that was a more personal than professional matter on their part, in my opinion. And upper management seemed to side with them when all was said and done. Go in, keep your head low, and get paid. That's all I can say."
good,"Target in my option is more interested in the customer than it's employees"
good,"They often give you the schedule you don’t want even when your not available that time. They don’t give you full time, I get about 28-30 hours per week, and around January - March they cut hours to 17-19 hours per week."
good,I like Target store over all. Target themselves have great pay and the allow the stores to searve food to employee slot. But if you're not with the local click of Management the will assign dangerous tasks like using a ten foot ladder to retrieve a box bigger then yourself
good,Great place to work I just wish they would    Give people more opportunities for success. Instead of hiring a lot of people when there busy and letting them go. FYI I made it pass busy season Lol
good,"Target is a great place to get a jumpstart on your work history but with poor hours, bad management across the board in many stores and some ridiculous policies it is not worth trying to stay a long period of time. Be especially careful when applying as a seasonal employee do not get your hopes up for being kept on."
good,"Mangers expect way too much from employees, and give strict deadlines, which if you dont complete, the management will on you. Every day I come into work I immediately am stressed out by the amount of work there is to do. I am also constantly stressed out by the constant harassment of a certain manager."
good,"From the day I started working there I felt my training wasn't sufficient. I only found out ways to work efficiently from other work staff when I was supposted to be told how to so my job by management. I was scheduled constantly on days I said I could not work, my avalibility hours went ignored many times, and I was punished for their mistakes. Overall simple job with bad management."
good,was fun till they screwed  out of the job they hired to many people for the holiday and fired all extras for the smallest offense plus they failed to train me properly for the task at hand
good,I think the best part of working at target is the other workers... and I definitely got lucky with having a great team lead. But the employee discount is horrible- basically nothing! And you can’t even get it if you don’t have a red card or pay cash
good,"A typical day at work is different if you're in a different department day to day. if you're working in soft-lines or at the fitting room it's kind of similar, you go in, get your device at guest services, log in, pick up abandons( clothes people returned, etc) from guest services, then go to the fitting room and pick up clothes from the section you're working in after you find out what department you're working in. then put away clothes and fold them, sometimes you have to respond to fast service at the front end."
good,At first it was a fine place to work people were friendly and helped each other out. Later they increased the pay but cut the hour drastically and still expected the same amount of work to be accomplished in way less time.
good,I worked at target over 5 years ago. I wouldn't be able to explain my experience to anyone after such a long time away. The culture has probably changed alot since I was there.
good,Management could use some work as the main reason i quit was due to my team leader being unprofessional and making me dread coming to work. Our target seemed under staffed as well.
good,"Target is a decent place to work, but I think that the expectations are not realistic, especially for people who have a family. There was a lot of pressure and not enough recognition."
good,"A day at work involves meeting with various partner teams, understanding the requirements and make design decisions. "
good,Everyday you come in and are given numerous tasks that are never the same as the day before. These tasks are usually unobtainable due to lack of staff while management is calling you out over the team channel instead of offering solutions.
good,challenging work environment;  long work days; aggressive KPIs; ability to work and assimilate with a diverse group of people is a must.  Many integrated levels of leadership.
good,"Took job on as part-time 15-20 hours weekly prior to Christmas Season thinking it would continue but after Holiday season hours cut to 4 hours a week without any warning.  Enjoyed working there, but I don't think they really wanted senior citizens and/or older employees to be a permanent part of their workforce; communication with employees a concern."
good,Target is the kind of job where you enjoy the work because of the people you work with. Management figures don't always seem to have a firm grasp on leaderships skills and qualities.If you can be self sufficient and communicate you can move up quickly in the company.
good,"The longer I worked at Target, the more issues I seemed to come across. I was a full time student athlete working a part time job however, they didn't always schedule my hours according to my school schedule resulting in clashes. Although I often needed it, I never received any assistance from other employees enough though I was constantly told by my manager to ask. I often spent my time being a cashier than in my area doing the job I was hired for."
good,"I enjoy the people I work with, but the management there is a joke honestly. They pick favorites and it doesn’t matter if you work hard everyday and make a difference. If the management doesn’t  like you, your not moving up."
good,In general Target was a good place to work. I started out unloading the store trucks at 4 am  then ended up opening the store at 8 am.  I preferred working on the floor - straightening shelves and reloading  stock.  The cashier was not bad- I got to be with people all day
good,Target starts all employees off at 13.00 an hour regardless of team member position and work history. A typical day will consist of a heavy load of stock push onto the sales floor and guest service.
good,Not a good team . Uses you for benefits . Shows favoritism and everything like that . Few hours and unpaid meals . No support and bad communication. No boss
good,"A fairly standard job stocking shelves is what I did. Just go to the back, get items, stock items on shelves, repeat. Occasionally it's broken up by a customer asking a question or if they need someone to go outside to collect some carts. I didn't like how imbalanced some days would be though. One day they don't have hardly anything for me to move then another they'd expect me to move loads upon loads."
good,"It may be for some people, but I don’t feel like my training was up to par, my hours were low and inconsistent for the holidays and I was told by a manager that hours would be even more scarce after Christmas. I did not believe it was a job that had very much bang or buck and I am an adult with my own bills to pay. Very unfortunate that a corporation as large as target could not do better."
good,"Target is a great place to work. I unfortunately had a rather difficult experience working there because one of my managers did not like me so she would always schedule me when I had school. Other than this frequent mistake, working at Target was a very fun experience."
good,Doing more then you were hired to do. All employees had a responsibility and it was not done the way with order so customers could understand where things are put. Being said as my title I couldn’t say a word without managers telling me just go back to your Register. I didn’t get a opinion ever. They hired to many people and got paid same pay as me after working 1 year there. They lowered my hours and I was struggling . I was promised if I was open with how many hours a week I could Fulltime. That next happened.
good,"Running registers"
good,"Target was a great experience at a big retail company unfortunately it was only seasonal ."
good,"I’ve learned many things in the past two years at target, target is a really big company. I learned guest service , customer service, inventory , stocking."
good,Target hires a lot of young adults (ages 19-25) and need to implement an extensive employee training course on the importance of work place etiquette.
good,Target is a very busy place. You definitley have to be willing to work in a fast placed environment and be able to work under pressure. They constantly push you to promote red cards and some customers are so tired of it
good,"Worked at the El Cajon location for seasonal and was asked to stay on after the holidays, however I left because I was moving to attend school. Great company to work for and they are highly flexible. If you stay on long enough they do provide good benefits."
good,I like the advantage of working as a team and always learning new things from different seniors throughout the day. The culture is very diverse which is really fun getting to know new people in which later I am able to network with.
good,"No flexible hours."
good,A very family friendly place. Majority of the customers were very snobby but I could deal with it. Employees were very friendly. Great hourly wage. One thing I will say is one of the managers had it out for me and I felt like I had to get a different job and leave that one because of that he was very rude and disrespectful and was watching me like a hawk
good,"Target is colorful and inclusive. "
good,"I applied for a seasonal position as a stock person. I was super excited as I really was not expecting long hours. When the schedule came out it said one thing, but what was expected was totally different. You get off work once all of the truck and your section is done. I worked in beauty, so there was always a lot of items and most times I would be scheduled off at 1p but didn't leave until 3p."
good,It was tiring and painful. Could’ve been way better. Managers seemed like they were always mad. Got some help on training but not enough. Crew was nice.
good,"Was only there a short time met all my goals."
good,They put a lot of responsibility on people who weren’t getting compensated for it  then cut hours of a lot of people. Going to management for problems sometimes made them worse.
good,It’s a good job but the mangers sucks but outside of that the job is great people come to work and I like that but again the managers I feel like they suck
good,"Worked for target for 4 years, have cross-trained in ""8"" departments such as, "
good,The workplace has many caring people with great coworkers. It focuses on many things that helped the company advance. It was inclusive and often times understanding of different things that come up in a persons life.
good,"not alot of opportunities for advancement and management recognized the favorite employees"
good,Helps with building character and job experience. You can grow with the company fairly easy into a management position. Takes hard work and consistency
good,require there always be a manager in all areas or those with no experience within the target community will be lost and without help. i was often thrown into jobs i could not accomplish because someone other than a manager ran out of people and made me close the cafe to help them.
good,I enjoyed my job everyday. I became trained in every department and was good at my job. Management was poor due to a lack of communication between LOD's/supervisors. There are little to no benefits and no real opportunity at becoming full time.
good,I was told that they would work with my school schedule but they have been scheduling me on my class days. I have had to stay later than scheduled everyday that I have worked there since I have started.
good,Poor communication among management and high turn-over rate. Learned how to set planograms and lead a team. The hardest part of the job would be maintaining sets.
good,"Fast pace work environment, setting up the sales floor and also making it presentable for the guests.  Helping other departments when they call for assistance. Team meetings for daily work load."
good,The interactions with the guest was by far the best experience at target. However hard work truly went unnoticed and at times it felt as if the management based promotions solely on favoritism.
good,"It’s okay as long as you don’t care to move up or just do the job description. Advancement is only for those who are favorited, not for work ethic or capability. They will belittle you if you try to ask for a pay bump, even when you are doing and being expected to do work outside your pay grade."
good,It's was a good job you just work some crazy hour and they did not want to give no set hour.other than that it's was a good job.i was a cashier's custom service handle money credit card and helping guest.
good,"They hire everybody for part time hours except management, backroom, pricing & staging.  They are willing to give train you for different position within the store. But the do not adjust you pay for the other position you may be doing."
good,Learned a lot about management and working in a stressful retail company. I loved getting to know my customers and getting to talk to them and helping them out.
good,"Not for the slow , move fast or you wont be there long. Lives change on a daily basis. If it does ,the waiting period is way to long to make changes to your work schedule."
good,"It’s a ok job, not anything for a full time, most people are part time anyway. The management in this place it’s not the best. The management is very in organization and not always clear on what the job is. But very awesome co workers and nice place for part time"
good,"Target is a good company to work for.   At the distribution center the shifts are long, ten hours, but you only have a four day work week.  Each shift has two, twenty minute paid breaks and one thirty minute unpaid lunch break.  Work is repetitive and fast paced, but benefits are good."
good,Terrible management and they played favoritism amongst the employees. The work load was not hard at all but due to poor management I had to leave. They mostly acted like tyrants and often argued amongst the team members
good,"I worked at a ""test"" store, meaning procedures changed very frequently."
good,"Receiving Freight we had 2 breaks in a 12hour period, you learned how to receive Freight in a timely manner, management was not good, the culture was very stressful, the job was bending, twisting, and lifting between 25-75lb, the people I worked with"
good,"Fast, Fun, and Friendly were the motto at Target when I first started working there. It has been almost a decade since I first started and I must say it is pretty accurate. It is a very fast pace and you are expected to do a lot, but the people you work with make it worth it. Work-life balance is prominent, once you leave the store, they do not call you nonstop regarding the work. The only criticism is that management change a lot, and with that, so does the expectations of your work in the store."
good,Busy day with lots of tasks and guest service. Learned a lot about the electronics products. Management was hit or miss. Some really good managers but some that didn't work much.
good,once you leave their the hr dept have nothing to do with you and won't talk to you if you have a question and if you work as a tempory the employees have snobbish attitude towards you and look down upon the temp agency they hired like their are nothing
good,"Target does well with you at first, then grooms you for leadership. They don't fulfill their promises and end up hiring from the outside. I was dealing with a lot at the time and told my boss that I no longer wanted to be eligible for a leadership position, because it was no longer what I wanted. He kept pushing me to keep working for him and wanted to make me a team lead still. He clearly didnt respect my feelings and only wanted what benefitted him and the company."
good,"The job isnt a hard job, until your forced into changing your routines for the lack of support for the team management. I started out as a inbound crew member. ive been told a bunch of times to extend my work times, even though i cant. I was satisfied with my current 6 hour shifts, but the managers didnt want that.. also they work you alot.. i didnt have many days of for a part time job and it felt f like it was a full time job giving more work that others didnt do throughout the day"
good,"It's a lot of work and no time. Managers are often nice to your face but you will here them talking behind your back in their offices. If you request more hours or a different work center, you're likely to be told you're not good enough but if you stay then you're automatically the best worker in the store. It's a really messed up system and they get worse by the week."
good,Very bad management all in their younger 20’s. Not really handling problems or situations in a way that benefits all. Some racism and homophobia. Not well.
good,I’m only 17 right now but I have been working at target for 14 months now and it has gone downhill In a steep way to say the least. I’m a cashier there and I couldn’t possibly imagine better front lane supervisors and people I work with. I have zero complaints about employees working on my level or slightly above. But management is beyond horrible. You are treated poorly and never appreciated by upper management. My front lanes manager has screwed me over on multiple occasions due to being lazy and not caring about his workers. I have had vacations days auto-denied twice and even an availability change right before school so I was only paid roughly $150 for all of September. Management is always telling you how to do your job when I was asked how to put receipt paper in the self checkout machine by the fronts lanes manager. But to conclude the coworkers are PHENOMINAL and it’s nice to be able to help people that appreciate you but I’ve never even talked to upper management more than five times between any manager. Plus instead of just firing people they will cut hours down to the bone before you have to quit so they don’t have to pay severance. Multiple people I know that work there don’t even have a car even though they used to work 30-40 hrs/week. I would say the hardest part is just trying to appease every customer and the easiest was definitely just calm shifts where you didn’t have to deal with ridiculous customers. A typical day at work is normally 4-5.75 hours so they didn’t have to give you a lunch. The workplace culture is pretty good with the people you work with but
good,"Received boxes in the loading dock, stock the merchandise. It was a stressful job because we were timed and I did not like that at all.  The hardest part of the job was that the boxes were too heavy at time and sometimes I would hurt my back."
good,my fellow team members were amazing to work with but the upper management isn't focused on making the team members feel wanted. More focus on getting the hours everyone is working down than making sure they can actually live
good,"Though Target was a great place to work, I juggled another job at the same time with Target being my secondary job, so I never felt I ever fully accustomed."
good,"I understand the goals, but they can be unrealistic most of the times with what you have to do honestly, and management will be on top of you if you don’t finish all your areas, even if your understaffed, they can be pretty unreasonable sometimes."
good,The job itself is simple when you break it down. Changes and policies are added constantly that seem to move the employees backwards. If you are looking for something that can help with a busy schedule then this is the place.
good,"I worked there for almost 2 years. i loved the people i worked with however management sucked and was always changing around. they picked favorites and if you were not a favorite, you got whatever was left (hours and rewards wise). I could go from working 35-40 hours one week and then only getting 10 hours the next week. They were so unorganized and it just sucked all around for me."
good,Way too many hoops to jump through to get big picture stuff done. Not a bad first job. Management expects way too much for an hourly job that does not have a lot of room for promotion.
good,It required speed and accuracy. Management was less tolerant of personal issues that may have been interfering with work. Management seemed skewed in their judgement of employees. Example; speed of one employee vs another.
good,"Target taught me about team leadership and how important it is to stay organized. However, I felt overworked and underpaid. It took too long to advance to a lead position in overnight stocking."
good,"Working for the Starbucks located inside one, the general sense is a divide between other Target workers (including higher ups!) and those in the kiosk, day after day. Mix that with a general lack of empathy and communication for a call-off, no-call no-show, or someone quitting on the spot, and you get this mixed bag result. You either connect well  with the Starbucks team, or you’re better off in another department."
good,As my first job target was really great! But months and months went by and it drains you. The management there are completely misunderstanding. They don’t recognize the hard work and dedication you do for them. If you are looking to grow in the company and become a team leader or a manager for a specific department good luck! You have to be their favorite to make it to the top.
good,Worked at the fountain hills location. Management changed nine time in a year and people were taking LOAs due to stress. The day to day wasn't too difficult but poor direction from higher management made things tough.
good,There is no corporate loyality.Just raised wages but cut hours and have more responsibilities. Always short on help. Never enough cashiers scheduled. Guests are always upset about not enough cashier lanes open usually only 2 sometimes only one if employee calls out which happens a lot. It was getting to be Avery stressful job. very stress
good,"I am an enthusiastic, skilled learner, who likes to keep learning and exploring the opportunities around me. "
good,"Good company to work for. Can get a bit overwhelming working the grocery section. Sometimes a days work expected can be unrealistic and that can get very frustrating. Also, hours are never steady or rarely get 40 hours a week."
good,"Was pretty competitive, everyone wanted to be on top . No one really worked as a team. other than that, everyone was positive towards each other. . . ."
good,"Target was my first job and working there for several years I gained a work family, I learned how to interact with people on a daily basis and was fortunate to be well versed in other departments other than my main role. although some of the customers came off ugly I learned how to make the best out of those situations."
good,"Working at Target as a Barista can be fun sometimes but overall, it can be very difficult and stressful as you may be left alone for long periods of time with a line of guests out the door while still being expected to complete all daily tasks effeciently."
good,A little physical. Schedule subject to change often. It was a good job with a good team work mentality. A great learning curve to move forward from. Not a bad working experience.
good,"As a target team member, my job was to stock food on the shelves. I would also help customers find what they were looking for. The problem was that managers would give a large amount of work to a few team members and expect the task to be done. No matter how hard I tried or how fast I worked, I never was able to complete many tasks because of the shear amount of work that was given. There were never enough team members working at the same time to get anything completely done, so we were always behind in work."
good,"Was promised full time at the position, but only get around 25 hours a week unless it's convenient for them. Talked to bosses about taking on new responsibilities for more hours but they won't work with me there."
good,I enjoyed my time at Target. I am ready to start a new chapter in my life and advance my management skills. The work life balance has been tough to maintain. The long commute has been an untenable situation.
good,"The most ghetto place I have ever worked at in my entire life, I have been with target for almost a year and I can’t wait to desperately leave. Target has very horrible, horrible management and time management. It’s not target’s culture or employees that make it horrible it is truly the management, most managers are very unorganized and will make you start multiple tasks that is actually meant for 3 people’s s ONE , If you guys are thinking about applying? DONT especially NOT the apparel and accessories they will make you fold every thing throughout that entire store floor. Please don’t do it to yourself find a job that will actually PAY your correctly for your laborsingle person."
good,"Loved the pay, benefits and coworkers. There were some issues with certain upper managers and their less than acceptable behavior in terms of harassment and comments. Overall great place to work. Wish they would treat employees like humans and not just names on a spreadsheet, at times."
good,"The Target in Owings Mills management fired me for no reason, I had set days I was suppose to be off that they said okay to but when I came back fired me."
good,"Although the management at target were really bad, the community within target was helpful. the Job was pretty simple. one a typical day we just stood around or interacted with customers to wait until a customer needed activation of a new mobile device. I learned a lot about the phone sale industry, including how or what is needed to have a good plan for a phone. The hardest part was figuring out any problems that occurred during any activation of the devices I worked on. Honestly, the easiest jobs that I've ever had."
good,it was an ok paying job but the hours weren't enough. the managers that worked there pushed the agendas from corporate but gave little actual helpful training to the employees
good,Target is a laid back place to work. Fun vibes with coworkers. Management shows difficulty with scheduling enough people for work load. This creates a lot of stress on the few that are scheduled. Work load is not distributed sufficiently most shifts.
good,"Loved working at Target. It was seasonal, so not many available hours. Busy during the holidays. Good pay. Not so good how they press you to promote red cards, this is one of the reasons I wasn't hired on."
good,"I went through a remodeling which was horrible as a worker, many people complained about everything and no one really knew what was going on. Management switched the way we worked very frequently (duties) we always get things done a certain way when certain managers are on duty. Customers (guests) are RUDE, giving it to you plain and simple get ready to get ur feelings hurt. You really need to know the whole store and where everything is at to feel on top of ur game. If ur doing clothes you better be able to help guests who need to know where your laundry balls are even if you don’t know what that is😂"
good,"Target:"
good,"I'm greatful I work at Target. I've learned so much from my past experiences, I've been given the Baby department to myself. I'm learning and improving to better my knowledge and hope to seek a better opportunity."
good,"The work itself is enjoyable, but management behaves like a high school clique, and are apathetic towards issues brought to their attention. Some Team Leads were allowed to threaten to fire team members outside of their own departments and answer LOD calls, despite not having the authority to. Some Team Members were allowed to be openly passive aggressive and/or confrontational towards coworkers and LODs would feign ignorance of previous complaints made about them. LODs have a tendency to isolate and blatantly condescend to Team Members about their work speed getting the truck done despite being understaffed almost every day. If you enjoy recognition for your hard work and working in a team-oriented environment, this is not the place for you."
good,"My typical day started off guessing where I was working for the night after grabbing my zebra and walkie. I worked in GM and closed nearly every night which is not what I applied for initially being that the store closes at 11pm-12am. I applied for PT hours because I hold a FT job which I made clear at the interview. After being hired and getting my schedule, I realized they had me working 30 hours a week...again, not what I had asked for. Training day was barely that. I was trained on cashiering the first day which was probably the best part. The following week, I was ""trained"" on zoning and such. My trainer wasn't very communicative. I followed her briefly and then I was on my own which was fine because I can work independently as well, no problem. I was there from 4pm to 12:30am...& had to get back up again at 5 to be at work. The following week, I was ""trained"" in a different department. I noticed that a lot of the team members like to micromanage each other which wasn't a good look because I was misled by another team member by being told to do something that my ""trainer"" did not ask me to do which made me look bad. Overall, the training wasn't much ""training"", they literally show you a little bit of what you should be doing then throw you to the wolves. I love Target but working there is a no. If you're under 25 and have no life to tend to then go for it, otherwise I'd steer clear of working here."
good,I would consider staying at Target if my department had a a different leader. It was great working there for awhile but it’s gotten to be a really toxic work environment and it isn’t worth the mental toll it’s taking on me.
good,"I had a great manager there which probably is the reason I can give a positive review. However, I worked seasonal. He knew I was a good worker and tried to get me hired on. However, he left the job due to some issues and because I was associated with him they not only did not hire me but let me go before my season ended. "
good,I believe Target needs and overall better system for training their workers and getting new information out to the employees a better relationship with management and coworker
good,"A typical day consists of meeting with a leader and then given duties to complete throughout the day. You may get pulled from your responsibilities to complete other tasks and you will be expected to complete all those tasks."
good,based on my time there I loved the people I worked with. Except my HR was not the best. She was not understanding and not the most genuine. Her problems came before anyone else's. The breaks were horribly scheduled and the team leads never knew what they were doing.
good,Job is  good  very  easy    job    but  unfortunately  after  holidays   new year's   January 05 to  middle of March  Target  was  giving me only 10 hours  a  week    if you have  family  married with  mortgage is not a good place to make it I  love  work  there   but this  job is  more for  student  live  with  parents or in college     is ok       o  stay in Target 4years   now I  work in warehouse  mores  hours
good,I worked early mornings and they gave me shifts 4-8 am but I would always work over that so it sucked cause i had another job but they didnt care they just cared about finishing what they had to do
good,Decided to start searching for different jobs when promises were continuously made over 3 years for advancement but nothing ever happened. Very high turnover rate. Not a horrible place to work but you get asked to do way more work that you get paid for. You do leadership style tasks for the same pay as a team member. Favoritism is very much a thing here as well.
good,If you have a family with young kids and have to take off at times to care for your child when there isnt anyone else this job is not for you! Will not work with you and doesnt care about what's going on with your family.
good,"Target was not a difficult job if you had proper training, which i did not. Management was very disorganized and unprofessional as well. Not accommodating to schedules."
good,"Target is a great place to work but you see a lot of favoritism.  Also, not room for advancement, I think everyone should be trained across the broad, not trained one or two days, and then not train again until needed by this time you have to be retrained, very frustrating."
good,My duties working at Target was working at the service desk and doing returns and exchanges. Taking guest payments for their bill. Also I was a cashier.
good,"After several years of making it through hundreds of changes at Target, Modernization is where I have drawn the line. They have absolutely lost sight of their employee happiness & well-being. Everything they push is a contradiction on something else they push. Saying they promote equal opportunities is a blatant lie. They won't allow you to take a leave of absence if you're not leaving the STATE for school, they require you o quit. They won't hire you for Beauty team unless you're pretty and/or do your make-up every day. They believe everyone is trainable. People of age and disabilities are not able to perform all tasks and must be coached out of the job. You own your department from end to end but don't actually have the payroll to staff for that kind of responsibility. Then you're coached Everytime something isn't finished. But you can't start any other aspect of your area until your zone and freight is finished, and if you do nothing but freight all day, every day, you never get a chance to do anything else. My current store director doesn't approve time off, requires mandatory weekends, will not agree to a set schedule of any kind regardless of your personal or family needs at home. They tell you the guest is the most important but if you spend more than 2 minutes helping someone then you're not being efficient enough? This company needs to realize retail won't be around forever and selling .29 cent bananas won't save them."
good,You really know what you will be doing that day but overall you clock in and get your job done unless one of the mangers told you to do something else because they didn't have enough people.
good,"The hours were out of the way, and the co-workers were great. Management was pretty bad, and the pay raises are abysmal. They can only give out a set number of 'maximum' raises a year, so you're competing with your co-workers to get a pretty mediocre raise."
good,Working at Target was ok. I worked during the holiday season so it was pretty crazy. I wouldn't recommend working here if you haven't worked retail before. I got paid $12 an hour and rarely got more than 20 hours a week. I have 2 kids so that was no bueno for me.
good,Was a good job for starting out. Managers at the location I worked at could've been a little better but overall it wasn't terrible. It's great for a first job
good,"Unrealistic workload, management has attitude problems. The company has a great care for the guest experience. But they expect too much from a individuals."
good,"Working at Target was my first real job. Some managers were kind of rude and they definitely played favorites. Some were very unprofessional, and Target is not flexible with your schedule espically if you are in school. However, I met some GREAT people working there, some that I even miss to this day. :("
good,"I worked overnight so It was as busy as if the store was crowded. I worked at my own pace, which meant I got my work done and efficient. It was a great atmosphere to work in, a diverse population."
good,Target is good in the pay. Everything else is trash. The hours aren’t there. It’s only a matter of time before you get into an argument or something with any of the upper management.
good,Well compensated can be a fun environment to work in. Team work is good at the store level. Work life balance was great in the beginning now not so much.
good,I only worked at target for two weeks before quitting on the spot. On my application and on my interview I had stated I only wanted 15 hours max 20 and they never said there was sn issue with that. My schedule was good for the first two weeks but then for the third week they scheduled me for 26 hours which was way over what I could work. I called HR three different times and everytime they would saytalk to my supervisor and call me back but never did and just gave the run around. Untill I finally decided to quit in the spot and not even give them my two week notice.
good,had a good time working there miss the co workers/friends i made but i still see them. the work was very easy but in time i had to do more since target got rid of the 3rd party mobile workers. all that work put onto us with little to no training. and no raises for it
good,"Although you can be promoted from within, it is very rare. The company dynamic depends upon the maturity and direction of leadership which was lacking while I worked there."
good,"The biggest upside to working retail at target is the pay, hands down. Besides that, they don’t treat employees all that well, but not much worse than anywhere else. Pretty average retail experience. Emphasis on customer service, but often poor management."
good,Target is a great company to work for but unfortunately the management at my store was pretty poor so my experience was soured a bit. I would still recommend working there as they pay very well and the benefits are nice.
good,Learning new things everyday made it a little hard but it got easier as the day went on. I loved how the job kept me busy my whole shift. I wish i would of had more hours to stay with the company but i had to continue with my other current  job.
good,"If you're not working at a busy department which is only front end and flex, then don't expect many hours. Workload they expect you to complete a full shifts work with part time hours. Good luck"
good,I learned a lot about the logistical aspects of shipping an item to a person and how it impacts our day to day lives. Although management was always been leagues behind the competition and sometimes even their own team members. The hardest part of the job is maintaining a grueling pace whilst keeping quality and safety a priority. But seeing/hearing how well you're doing is always the best validation.
good,"Work line, push carts to their departments, sort products, move to other team member to help restock, pile trash to cart, move to next department, 15 minute break, resume sorting products, clear trash, then get sent home. Average 4 hour worknight."
good,"To start this all out, the corporate overseers are constantly having these grand ideas on how to make a store run better and more smoothly but these same people seem to have no idea at all how humans actually work.  The overall temperature of the store is warm enough to make guests complain, and the leads can't seem to communicate with one another.  As a whole, the store is still alive but it is struggling as a whole at this time.  Nothing can be done without one or more leads ""checking in"" on you and making sure that you're doing it their way regardless of the more common sense solution.  If i had to pick one part of the job to be the best and the worst then i would say this:  The best part of the job is the people that you spend your days with.  The team members there are welcoming and easy to get along with and the real reason that anyone even shows up anymore honestly.  The hardest/worst part is simple:  The leadership expects 8 hours worth of work done in 4-6 hours, they can't seem to communicate clearly and effectively if they even make an attempt to communicate at all, and overall the corporate aspect is in absolute shambles.  The pay and the community is the only reason i would have anything positive to say."
good,"Management at 2 Target locations was lacking tremendously.  Unreasonable expectations from company, ridiculous deadlines.  Pay is decent, but no hours."
good,Manager was very mean and abusive. Tried changing to cashier and still got stuck with him rest employees were quitting 2 to 3 a day. Management didn't do anything about him so I left
good,"My personal experience working for Target wasn’t a good experience. I wasn’t properly trained, but they expected me to know everything about the job. I had to do everything alone while working with a “team”. Management never checked on me in the beginning stages of me working with them."
good,I was meant to be in a kitchen. Fast paced and maiming good food. Target was not that. Just moving items on shelves forward waiting for customers to ask questions. Decent pay but not for me.
good,"I started as a seasonal cashier and was told that I would make for a great sales floor associate. Thats as far as that went because none of the management ever helped with filling roles, so it was a constant breakdown central."
good,"It was a job that got me back on my feet for a while. I advanced in the job but management had been uproot and I became low on the list for next "
good,"Overall okay place to work at first, many people quit during the early months due to only getting 10-15 hours a week, yet management still hiring more employees. Employee/management trust is very low. Team Members consistently on phone and unwilling to put customer first."
good,"Your worklife balance won't exist. As an executive, you could be working between 45-60+ hours depending on bad the store is. Holidays are literally the worst as it is retail."
good,I hated it at target! They wanted a whole table of thrown messed up clothes to be folded in 5 minutes. And they but too much stress on getting red cards. One girl had a nervous breakdown at my store because of it.
good,"As a ""JOB"" this is a good place to work. But don't be fooled, by no means is this a career. You max out at $25 an hour and it is very hard for you to excel within the company. The company is very tenure oriented and the average tenure in the warehouse is 20+ years ,so unless you have a time machine, don't plan on moving up anytime soon. The managers are probably the best thing about the company (if you don't like to be bothered) just come in and do your job and you will be left alone. The job is very physically demanding with long hours on your feet. You will be expected to lift items anywhere from 1lbs to 90lbs. You might have a box that says ""team lift"" but if you have to ask one, although you're supposed to"" it is frowned upon because you are slowing down production. Most importantly and I will leave it at this is the air quality in the buildings are horrendous, the dust is so bad due to the amount of years they've been open you'd think they've never been properly cleaned."
good,As always in customer service jobs you get some nice people and some real pieces of work but the work environment was good for the most part. The employees are nice and there is occasionally incentive for getting people to sign up for a red card.
good,"Communication between leads and team members/business owners was quite awful. Sometimes you would hear a new way of doing the job from a coworker rather than your boss. I found myself being asked to do ""X"" without being taught how to do ""X"" Scheduling would change frequently even after giving availability that was confirmed (i.e. ""I can't work Sunday""), I would then find myself scheduled every Sunday 2 weeks out. The job isolates all it's workers. A year ago we were allowed to work side by side with eachother in a given area, however now we are ""business owners"" and there is 1 worker per area of the store in. I understand the business model, efficiency is key, but I can't have a simple conversation with a passing coworker without being scolded at by a lead. Isolate all the workers so they're deprived of conversation and they wonder why people are leaving. The job is no longer fun and I see myself wishing to find something I am both good at and enjoy."
good,I really enjoyed the experience of working there getting to meet new people and learn new things. Had a nice facility with a great team to work with..
good,Worked in 2 departments and wasn't able to find time where I could have time off without being called in because there were always issues that other employees couldn't handle on their own. I was given schedules that would have me close then open the next morning within an  8 hour period and it wasn't even the holiday season. There was also not many opportunities to move up in the store.
good,Target is a very fast paced environment that requires persistent strength for 12 hours. The days are very long and require a lot of patience. Most of the management is all newer staff.
good,The management was poor and the trainers were not interactive nor did they care to train the people well. The hours were not set and overtime was required a lot more than posted. but the discounts amazing.
good,Job is an amazing place to work until the new managers came in and started demanding everyone around and yelling at us like we were children. Just wasn’t what I was looking for anymore
good,The job was more or less stable for coming fresh out of high school and still living with family. The pay is far too low and does not cover cost of living.
good,"Job isn't too bad, management will put more work on those who already do a ton. Hours vary greatly from week to week (can range from 12 to 35). We get pay raises pretty regularly but every time it happens we have to get more done with less and less hours. Wouldn't recommend Target as your main source of income, unless you are a supervisor or are salaried. Hard to get any sort of benefits or PTO."
good,"target is a fun, easy place to work, but depended on location, you will not be able to grow career or position wise, due to business almost never promoting,and almost always hiring outside of store. you have to have 30+ weekly hours to be eligible for healthcare and benefits. very low hours is very common."
good,Fast paced micro managed company with decent pay and benefits. The faster a person can go the OM's take advantage and hold associates to that speed which is unfair. Associates are targeted with disabilities.
good,"Target is a great company to start off as a first job, you'll meet some nice, interesting people who really make you feel like a team. Management on the other hand is subpar with many executives and team leaders having single out ""favorites"" amongst themselves. After a while supervisors will make you feel like the job you're doing is not enough even though you're not given the hours to get your job done and will treat with a bad attitude."
good,"Not a place for growth unless you have a degree. Hourly pay is fair and the work is solid, but the hours are scarce. Management is solid, but can tend to play favorites at times."
good,I enjoyed working here for about two and a half years. I met many people I'm still friends with. I quit due to poor management and a reluctance to work with my schedule. I found another job and that was it.
good,Most employees only receive 32 hours per week or less which with most older adults is not enough to afford to live properly in this area. It was convenient when my family first relocated here because its right across the street from my home.
good,"When I 1st started workin for target it was great, but as time went along they got rid of old managers replace them with young upcoming new managers that disnt get the people they had workin under them. I would would go back if they fix the changes they made, but I feel they push me out to get new people in"
good,"A Typical Day At Work It Was Always Slow And I Didn't Really Learn To Much Of Anything, The Management was not any better, the manager was a jerk, the culture was the ONLY thing i found to be ok. the hardest part was of the job was be controlled by a boss who doesn't care for you in any way"
good,"a typical day at work starts with pulling batches and pushing that and the days work load to the floor to fill the shelves, what i have learned while being employed at target is how to back stock how to stock and how to run a department more or less by myself. as for management goes there is little to none at my location and when management is there it just stresses the team out. the hardest part of my job is getting other team members jobs done with the short shifts they are giving us. but the most enjoyable part is i work with a good team and get to help and put smiles on hundreds of faces each day."
good,"Management is horrible, even if you plead your case you are wrong! Poor hours and hard to find shifts to get more hours! Treat you like a child most of the time."
good,I have no review at this time for some reason it wouldn't let me bypass without entering something. Have no ill feelings towards Target its a typical retail job
good,They pay you high enough to where you wont get many hours. The way things are done are very tedious and kinda annoying. In fact very annoying. Every 2 seconds your catering to customers.
good,"The amount of hours given in slow times of the year are insulting.  I've been there 7 years and sometimes get only 15-20 hours.  The best is the breaks.  If you have an 8 hour shift, you get 2 paid 15 minute breaks and one unpaid 30.  Management doors are usually open to discuss any problems you see occurring within the store or with other employees."
good,They cut hours while expecting you to do more work.  They have changed the work culture for the worst and expect you to give up your life (family) for them.
good,It was just your typical retail job working at Target. The only way you could get more hours was by being trained in different areas of the store. The only two areas that I never got trained in was Exchange/Refund counter and Backroom
good,"This job was a good beginner/first job. You get the experience of working and learn the basics of the working world. You learn how to balance work with personal life, how to work with others, and other basic skills such as time management and organization."
good,Target is in the process of changing how they present themselves to the public. They are placing their focus on family and fashion. Some stores are struggling with this change.
good,"It was fun working with customers and the employees are pretty good with helping you if you need it. I found it kinda tiresome to work nights since we couldn't just leave when we were scheduled to, even though hr makes a big fuss over leaving at the right time.  My only problem was that, the ETLs don't really care if you have a situation that requires you miss a shift. I had a very bad allergic reaction and I had to miss work and they let me go because of it."
good,"Modernization is the new buzzword. Either you get on board or they’ll performance you out. No more grey area to work with improving job performance. Moving most leaders to a 100% mid (10am to 8pm) mid 5 days a week schedule but does vary by store and position (some are 7am to 5pm, some 9am to 7pm, some 12pm-10pm). Salaried Executives are required to work a minimum of 50 hours a week, but doesn’t include the time spent at home on groupme, yammer, e-mail, phone calls, or texts and very rarely are you able to actually walk out after 10 hours are up. “Flexible scheduling” is what the focus is now, however having a set day off during the week is extremely nice. Holiday rotation is basically being moved away from and summer holidays, thanksgiving week and weekend, and every weekend in December are mandatory and there is a vacation blackout from the weekend before thanksgiving until the first weekend after New Years. Weekend rotation is mandatory and includes every other weekend, and you are unable to use paid vacation to take a weekend off, you must switch. Vacation is a “perk” and not paid out if you leave the company. You can store one and a half times your annual limit before you stop accruing. Taking time off can be a substantial struggle depending on your store volume, location, and executive headcount. The only way you can promote is being 100% relocatable, willing to move anywhere Target is asking you to go, and only if you’re liked. Business knowledge and results are less of a factor for promotion. Nearly all field leadership (district positions and above) are internal hire."
good,"Paid started at $11/hr, company changed starting rate to $12 for all positions. I accepted a full time job offer for security, and only received a .50cent raise.Benefits don't apply for part time employees, and upon becoming full-time you must still wait 90 days. I was fired for having a criminal background check, yet I never gave consent or authorization to run my background, nor was I notified upon being offered or accepting the promotion. Lead positions require much sacrifice- they decide what department and store to put you in. Team leaders must have a Bachelor's degree. Better than most retail companies, but a false pretense of a family community. Referring to customers as ""guests"", always ""making it right"", but all that is only on the surface. Management doesn't care about their employees, just hitting their goals. My store, at least, was very bad due to our store leader."
good,"At first, i loved my job here at target which is flexbile fulfillment, i enjoy working with the team. The management doesn't know how to manage employees and are very rude. All they care about is themselves because they make better pay and numbers. Im thinking about leaving but I don't know if I should leave just because they don't treat us right."
good,I liked working at targetonly becauseof the great Co workersI met there they were amazingand there the reason why I came back everyday. I didn't like how they took care of there workers and they changed there Mangerway to much
good,Target is a fun and fast paced place to work with flexible hours. Accommodating to employees needs. The team works collaboratively and supports one another with guest interactions.
good,"Target is a good place to start when you're trying to get some more experience, but you dont get rewarded for the hard work you put into and at the end you are left unsatisfied."
good,The hours were perfect for a college student but there was no more future going further in the company or job opportunities. The communication was poor with upper management but overall was a positive experience.
good,was hired on to unload and stock shelves before daily opening. Fast pace with little to no advancement. Salaries are low and promises for increases were never followed thru on.
good,"Target was previously marketed as the ""kinder"" retailer to work for, but in recent years they have transitioned into completely becoming Walmart. I know from experience at both companies. The operating model is similar to that of Walmart and Target is headed solely in that direction of diminishing work-life balance and not delivering messages."
good,Some managers are very nice and help you out but most managers expect way too much and you are unable to complete all your tasks with the few hours a day that you get. The hardest part of the job was debating on if you want to spend enough time selling a tv or phone to a guest to make sure they're happy with their purchase or just selling them the product quick to finish organizing your area so you don't get in trouble with your managers
good,"Portrait studio closed so I lost my job, the management was nice and I enjoyed my coworkers also. The customers were the hardest part about the job overall."
good,"Target needs updated technology and training. Employees need to know their expectations and be held accountable for them. Employees become frustrated from the lack of standards given to them by management. Management needs to be consistent. You should not receive different answers from ETL, STL, and TL. They should be the same with their answers to enable employees to complete their work the same everyday.  This will help employees feel empowered and become knowledgeable in their designated areas."
good,Working at Target was fine except for the managers. It seems the managers would give off so much resentment if a mistake was made . They were very high demanding.
good,you will work a lot of hours and be expected to lift and be on your feet from 10-12 hours per day and you will have mandatory overtime so you will be working at least 60 hours a week for most of the year. If you do not want to work overtime  you will be written up or let go. Many managers and they are not all on the same page and they all will have different expectations of you.
good,"I started as a backroom team member on the graveyard shift. After a couple years they got rid of that shift and then started at 4:00am instead of 10:00pm. It’s easy work and very repetitive. Worst part is typically when you have a new STL, ETL, any form of upper management start working there. They usually are fresh out of The Target Academy and think they know everything that will work with the flow team. They constantly fail because they won’t take advice from team members who have been there for years and have seen what works and what doesn’t. The leads basically think just because they went to school and can read the Target Handbook, that they are better than everyone else and think they can speak to you as if you were a child. If you have a good set of leads that will actually pick up, then open a box, and stock a shelve instead of just standing there complaining that work isn’t getting done, that’s shows team members that you actually care about the team and that will follow usually with the team wanting to work hard for you and respect you."
good,"Been with the company for more than  twenty years. Consider if Target is a company the applicant is willing to invest time in, if so, do your research and plan accordingly."
good,"O worked here breifly. If he does not like you, you are gone! Target is very clicky and you will feel left out if you don't have friends at work. Allot of shady stuff going on within ETL's. I would recommend (if you can deal) but I wouldn't work here again myself."
good,"Target was a pretty good place to work, with a good team effort atmosphere. Target was pretty laid back when I worked there, not fast-paced unless during the holidays. Management was not too bad, however, I did not see much for advancement with the company."
good,"Colonial location is terrible. Management is terrible. If you can, work for a different location in Memphis. Employees are rude and leave assignments for next shift."
good,"It was fair for a big retail job. Made many friends with co workers not so much of my bosses. The work environment was a lot of he said, she said. Overall it was an experience and they taught me a lot and I’m very grateful they gave me the opportunity to thrive in their business"
good,"Was promised a permanent position then suddenly let go, but other than that things here were not half bad. Every retail trying to push a membership gets annoying however."
good,It was fun for a young man. This was like 15 years ago.  I was young . dont remember management much. It was good for a younster. I recommend for a young adult.
good,"Stocking overnight in a discount department store."
good,"I felt on-hands management was not friendly with their employees.  When I first started there in 2017, the upper staff were awesome.  One of the reasons I left Target was because of the current HR staff."
good,"The work environment was efficient and the staff was productive. During the overnight shifts; you learn to work in a cohesive unit, build cognitive skills, and keep a steady pace to ensure your handling time management properly. The overnight crew is solely responsible for replenishing the sales floor and redecorating whenever necessary. The work can be intense, depending on how large a shipment a truck delivers that night, although honestly, unpacking a lot of product helps the time fly by. The hardest part of the job is being cooped in a basement or sales floor for 8-10 hours and not being allowed to go outside for fresh air until after your shift was over. Managers always feared that the staff would escape if they were allowed outside at 3 in the morning. Besides a few managerial kerfuffles, the work environment is rewarding and the staff is always alert and ready to get the job done."
good,The company was good to work for if you don’t mind hard work. My problem came in the form of new management that was fresh out of college and clearly was trying to prove themselves. Nothing wrong with being educated but inexperienced as long as you are willing to listen and learn. This was not the case with several of the management. I would consider working there again but it’s roulette with the management you get.
good,"All targets should operate the same, but managers will dramatically change quality of life. Retail workload can range from small, to dramatically overbearing at times, and prioritizing goals has become key to efficiency in a workday. Closing hours will result in the work overflow from the daytime workers to you, and can again vary wildly on load. Holidays will rarely be time for vacation, considering it is a retail job. Coworkers make for a positive and cooperative workplace, but hour cuts, infrequent schedules, too few workers for shifts, and occasionally overbearing managers make for mixed experiences at best."
good,"A typical work week at Target can range from 20 to 30 hour depending on the time of year.  They go by average hours when determining your eligibility for insurance and vacation. So, as a whole it can be very stressful trying to get hours to live on without working a second job.The pay per hour is good but without the stability of your hours every week it can get stressful especially during the summer when payroll is very low.  "
good,"Of course every target is different, but you’ll find that the majority of management at target clearly have no idea what they’re doing. Career advancement is pretty slim, even for a retailer."
good,If it weren't for my co-workers I wouldn't have lasted as long as I did. I finally left when my supervisors changed and the situation became worse and wasn't getting better.
good,"Not many people working for flexible team so all of the work would be put on one or two people. Management was condescending if you didn't work fast enough, but the pace was extremely unreasonable. Most coworkers were nice people, but the disorganization and unrealistic expectations made it difficult to appreciate. Stressful."
good,They ask for a lot of work from the lower level employees while most of management doesn’t do much. Although the work isn’t hard it can be very tedious. People who shop at target also expect way too much from the employees.
good,it was a good experience I learned more about how to treat a guest and how to improve on my social skills to be able to handle all different kind of situations.
good,If you can handle the speed and accuracy they ask of you youll do fine. There are stories of poor management but I have a decent boss. They have alot of job structural changes going on as of april 1st. So currently things are kindof hectic. Once things calm down a bit I think that target as a whole will improve.
good,"It was not too bad, but the sceduals were not well thought out, one time I worked till 10pm and had to go in at 7am the next morning. If there is no consistency at all I tend to get extremely stressed out."
good,Working at Target as a visual merchandiser can be very stressful. Target has always had VM's but the culture of Target does not quite understand or respect the role. They are trying to change this but this is proving to be quite difficult in big box retail. Management does not understand the VM role and because VMs are considered team leaders they are often used in capacities that are completely outside the role and job description. But over all the pay is a little above average and the benefits are great. Work life balance is pretty good also.
good,Target is an interesting place to work. They actually are a company that caters to all people. They sometimes can be a little unorganized due to poor team leaders.
good,"Great beginner job for young people or people in school. Definitely not enough pay that you could easily live off of. Hours are very inconsistent which is disappointing. Other than that, the job is easy and coworkers are friendly. Sometimes they supply snacks to employees. Also, the paid 15 minute break is nice."
good,"The job itself is incredibly easy.  Only full-time employees receive benefits like insurance.  Some guests can be horrible and rude, but they offer opportunities to fine-tune your patience.  "
good,You put up merchandise or put it back in its spot. Then you deal with customers who are too big for they`re pants on occasion. There`s not too much responsibility though so it`s easy.
good,Target has its ups and down but I would recommend working there just don’t except the greatest of hours or pay. The best part for me of working at Target is that Management for the most part is decent and treats you with repect.
good,I worked in the clothing department and got great hours but the job itself was stressful. They gave very minimal training and expected you to know everything right away. Team leaders were really unhelpful and rude. It gave me some good skills but I definitely wouldn't recommend working there for a long time.
good,Um the managers were ok. Too much drama. Not always understanding. Sometimes rude. And now going in rules are not the same totally crazy and it's like somewhat they can do what they want and almost wear they want where we were pretty strict
good,Poor management. Unrealistic work goals due to number of employees and hours allotted. Schedule constantly changes along with methods management wants you to do your job.
good,"I enjoyed my pay, however, the divisions were not cohesive and people were favorites. I were not able to come into work because my care broke down and I called three hours prior to and they fired me."
good,"I was happy with the pay but it was stressful. My managers wanted us to do 10 things at once while being short staffed. We try to keep up but as a Salesfloor stocker it’s hard to finish stocking and constantly help guests and keep up with fitting room and cashier backup. Management was just terrible, they don’t really know what they’re doing. Coworkers were nice and put in a team effort but the store I was at could strive under the right management. (I did have like 2 managers that knew what to do but didn’t have much influence sadly)"
good,The management at the location I worked at was unfair. They used favoritism a lot when it came to good shifts and extra hours. I felt like they weren’t very professional
good,"Was an okay place of employment.  Lack of affordable health care was a negative for me . Management was very inconsistent, store manager was not very friendly.  "
good,"Working at Target was a very stressful job. It was fast-paced and often got hectic at rush hours. As a cashier, I was expected to scan and bag items, keep my area clean and stocked, and sell Red Cards (Target's member card). A typical day was stressful, but manageable. The other team members are very kind and were very helpful to me when I first started. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my co-workers and kind customers. The hardest part, of course, was dealing with inconsolable customers and with the management, which a) seemed very inefficient to me at times, and b) would not stand up to angry customers, even when the customer was in the wrong. That, coupled with school, was the reason for my resigning."
good,"I worked at Target for 2 years and retail is not a great fit for me. I was able to take vacation days very easily but the scheduling was a little rough because I got very few hours considering my availability was wide open. Cashiering was also rough because I obtained a shoulder issue from working there for long periods of time. However, the community of people working in Target is mostly very good."
good,I really enjoyed working at target. I was hired as a cashier. It was enjoyable. Though the management was not so good. The work schedule was very unpredictable.
good,"I was cross trained in every department and training staff at 17-18 years old. Target was my first job, and it was a struggle to get enough hours. It was busy during Christmas time, but during the summer I would have as little as 4 hours a week."
good,Working at target was stressful for me. I was the cart attendant and it was hard to jungle all my duties while getting radioed to go do something that had to be done immediately.
good,"Target is a great place to work for students. Very flexible with scheduling and they have two platforms where we can choose to pick up or give up shifts. So that’s great if you need more or less hours. Another great thing is that you can get multiple breaks in a day, and they often have snacks in the break room for us. I was lucky enough to learn most of the jobs there so I don’t really have trouble with hours but most people don’t get to learn this many positions so it’s hard for them. I also realized that the front end is lately more focused on stocking and looking pretty than worrying about providing service to customers. Doing the truck or anything for the back is always crazy because you get a huge list of things to do and a short amount of time to do it. Especially if you’re working at 6am, its really hard to get in that groove. Nice people though, only 1 or 2 surprisingly offensive/degrading moments with LOD’s but I don’t think they realized how rude they sounded in the moment. So its all good, great place to work if you aren’t too worried about making a livings worth of money."
good,"Target was a great place to work for the first few months, the hours were good and the pay was higher than any other place in the area. However the management changed at some point and soon hours were cut and several hard-working employees were fired. Students were deprived of hours, even being assigned only 4 hours a week while other employees got over 40. When asked for more shifts, management would assign shifts when my schedule did not allow (which was reflected in my initial job application and accepted.) The company itself is great and I would not mind working at a different target, it was only this management that made me have to resign."
good,"I had a mean manager that rushed me even though I worked fast and hard she was very weak and would rush me to carry heavy boxes even though I would be stronger than her. She was rude and showed favoritism and yelled. She was a bad manager, the worst working experience I ever had."
good,"Can expect 50 hours+ per week minimum, even in slow times of year.  Very fast-paced and always changing.  Leadership quality depends on your direct and next-level leader.  Pay and benefits are exceptional, but Target will get its moneys-worth out of you."
good,"Not enjoyable work.  Overhiring during holiday season so hours are minimal at best.  Only people who will go easy on you are friends you make and other cart attendants.  Most everyone else will constantly call you on walkie talkies to demand another task while you are already trying to do the last three you've been asked to do.  If you are outside getting carts, cleaning the bathrooms, or helping a customer load a tv into their car, it is almost certain you will be called to another one of your work duties before you are done, and if you cannot get to one task within a few minutes of being called you will either get scolded, called lazy, or told you do nothing.  At my store there was a GSTL who loved to insult and degrade cart attendants because there would be one working at a time and could not drop everything to listen to her tell them how to do their job.  Another issue is the fact that many store workers will ask you to do things they are perfectly capable and have the time to do.  Customer service could ask you to go get a flat for them while you are outside with twenty five carts trying not to get hit by a car and avoiding people backing out, all while they have enough workers for one of them to grab the flat themself and save time."
good,"Worked in the backroom at Target. As a backroom member, was required to make sure floor was replenished based on sales. Could get very hectic and frenetic."
good,"Poor communication and lack of understanding for associates. "
good,"Whenever there are new changes for the corporation, information from corporate comes misleading and confusing. Makes all the processes a disaster and leads all stores to be operating differently. This makes it hard to reach out to other stores for input on ideas and issues."
good,"I've worked at multiple locations thinking the management HAS to get better at the next location... no. The managers do nothing but bark orders instead of lead. Money is good, so if you can handle a few poor managers then its a great place to work. I've been there over 6 years so I obviously could put up with the managers. The thing that is making me want to leave is lack of advancement opportunities. HR always promises to help get you promoted, but then leaves you hanging."
good,"Target Distribution is very heavily concerned with Appearance, even if you work very hard, you are expected to do so in a completely silent and obedient manner. You ACTUAL productivity matters little so long as you LOOK like you are working hard....."
good,My direct manager is super nice but the overall store manager is terrible and very rude. They give me very little hours even when I've asked for more. They take forever to approve time off and the communication between all the workers sucks.
good,"My experience working at target was not the greatest. The management team was not the best and the benefits were not worth it the amount of work put every day.  I was promoted to a general store supervisor when I didn't feel ready for the part. My time at the service desk was great, love working with people and being able to help others in one of my favourite things. Overall would recommend working for target but not the specific one I worked at."
good,"When working at Target it was just  like any other grocery store. It was pretty difficult to balance work life and being full time student in college, so maybe it was only difficult due to I having to work constancy just to balance and maintain my grades and less tardiness."
good,Overall I think it was an okay job it helped get me in the door to better opportunities. It’s a good starting job but eventually there’s not enough growth or at least offered enough.
good,The company is great to work for and you have career advancement opportunity. Working in AP for the store the AP leaders and team are very helpful. Store leaders don't understand the AP side of the business.
good,"Don't let Target's motto of fast, fun, and friendly fool you, its retail. Even with its hip reputation your still doing boring and repetitive labor and cleaning up after strangers. There's very little advancement above supervisor, everything requires a degree. Shifts are completely random based off an inscrutable algorithm (3:15pm to 7:45? give me a break...)"
good,Worked seasonally here. Very detail oriented in softlines. Sales floor was sometimes very busy or not very busy at all leaving time for you to focus on upkeep of the sales floor. Rotated sections every shift so you're not always working in the same area.
good,calm place to work with in. just stocking shelves. not bothered the hardest part is finding something to do an lifting things the most enjoyable part is working as a team
good,"for the first couple of years management was very good, but recently the whole store and management had become very incompetent and disorganized. this branch needs ALOT of work done to it"
good,"When I first started off at Target it was a super fun place to work. I loved my STL, TL HR, and ETL's. However towards the middle of 2018, it began to go downhill. Corporate has made everything 10x more difficult to get the job done. As a softlines TM I am expected to sort and push the truck, push reshop, clean the sales floor, manage the phone calls, help out guests and back up at the register all for $12/hr. To me and my coworkers, that does not seem very fair. However, as much of a hassle it can be, Target can be a fun place to chat with coworkers haha and I guess the 10% discount is decent."
good,"Management doesn't actually listen to the people who actually do the job. I went from Flow Team to Backroom Logistics because that is where the hours were. I left Target over 4 years ago, so it may have changed over time."
good,"Typical day at work consists of supervising the unloading of freight utilizing a conveyor belt system. Monitored teams stocking sales floor. Upon completion supervised team placing excess products in warehouse. Equipment used in warehouse include forklift, pallet jacks, baler, compactor.  Ensured warehouse maintained location accuracy, and accountability of all stored items within the warehouse using multiple reports. Conducted monthly training where raise where given."
good,its an OK job but i wouldn't consider target as a long term place of employment. the management was good and the general attitude working at target was very positive and motivating.
good,"There were several bosses , i had to work under and 2 out of the 3 were decent. However I felt the one boss was sexist towards the female workers. Did not feel they treated me fairly."
good,Target is an experience to work and learn new things. achieve new goals and set new ones right after. the hardest part of the job is the guest you encounter when an issue arises.
good,My fellow team members are amazing! But my management is always changing! They encourage you one day and insult you the next. I had to leave my department because of my manger. Many team members that I have become friends with have left because of management! The only reason i stayed there is because of the hours they are gave me so I could go to school
good,"I unloaded trucks every day, and set the floor up with goods and services. I created sale planners and followed sales planners. I ran a team of up to 20 people at a time. I ran strays, cleaned the backroom, and I have worked overnights on many occasions."
good,"I did like my job, but I was injured on the job and couldn't remember what I did at the time as it occurred while unloading a truck. By the time I remembers, I was told it was too late to file a report for it."
good,Target is a good place to work for someone who is in need of work experience. I have only worked at one location so my opinion is a little biased. I was not properly trained ( or trained at all) but it's retail and your expectations can only be so high.
good,"The team lead in my department never helped us do anything. We would be so behind and she would be no where to be found. Everyone wanted to be in charge and that made it difficult to work. The trucks would be massive, and pulls would be swamped. The hours are very slim, so you’ll have to pick up hours. I was told that I wasn’t seasonal, but that was a lie. I feel like I was hired under false pretenses. Would only recommend, if your in school and need pocket money. Other than that, I wouldn’t recommend working here."
good,"I was trained in many different areas of the store and I learned a lot about customer service and time management during my time there. Hours weren't great until the holidays, but I made decent money nonetheless."
good,"Target's staff has always treated each other like a real team. Coworkers become friends, and even treat each other like family. There's always someone who will answer your question or help you finish your task."
good,"In the last 5yrs it has changed dramatically from what it once was. I've seen many many good, hard working individuals leave due to the poor management and toxic work environment."
good,"Compared to start dates in 1999 to the time I left in 2013, the continuity of leadership was failing.  Being used to operating under the guidelines to ensure continuity throughout the company, it was slowly being tossed aside.  As people came in from other companies, they continued to use those stores as the way to do things instead of adopting the Target brand.,  The purpose of these guidelines was to make sure a person being used in another store would be able to do the job he/she was sent there to do with company wide policies."
good,"Don't expect to get off work when your schedule says you do. They'll milk you for every hour they can get. No overtime, though. The employees are usually great, but management was rough."
good,I met a lot of really neat people that I call my friends even though I am not there anymore.  The management is run by a bunch of young people and leaves a lot to be admired.
good,"I think the target that I work at has a good work place environment. The bad thing is that expectations, are constantly changing. I have learned good communications skills from interacting with guest. I think the team members within Target are good people who are easy to get along with. I enjoy being able to work with other team members on projects."
good,"Overall, Target treated me well for 3 years. I made the most of the job to make it enjoyable to me and my co-workers, as well as productive well beyond expectations. Good job if it suits your situation."
good,"Food Experts are expected to keep the sales floor full and zoned, unload food deliveries, push and back-stock truck freight, answer phones, help guests, clean, backup cashier, pull stock from the coolers, check produce for freshness daily, help with call boxes in other areas of the store, check for outdated merchandise, push reshop, make cardboard bales, fill sanitizer bottles daily, order produce, research out-of-stocks, assist vendors, and set planograms in grocery ares."
good,after being on the job for almost a year we got a new manager from a different department who took over and had no clue how to run starbucks at the same time my co- workers who had the experience started to leave which left all the weight on me an me having to help my manager do her job and mines at the same time  .
good,I Started off loving the job and was even talked to about a promotion but then I never got the promotion and was never talked to about it again.  The management changed and everything started to get worse.
good,"It isn't just target, it is retail in general. People are not nice to cashiers and everyone blames them for things that aren't their fault. We don't get paid enough to deal with everything that is thrown at us and the discount is not very big. I only enjoyed the people o\i worked with and being able to converse with them on my breaks. The absolute hardest part of the job was keeping my composure when stupid people yelled at me for things I had no control over. Someone literally yelled at me because it was raining outside."
good,"A typical day at work varies depending on what department you are in. There are opportunities to learn, & sometimes advance into various roles/positions. Management could do better across the board, and the workplace culture often lacks momentum because of this. The hardest part about the job is the fluctuation in hours which ultimately affects pay, and the easiest part is working with most of the other team members :-)"
good,"Be prepared to feel as though you are always working in this position or any ETL position. You are expected to worked minimum 10 hour days and most weekends throughout the year. But you will also take your work home with you as well as you are never ""off the clock"" and with a business that is open 363 days a year, you will constantly be working. The work is usually one of two things: putting out fires within the store or trying to meet unreasonable and sporadic HQ initiatives."
good,"rude customers"
good,"Some stores have great management, others do not. Lots of great people work here but upper management has proven that they do not care about the team and will do anything to chase a dollar. Very sad to see since the company used to really take care of it's people that drive profits directly."
good,"I was Apart of a Backroom Team that would unload trucks using strong team work. Once that was done I would Push out the products and stock the shelves. If they didn't fit on shelves I had to Back stock the items. I also had to do zone which was making sure everything is in order and is neat on specific sections."
good,At target my job was to keep the bathroom clean and do checks every hour get all the shopping carts and fill the store know how to use the machine and the cash registers . Help with carry outs .
good,when i worked here it was just crazy fast specially since we worked at 4am but the way the mangers where and just having everyone all other the place i wasnt able to keep up that i would get in trouble not a fun place to work.
good,Employees are not given the opportunity for promotion or move up to another position inside the warehouse. The company hires outside the organization instead of considering current employees.
good,"Its a great culture, the only issue I had was when they fired me without cause. I was never late, never called In sick, never did anything wrong and they fired me with little to no notice."
good,Decent companybwork for. Dont agree with rop down approach of senior executive. Also leader led safetey culture. Preach one thing but will hold you accountable for another.
good,"The pay was terrible.  The people made up for that.  the typical workday left me tired, sweaty, and dirty, but I didn't mind.  The managers were nice."
good,Target is an ok place to work. The pay is great but management is actually terrible. Not all management but there are some people thatwill make you wonder why they are even there
good,It’s pretty laid back unless they say corporate is coming. After that they are as strict as can be and don’t care about there employees. They pick and choose who they want there and don’t consider other team members financial and well being.
good,"Told them I wanted to work 30-35 hours a week but I get 20 or less. They are 4-5 hour shifts, mostly in the evenly or night. they hire more people but us who work there complain about only getting 4 hours a day where we want to work an 8 hour shift. "
good,This job is made for a college student or high school student. its a great part time job but its not a good full time job unless you are in management. they do offer great benefits but the hours they give are very small
good,"If you've heard horror stories about working retail, they're all true in different ways. Some customers are nice and polite, others seem to make it their mission to make your job miserable. And management could be on your side or totally against you, depending on the shift and location."
good,"Being a sales associate for target it taught me to work well with other to get the best deal for the guest . As that factor was the main focus of the store and company, other things we’re out of organization which led to lots of cut hours and lots more work for those who did work"
good,"learned how too develop property mangers, train them on different types of equipment. showed team members the proper way too use chemicals and handle hazardous materials."
good,I was always under pressure to be a salesman for red cards when that was never part of the job description. My managers repirimanded me when i didn't get enough people to sign up to be members.
good,Was an okay job with decent pay. Decided to work here to help finish up school. Not a terrible place to work. it is just very fast paced and can be competitive.
good,a normal day would consist of long hour and alot of hard work. management was horrible if you weren't a fast worker then your job was on the line. hardest part was all the hard work
good,"The company culture of Target is focused on the impact of team members.Unfortunately, in the store I worked at, it is made fairly obvious that the management doesn't much care for the well-being of the team members outside of their individual cliques. The amount of work that team members are expected to complete on any given day is utterly unrealistic. Even is team members weren't expected to frequently drop everything in their current task to provide excellent customer service, there still would not be enough time in their day to do everything they are saddled with. Yes, Target does have one of the highest starting wages in the industry, but the amount of stress that the job comes with and how hard it is to earn benefits makes it a less than great place to work."
good,"Most everyone I worked with daily were a joy, but management was arrogant and the over all organization was lacking. I would apply there again to see what happens."
good,"I only worked at target for 3 months and it was good for the first few weeks. Then it was horrible, late night shifts ( don't getting home till 2 in the morning) That sucked!"
good,"A typical work day at Target is stocking, cleaning, assisting customers, answering phone calls, helping with cashier backup if needed, retrieving carts. The management was good, the workplace culture varied with who you worked with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who did not care about my job or my help. The most enjoyable part of the job was my actual schedule."
good,"Target was an all-around okay place to work. I was only a seasonal employee so I knew I was going to be there for a short period of time. However, as I went to check my schedule to see what I am working the following week, I notice that I have no hours. I found out I was not employed there anymore two days before my last day (I found out on Monday that Wednesday would be my last day). After asking around, I was told that a manager was supposed to speak to me two weeks prior to ask me if I wanted to do something else inside of the store, but instead of even warning me or talking to me, they just took me off the schedule, which left me having to find a new job ASAP. I was told during my interview in November that I would be employed there until mid-January. At first, I went from working there roughly 25 hours a week to 8 hours my final week."
good,"The work wasn't bad, but they almost dangle the jobover seasonal knowing they aren't going to keep you. The pay was good however and need to make around the same next job."
good,"The constant hours were very nice and allowed me to plan around they schedule well ahead of time. It being a temporary job, the renovations of the store, which was great for working summers as a college student."
good,"This place is awesome if you work real hard to better yourself and store. However, lots of mangers have free roam to torture whom ever they please. At times can be really unfair."
good,"Like all retail stores, hours can vary depending on seasons and holidays. Workplace culture for the Bayfair location is wild. Many students working in this location and it is pretty tough to deal with. The location itself is placed in an unsafe area so customers can get wild."
good,Coworkers are fun to work with. Upper management in store is a lot of recent college graduates that go on power trips. Some of the managers are actually good and care about you and the department. The actual department manager that I worked for was the best manager that I ever had at a job.
good,"It is a very faced paced job, depending on what your position is. They bring in food for everyone once in a while which is nice. The managers can be complete air heads though."
good,"Do not expect to be promoted, even after consistently being a stellar employee.  Do not expect a pay raise, do not expect to be treated with respect.  Do not expect your opinion to matter or to be able to speak your mind without being disciplined for doing so."
good,Management was poor and nothing was ever fixed. equipment was constantly broken and it made the job difficult. The pay was good and i had no problems with the work itself.
good,"Senior management hasn’t the experience, knowledge and vision to handle changes that can make Target competitive with Amazon and Walmart. The books and strategy that seniors are using are very old and effective, some are still using bullying and harassment techniques to get the job done..."
good,I went to work each day and stood at the doors to dissuade potential thieves from stealing and to give Target shoppers a sense of security. Worked with police to apprehend thieves. Documented losses and recoveries.
good,Very friendly and welcoming coworkers and time management was easy. flexible position opportunities. sometimes stressful . calling off was a hassle at times.
good,"I have worked for Target for 8 years i started out as a seasonal cashier and promoted to Guest Service - GSA-then Team lead over soft lines.  I really enjoyed my job and planned on staying there till i retire then Target decided to do an overhaul of the management at my store.  Problem is the management they took out was a great team they cared about their team members the trained us to build us up for advancement they always had an open door policy and treated us all like equals"
good,Good part time job for anyone looking. Management does good with breaks. You don’t get many hours a week but that’s normals when working in retail. I recommend working there.
good,"In the 1 year and 5 months with Target I have seen the joy of base pay raises offset with staff slashings. The satisfaction of teamwork well regarded now countered with ever increasing workload and dropping morale. Steady, savvy leadership replaced with new methods and higher turnover.  "
good,"Working here has made me realized how much I do not want to work there longer than I have to. They do not let you work more hours than they put on the schedule, they expect you to get everything done while cutting your hours."
good,I have been honored for my years of working at target. This place has taught growth and confidence but has also truly disappointed me. I’ve have dedicated so many years to the company and I feel as though I was treated very poorly. Great place to start.
good,Fun to work for target enjoyed the smiling faces I got see everyday. Typical work day consisted of seeing many guests and ringing out their transactions as well as dealing with any issue they were having to the best of my ability.
good,"Overall people are people and in a work environment, I understand we come to work but there was a great conflict among the team members."
good,Target can be an alright place to work. Probably poor management that started to drive me away. You are expected to get a lot of work done with not a lot of time or resources. Training is pretty poor usually pawned off to veteran team members. Equipment usually doesn’t work properly understaffed for workload most of the time.
good,"Highered full time Planogram, got hours cut, down to 4 hours a day on stocking team. A lot of people get hired full time, then they cut your hours. That's why I call it a meat market of employees. Basicly offered one thing then cut your hours down when bonuses are due. Over 3 years there, seen it done that way, many a times. Due to Granddaughters needing care and watching when I was cut down to 4 hours I would have been gone. In the end, the crew I worked on, and some managers, were great to work with too."
good,the management was terrible but i loved my job as the electronics stocker.  unloading the truck was nothing to me since i had experience already. 1138
good,"The target I work in has gotten remodeled with new management. Since then, the workplace has been very disorganized, dysfunctional, peers who have not gained proper training in their job roles,  and management continues to make irrational goals that cannot be met because they do not understand a department within target. "
good,"Target is a relatively easy place to work at, however, there are times when management does not work with their team very well. One major thing that I learned is that in order for there to be an effective team, management has to put an emphasis on communication and clarity. The hardest part about the job is the sometimes overwhelming workload due to lack of staff and lack of organization. A lot of times the team is forced to pick up on other departments jobs because the floor is short staffed. One of the more enjoyable things about the job is the networking that is done there. A lot of times you meet hardworking and determined people that are often times in the same age range as you. All in all, Target is an okay place to work."
good,"Great place"
good,You can stay in one position if you want but if you work hard you can easily be thrown into any position where the store needs you. The opportunity is there its just difficult to keep up with everything and the scheduling was inconsistent and makes it hard to have a good work-life balance.
good,Target is more suited for young adults who are in school. They work around your schedule if you are in school. They hire everyone as part-time so no steady schedule or full time hours. You lose a lot of money if you only work this one job to try to make ends meet. The best part about my job was helping guests find what they need. My coworkers were also a big part of why I stayed at Target. I have never worked with such nice and inviting people. My team was great and we all supported each other. Management was better than most places I have worked for. The hardest part of my job was the mundane work. There was no real challenge so it became boring really quickly. It is a decent part time job. It is definitely not a horrible job but it was more suited for a younger crowd.
good,"It was a tough work environment with the constant push to be a better, faster, stronger, more accurate worker whilst also constantly having the workforce and hours cut was not beneficial to my own mental or physical well being. If you are looking for a job with stability this isn't it. I went from working a minimum of 17 hours a week down to 4 in a flash because we were the smaller store and hours needed to be given to other departments. and when the days were cut from 4 hour shifts to 3 hour shifts they expected us to finish the same (and sometimes more) work with less time."
good,I enjoy working with the public at Target. I do not enjoy how management treats their employees. I am a senior employee but receive little in recognition.
good,I enjoyed the staff I worked with but didn't see any benefits or chance for growth here. Its perfect for retirees or teenagers looking for part time jobs.
good,"I worked for Target for 8 1/2 years I loved it for so long. But i wasn’t getting anywhere no promotional opportunities.  Inconsistent management, no room for growth.  After some time away I’ve tried a few times to come back b/c I loved the job and I loved the customers the last time I applied for a supervisor type role they called me in for an interview and intentionally interviewed me for a cashier position which I didn’t even apply for then turned me down. Their own integrity hotline people tried telling I was treated fairly"
good,Working at target was an absolute delight. Most of the staff were people that were easy to get along with and the majority of the management was very nice and understanding if ever you needed time off for any reason.
good,You have to stay active at all times or you’ll get written up or sent home. They’re always pulling you off of one task to do another task then they get mad when you didn’t finish any of the tasks.
good,"Working at Target, as a leader is hard. You do a lot of work, without a lot of recognition. Everyday is different, so you have to be flexible. The benefits are awesome, 401(k) is a 5% match, heath/dental is fairly cheap on coverage, but all preventative is free. Management is very political, if you can get along with the STL and DTL, you are set, if not you may get pushed out. I enjoy working with the team members, especially when there is a lot to do, they like seeing leadership jump in to do the heavy work."
good,Hired as a seasonal part-time employee. Pay was substandard. Management at time was adequate. Worked hard and had hoped to be kept on in full time status.
good,"Target is a good place to work "
good,"I think they need to have more employees on the schedule due to call outs because then they try to over work the people that actually show up and it’s not Fair. Also, there are certain LODs that do to much. For example, they come check on you to see where your at but make you feel like your pressured and being rushed in what your doing because they want you to move on and do more, and I get it it’s their job to check on us but please don’t do it every 15 min and I know it’s our job to multi task but it’s not our fault you didn’t schedule enough people and now you have like 5 call outs. They don’t pay enough for everything they expect you to do and stressing you to do it at their pace."
good,"The location of the Target didn't get the best reviews, I was hired for the Starbucks location inside Target; but through Target. I was trained for the Target Cafe and would cover shifts. The hours would be different, but had to be less than 40 hours a week otherwise management and HR wouldn't be happy. When I was first hired, my first day the manager quit. Soon after the few employees that did work there, also quit. It ended up being me and two other baristas when I was still learning how to make a Frap or the difference between a cappuccino or latte. By the end of my first week, I worked alone some shifts and it was embarrassing when the line would be to the door without any help or guidance. Eventually I got it down by half of the month, it was a struggle, but studying the guide book provided was my only saving grace. There were times I got yelled at for not taking my lunch, yet no one would be able to cover the coffee shop while I was on break or lunch. The button on the cashier never helped me for back up either. It was very difficult and by the time I was 3 months in, I was training newly hired workers for the company."
good,"Target runs it's company by the book or as closely as it can. Target has solid best practices and is driven by every conceivable KPI you can think of but it works. Execs must know how to speak to their business and drive sales though merchandising, guest relations, Red card conversions and controlling shrink."
good,"Working at Target has been okay.  It's better than food service, and the pay is better than what you'll get at a lot of places.  Corporate leadership is terrible, but in-store management is okay.  Workload is always heavy, and not always manageable—understaffing is a big issue."
good,I did enjoy the job and could have done well but decided that another position was more in line with a possible career path I liked and was better suited.
good,I had the opportunity to train in multiple departments but it never led to raises or more consistent hours.  Most daytime managers had no idea how the back room operated and generally left them to their own devices.  Working the garden department was fun.  Don't expect much interaction between your co workers unless its the holidays as most shifts are bare bones.
good,"My typical day entailed stocking shelves and cashiering when it was busy. I learned to fold properly and cashier while working there. It was a very rewarding job experience. The management was normal. The workplace culture was very smooth, but fast-paced at best. The hardest part of the job was also the fast pace, but I got it quickly. The most enjoyable part was being apart of a company that cares about their employees. That's very rare these days."
good,"I would strongly urge anyone considering working at Target to apply for any work center besides Cashiering/Guest Service. Personally, the pushing for red cards is mainly what made me quit, and was the one thing that I wasn't all that great at doing. The pressure my GSTLs and ETLs put on my coworkers and myself to get red cards was not worth how much we were getting paid. If we weren't meeting their standards in terms of the red card quota they would occasionally do write-ups; meaning, you'd be in a ""training"" period all over again. The training period is just another way of saying you're on probation, but your GSTLs are supposed to TRAIN you to get better at whatever you're lacking at. However, at my store they'd never actually train us or give us decent pointers on how to approach upselling red cards; which defeats the purpose of even calling it training. How do you expect cashiers to get better at selling red cards if you don't actually TRAIN them during their TRAINING period?!? exactly."
good,"I met a lot of amazing people at this company that I will never forget and they taught me a lot about work, culture and life. The coming together of people from all walks of life and different nationalities and age groups is unparalleled. I liked the discount and the break room and the fact that they had a Starbucks (not all do, I gather). Generally, the guests I helped were very kind people and a joy to assist."
good,"Unloading the truck is long and tedious"
good,Target is a great place to work for a full time student and part time employee. They provide flexable hours and understand your needs as long as one has clear attendance and a good work ethic. It is a decent place to work.
good,"They were great to work for,  but online markets have caused them to restructure there work force. They moved all night-shift workers to day shift.  Their personnel was cut when the night shift moved due to the shift being moved to days."
good,"Your experience really depends on the employees at the store. I was lucky to have some pretty great managers that were understanding of  personal situations,when they arose, and paid attention to the quality of your work. There were times where the expectations were too high for my coworkers and myself in terms of accomplishing tasks. However, so long as you put in effort, the managers understood that not everything could be finished. Overall, the experience was fair. I was paid well for part time work, not enough to live off of on my own, but enough to pay for basic necessities and some school tuition. The managers worked well with me and treated me with respect."
good,It's fast paced 10 to 12 hours standing and walking. It is also a hot environment so dress for the weather is always best. Management wise are good and bad depending on the work.
good,Target spends a lot of time trying to cut hours.  Pay is low.  Benefits and raises suck.  The only good thing about working for Target is that co-workers are wonderful.
good,They definitely push you way to hard about the credit card they offer. If you don’t get any they get like mad. You can’t force someone to apply for something they don’t want.
good,"I knew going in that Target was going to be temporary since I was in school. I was in Cafe and I learned something in the first week there, NO BODY CARES ABOUT CAFE. I constantly had to flag down a manager so I could take a break, there would only ever be 1 person at a time in cafe so if we got swamped randomly we would get no help. But most of the time, it wasn't bad. Pretty laid back, co-workers are super chill and if you wanted to try to do another position you could just ask to be trained and then pick up shifts when there were some. Hours were pretty flexible for that kind of thing, unless you wanted full time. NOT GONNA HAPPEN, even managers don't get full time from what I heard."
good,"I usually worked upfront. It was stressful when it was busy. If feels like the same thing every shift, just a new day. I would help customers checkout, return items or answer questions. I did learn a lot about customer service and the process businesses go through. I learned how important it was to be at work when scheduled because if one member was gone, it would make everyone else slammed with work. Sometimes when I was going into work I don't know what exact area I'd work in. I was scheduled for being cart attendant all during school last year. I had asked if I could switch into a different area because I didn't like it multiple times, and none of the HR reps helped. The Target I worked at in Kalamazoo was very fun. I loved my coworkers and managers. I think the management really varies on each individual store. The hardest part of the job was the repetitiveness and how I felt like I wasn't making a big impact on the company, especially when I was doing carts. I felt like the company could've done fine without me there. The most enjoyable part were my coworkers. I liked the friendships I made. Having friends at work made it more enjoyable for me."
good,"Pretty good job, I wish they paid more in my opinion, But is is what is is. The discount is not anything special its only 10% which I did not like honestly."
good,"Each Leader on Duty has their own way of doing things, Some I approve and some don't. I can not argue with the leaders so I must do as they say. The Leaders that I approve, I go straight to work while telling my team members of what is going on and it makes me happy because I would have done it the same way."
good,"Strong workforce, loyal and dedicated to what they do daily. Solid plan for future with technological growth and multi-channel focus. The company will be around for a long time. Work life balance can be challenging."
good,"Target has better pay than other grocery/department stores. I worked logistics (mostly back-end, inventory, stocking) and it is vastly different from the floor staff. My work mainly consisted of unloading the delivery freight and stocking the products on a daily basis. Normal workday started at 4am and ended whenever we were done. Worked there for a little over 2 years and the only complaint would be the constant change in management and protocol. Pretty much management from different departments disagreeing with each other which made our job harder than it should be. All in all, decent place to work if you are just starting out."
good,Good place to work but seems not to be enough hrs at the smaller stores. I would recommend if you choose to work at a target to work at a larger one.I came to find out while the pay is good I don't work the amount of hrs i need to be at. However I understand that how a business is run.
good,It's a fast paced demanding retail environment. Definitely a fun place to work with good people. I always enjoy my time working here in the busy seasons.
good,I made many friends there we all had fun while we tried to keep everything professional since we weren’t all in the same level. Store team leader stopped caring about store after awhile and was dependent on executive team leads. Some of Etl’s had no idea what they’ve been doing. Stl didn’t train them. And they were micromanaging team leader and team members and would dump their responsibilities on them.
good,Working at Target is so fast paced and unorganized that I think it a really dangerous job cause we don't see a lot of teamwork and everyone is in a hurry with heavy item or full items accident happen a lot. Thank god none of them are major just small accident. but I do fear of having a serious accidents because of short staff and fast paced.
good,"workers was great, mgrs was pretty good, over its retail you will have some good days and bad ones too. mgrs got the little favorities too.over i like working there"
good,"Pretty good place to work if you need a temporary job. Coworkers are generally nice, but just like any place there will be petty drama and people you'll dislike. Wage is poor (at the time of this review, I'm being paid $12.50 after a raise and a store wide pay bump, while Walmart's staring is $13). Management is usually rather bad due to disorganization and lack of follow up when communicating. There is a decent amount of potential if you're hunting for that promotion. It's easy to get that first step (It'll usually take six months to a year for the first promotion and will vary after that). The worst thing about the job is serving the guests. Most of them will be nice, but there are some people that will go out of their way to complain about every little thing."
good,"Management not great. Not a great place to work at for young students. Management isn’t friendly, and not willing to work with you. Pay is good for a starting job but not worth it."
good,"Target pay is comparable or better than most retail or fast food. Management is awful, always drama, and heavily biased. It feels like you're back in highschool."
good,"Typical retail experience, cash registers, dealing with guest, stocking shelves, pushing shopping carts, black friday is intense due to high volume of guest"
good,Being employed there for a little over 3 yrs; I have noticed that the turnover is high in this particular store. Many complain about management and management expects you to do at least 2 different jobs.
good,"A typical day at Target is stocking items, getting yelled at because you aren't moving fast enough, running to the cash register every 20 minutes because there aren't enough cashiers."
good,"Seasonal backroom position. Retail position with a long rod to advancement. Once the Christmas season was over, work slowed considerably. It was a struggle to find something to do."
good,"easy to learn, nice staff, discounts, fun experience, laid back environment, quick rushes, lots of people, clean safe work environment, fun times ......"
good,"A lot of work, fun co workers, management can be a rollercoaster though. Management is constantly changing, with people who have zero experience fresh out of college. Great skill building company if your just starting into the work field. Pay sucks, unless you promote 2-3 times. Benefits are good if you work full--time. Overall, good level entry job."
good,They hire anyone who has a degree to manage that god forsaken building most kids fresh out of college not knowing the first thing about warehouse life so they try to make changes that don’t work which leads to mutiny
good,"Target is a good place to work for, but currently the management in the front lanes need improvement. There are current Leaders that I feel need improvement on management skills."
good,"I was a seasonal employee here two years in a row. Nov 2014-Jan 2015 and Nov 2015-Jan 2016. I was on the floor both times and an occasional cashier. I liked being a cashier more and the Lead for Front End actually liked me and wanted to keep me after seasonal but it never worked out. Happened twice. Overall, the place was cool but management was stingy. I was never able to work here again for some reason."
good,target was a good place to work because of the managers and the team members that I worked with. The team work help us complete our task ahead of schedule.
good,Not very happy after the mandatory switch of our shift from overnight to a Early morning shift. (4 am) Many people left and that put a huge strain on the ones that stayed.
good,"Management as a whole needed word. they paid no mind to my availability. "
good,"Very unreasonable expectations, expect 8 hours worth of work in 4 hours.  The culture is set by the very top to get rid of those not meeting unrealistic expectations."
good,"Its a good starting job, but I don't see a career being developed there unless there is more competition added. Also there are rules at target for customers to follow, but if they choose not to follow them, then we cannot say anything; for example. I have bad allergies, I am allergic to practically every animal with fur out there. I am fine with people bringing in service animals since they need that for medical reasons, but if someone brings in their animal and it isn't a service animal (even though our rule is only service animals) we are not allowed to even make them aware of that rule. This is the case for a lot of rules at target, also corporate rules sometimes go against state rules. It can be quite frustrating, but it is still a decent job for people to start at. It was disappointing though that there were no full time positions at any of the targets I worked at though. Definitely not something to live off of."
good,"They respect religions of employees, offer cross-training, have discounts, and encourage good relationships. "
good,"The management doesn't seem to understand what they're doing unless they come from a high volume store. Expect you to do way too much in little time, will write you up if you're unable to complete tasks, regardless of if you're understaffed or not. Management will also lie to you and lead you on, tell you that you're Team Lead Material then 'forget' about you when you ask for an interview for an open position. "
good,"I like working at Target, but the fast paced environment made me feel stressed out and tired. The management was pretty fair, I liked the managers I had. The coworkers I had were good, I liked them and they made the job enjoyable for me."
good,"Managed a fast-past retail store focused on guest service, team engagement, community involvement and personal development. Served as an executive at 4 different stores over 3 years."
good,"a good place to start working, but not a good place if you're looking for a career. takes forever to have a chance to be promoted and the communication between managers is terrible."
good,My time working there was fine but the fact that some managers did not seem to know what they were doing. I felt as if they didn't understand that i had stuff to do after work. I would always be asked to stay and they would not get the hint that i had stuff to d. I even had a manager said i couldn't leave until i finish a flat that wasn't even mine. So if you like being told what to do at all times and early morning hours than this is the job for you.
good,"It might have been where I was, but I didn't enjoy my time at Target. Things didn't feel right, and more times than not I felt they didn't properly train someone when it came to warehouse work."
good,"Poor work experience due to lack of compassionate culture, unrealistic tasks are always given Stress is always high on entire workforce. Everyone is unhappy on a daily basis."
good,From my time working at target I was able to learn a lot in the past yeah and a half being able to work with some amazing co-workers and some that were not so great. Management was sometimes alright and sometimes was all over the place. the pay was slightly average it just wasn't enough to make ends meet and I eventually became unhappy with the work environment because we were forced to double up on work and was given less hours to do so.
good,didnt pay enough for the amount of work. staff was really cool and the fact that you get a discount was nice but the pay suck. didnt get enough hours.
good,"I have good co workers at target, I would say management is not very easy going, the hours are very weird and sometimes hard to get days you need off,other than that pay is great and the co workers are awesome"
good,"It’s okay. Company just doesn’t pay well and that’s the only reason why I would leave. Benefits are good, management is good but they expect a lot from you with the little time you have in your shift"
good,"Target has a pretty friendly environment, but the work was very strenuous for me at times. I have learned how to better serve customers while working there for the past few years. Unfortunately the management was really inconsistent. We would be asked to complete tasks that were literally impossible. For ex: Stock items to the floor by a certain time, no matter what. But we only have so few team members depending on the days. We also have a routine that works really well and gets the job done consistently. But management will always scrap all of our efficiency to try new things, but yet they will wonder why things are the way they are. I feel like they just need a better understanding of how the work actually gets done. That makes the management weak in my opinion. The hardest part of the job is unloading the truck. It takes a lot out of you physically, and I don't think everyone can do that. The most enjoyable part of the job is without a doubt, getting to know everyone you work with. It's always been the people you work with that makes it more worthwhile."
good,"Fast paced retail, must be able to meet timelines and maintain a consistent level of high production in order to meet daily goals. Work life balance is poor, you don't go home till its done,sometimes 12-16 hour days."
good,"Targets management in areas of the store lack. They do work with schedules, but offer hours that are not able to be given.  They upped the pay but cut hours."
good,"Working here was interesting, I enjoyed the quick pace of it and the work we did. It was all about team work which was amazing, so you weren’t expected to just do things on your own without any help which was a nice change from my previous jobs."
good,"Where guests are the main focus. Target lacks the ability to please the employees. We do get minimum recognition which either helps ease tension or make it worse. The management team is very unprofessional. The lead manager has made several racists comments. Which proves our integrity line is no good. The compensation barely meets the heavy workload. The guests are fun which helps, also i work amongst a great team of coworkers. Overall i would only partially recommend this job to people. The compensation is actually the best part. Trust you'll find yourself begging for a raise to match the workload. Definitely could use more incentives for employees. I wouldn't mind advancing if it didn't mean working with team leaders who are just as unprofessional as the store leader. Advancing here is not worth the headache."
good,"Trains you well and has great supervisors who are willing to give advice or direction. Can be easy-going, but pretty fast paced during back to school and holidays. Certain work sections can get very competitive."
good,Some long days or nights depending on your shift. Learned alot about engaging large groups of people. Management left something to be desired in terms of recognition. Cultural goals were good but execution and the extreme rate of change made it difficult build that cultural foundation. Hardest part was the lack of work life balance. Most enjoyable part for me was engaging the team members and getting the best out of them.
good,"The group that I worked with was an excellent one. The management shifted semi-often. The pay isn't too bad but when they do pay raises, new hires would be making more than people who were there for years."
good,"A typical day at work was busy but slow at times, it wasnt all that fun as my managers were very childish as they each didnt really help us or guide us in the way they wanted us to go but mainly just pointed at an uknown location with a generic name."
good,Target is okay to work at under the right management however most managers are drinking buddies that don't care for the growth of the employees they supervise.
good,"Being a GSA here which is a front end supervisor, getting paid only 50 cents more than a cashier, is a slap in the face, being the one who open/closes, runs the entire front end of the store and even in charge of all the money in the entire store and in charge of managing the safe, counting the money and doing deposits. it's a disgrace that Target feels hard to compensate their employees."
good,"I loved the environment and the people I worked with. My manager was nice. I was unable to be promoted, even with 14 yrs manager experience unless I went back to college and obtained a BA."
good,Though it cant be a stressful environment as can be dead as figurative graveyard in the store to the end of the world scenario in the store. I enjoyed my fellow employees and the costumers i got good and bad. Most of management were good people. Only downside is not all were.  Biggest issues I had with this work environment is inconsistent hours and the constant shifting from one employee being overwork and the other begging for scraps. I fell victim to being overworked at the wrong time as well. Management itself has no power keeping or letting go employees as they are constantly hiring new ones and firing old ones keeping the door swinging so they don't have to raise wages or give benefits.
good,At Target I didn't feel like my work was appreciated. I dealt with rude customers I've dealt with people trying to steal things right in my face and the manager seems difficult to talk to for me.
good,Decent place to work. I enjoy helping people and being able to provide them with what they are seeking. I work primarily with logistics and stocking in the backroom.
good,Target is an alright job if your just starting to work with pretty decent paid than most jobs in the field. Its good to learn how to interact with people.
good,A typical day I would select items to be replaces from being sold and replenish shelves. I would select customer orders from online or drive up orders. The management needs to make better choices about the direction they want the store to go and needs to give the good employees they have hours and not keep hiring new ones. I enjoy the coworkers that I work with.
good,"It was ok working in target. There was a little bit of mismanagement of time. Good people, good benefits, and plenty of time to relax. Unapproachable goals issued by supervising leaders made it very hard to keep up with expectations. Inefficient methods on back stocking made the process that much harder. The team leader will schedule you for a certain amount of hours and expect you to want to work longer and then get upset if you leave on time.  This is only in regards to consumables. I am sure the other departments were fine."
good,Target was a good job to get me on my feet. But working there for a long period of time is something I can’t understand how people do. Employees are constantly in and out. Including management. Roles changed so much. And the turnover rate was crazy. But that’s retail.
good,"No room for advancement, they hire from outside the company.  These people have 0 experience however they have a degree which lands them upper level positions"
good,Target was actually a really easy job. My only complaint would be poor management and lack of training. They basically make you figure everything out on your own and when corporate comes they try to shove proper training down your throat. The managers were like high schoolers and really petty about a lot of things which was my biggest reason for leaving. Other than that with a few tweaks of the store I probably could have stayed with the company forever.
good,I loved some of my managers and others were horrible. I enjoyed working on a team. I enjoyed the people. Very clean. They give you breaks. Good training. I had family issues and left abruptly so they do they do not care.  I can't go back. But I do recommend it for a job if you need one.
good,"a great place to get a start in life, but in my case no long term career to be had. decent management and great coworkers, on site HR was a definite plus"
good,"I want to stress that this review only applies to my store T2235."
good,it was a great job it was overnight from 4am to 12:30 pm and it was amazing to do that and have another job but unfortunately they decided to change the schedule and completely disregard your life because you adjusted to overnight so they changed it to 8am -4:30pm which messed everything up but it was a corporate decision unfourtanetly .
good,"The managers or the store team leaders have so much stuff said to them by corporate, and then they say so much stuff to the regular team members. It was all a mess. The store team leaders didn't have the same customer knowledge that the regular team members have. And the corporate people don't have the knowledge that the store team leaders have. Thus, the working environment at Target isn't really something that makes you look forward to going to work."
good,"I clock in, go to the food court, learn when the food was put on the racks, if my boss is there hes probably going to yell at you for what the closer didn't do even if it wasn't you who closed the night before.  Some shifts it takes a couple of hours for your first guest to come so have food cooked and ready for people to buy it. I got maybe 50% of my breaks because my breaks wern't official.closing takes like 15 to 20 minutes. the mangement is really bad i got yelled at for everything i did"
good,"The job was decent but they don't actually train their employees, the only people who advance are those who are friends with the higher up, and the management is terrible. Not to mention the pay was awful considering the amount of work they had us do. So many employees came and went, but I never had to wonder why people left."
good,"Working at Target as a part-time employee is not a bad way to begin your working life. The management is generally competent and is especially accommodating to students. With more than two weeks notice they generally give days off for important school events and other things."
good,"leadership was terrible at communicating with me and with each other."
good,"As an ETL, you carry a lot of the weight of the store on your shoulders. I started at a low-volume store and was told that in order to succeed I would have to use my resources. What I didnt know is that I would be working 12-14 hour shifts, 6 days a week to accomplish everything that was assigned. Unfortunately, when the store doesn't meet sales, they pull back payroll and cut hours from the hourly team members. Though the hours are cut, the workload remains the same. Everyday, I would be in the parking lot pushing carts inside, making drinks at starbucks, hotdogs at target cafe, jumping on a lane, putting out fires all across the store, meanwhile bonding with my team and making sure everything is completed. Though it was challenging, I enjoyed my job and my team. "
good,"While I am still employed with the company, I have learned quite a few different positions. Ranging from logistics to food production. I do kind of feel that at least at my store there was a bit of favoritism which mostly likely is reason I have not advanced. Overall I think the company provides a great guest experience. I just wish sometimes that trickle down to the employee level."
good,"Job was physically demanding.  On your feet for full shift and then some. Must enjoy being in customer service role for the entire shift.  Target does provide lots of training, but some trainers are not equipped for that role. Ended up learning much on my own."
good,"A typical work day would include being assigned a section, gathering re-shop to put back on the shelves from guest service for that section, organizing the section, and finishing the shift by doing any additional re-shop for that section. The negative aspect of this job was that sometimes employees were given too large of a project in relation to how long their shift was. This tended to leave things left undone when closing time approached. The best part of working for Target was the interaction with guests and fellow workers alike. It aided in my professional development of people skills. Another strength was that management was very flexible with scheduling during the school year, which was greatly appreciated by me and other college students. They also provided a comfortable work environment and were always approachable and supportive to ask questions or express concerns."
good,Worked here for 8 months before new management came and made me want to quit. Honestly loved working at Target before the store GM retired and they brought in someone with no experience instead of promoting someone who deserved it.
good,"I still say that I'd love to work as a part time sales floor, cashier or guest service, however as a GSA many tasks get overloaded to your position for the rate of pay and same goes for Team Lead. I didn't continue the course to Executive Team Lead as the culture seems to change from promote from within to ETL's being selected straight from college."
good,This job has turned very stressful and management is poor and often lazy. They will hide in offices and mess around with one another and get upset when the floor team members struggle.
good,"multi task all day, every day.,  a great culture. advancement hard to make happen. team was most enjoyable. there is job security with this company. it is a good starter job."
good,"Every changing environment that keeps you on your toes, daily routines are changed daily and at times the work load is bigger then the time frames given."
good,"Reported at work  or punched in at 7.00am..got my work uniform on, said help to my collegues and reported to my routine work stations "
good,The first place i ever worked.Its ok but i had to move around a bit.Started out on the salesfloor and went to work in the stockroom.Backstocking then gave way to The flowteam.
good,"Human Resources is a joke, when you ask for more hours they tell you that all they have to offer and that if you don’t like it you can simply leave, it would be better if they offered more hours to the people that actually worked well"
good,It was okay. It was stressful at times and when it was not stressful it was boring. I felt like even when we we finished our work we were cut off from talking to our coworkers.
good,I enjoyed working at Target for the short time I did. The hours went by fast because the work never stopped. the only thing I didn't enjoy was the lack of advancement opportunities.
good,"A typical day at Target would be, checking to see who is here, who you will be working with and which department you will be in for the rest of you closing shift. When doing a closing shift you must do reshop, zone and fill up your asiles. I learned how to manage time better based on how messy the department would be, depending on if its the weekend. The management is mostly strict when it comes to your zone, which means the neatness in the department. The most enjoyable part about my shift is my breaks. The hardest part about my shift is communicating with a manager who forgets within 10 minutes on what you tell them."
good,I worked here when I was 16 as my first job. It was pretty difficult to get a job here but my mom was friends with one of the managers. I was the youngest employee and felt like I was dumb. Constantly got yelled at and was on my feet all day.
good,If you're able to work graveyard then I do recommend this job but if those hours seem unreasonable to you I do not recommend working this job. Management can be reasonable but they do have a standard and they don't really seem sympathetic towards its workers
good,Food and flexible when it comes to scheduling if notified in reasonable time sometimes . Needs to improve on management and employee confidentiality and improve on the open door policy and understand that employees also ave ideas about smart working techniques.
good,"Good environment to work . Always in contact with people. Good employment benefits and room for advancement . Can acquire  experience in retail business, and  most importantly help my family."
good,"At my store we were severely understaffed, not so much from high turnover, but from just a lack of budget room to hire enough people. As a result, despite being hired for a specific department I was routinely moved around to various departments on a daily basis to help with short staffing."
good,"Overall Target is a very fast paced work environment. Your tasks will change daily as well as direction from leadership. Culture is great but really does depend on the Store leader. They set the pace and culture in each building. I've worked for good, bad and straight down horrible store leaders and they are the pioneers for store culture. Work like balance for ETL on up is a huge issue, if this is important to you then Target is not a good place for you. Pay and incentives are great however."
good,This job atmosphere is great for getting on your feet and expanding your resume for a first job.  If you need a job and are looking for a minimum wage random hour job then this is for you but I don't suggest getting comfortable.
good,Very good managers HR reps at the store were very powerhungry and cut throat. Department managers were fair and understanding upper managment did not care about basic workers.
good,"Every day I would be rushed to do work in a very small time frame, management cared more about the dollar than employees, and staff was almost always short."
good,"Good part time job to get some extra money. Benefits are not given unless you are a full time worker, including health care, insurance, etc. People are great"
good,"Target was a fun place to work for the team members there where super friendly but optimized working place management wasn't very open to taking constructive feedback from team members, very little room for moving on up but provided a decent experience for a first time/temporary job"
good,"Hectic work days"
good,"Typical day was to come in, prepare all machines, coffee and pastries for the customers in the morning and to maintain a clean work station while managing the milks and coffee made. Multitasking was a must. Pay was very low considering the effort needing to be put into the job and the attention to detail. Hours were all over the place and hardly ever got above 30."
good,"A typical day at work was never typical, working in Guest Relations every situation is different and you can't plan for what someone is going to bring you. I balanced a lot of different work centers including the front lanes which included: the cashiers, and cart attendants, myself being a cart attendant during the day as well; Starbucks; Target Cafe; as well as spent time with Sales Floor teams. For my team I never expected them to complete a task that I couldn't also complete, I tried to spend my time leading by example and not just managing. The workplace culture overall is what you would expect in any workplace environment, we worked as a team to complete various tasks and helped out when others needed. The hardest part of the job was finding time to balance my daily tasks with my team and guest relationships, my work center was one of the largest with the most guest interaction, and finding that balance at times was difficult. Overall, the thing that I enjoyed most was finding the time to be global within my store and making the relationships that I was able to create with not only my team, but with management and other teams as well."
good,"seasonal cashiering was challenging, demanding, fast pace, and busy. You meet any new people and are able to interact with many different types of people. Didn't feel the emphasis was on customer services some days but on promoting the in store credit card and debit card."
good,Work maintain area service customers do day to day task. you really don't get notice for the amount of work you put in when you should customers are nice
good,"Manipulative and false sense of  community.  Very political and a popularity contest.   THey care for the people that a well liked, but not the people who work hard or have been with the company for decades."
good,"I believe Target has a lot of potential for a long term career if retail is your thing. They offer well-being and vacation hours dependent on your time working there. However, this store is always messy, their team leads are chosen poorly & the team members that actually care are dismissed or threatened with their job. Whenever something is not up to par with the district managers expectations the ETLs that made the call blame their subordinates & they do not allow growth or change, hence their failure to comply and have the store up to the standards of any other store. Walmart pays more & is way cleaner. This is just the tip of the iceberg."
good,Employees work as a team to accomplish daily task.  Excellent training program.  Salary low for the work performed.  Great place to learn the ins and outs of retail merchandising.
good,"I was hired on for the christmas lead-up. I was trained for cashier work, and in electronics. The training was adequate, and hours were fair during the holiday time. Management was typical, with no bad examples or any outstanding ones, either. The team worked well, but any spots after the holiday season were vied for heavily. For the seasonal worker looking to stay on permanently, management made it feel more competitive than I would have preferred. If I had been hired on outside of seasonal work, I think this would have been more enjoyable."
good,I've been with Target for over two years and although the environment is something I loved I feel like I'm stuck at a point where I see little advancement. A lot of promises were made that were never made into reality and lack of support are some of the main reasons for my eventual departure.
good,To work in a Target store as sales is fun and  very customer service oriented specially if you love taking care and satisfying your customers. If you like Target products then work here.
good,"It was an okay job, but it wasn't stable. You would either get to many hours, or none. There is never an in between. I go to college and so I couldn't work full time but that never stopped them from giving me too many hours during school. I had previously complained that my availability says that I couldn't work the times schedule and RE-told them what I could work... Which is in the system so it's not like they couldn't look. This would happen time and time again. And if it wasn't getting over work, it was the exact opposite. 7 hours a week... 7?! How am I supposed to survive on 7 hours a week?! And this is how it is working at Target. The managers would always point fingers at others and never just apologize and work with me to find a stable schedule."
good,High demand to sell red cards but low pay. supervisors only get paid 9.09 per hour! alot of stress and responsibility. Job does not feel secure and some bullying mentality between one manager
good,"From the start of the shift to the end, management was always hounding employees. Management would sit in a meeting room and goof off and then walk the floors calling out employees. The employees were mean and judgmental. The most enjoyable part of the day was when we had to do the closing announcements and collected reshop."
good,"As a softlines employee, you are required to clean the floor, organize clothing, and direct guests to what they are looking for. During certain hours of the day and depending on how crowded it is, you may be required to go up to the front as a backup cashier."
good,"Most people coming in to the warehouse don't plan on staying long and are continuing education. Within the time I have worked there, there was about 30% or more turnover for warehouse workers. The management turnover is quite high as well. Lower/Middle management hardly has an control over the immediate business. The business is reactionary even though they have a vision for being proactive. However if you didn't know how to work hard the job will teach you. Most people are down to earth that you interact with. If you need some good money while you set yourself up for your future I'd suggest the warehouse position. I wouldn't recommended a long term job/career if you can avoid it."
good,As a logistics member we stock the shelves. Often times we get people who think it will be slow paced and easy and find out it is the opposite and leave thus leaving more responsibility on the remaining team members. We are understaffed and short on hours and they still expect us to get these huge trucks done in 4 or five hours. Something that is realistically not capable unless you feel like you are killing yourself by overworking.
good,"- A typical day at work- shifts consist of; re-shop, repacks, stocking, and always zoning each isle perfectly before the end of your day. Occasionally you will be asked to help with stocking the grocery department. Also the TL up at the lanes will call for back up once in a while. You'll greet guests and help them find the things they need. answering phones in your section too. Answering to the service boxes located all throughout the store. This job requires a lot of walking as well but it's great exercise. "
good,"The companies direction is silly.  They say that they prioritize certain things, but their actions say differently.  Work life balance is good, only if you don't care about working extremely long shifts.  Pay isn't that good.  The bonuses aren't good, and pay raises are good to start but then topple off quickly.  Overall, you will be safe here, but very frustrated with trying to lead or drive anything."
good,"This job provides great management experience but the culture within the store is very poor. The upper management wants to support all managers but there is too much going on for them to actually make a difference and really help. Target over works you, thats why the pay is so high. The best part was developing and working with your team, thats why I went into work everyday not because of my peers. The hardest part of the job was the negative environment of the store."
good,Didn't care for the group leaders for my shift. They weren't exactly professional. A lot of people could tell they had their favorite workers. My fellow colleagues were pretty interesting though. Made some good friends and great memories.
good,"Unfortunately, since Target pays higher than average, managers expect the hard-working employees to do the work of 2-3 people. Those who don't work as hard don't seem to get fired unless they don't show up for shifts. I started as a seasonal hire and I worked my butt off to prove I was good enough to stay on permanently, and now that high standard has been raised with each pay raise. "
good,New management is shot and stressful now. Not good with teamwork aspect of job role. They expect more for less. Very undermining and lack of consistency.
good,"A typical day at Target includes clocking in, then asking the LOD (Leader on Duty), what section they wanted you to be in. After you are assigned your section, you are responsible for making sure the area looks neat and presentable."
good,Target is a great place to work with some room for advancement. Team oriented with a passion to build strength and the individual. They are a secure company to work for.
good,"It's fun working there,  always take advantage of seeing new things first before customers buy it... and meet people and some help people find what they want to find."
good,"Target agrees to work with your availability but they constantly give you hours that do not. When a team member needs help to help the guest, management lacks in providing it. One is constantly reminded that RedCards are needed and if you do not meet the goal, you are written up for it as a warning."
good,Management needs to improve but overall I was able to stay busy and be productive on the job as well as learn and advance many skills with the help of other team members.
good,The thing about Target is that different managers from different departments run rotate shifts as Leader on duty (LOD). There is a morning leader a mid-day leader and a closing leader. So the type of day it will be varies depending on the temperament and mood of the LOD. And if you have a mid shift chances are that you will be under the leadership of three different leaders with three different expectations and three different charachter traits. Once one hands the store off to another the mood of the store can go form cool to tense quickly depending on their moods. That is probably the most frustrating part of working for Target. However if most of the managers are decent then it’s not that bad.
good,working at target was a wonderful first job that gave me experience in a retail environment.my coworkers were my favorite thing about working at target because even if it was a rough day they made it bearable.
good,"i think they should worry  about their team and how they are treated by the hire ups and how other team members treat them. "
good,The department that I work in is great and our team lead is awesome and always willing to help and compromise with your schedule. But Target doesn't I've us a lot of hours and they keep hiring new employees that they can't pay to work.
good,"You clock in and you start your shift. If you are an excellent worker, no one is going to backbite you. If you are a awful worker, expected the Leader of Department to talk about how bad you are."
good,"Great place for most, good work environment, good management, flexible hours,  but, it is very hard to move up in this company unless you have a connectiuon"
good,A typical work day varies according to the season.  Each day is a growing experience in working with the guest that come to shop.  Creativity is important when working with inventory to maintain the shopper culture.
good,"Great environment, work isn't too difficult or strenuous.  Bad management and very low hours.  Difficult to get vacation time.  This job can get stressful, especially during the holiday season, but working in the holiday season at Target can be fun."
good,"People are very nice here and scheduling is flexible but can have lack of hours, benefits and advancement!! No sonority extra pay for years in, multiple departments you work. No training either and work with minimal staffing."
good,"Target is a great place to work. Just like many retailers, your day to day in the job will consist on analyzing sales data, identifying trends and course correct. Target has a real high phase environment which makes it not the best fit for some. However, management is very responsive and supportive of employees needs. The most enjoyable part of Target is its fast fun and friendly culture. This company truly stands by it and provides people with the necessary tools to be successful."
good,"Target provided a great team environment to work within. I also was able to learn a great deal about consumer electronics. However, the workload often exceeded the compensation given."
good,"the only reason i would recommend someone to work here is the pay. due to their recent wage increase though, they really cut hours and hired more people. so if you are ok with very little hours then it is worth it. not everyone does their job correctly and follow all procedures, especially some of the high schoolers that close at night which make it harder on the day person. they try to encourage you and say you are a part of a team, but i did not feel that at all towards the end of my time there. i felt i had office managers, not team leads. i tried asking for more hours and they would say check the swap shift board (most were taken or went against availability), not even try to help me out. most of my coworkers were dissatisfied with hours and some were there more years than i was. also they will try to keep your average hours just below the mark to keep you from becoming full time."
good,"I was seasonal at my local target and while $11 an hour isn't terrible, the management at this location was awful. They'd make the cashiers do the cart duty, even though the stockers would walk around talking about who knows what doing nothing."
good,"There haven't been many hours for part-time. Since I've been there, only have worked over 30 hours once. Average hours during peak times are less than 20 per week."
good,"I'll be fairly brief, working here has been like a roller coaster. Often times it reminded me of high school. There were always favorites among the management and our team leads and favortisim played a huge part in everyday life at this job.  At times working around the store was a breeze and others times it felt like swimming against a current."
good,Had been given many opportunities to grow and learn in the company. Along with having a friendly atmosphere. It was just hard to find an opportunity to achieve more hours.
good,"As a company I believe Target is a great business with all the different product they sell. However, at my location there was a lot of drama and the managers acted like children."
good,"Worked as a bakery Team Member, honestly just didn’t like the position. Felt I would’ve been more comfortable as being a stocker or something of the sorts. At my location, management was very “cliquey” and ran by 25 year olds that were very lazy."
good,"Not much more than you would expect from a typical cashier position, although there was a heavy emphasis on getting customers to sign up for credit cards."
good,"It was nice at first, but then took an ugly turn."
good,"Target was a fun job when I started. I liked my job, liked my coworkers and liked my managers. Then, corporate decided that things needed to be changed up with staff. They swapped all of each departments managers, so now the backroom team manager was our ( salesfloor members) boss. The backroom manager expected everyone on the salesfloor (who weren't trained for backroom) to do backroom levels of work. It didn't fly for most people, and everyone began to quit. "
good,"Hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult shoplifters"
good,Working with the peers that I had was wonderful. They were helpful and supportive. We helped each other out and we made some strong connections with each other
good,Seasonal work.  Wish I would have got hired on full time. Fast-paced environment.  Packaged and shipped merchandise to Target customers. Match labels with product.
good,I did not work there long enough to give an  accurate review.  The time I was there was found to be an average retail operation.  The supervisor was fair in her management of personnel.
good,"Essentially, Target prides itself on being ""Higher Class Wal-Mart"", which is true and false at the same time. Usually always neat, employees are trained to be as friendly and helpful as can be. Pay sucks for all they ask you to do, but that's just retail. Management can be cool, understanding about a lot of things if you're on their good side."
good,The people there were just self-centered. The managers were arrogant and didn't understand how to operate the store themselves. Highly unimpressed. immediately I took action into finding a new workplace
good,"I have been at Target since 2015 as a Team Member. I started in a SuperTarget and the experience was great; personable managers, really nice coworkers, starting wage of $10/hour (now $11), and very fair policies in my opinion. "
good,"It was a place for people to gain experience. While I did learn alot, I felt that the job was something less than desirable. It is not something I would do for a lifetime."
good,I would not suggest to work here unless you enjoy the idea of it. The management is pretty lacking and the HR department is sort of poor detailing to be honest.
good,"Sorry, but I do not wish to write a summary for Target. It was a seasonal position and that's it. And I don't know why this is required to proceed with this application process."
good,"The job is pretty easy, the only thing that makes it hard is the other employees and bosses, everyone seems to take it far too seriously. The bosses rarely if ever give positive feedback, only seem to be willing to reprimand you for not doing something the way they wanted you to."
good,"Customer service is important, meeting your sales goals is always the goal for the day. Retail sales are always easy if you have good customer service and a nice attitude."
good,Very stressful during the holiday months.  Very demanding and not enough help to get the job done but expected to by the managers.  Makes for not a fun environment to work under.
good,Unload morning truck and line pallets with manual pallet jack.  Distribute pallets to all areas of store.  Stock shelves with new items and back stock items that can not go out. Collect and bale all cardboard and compact trash.
good,"Work day usually begins around 6:00 AM, and ends whenever the truck is empty. Each shift usually included one 15 minute break and typically ended before noon."
good,"depending on what location you work in with see how busy your location is.  friendly people, decent managers and flexible hours.  working as target mobile representative and working hand in hand with target mobile employees."
good,I've worked at Target since 2005 although I have been a dedicated employee my hours are not enough and they pay for the amount of work I do for the company is not enough.
good,"About what you expect. Bottom-level retail jobs aren't exactly the cream of the crop. Job was secure, but unrewarding and monotonous. I learned how to use warehouse equipment and work in a team. Supervisors were mostly there to crack the whip - they mostly had to obey the corporate edicts as much as us, but had the actual responsibility for it. Culture started out ""fast, fun and friendly"", but as supervisors came and went and corporate pulled shenanigans, it got to be Just A Job. There was nothing particularly hard about it, and nothing particularly enjoyable."
good,I worked at Target for over 3 years. The main problem is hour shortages. The lowest hours I recieved for a work week was 8. It seems that the managers do enjoy picking favorites and making excuses. Outside of that problem it is a fairly nice place to work.
good,"Hardest part of the job is the 5am or earlier start. The rest is cake. Retail is subject to seasonal shopping trends thus, hours can dip and rise drastically. "
good,Target was a good place to work at. They just didn't have enough hours to really make a living off of. I wasn't full time and I had to find a different job that I could make a living off of.
good,I had fun at Target. I had a good relationship with my co workers and managers. I left because I was in High school and I didn't see myself going up in the ladder.
good,"A typical day at work is pulling orders for customers or loading freight onto trailers for shipment. "
good,"I originally started as a cashier, but do to an injury I became a zoner. With organize and restock the shelves. My general spot was the $1-$3 section. Given that I received no instructions other than to look for items that don't belong in that section, instruct other zoners, and stock, I took it upon myself organize in away that brought it more customers to my section and then took a step forward to also learned other ways to help them with their experience. I learned to observe the customers product habits and acted on them. Within four months of organizing there was an increase of 1.8% of items being sold and it continued to increase. Soon I not only organized, but also took my breaks to observe different item locations in the store inorder to increase helping the customers find the items they were looking for. Especially when no other team member was helping them no matter how many they had asked. Since most of my co-workers were too relaxed it allowed me to gain and polish my observing skills. The main dull point wound be the work scheduling and the memory of my managers. The scheduling was to unreliable and so was my managers because they would for get was working there, even if I worked right next to them."
good,"I'm not sure about other departments, but if you work up front, job security is mainly about how many credit card applications you can get per shift.  I had multiple customers that would only shop when I was there, and my time was almost always excellent unless I had to wait for a manager when there was an issue with pricing/tags.  However, certain managers would happily berate me and others, on the floor, for not getting X amount of credit applications per hour.  Between that, and the petty jealousy of a lot of the girls there, barely above minimum wage wasn't worth the daily headaches.  The customers weren't as shady as at some other places, and most of the angry ones you can avoid unless you were directly at customer service, but all but 2 of my managers, and there were about 6 just for the cashiers, were horrendous and got away with it despite the cameras watching employees more than customers.  Not worth the seasonal/part time pay given only rare occasions to advance pay/position."
good,"When I had just been hired in, they told me they would call me with a training schedule within 2-3 days. I called them 3 days later asking if anything had changed, they told me to wait a bit longer. Two weeks go by of me trying to contact them. I finally get though and they are confused and throw me right into the job by myself on my first day with no training whatsoever. One of the vendors had to teach me how to do my job because of the lack of training. When they want something done they just expect you to know what they want right away without them having to tell you which was especially hard for me not having been trained. Four weeks into the job I finally took the electronic portion of the training but all it thought me was how to clean up spills and things I already knew about video games."
good,1. people buying the things they wanted and needed
good,"Start your work day off by unloading the the product to place in the right section of the store. what I learn how to place the product in the store neatly in the correct order to be presentable when the guest shop so they can easily find what they are looking for. very laid back easy job, Hardest part was upper management not doing their part in the store helping not all of the upper management just some. Enjoyable part was helping other team member and the guest."
good,"The team member isn’t too important any more. Maybe it’s local leadership. "
good,"Load trailers with merchandise; Learned how to read work orders to make sure correct merchandise goes to correct locations; Management could have been more hands on but other then that everything else was amazing as far as the culture friendly employees, answering questions that I inquired. I enjoyed the diverse group of people I encountered during my assignment."
good,"The job was relatively easy and the co-workers were great. The main problem is management plays favorites, and you wont advance unless your sleeping with the right person (no joke). I swear it is like a high school there with all the drama."
good,"The managers were very inconsistent from day to day. One manager asked me to work less detailed so that I would get done faster, even though I got done on time. The managers reprimand you very often and give very little praise for the work you do. Most of them have unrealistic expectations of how much work a few people can do in only three hours. Some managers were great and really encouraging and we worked very hard, but others were rude and condescending and made you feel as though you had no idea what you were doing even though you have been doing the job for months."
good,"In the clothing department, the days can either be very lax or a complete nightmare. Guests are always asking you for impossible tasks, and blame you for not knowing enough about other departments because at my store, you're never allowed to cross-train if you're Softlines. They literally do not want us to leave. "
good,I enjoyed some of the autonomy you get as an ETL. You are able to make some decisions on your own and decided how to run a work center within the store.
good,Great opportunity for a first job in management as you can lead a large team with little to no experience.  Hardest part of the job is addressing declining sales and hitting all targets you are responsible for.
good,I really enjoyed working at target. I learned a lot form the way the company was ran to the way they appreciate there employees. They are a fair company that truly values there customers and there employees.
good,"I'be been with target for 5 years now I am as high up as I can get without transferring. After the Christmas season the hours drop quick, I went from 30-40 hours a week to 12 hours. The money is decent with most people coming in at 11 an hour. Everyone is friendly and it starts to become a big family."
good,"Management made the work atmosphere tense and unpredictable at all times. They were uncooperative and gave no support to the staff, only concerned with their own agendas. I worked for the main corporation and not the local management, I was in a very unique situation and observed many unfair practices on the local level."
good,I  think Target can offer more than what then offering... especially when I'm a great worker...some of the boss's or great and then you have some who has no respect because of their job title...I like Target it's not a bad job I just wish some of the things they do will change for the better and make their team members more excited to come to work
good,"Target is retail so you're going to get paid little for the amount of work you do if your a sales floor team member. "
good,i like the shift i work its convient to my daily life style 4pm till 2am and weekends off gives me acapible time to spend time with my kids and loved ones
good,"It's a great place to work if you are a people person or just want to build thick skin. Everything else, you'll just have to overlook."
good,"Temporary I was a employee at target, my back room manager wasn't so kind to me, really seemed disinterested in my hire, but other than that staff isfr."
good,You are required to upsell for a Target RedCard.  If you don't get so many within a week you can get written up.  There is no consistancy in scheduling and they are not flexible for those who have children
good,"First store I worked at the manager who was in charge of me was a pig and not manager material at all. Second store was awesome, had problems sometimes but better than the first."
good,"With low wages, they take what they can get causing the biggest problem. The employees don't work together, there is no cohesion. The harder you work the less someone who just doesn't care does."
good,It's a great place to work for your first job.  Flexible hours and friendly environment.  Slow pace and diverse.  The communication part among the workers needs improvement.
good,Here for contract position. It was okay. I liked the work environment and coworkers but disliked the job itself. The work-life balance is not good because hours were bad. It's difficult to have a social life outside of work.
good,It was ok working here. I loved my coworkers! there was always something for you to do at this job. however one thing that I didn't like what how many times they would call me in for work and do things that I didnt getting paid enough for doing
good,Management was not in touch with there team we was under man on our shift. Then ask to work faster an harder. Long work time between breaks. Couldn't talk while you work.
good,"Although it was fun most of the day it was stressful, not because of the team it was the neighborhood.  Helping guests was mostly great but many of the guests seemed as if they did not trust us. Keeping the sales floor full and knowing everything possible about the product was always important and a great way to get through the day."
good,"Although it was a part time seasonal job, the hours were flexible and management wasn't bad. The overnight work was the best part about working here, because you had all day to yourself and worked all night. This could get in the way of a night life but was great for day time activities like shopping. I enjoyed working there but after the Christmas season was let go."
good,"I started my work day off by setting up the area, making sure we had everything stocked and available for the other staff members that would be needed through out the day."
good,"As a backroom associate you could find yourself stocking freight, cleaning up the back room and unloading trucks. Management was fairly clear on what they needed pulled from storage racks for floor displays and back stock needed on the floor. If you are the associate maintaining the back room you will spend most of your night unloading trucks, stacking pallets and managing back stock that goes on pallets and stack on racks. On occasion you will finish and head out to stock isles to finish your shift."
good,"Management at the store level leaves much to be desired.  Navigating those personalities and shifting needs proves the most difficult aspect. The atmosphere provided a great learning experience, moving forward."
good,The job was a summer job that I held. The management seemed to not have any ideas on how to get the results they wanted. Example they wanted people to stay latter to finish work but at the same time we were never given any incentive to do so besides more hours. (Note we were not allowed to hit 40 hours so these extra hours were at the slandered rate).
good,"A lot depends on your store and ETL culture but in general the job requires more time spent working and managing tasks than actual people or doing activities that would suggest your are an actual ""executive"""
good,"Good place to start part time but not much advancement. Management can be poor depending on the store, it is easy to tell, just look at how clean, organized, and stocked the shelves are."
good,"Pretty sure most people know how Target operates. You are in a team, then you move to another team, then another. Eventually you drink the red kool-aid and are stuck for life."
good,"Good place to start off working if you are in school. If you are a cashier, it is difficult to get your lunch/ breaks on time. The training is easy, but you soon figure out that you are not trained well."
good,target has a way of pushing out the people who they dont like. just because they dont like the workers doesnt mean they arent hard workers and get the job done. its all about personal vendetas. no matter how hard you work they will always seem to shove you out if you dont follow there thoughts or beliefs. the pay is ok and they benefits are not good. you practically have to take half of your already low paycheck to pay for them.
good,This is a good place to work for someone who just got out of  high school or someone who just wants a good paying job with benefits. This is not the place for someone to advance in their career if they are not management. Only management advances. There is a high turn-over rate in management. Poor management.
good,"This was, for all intents and purposes, a standard,customer service driven, big-box retail operation."
good,Working at target was not an enjoyable experience. I was the front end manager and was in charge of guest service and the cashiers. It was all the duties of a manager with none of the pay. You are basically an intern with the amount of money received.
good,This was my launch of a second career after 18 years in the gaming industry. I was able to join the Target team as a seasonal worker and managed to prove worthy of a permanent position.I worked my way up the ranks with the help of great managers/mentors. I always felt valued for myself and my strengths.I recieved feedback often and fairly.
good,"On call 24/7 started as a cashier and learned that new things like zoning and costumer is always right. In the Pharmacy, Management is very stern, watching you constantly. But very friendly at time making it easier to cope with the job."
good,"If you like middle management and don't have much ambition to succeed, then Target will treat you well.  There were many of my peers that had been in their positions for 15+ years."
good,"If you're not a management favorite, you will not advance or be given a raise. I was constantly complimented by guests daily but was looked down on management for whatever reason. Target is a great place to work if you're young or a student, but for the average person its tough. Hours depend on the amount of business the store receives. Tough, if you're an adult."
good,"The co-workers, the guests, and even unruly guests weren't my main problem with working at Target. The main problem that I had with Target was the management. It seemed that there was a lot of favoritism in the store. Some employees could get away with not working very hard, but when an employee was working hard and didn't get everything done, they were scolded."
good,"I had to leave because they didn't respect the fact that I was a student, its a large environment, and you get plenty of irritated customers, but the work was easy and the pay was fantastic, just make sure you say you can work a little less than you actually can if you want to breathe"
good,It was a fast fun and friendly environment and they keep you very busy but from time to time the work was very repetitive which made it difficult to keep doing the same tasks.
good,"I did enjoy my time at Target however there is a lack of upward mobility.  Getting promoted is pretty difficult and recruiting is done heavily from fresh college grads with lack of experience in management and retail in general.  Schedule is consistently changing as business needs do so its difficult to have a stable schedule.  10% Discount was nice, and the discount on organics and produce was even higher (additional 20%)"
good,Lot's of turnover within the company. Future of company is very uncertain with closure of nodes. Enjoyed the people I worked with however the direction of leadership was a constant change.
good,"Things are changing quickly from the top down in this company and it seems that the roles that the different positions have are not black and white or consistent. Many company policies are not being enforced, or ignored, and it is hard to know where to draw the line. Due to the rapid rate of change it is difficult to know which policies are to be upheld and which ones aren't. This company seems to be moving away from the ""family"" atmosphere for the team members to an atmosphere of supporting those guests that have a sense of entitlement."
good,"A typical day at Target Inc. would begin with restocking / organizing merchandise while preparing aisle & sales planners. Throughout the day you'll help customers locate and purchase items, while dealing with any cleaning and prep for the following shift. The company offers chances to advance as well as relocate."
good,"The pace is non-stop.  Numbers matter more than quality, and there is little chance of advancement even with a degree.  The benefits are great, but the working environment is constantly declining."
good,"I love working at Target, great job while in college, management may be different, have different expectations from store to store, you may have a different experience from one store to the next when transferring"
good,"Management does not care about employees or their well-being, only production numbers. Hard to advance to a management position regardless of positive reviews and support from supervisors."
good,This job is good for high school and college students. This is not the place to go if you are looking for advancement and a positive working environment.
good,work was fun for a while everyone would come in happy and ready to work. soon enough management became irritable annoying. we were working with the bare minimum of people.
good,After thirteen years in two different stores I  am starting to realize how much a difference an effective STL makes on that store. Working 9 pm- 9 am often times with no other ETL or TL could make or break the overall process.
good,Good experience  to build your resume. No work life balance. good benefits and pay for recent grad. Depends on the store that your at and your position.
good,"Normal work place nothing more nothing less."
good,"the job would have been better if the mgmt would listen to the rest of the team for ideas on how to go about things, its a ""team"" driven business but they dont work in ""teams""."
good,For lower level employees Target is great with working with schedules. However it is almost impossible to move up in the company and you will see outside hire after outside hire for leadership positions.
good,"Work was fast paced, and continual which i enjoyed.  Started with Merchandising, and logistics throughout the store......was being moved at the time to a Dept. to work a regular basis in.......I stepped off a ladder at home and twisted my ankle and had to take 2 months off work.......they held my position for me, but Irs called me in with much better benefits.  The managers were great, upper management was great......."
good,"a good job for a stepping stone to greater things, not really a place i could see myself working long term, but hey for some people its perfect. Good company overall"
good,"A equipe na qual trabalhava era sempre unida, tive oportunidade de aprender coisas novas."
good,"I really enjoyed working there only because of the wage they gave me.  I think that's a problem.  I understand that a good wage is important, but I feel like good management is what makes workers stay."
good,I enjoy  working in retail more than I thought I would.   The quest are nice and the co workers are easy to get along with and I think that most of the managers are fair
good,"Its not a place where you can advance and even if you do advance you don’t get a raise. The management is very poor there, and theres alot of  favoritism."
good,"Working for this company was a pain because their was always a moving target, no pun intended. You would just figure out how to work according to one procedure, when management suddenly moves the goal posts. Luckily, my manager was unbelievable, and I was willing to go to the ends of the earth for her. I loved the people I worked with, but the company as a whole left a bitter taste in my mouth."
good,Target was very flexible with my college schedule. Most of the management  was fair and communicated there expectations very well. The work environment was generally friendly and quick paced.
good,"When I started at Target the work environment was fast paced but easily manageable. After a few months of working there, the environment went from being fast and friendly to very hostile. I would not recommend this specific Target to anyone due to the horrible management."
good,Process changes causing poor management decisions and lowering overall moral.  Good place for newly graduated adults looking for experience in distribution management.
good,"It's fine if this is going to be your first job, but the leads may take advantage of yo depending on the department you work. Also setting up your availability is a pain, they will reject you because they ""need you to work more because you're the best"" even if you're cutting you're availability for SCHOOL. also they'll always schedule you against your availability. And they hardly promote within, if there's a position available they either transfer someone from a diff store or hire someone new, even if they say they'll consider you, they won't."
good,"I work for the flow team, tedious work if the co worker you work with calls in, is do-able. Could offer more hours and better pay for this kind of work"
good,"I have been with Target for over a year and for 95% of my work experience there I would say it was great. The people I work with are some of the nicest people I know we always cheered when we heard of someone leaving for a better place or getting a promotion within the store. The only downside to Target is the lack of pay raises/advancement. I have been sitting for six long months waiting for my promotion to team lead or PMT and every time I go in to ask about the ETA the management always said ""Soon"". Its a GREAT job to start out at and the stores will always need help so if you are in high school or college and need some cash I recommend working for your local Target."
good,"a typical work day at target is do so much in so little time for so little pay. Cart Attendants only get paid minimum wage and for the work they have to do plus the receiving the carts, it doesnt add up."
good,I worked at a location that has recently closed.  At the time I worked there the general manager and team leads were great to work with.  I left due to work life balance and that the hr representative played favoritism.
good,I would check guests out at the cash register. I learned how to handle hard situations and difficult people. The management was very good. The hardest part of this job was trying to sign people up for RedCards. I enjoyed being able to work at my favorite store.
good,"I hate the way how target watches their employees more than the customers because the customers steals everyday and they don't do anything about it. That's unfair. There is a lot of favortism there it is not how you perform your work it is who they like more will get the promotion. They pay the cashiers very cheap for 10.75 an hour it is ridiculous."
good,A typical day at work was busy all the time and for a new timer in retail is not the best because of how big the store is. I learned that you really have to have good time management skills.
good,"Target has a great culture for anyone who is not a call center employee. My coworkers are amazing and the job itself is exactly as expected for a call center working fraud."
good,"Coworkers and customers are generally pleasant to work with, but failure to sign customers up for Target's Redcard can lead to a negative review and eventual termination."
good,There are no fulltime positions unless you are in management. This is great for a student or retired person who doesn't need to support them selves and have other means of financial support. There job experience for all positions. I enjoyed working for Target I needed a fulltime job with better pay and advancement.
good,Target cut hours some months  and team leaders press a lot to team members and that make it very stressful but at least they are respectful and help each other so team member are very good
good,Working here was wonderful for me I absolutely loved it. Some Things are hectic but overall it's a good place to be. The only bad thing is they never have enough staff at the store at the same time.
good,"I first began working for Target, I was a cashier. There was a heavy emphasis on getting Redcard signups, but it was known going into it. Upper management only ever rewarded signups and never recognized great guest service. There are no commissions on signups. I've now worked in many of the workcenters available in the store. They've moved to Beauty most recently. They originally told me I would be doing detail work, inventory management, and backstocking. They neglected to tell me 80% of my shift and performance would actually be focused on aggressive selling in cosmetics. I've been given no training or knowledge on the products, just told to sell. The worst part is for all of these added responsibilities, there has been no raise whatsoever."
good,I loved what I done at target it was the unfair treatment given ti the employees I did not like. Maybe if it would have been different management it would have been better.
good,managers don't care about who works for them . would rather reprimand them for taking days off when they have a family emergency / death in the family
good,"Not bad, but pay sucks. You can advance but it takes a long time. The job is easy and the people and culture are great. Overall, if the pay was better they would be a much better company to work for."
good,Every 6 months you have a new manager. Hours aren't steady. They can't promise full time hours. Depending on coverage was how many breaks you got and how long your shift was
good,"Target is an awesome place to start your career. They get people to stay by overpaying everyone, so you will make lots of money. You won't leave because you make more there than you will make anywhere else. At some point though - you have to examine and say the paycheck isn't worth your life."
good,"I started off as a cashier and my hours weren't structured since I offered to work as much as possible. Because there's a 40hr limit and the schedule varies, you might not always reach 40hrs per week. The breaks and lunch are short and no included towards your overall time."
good,Management and leads were ok to work with but the starting pay was horrible. Overall fun and caring environment and coworkers were a pleasure to work with.
good,Was ok. People were always calling in.   The company is very cheap and doesn't appreciate their employees. Had great managers while I was there.  They treated the food workers like we were really low on the totem pole.
good,not a bad place to work. only downside is the selling of the red cards. if you don't sell the red cards you will not get hours. I mean like DRASTICALLY you lose hours. im talking you'll work a total of 10 hours for a two week pay period
good,"the job itself is simple, but the enjoyment of the job hinges upon coworkers and boss.  Wheb i first started my boss was rude, disrespectful, and self absorbed- no one liked working with her. However, eventually management changed and the working atmosphere improved greatly."
good,"Working at Target is perfect for a young person looking for experience or someone older who wants a minimal, basic job. I've worked at target for over 2 years and was never promoted or  considered to be promoted into any higher position or even cross trained. My one and only raise was $0.13, overall the job can be easily outgrown if you are a regular team member. However, higher up positions seem to do well!"
good,good part time job  hard to get hours. work for days for 20 hours. there can be a break down in communication with management.  there are a lot of call in because management does not rotate weekends
good,A well organized workplace where team work is everything. Everyone works with you from employees to managers. Some demands can be a little much because of work ethics but overall it is a good place to work
good,All though Target is a great company he Management is not the best. Some of the higher ups ca not even look you in the face when they are talking to you.
good,"Management weren't terrible people, but corporate pushed them too hard to make their weekly sales goals and it forced them to push their employees even harder as a result. Some co-workers were really friendly, nice, and fun to talk too. Others made the job absolutely miserable. Most customers were nice and understanding; but there was always the occasional customer that enjoyed making himself/herself the center of attention for the day and would send the whole sales team scrambling to find some $5 item that they wouldn't end up buying anyways. The internal inventory system never worked and often lead to issues with customers looking for items that were not in the store to begin with, leading to some ruffled feathers. Scheduling was decent, HR was understanding of outside commitments and worked with employees, not against them. I had heard of people not getting paid properly when payday came around, but it never happened to me personally. Turnover was high and the managers were oftentimes just as overworked as their subordinates. The store was consistently understaffed. Morale amongst the bottom-level employees was almost always a stone's throw away from something akin to the Spanish Inquisition. Occasionally, employees would simply not show up to their shifts, sending management into a hissy fit and screaming over the walkie talkies for anyone to help out with cashiering. Raises were on a per year basis, and would amount to .30 to .60 cents at a time."
good,"Everyone felt unsure what to do because authority figures didnt care about properly training its employees. Then was let go because of ""seasonal overhiring"""
good,"The management is always changing and that makes it hard to do your job, most people do not get 40 hours a week and you are usually asked to do more than you have time for."
good,"Its ok if you like retail, rotating shifts and standing for long periods of time. Evening shifts can be longer hours because you have to clean up the store, but thats typical for retail."
good,"If the employee is willing to go with the flow and have a positive attitude then they can enjoy working there. It is the guests that make it an enjoyable place to work. The regulars get to know the staff and treat them with a smile and hello.  The hardest part of the job is depending on the position you may be scheduled to leave at a certain hour but find yourself there hours longer, if you are flexible then it is okay."
good,"The pay is good, when not in a busy season the expectations are not exactly realistic. Great benefits, will not be able to work in your own department. A lot of things they do for the business does not make a whole lot of sense and are usually short on answers for questions employees have."
good,It sucked. Made wonderful friends.  Lots of work.  If management didn't like you they would do anything possible to get you fired. Hardest part of the job was waking up to be at work at 4am
good,Target was a good experience for me.  It was my first retail job.  Very fast paced at times.  Great for cross training through out departments.  Heavy work load at times.
good,"typical day would be: punch in my employee number, go to the backroom and start preparing cages so people can throw the boxes the merchandise is in. Our team unpackaged and put out  on the floor, over 600 items per truck in 2 hours. "
good,"Working here is sometimes unpredictable, for the most part, the staff has much more experience in management and work experience overall than our actual managers. On a day to day basis you replenish empty shelves or font face product and can always count on someone to not come into work so the work load becomes double."
good,Working here wasn't horrible. I got hired very quickly (within a week) but after that I wasn't given much opportunity to move elsewhere in the store and eventually I had to quit.
good,"Been very fast paced and has busy seasons and then extremely slow times with low hours. Very customer based job with customers' satisfaction always placed on top priority. Team leads are not always helpful or fair to everyone with the same treatment. Felt really appreciated in the beginning and received customer appreciations often, but as time went on, with the fluctuations of sales and high turn over of co-workers, my responsibilities grew, but my status did not. I have enjoyed the time here, but hope to move on to more stable position."
good,"Direct and supervise the activities 8 mechanics and utility attendants to maintain the production capabilities of the controls, conveyor systems and powered mobile equipment. Collaborate across operational departments to discuss production plans and identify system issues."
good,Management can vary store-to-store. I did not love my experience because of an overworked workstation (Presentation/Planogram). My new STL (Store Team Lead) was not supportive of our workstation either.
good,"Very busy store but high turnover rate and disorganized. The Sales Floor is always in chaos with things out of location or scattered in almost every aisle. Very little accountability per associate. The pay is decent but full time positions are only provided to team leads or higher and benefits are only provided to those who average over 30 hours per week. The work is fast paced at times and the days go by quickly which is a plus. I wouldn't say it's a terrible place to work but between the HR department, scheduling and management there is a lot of disorganization and chaos on a regular basis."
good,Really flexible with your schedule. Management can be slightly annoying but is a decent part time job. Cant really complain about my experience there.
good,"Working at Target was a fun experience, but when the management changed its been difficult and stressful. Especially when it comes to getting descent hours and how things are managed at the store."
good,The hardest part of working at target is not sure how many hours someone will get. there's thing i like about working there that is for a few hours then just going home.
good,While I was there the managers would do nothing but make fun of other employees and would hang out together. I was constantly being called in and written up for no-call-no-shows AFTER already having days approved off by.
good,Hardest part is keeping up.  Logistics is very fast paced and you need to be at your best to keep up.  I have learned that retail is very unreliable as a job and you can be replaced very easily no matter how long you have worked there or how good you are at your job.
good,Working here was a little hectic at times but the busyness of the store always kept me working and moving around. I like that it was fast paced but I just felt like after a while this isn't something I'd see myself doing as a career job.
good,This place is a good starting job. A first time job holder would have a positive experience here and most of the managers are good to work for but not all of them.
good,"The Target culture seems to seep deeper into their employees skulls with tenure / advancement. I could be wrong though,  i met a few individuals who seemed to be exception to the trend so it could be a location specific thing. Its very self defeating though and given the look of their market share issues i may not be the last person to notice something strange in the kool-aid. Good intentions, bad execution."
good,"Worked for this company for around a year, fairly easy job though my location was one of the busiest in the state. Very fast paced and sales goals oriented."
good,I wanted to experiment a fast paced retail store with many departments. It was not the career I was going for so I had to leave it to focus on my studies.
good,"Arriving to work Saturday through Monday, 12 hour days. Clocking into work at 6pm and transitioning to our individual lines. We take 2 30 minute breaks throughout the night, one including lunch.  My current position is to throw boxes onto a line 13inches apart. The end of my shift is 6am, off Tuesday through Friday."
good,Target is parttime only and would be four hour shifts and they would have you come in randomly to give you shifts. Didn't really have a set schedule at all
good,"Flexible and easy to do part-time while in college. A decent environment would depend heavily on management, peers, and area. Overall, a decent job to have and the extra discount comes in handy during the holidays."
good,Culture is very diverse and expectations are high. Time management and knowledge of store is required to help customers in need. I learned how to become a great team member for the corporation.
good,I learned the job does not promote within.  The management was confused and was not organized.  I worked well with my immediate team members in my work area.
good,"The people are always great to work with. The work can be a bit repetitive and exhausting. Lots of responsibilities for little reward. Also because it's retail, you're not really valued as much; you're very disposable. Managers do tend to play favorites, but that's in every industry."
good,"I worked during the holiday season.  I learned several different areas that included inventory, time management. The hardest part of the position I would say was not enough staff, it made it sometimes challenging to complete all assignments.  I enjoyed the team effort."
good,"The company is heavily guest drive and innovative, doing the most to accomadate the shoppers. However this often comes at the expense of the employees and shortage as Managers will often ignore suspected fraud. Team member work life balance is often a problem due to managers constantly scheduling against team member availability. Management is often inconsistent because at any given time there are between 3-4 different team leads that all ask different things. This results in employees being performances due to not being able to complete all the take assigned from multiple leaders."
good,"A typical day consisted of getting to work to wait on a working PDA and get ready to scan the assigned area for the day. Sometimes we were told that we weren't going to be doing our work, that we would have to help out in another dept. Since instocks also worked the floor, we would also be the only ones on the floor to help out guests, go for a back up to help out cashier. Often there were other managers walking around, seeing that people were doing their job. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing how much merchandise needed to be ordered and knowing that I was responsible for correcting the situation."
good,"It's a normal workplace, some days are boring while other days you have little time to breathe. Very fast paced work environment most of the time. Job security."
good,The managers feel as if you are beneath them and you have no right of an opinion. working for this company for the past years have shown me that i deserve more than what I have been offered.
good,I started at another target and it was amazing but this target in Kalamazoo has horrible management. I've been here for almost a year now and I have wanted to quit since he day I started. The biggest problem for me is I'm religious and have always taken sundays off unless I was needed desperately. This store ignores my availability and schedules me for almost every Sunday even though I have requested them off each week .
good,"There is much to do to move the company forward, and the team is committed to that work. Smart teams with tons of passion = the potential to be great! "
good,"You can always find something to do to keep yourself busy, but can become a bit overwhelming if there is to much to do and very little time. As long as everyone is doing there fair share it doesnt get to bad."
good,"A typical day working at target is just like any typical day at a typical job; you show up, give customer service, two 15 minute breaks, and a 31 minute lunch. However with the added new leadership and the questionable policies they brought with them, there tends to be at least a little drama at target. NOT the best thing to find at work."
good,"A place to get a really good work out, while making some friends in the process.  Also a place to get to be yourself and not be a robot saying ""ok"" all the time"
good,Great if your 18 - 25 and available to work overnight shift while maybe going to school during the day or evenings.  Blue-collar manual labor unloading trucks and sorting packages onto pallets based on label codes.
good,"Management is the worst, don't acknowledge anything you do, very boring, guests are the worst and expect you to know every little detail about the product even if its your first time in that area"
good,Stocking the shelves required you to wake up very early and way before the store closes. It is a quick paced job because you need to get all the supplies the they give you on the shelves before the store opens. It is also very boring but pays better than others.
good,"Within my 90 days , my feelings about this employer fluctuated many of times. The work environment was pretty nice , I will say . But there are a lot of employees at this specific location that have a lot of growing up to do . Leads and managers are messy and drama filled . And WHO TF HAS TIME FOR DRAMA AT WORK ? So I quit 🤷🏾‍♀️☺️"
good,"The other employees were the best part of the job. Some really great people worked there while I was there. The job duties could get a little out of hand, and there wasn't much help if you needed it."
good,"Working over night is for a certain kind of person, as such you will be working with sleep deprived people and people who are often working two jobs. Management is far, and the work is simple but at times demanding."
good,"Great place to work, with the exception of work life balance. As an executive you are required to work 10 hour days. That's 2 free, unpaid hours; 10 free hours a week, 40 hours a month with out compensation for those ours."
good,"With the turnover in executives, the culture has eroded quite a lot.  I've learned quite a lot about the setup of a retail establishment, as well as merchandising."
good,"Target is very challenging as that you are not given the resources necessary to reach your expected outcomes. The positions never get easier, instead you are always given less then the year before."
good,It's a retail job. I worked at returns/exchanges so I dealt with the unhappy customers right off the bat. The part I didn't really like were my managers who wouldn't listen to ideas and suggestions of the employees to make our job easier. Hired and promoted people to positions even though I had seniority and work experience.
good,Target can get very boring at times especially on the floor. Once I turned 18 i was cut off from the company due to being too expensive as a casual with no prior warning.
good,"Potential applicants should be aware that this building is not a conditioned space and temperature will vary depending on the season."
good,"Company was decent.  Job was easy.  Pay was okay for what it is.  I'd work for Target again if given the chance, and I needed the job.  A good place for your 1st job."
good,"the pay was good but the management and hire up employees acted like they were all in high school, like a click. Not very polite or welcoming, Only other good thing was the discounts you can stack upon your own employee discount."
good,"They want you to ring up people fast, get people to sign up for red cards and at the same time convince them to take the online survey. All of this is impossible to do at the same time! Additionally, they get upset when you don't get enough red cards, even though it is out of your control whether or not people want to sign up for them. Newsflash, not everyone wants debit and credit cards, since it's too much of a commitment."
good,"You start off by unloading the truck and making pallets, which they want you to do in under an hour. Then you have to take the pallets to their designated location in the store and stock the store from there. It can be very monotonous. The management is always changing. People get promoted or fired or leave or hired. Every couple of months or so, there is always a change up in management. There are a lot of young people working, which can be fun, but there is a lot of drama. Management always talks about employees behind their backs and everybody has something to say about somebody. With that being said, Target does a very good job at covering their butts and making sure they are organized. The hardest part of the job is trying to finish everything on time, because there are goal times and the leaders expect you to meet them. The most enjoyable part is probably getting paid."
good,Days consist of always something new and challenging to perform.  Build leadership skills and working with a team.  Able to think create different strategies around growing sales.  Work life balance and hours can be draining.  Benefits are pretty good.  Not much to grow and advance with the company.
good,"Very fast pace, upbeat line of work. I worked in two different fields of work so I was paid slightly better than minimum wage. Hated working in the café/Starbucks area. It's basically like working in a fast food kitchen and I personally never want to experience that again. I worked weird hours, either very early or very late which was conflicting w school. But I guess the benefits were the 10% discounts."
good,"I enjoyed my time with the warehouse as it was physically challenging, constantly moving around either carrying boxes pushing boxes, moving pallets, pushing carts. I mean i got some of my best workouts there. Most people i worked with were cool made things a little easier to do the job. Hardest part of the job working around my school schedule, as i had days where i had to get off work early in time for class and sadly it made some people feel slighted because I was being able to do that and they couldnt."
good,"Target's work culture is built around making workers feel appreciated, so that workers feel internally motivated to provide fast, fun & friendly customer service."
good,"very slow on most days the only time it got busy was weekends "
good,Just do your job and you should be ok. come on time and make sure to help guest at all times. Smile and be helpful. Benefits are great and managers are ok.
good,"The Target of today is not the Target I worked at, so a review is not valid for prospective employees.........................................................."
good,"I like the company,  just wish more hours we're available.  They staff is very eager to help and show how to get the job done in a timely manner.  Need more equipment."
good,"I was hired as a cashier. The hours were flexible days,nights and for sure weekends. The pay was decent for retail job. I worked 4 to 8 hour shifts.Breaks and lunches were mostly on schedule. Training was one day on a training register and then I was on my own. Management was nice at first, but then it was all about promoting the Red Card. I hated having to push the ""sales"" pitch on every guest coming through my line whether they already had a card or not. Some of the guests didn't like it much either. The front end supervisors spent a lot of time standing around talking to each other, and had little interaction with the cashiers unless of course they were reminding us that we were not getting enough Red Cards. Procedures were inconsistent which caused issues because I worked for different supervisors throughout the week. If you are looking to gain experience in the area of retail then this job would probably meet your expectations. Just be prepared to promote the ""Red Card"" incessantly on top of your cashier responsibilities."
good,"It was different, you could come to work one day and the next day you may have hours cut without warning and pay raises weren't that great but I guess they did the best they could"
good,"I honestly enjoyed working for Target. They would have provide lunch for us usually about once a month, They were good about helping to resolve scheduling conflicts. I greatly disliked the favoritism. My favorite part of the job was getting to know my""guests"" and ensuring they had the best experience I could provide."
good,Easy job but they are quick to let people go for the simplest reasons. The job itself was not difficult but the expectations were high for a first job.
good,Its a fun environment but not job is never secure.  For those who loves to talk like me is great.  The hardest part of the job was to close at 12:30 am and then come to work the next day at 6:00 am.
good,"As Senior Team Leader I was given the responsibility of a Team Leader and Executive Team Leader. I am pretty sure the responsibilities of this role will vary store to store. My experience was quite rough, due to the role I was performing felt more like how you wo9uld describe an intern's job to be in the early 90s. The team I worked with was very hardworking and some were even dedicated to the target brand. The most enjoyable thing about working there was meeting the many small pieces that actually made that store tick (vendors and team members)."
good,If you lie a competitive long hours type of job then target distribution is for you. Its a 10 to 12 shift and you have to work over time at lest once a week after 36 to 40 hours a week and over time can ten to twelve hours.
good,"I enjoyed my job when I first started, but after a few leadership changes have taken place things weren't fun anymore. The work has stayed about the same but some managers like to voice their opinions about other employees in front of team members rather than in a confidential place. They do not allow overtime and expect you to clock out early if you are close to hitting 40 hours."
good,"I enjoyed learning new skills, such as stock and interacting with the public. Gaining experience selling the ""Red Card"" was valuable experience too. Management was okay and understanding."
good,"My managers are fine, though not strict enough with their lazy employees. Employees take advantage when they're not around to just chit chat instead of work. Then said employees get angry and lash out at the manager/supervisors because they think they deserve more hours. The hardest part is getting a check for 250 bi-weekly, getting told we'll be getting more hours, and then when we get those hours its only during major holidays. A typical day would be clocking in at 4 am, work on the line for an hour, stock for 3 hours, then clock out. Then repeat about 3-4 times a week."
good,"Each worker was treated differently by management. Some workers could take off as many days as they needed while others would get in trouble for needed one night off. It seemed to be based off of race and age. Anytime a manager got chewed out by someone higher up than themselves, they would blame the workers under them instead of taking any responsibility."
good,Unloaded trucks to put merchandise on shelves. learned great teamwork . the culture was good there. things were never the same always changing. hours are always changing so it did make it difficult at times when it came to balance for bills.
good,"Overnight shifts at Target were not easy! Heavy lifting, shifts went from 10 PM-6:30 AM, and they were not very organized when sending merchandise to our store!"
good,Has a high turnover rate. Support from staff was sometimes sufficiant and managemant was not always able to resolve a situation. Not able to advance easily. People with years of experience at Target get overlooked for new staff that has more education. It could be stressful but not very rewarding.
good,Certified to drive different types of machines. Manager tries to switch up where people work so they're not doing the same thing every day.  First starting 90 days  in a truck throwing boxes on the line
good,"Target is a great company, the pay is competitive, and the environment is fast-paced, busy, yet friendly. However, I have found that it is very difficult to acquire adequate hours at Target. If you are looking for a part-time job (less than 20 hours), then this is a great opportunity. If you need more hours, this is not going to be the job for you."
good,"Working at Target is a learning experience.  I have been trained in many areas of the store, being customer service , operator,  cashier, flow and more. Working at target allows you to get the feeling of how people are that comes and attend our services either it be a good one or a bad one,also allows  you to get the flow of how it is on their  busiest time of years."
good,the job itself was not bad either was the company. but the manager kat was very rude and just mean at times. she didn't focus on the actual problem was focused onher own image and nothing else.
good,"Typical day at work consists of me looking for the re-shop bins and putting the items back to their locations in a quick way and efficient way. What i learned from there is how to use a pda, zone aisles, dealing with customers in a retail setting. Hardest part of my job is to zone multiple departments in one day. Most enjoyable part of the job were my fellow team members."
good,"honestly, the management only cares about you as a cashier when you get redcards and sometimes they don't even recognize you for that. The co workers are nice people but management at least at my store is terrible."
good,I enjoy working with others and I hurt my back from lifting the wrong way and the manager didn't care and wanted me to keep working without going to the doctor
good,"Fast baced work environment, flexable work locations,able to transfer easily,always able to learn new jobs and positions,wages are normally slightly above minimum wage"
good,"Wasn't a bad job all around, the people were great and nothing but positivity. Hours were random and sometimes very short shifts were given, as in the legal minimum, but the job was generally easy."
good,Do Not have enough hours availableto staff Rphs to be full time. But has beena great environment through the years to work. Would recommend if you dont need to be full time
good,"Work was predictable but fine most of the time."
good,I started working with Target after I graduated college as a seasonal cashier. I then moved on to flow team for about year. After that I moved into AP as a TPS and then an APTL. I think with Target it's very important to have a good mentor or someone in your corner that wants to help you to grow and develop in the company.
good,Well let me start at the fact that they pay their employees fair. they will continue to give you praise as long as you work your job to the best of your abilities.
good,"Target is like any other retailer. They do try to make things fun from time to time, but that doesn't change the fact that they'll expect you to pull off miracles with scraps."
good,The team can be great but its not enough money for the amount of work and at the rate they want... they push and push but give you no means of reaching their goals....
good,"A typical day at work is getting and keeping the front end of the store tidy and ready for Great Guest Service. Each checkstand has to be stocked with receipt tape, Debit/Credit Card Pamphlets, basic warranty information, spray cleaner & paper towels, plastic bags, and some stickers of Target Dog to give out to kids. A cashier provides fast, fun, & friendly service in checking out merchandise. I also dealt with returns, exchanges, & defectives at Guest Services. Both positions involve dealing with guest concerns in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the public; helping them out day-to-day. The hardest part of the job is getting carts from outside when it is a blowing winter blizzard. I was very pleased in learning to work at Guest Service. Management and/or fellow team members were there to help and encourage me when dealing with guest concerns."
good,Spent 1.5 years with Canadian version. Logistics manager for retail location. 12 to 14 hours most days. To little staff to complete daily needs of store. Great wages
good,"Cashier position, upselling, fast paced environment. I worked as a cashier for about two months and then I was transferred to the returns desk. Tough crowd over there at the returns desk but as long as you learn to ask the right questions and have your answers spoken in a way that does not insult the customer it can be a nice change of pace from being a cashier."
good,Target has decent shift options. Overtime!  The pay rate per hour is very fair. Work isn't hard. The hardest dept. Would probably be inbound; your unloading a full tractor trailer truck.
good,Too much favoritism  and upper bosses are lazy. Need more work hours to provide for family. Hr does a bad job with employees coaching standards and people get fired for nothing
good,"The Target at Blue Springs Missouri was a real fun place to work beforehand. I am coming up to finishing my third year at Target and in the last 6 months the management in our Human Resources and Sales Floor team leader has changed. The change in the management has made many of the team members become demotivated and leave as where before most of us were happy to be there."
good,"The Pay was average in comparison to similar employers, but the managers were terrible and the hours weren't consistent. With good pay and poor hours the money isn't  enough in total."
good,"A typical day at work changed from when I started to when I left."
good,Target employees suck. They're stuck up all the time and complain when you ask for time off. I was only a seasonal worker but I didn't like it at all.
good,When working there a typical day is eitger chaos or extremely slow within less things to do because when it's really busy there are more things to do with just as many people as the slow days so most likely those things won't get done.
good,"I worked almost all aspects of this job form the garden center to scanning empty product to working backroom, making sure to zone and order product properly for the needs of the store."
good,i like my job and i like my co workers but the hours suck and the management isn't that good. i wish it was better hours and better management.
good,"Target offers training that is above par and it helps in directing your career path. They are all about development, which aids in your skills tremendously."
good,"Overall this was a good experience.  The team members were more than capable to do the job since the pay was higher than most manual labor jobs.  Management was turned three times in three years, so there was little stability."
good,"They didn't provide much training, and the pay was lousy. Most employees I worked with had negative attitudes, probably because they are paid very little."
good,"The best part of working at Target are the people you work along side. They are always very helpful, and it's like a small community with an inside joke. The worst part is the pay."
good,The people were nice but the actual tasks were mind numbing. Sometimes managers would over dramatize events for good and bad. The little meeting were a nice way to figure out what the rest of the store was up to.
good,This place gave me the chance to work in all departments to get my full time hours. I became more open to work in a lot of diferente places in the store in order to get my full time and was never denied to be cross trained . Every day u would meet with the managers and talk about the goal of the day and the sale goals that we would have
good,"I enjoyed my time, though i felt my training was rushed. Here i learned to deal with a variety of different cultured costumers. Also learned to be a cahsier which i found is a great skill to attain."
good,"I applied at Target when they were hiring for seasonal. It was a great way to earn extra money during my brief time there. I really wanted to stay after, but they let go almost every seasonal person due to payroll cuts or whatever. Now I have to find another job."
good,"i worked for a great teamleads they where great they made our work days fun but when they it was not fun place to work in , the managment where very agrasive."
good,Seasonal job that is loading shelves enjoy shopping there store was busy and people were nice good starting place in a retail job need to flexible during holidays
good,"Opportunity to learn various departments and pretty flexible hours which helps with school. It's also great to meet people, considering a lot of people of all ages work there."
good,Target is a good place to work. You get a 10% team member discount. You will be working with other team members who will be there for you when you need help.
good,"Great for a second job; not great for stability. Workload to compensation is very skewed. Cross-training is lacking, so published breaks can't be taken for certain assignments."
good,"It's what would one may expect from any large retail chain. Many people work in many different areas of the store, and often you are moved around from department to department trying to finish all of your given tasks. However, the team members are all generally friendly and easy to talk to, and the stores policy on how to treat guests is one to be commended, though it may be slightly harder to build lasting relationships with coworkers simply due to the amount of employees there are. overall, it was a good experience."
good,"A typical work day at work would be to get there and first restock the items the customers did not want, what I learned from Target is communication and speed the management would be bit crazy when it comes to the holidays. As for co-works depends on again communication and team work because without those two the work place would not go well. the hardest part working at Target was having to continue to work on particular days like Sundays when you prefer to have those days off and as well as dealing with some unsatisfying customers. But the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people whether its customer from different places or new co-workers."
good,I loved and hated working at Target. I loved the variety and being on my feet moving around the store while helping customers. I worked the fitting room & answered phones but also helped on the sales floor and I loved zoning.  I hated the fact that they employed a lot of high school kids who would take advantage and call in sick all of the time leaving management to call me to fill in. Most of the time I was working 38-40 hours a week as part time associate. The training was good and you worked along side team members when learning something new. Management was a constant turnover.
good,"You will meet great new people from customers to employees who socialize in and out of work. Work itself is not hard, but tediously time consuming."
good,It started as a fun work enviroment which provide me with my first work experience during my senior year of high school. Unfortunately after the store remodeling process began my hours were cut and i could barely afford transporation.They taught me skill such as how to be quick and efficent.
good,"It was enjoyable at first, but towards the the management became less and less communicative. I would recommend this job to someone who's trying to get through school but not a career path."
good,I didn't really like working here even though it was a real easy job. They would make me and others bring carts even if it was raining without providing proper rain gear
good,"great customer service, lovable co workers, great management staff, flexible hours, great team work among team members, overall a great place to interact with new and interesting people"
good,I learned lots of organization skills and since this was my first and only job it was a great experience as a professional employee.
good,I enjoyed working i do believe i should have been hired permanently. I was a very hard outgoing worker and was on time everyday. I also worked overtime and came in early.
good,The jobs are simple and straightforward. Most of the time at my particular store is spent cleaning up after other teams or doing small projects put to us by management that distract from our main duties. The management is better at making excuses for shortcomings than they are at making changes to help the store.
good,"I had worked for this company for 3+ years. Several times I applied for the manger position. All of the bosses would agree that I was overly qualified for the position, but the position was always given to someone who was more ""popular"". The store I worked at was very much like being back in high school. It was all just a popularity contest with everyone running in their own little cliques."
good,I've worked at two different locations and both stores had terrible HRs. Which in my opinion is a key part of any retail store. There never very friendly or good at communication.
good,Been working there for a little more than 2 years. If you're looking for a job to get quickly and only to work for a year or two I guess it's okay. Let's just say there's a reason I'm looking for another job. But my first year and a half were pretty great I'm not going to lie about that.
good,"Typically shifts start with a rundown of a dozen things you need done in a matter of minutes, followed by being assaulted and yelled at by the ""guests"", and typically you finish a shift by being ""coached"" for not finishing an unreasonable amount of work in a short few hours. I worked here while trying to finish my bachelor's degree, our management asked me to work on days I had requested off months before for important reviews and even my own graduation. I was constantly punished for not being available to work everyday due to school, but when I originally interviewed I was promised a benefit of having a flexible schedule for school. My co-workers were supportive and a main benefit of staying but the managment is what pushed me away. The money was decent, on the weeks they gave me enough hours to live off of. Overall I would never return to such a hostile and tough work environment."
good,"A typical day consists of pushing products to the sales-floor, making sure every customer leaves the store satisfied, and to keep the sales-floor clean so customers can walk through safely. Hours vary. Management can vary on different managers. The hardest part of the job is leaving at 11 or 12 at night. The most enjoyable part of the job is working in the morning."
good,They preach it but STLs do not care how many hours you work. There have been plenty of times that the current STL has forced his LOG to stay and work 16 hours on top of knowing the guy lives an hour away from the store.
good,"Good starting job, easy to make your own schedule, easy to move up. However, LODs are not as helpful as they should. It is a safe place to work at."
good,"Target is a pretty good company,their management team are very smart,they train you really good,The only issue I had is they don't give you a lot of hours"
good,management was horrible. It seem like it was hard to get on the same page with other managers and employee's. I enjoyed working their. I just did my work and went home.
good,"Target overall is a good company, middle management is overworked to compensate for higher up's laziness. Pay doesn't match the actual hours expected to work, once you are salary prepare to be taken advantage of. "
good,Guest services and cashier. I helped customers find the things that they were looking for and needed. Ilearned how to work a cash register and manage money to make sure that my draw was never short.
good,Great place to get your feet wet in the job market. Although it is fast paced and they ask more of you than you would expect. Finding a balance between speed and quality can be difficult.
good,"Working for Target came a couple of years after my husband died. The employees and customers were so kind and easy to get along with. I still have close friends to this day with some. "
good,Great company just lack of good leadership.  There is no advancement for leadership because they hire from outside the company.  I think this is one of the reasons for the poor leadership.
good,"If you are a person with strong determination you can possibly advance in the company. Hours may constantly change, and may be hard to come by during slow seasons."
good,I have worked at Target for over a year now and wihile I enjoy working there it has its problems. Management there is not that great. A lot people come and go as managers and doesn't seem to be in place. The benefits are alright you get a 10% discount but can only use it if you use cash or a red card which is 5% so you get 15%. While there are problems it's not a bad place to work.
good,Used to be a great place for career advancement. Company is still finding its way. Most beneficial aspect of work are the smart peers and leaders you get to work with.
good,"The job itself is not complicated. There is just no communication within the store, between stores, or between upper management and store management and it causes a lot of problems."
good,its a good place to work nice people come in the store all the time the co-workers are nice as well the environment is very safe to work in as well
good,"The job required me to work and do the tasks of up to 4 diffferent positions, leaving me little to no time to get done what i need to, after the continuous running around I would have to do, however I was never promoted or switched to any of them, and the pay was barely enough for the one position I was actually assigned to.  The only truly positive thing about working there was the nice coworkers and the matched 401k and benefits."
good,"Target is a very productive place.  Its not so busy in the morning but gets really busy towards noon, making it complicated to get your brake on time. Management is alright; complaints aren't always dealt with although i think they should be a priority. My co workers are fun and very friendly. Supervisors can be really friendly also, but get picky about quite a few  things. The store manager is great though, but again complaints about work dont always get dealt with. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the angry guests. They wont always take no for an answer. The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing you can help guests with their inquiries."
good,"It's not the best job, but it's doable. Management was okay, but you get those few that shouldn't be in management. For the most part it's descent."
good,Upper management needs to be a little more hands on in the store. Scheduling was not perfect. Not enough employees on the schedule to work during holidays.
good,"The job itself isn't that bad. It's the management and the red cards that make it such a pain. If you don't get red cards for them,  you're pretty much useless. And the people over you sure treat you like it. Any other time you're just a cog in the machine."
good,Working in as an hourly employee at the corporate offices definitely makes you feel different than the salaried. The hourly employees are not invited to attend the quarterly meetings that Target hosts that everyone always speaks about. There's quite a bit of micro-management and a lack of trust. Merchandising and sourcing teams have a lot of turnover.
good,"I got hired in as seasonal then later got hired as a permanent hire. I was immediately tossed onto blackline my first day with little help. I got used to it and ended up just always working on blackline. Some of my coworkers were nice, others were not. I was harassed by two of my coworkers and I told both of my managers several times and neither of them did anything about it. This is where I started to dislike the job. The managers also played favorites with certain coworkers."
good,I learned how to give friendly costumer experiences. Treating them kindly even in stressful situations. I learned to work with people as a team even with difficult situations.
good,"Working cart attendant get ready for a lot of workers calling out so you are left in the hot sun all day, when you need help they would send some people out to help but they didn't help as much."
good,"a typical day being on sales floor consists or cleaning the sales floor, removing damaged goods and foods, helping guests, and being asked to do backup cashier. Some co-workers will be hard to find at times, and some are constantly cleaning and not helping guests. must have a plan while working in a large group. Hardest part is closing and placing back items that came from guest service, can delay the time of finishing your shift."
good,It is hard to do your job when you don't have enough workers or you pulled to do others people job. They rather work the hard working people than the lazy ones.
good,"It's Target, so not exactly ideal.  I liked the people I worked with, but the management was a little unpredictable.  Felt like I had no opportunity to advance and hours were unpredictable."
good,Job didn't pay enough and required you to be there too early. Only three days a week when I did it so not many hours of pay nor enough pay per hour.
good,"target is literally one of my favorite stores so when i got the job opportunity i was thrilled. The team members i worked with were very nice and friendly and it seemed like this was going to be a great experience up until a couple months ago when i started to realize that the retail world is full of lazy and drama filled people. the management treats the workers as if they are slaves and demand things that they can handle on their own, Also when problems are brought to hr confidentially they are shared amongst other people within the building which is pretty crazy because if you don't even feel comfortable going to hr then thats a problem within itself. The raises are a pretty good amount when they come around but it makes you wonder if its worth it when the management isn't up to par."
good,"I feel that the site I work at is poorly managed, poorly staffed for daily business, team members are frequently low in morale, the front end is unhealthy as far as cleanliness is concerned and overall is just a total chaotic mess"
good,"Fun workplace, excellent interviewing process - as a result co-workers very friendly and willing, comfortable environment."
good,"Management=horrible and I've worked at more than one target. co-workers were nice some not so much. I believe the guest that cam in were nicer and more understanding than our management. Hardest part was being able to tell your supervisor ""no, sorry I can't stay longer"" or ""no, I can't work another day"" they make you feel bad and pressure you into taking more shifts than you need. I did not like closing at 11:30pm and then coming back the next day at 6am. it seemed unfair and not even legal, I didn't get enough sleep"
good,"Unloading trucks and stocking shelves. Learned to work well with co-workers and subordinates. Hardest part was losing team members, and most enjoyable was welcoming new ones."
good,"Work- life balance is a challenge in retail. Promotions are very politically driven, and each work environment is different based on which market you work in. pay and benefits are great but you have to often make a decision between career and family. Most people are great and want to do a good job for the company and each other."
good,"My typical work day comprises of being flexible in what task will be assigned to me. Yes, Logistics/backroom are a main part of it but also being able to work in other areas after or instead of are now a major part of my day to day work. I have learned to become fluid and give my all in each position that I'm assigned to so that I can in turn be of better use to the company. Management such as my team leader grants me the freedom to do my work knowing that I will complete what needs to be done in my workstation. Although upper Management is another story, not to be harsh in my description but they could stand to communicate more among themselves and focus on realistic goals for the day. The hardest part of my job is seeing my team scattered and used to fix the holes as I put it, in where management has failed to repair permanently. Simply put, hold the right people accountable for their own work and stop excusing poor work ethic. In the end though, I have to say the most enjoyable are the people that make up my fellow Target team members. They are truly what makes Target a place worth working for, I'm very grateful to know them both professionally and personally."
good,"Hard working company , work culture is great with the diversity ,"
good,"It was okay! Not what I expected. The work environment was good!!! Chances of advancing not so good. We had to meet a sales quota for red cards each day. I enjoyed working with my team! Great people. I learned how to push sales, the worst part was scheduling. If you put requests in for important events, they were never granted."
good,I usually felt everyone around me was not working. The managers are very subpar. It also seems like no one there cares about our needs.
good,Hours were never guaranteed and you could never move up. If your hired part time it is almost impossible to get moved to full time
good,I didn't enjoy working for Target. It was pretty painful doing the set-ups for their store on top of being on our knees for too long.
good,"target is a big fortune 500 company which means stability"
good,"Most of the job is cleaning, making food, and running the register with the occasional extraneous task every few days such as making freezer runs.  Advancement is possible, but benefits are mediocre."
good,"Working within the stores is an okay part time job, but there are not many opportunities for advancements in store, making only minimum wage is terrible and i have been harassed on several occasions by coworkers."
good,"management was good, they work with your hours. "
good,"target is a good place to work, friendly atmosphere, and a safe place to work. i also enjoyed to train and travel to other dc's to train."
good,Always being greeted by team members and building relationships while gaining memorable professional experience. Given responsibilities to guide other team members to success. Biggest challenge was time management with large amounts of stock. Most enjoyable was creating life lasting friendships.
good,"I enjoyed my first few years a Target.  Managers came and went and with each new one you had to figure out their rules.  The flexible scheduling that they claim to have is only flexible to them, they don't want to be flexible with you.  If you change your availability, they retaliate and don't give you hours."
good,"Predictable job, more of a routine every shift. Lunch and break times are very organized. Management however isn't very flexible with your schedule. Opportunity to move up within the company, but not extremely far. Great job if you're in high school, college, or fresh out of high school! Coworkers become your friends very easily."
good,Overall this place is a great place to work seasonally or temporarily. The staff are nice and are dedicated to hiring hard workers who can handle multi tasking if needed.
good,"Target was a great place to work before the data breach and the failed attempt to enter Canada. After these failures, sales and payroll was all that mattered. Culture was completely lost at this point."
good,"Target is not for the person who wants too advance in the work place. The management has no training program for team members that are qualified to advance in the company. I am a Inventory manager and a Trainer. The way that Target is set up, they do not promote advancement. I am looking for other oppurtiunities."
good,"arrive at work do your job"
good,I loved the people I worked with. They did tend to hire management that refused to help do what the team members do. I dont think I ever saw my management team hop on a register or help print a picture. They would just tell guests to wait and go find a team member to help the guest.
good,Target is a cool job for those starting out but with low wages and hours..it is not good for those trying to move on to careers.
good,"nice place to work however there is to much pressure on the cashiers to push the red card. scheduling is a roll of the dice shoot, you can be working mornings one day and nights the next."
good,"They are always checking up on everything that you do. They mostly will hire you as a part-time worker so that you wont get vacation nor sick hours. As TPS , you are put through stressful situations. They oay that you get from TPS is not worth the work that you put in. However, every target security team is different. Some targets require there security to be at the doors most of the time which is great for the money that you will get. If you're store has an APS get ready to be micro-managed. If your store only has an ETL then being a TPS is more fun since you decide how to approach theft trends."
good,I have enjoyed much of my time while working at Target. My direct team leaders are great but upper management not so much.  Some of the executive team leads are unethical but some are still good.
good,A typical work day would be getting assigned to a different section each night that I had zero interest in and just walking up and down the aisles to make sure that everything was pulled out on the shelf as far as it could be.  The only other part of the job was helping people find things.  In the interview I was told I got the electronics job.  I only worked in electronics for half of a day.
good,"Provided you have a minimum level of competency Target (retail) will never fire you. The coworkers were the friendlies I've ever worked with and if it wasn't for the low pay and abysmal hours I would gladly work with them again. Management is generally fair but doesn't care about your advancement, they have jobs to fill and do. They will keep you in the same position for 6 years with no chance of advancement to keep a less desirable position filled. The best part of the job was the friendly atmosphere form my coworkers, the worst part was when the bathrooms became especially dirty."
good,"For the 90 days of working there, you work long shifts, get two 15 minute breaks, a lunch, and then back to work. The Red Card applications are like the holy grail at Target. They base your performance on how many Red Cards you get each hour. You get flagged if you aren't fast enough at check out."
good,Great place to start at when looking for a job. Work among your peers. Everybody that works here is around the same age so it was great to make new friends and build a network.
good,my coworkers are great people to work with. they are hard working and proud of the work they do. The hardest part of this job is the lack of passion for the job.
good,"The environment and those you work with are amazing people, the pay is $9 + commission. There is always encouragement to do better and make sales goals. Everyone works together"
good,"A typical day at target overnight is a lot of heavy lifting and big excpectations. I learned a lot at target how to stock, back stock, store plano gram. The management at target at times is questionable. Some times they seem to know what there doing and others they seem lost. The co-workers at target all seem to get along fine. Theres a good vibe between team members. The hardest part of the job is the managents expectations. The harder someone works the more they seem to excpect and yet the hard workers still get paid the same as day 1 people."
good,Target started out as a Summer job when home from college and it turned into a lot more. I worked with some great people and grew to love my coworkers. One of the biggest problems I always had at my store was the consistent turnover of our management teams. I was able to cross train and build my knowledge of the store backwards and forward.
good,"The workplace was always busy and productive so there would always be something to do. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the relationships I made with customers and other co-workers, management included. Some of the managers were friendly and there were also, of course, managers with whom I had a hard time with."
good,"•	Receive merchandise in busy retail outlet."
good,I loved working at target because the hours were great and there was always a shift to pick up when needed. Everyone was nice but at times it felt more a high school environment more then a work place. Management was a little too friendly like they were more interested in being everyones friend and knowing everyones personal business rather then running the store at times but they were nice. Co-workers were like so up and down some were like crazy immature and others were like amazing friends. The hardest part was dealing with the slack from certain co-worker (especially during the crowded hours). The most enjoyable part was going to help out in electronics.
good,"Overall job is ok. It could be better when it comes to treatment of the team members, I have no other complaints. I just need a better job."
good,"I worked as a flow associate.  I'd show up at 4am in the morning, help unload the daily merchandise truck, and divide the goods between what was on overstock item, and what would go directly to the sales floor.  If you don't have a college degree of some sort, advancement within this company is limited."
good,"Executive Team Leaders (i.e. Middle Management/Salary):"
good,"Typical day at work is reviewing planogram to identify changes needed to particular isle or area I will be setting in.  Removing old product, moving shelves, cleaning, and setting new according to plans.  Helping guests and answering back up calls to front registers.  Team members are energetic, fun, and hard working.  Hardest part of my job is having equipment needed to complete planogram.  Most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the finished results."
good,"Have a team meeting,  unload and scan the items that come over the truck,stock the floors if needed, do backroom-organizing the products"
good,"You come in and sign out your equipment (PDA). Do an audit/inventory of wherever the PDA sends you. You then pull merchandise from the backroom and send it to the floor for other team members to stock the shelves. Somedays you have to stock the shelves yourself. Then you stock extra merchandise which could not fit on the floor back in the backroom for the rest of the day. Throughout the day you pull batches and fulfill online orders as well. The co-workers are good to work with, including some management. Can't say the same for most of the new management. Hardest part of the job is backstocking all the full case packs that come back from the floor/truck. Most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers. I learned how to work in a stressful environment and how to prioritize my tasks properly according to their standfards."
good,A typical day at work is that I would clock in go to my station welcome the guests with respect. Ask the me how there day was and bag there items carefully ask them if they would like to save on 2%. What I have learned here is that to manage my time. My workers were friendly. The hardest part o the job is when I got hurt picking up with my back and they still wanted me to work but I couldn't due to doctors orders. Th most enjoyable part of the job was making the guests happy and putting a smile on there face.A typical day at work is that I would clock in go to my station welcome the guests with respect.

good,everyone is great to get along with. i love working with staff and helping the customers. the management staff is normal to work with they do set to high of standards for employees.
good,Stock and help customers with their cares and concerns. I also worked in the backroom keeping up with the stores inventory.
good,"Other cashiers and team members were very friendly. Hours were low, and so is the pay. Customers, like in any retail job, were difficult."
good,"Management has no clue what they're doing half the time. If you ask management to help you with a guest they never show up and just ask you to reach them over the walkie, which is very frustrating for both the rep and the guest. They expect high expectations but they do not properly train you."
good,"too much work place politics, management play favorites. little to no room for personal advancement with the company. usual retail job"
good,"I worked at target Portland OR, in the backroom. A typical day is full steam all day long, pulling items tru different stockrooms  to fill up the floor on hourly waves. The job should be straight forward and simple but lack of leadership, organization and proper training makes the job very annoying. You  have your list of tasks that fill up your time completely, but you are constantly interrupted by calls from the front and to do other things outside of your duties, as well as have to go trough obstacles, literally..in order to get to one item sometimes you have to move several pallets away, their stockroom is not well organized, all this takes extra time and you are expected to finish all your tasks hour by hour, the time frames with the current staff are unrealistic."
good,"i was asked to stay temporarily for the holidays but once something changed i was kept part time. didnt give me much hours but they wanted me to do so much, not much training i had to ask for it. Never again, dont miss it."
good,great place for a teen. the money is low opportunity is slim.  work hours are all over the place. if you have a family forget it.
good,"I enjoyed my time in the backroom a strong group of individuals striving for the same goal, on the other hand dislike the change to the front the animosity between the other cashier were high"
good,"As far as team building, Target as a company really tries to build morale and have fun and etc. They have a lot of team oriented things like games outings and at work treats. Butttttttttt Every year the company downsizes positions its not fun. There are a lot of unfair managers depending on what store youre in. There is little work life balance as a manager. Target caps a lot of peoples pay and I hate that I wasnt there long before I was capped. Target as a company needs to be more family oriented for the employees like 12am and 1am are ridiculous times to be open, especially on a Sunday. they only care about sales sales sales money money money smh"
good,Work most weekends including Sundays. Does not accept days off requests 80% of time. Poor management. Managers show favors towards other people they know prior to working there.
good,"Target had great benefits, but a horrible work-life balance.  We may have been retail oriented, but working in the distribution center should have plotted us some holidays off - but this wasn't the case."
good,It was a so so job .It was a good opportunity to work for a big company but Working hours were not enough to meet my goal.But no complaints
good,This is a place where  there are always opportunities to take advantage of. Including getting the job done and moving up in the workplace.
good,"I have worked for Target for more than 2 years as a logistics team member. This job has become depressing! Every time i walk into the store i ask myself why do i wake up for this s***. Every day is the same. We unload the truck, stock a bunch of s*** and then stock some more. Oh and did i mention this all happens within a four hour period? So basically we run around like chickens without a head while our ""Team Lead"" is busy doing ""administrative work"". Yes, this job does offer a lot of flexibility and is perfect for a student but they really take advantage of you here. Sorry Target but I hate you."
good,"I didn't have a set schedule and work a full 40 hours per week. At times, the work was too much to handle. Overall, target is a great company."
good,"My co-workers were the best part of this job. Everyone was extremely helpful and nice, it was a family type of atmosphere. However, the management was lacking and needed to be revamped. The job itself isn't hard, but it's very stressful especially during holiday season. You have to work as fast as possible to get the job done as well as doing other people's jobs sometimes. It is a very hard- working job with some unrealistic expectations. They tell you it is a full-time job, but they won't let you get over 40 hours a week."
good,"this is a great work place with great management this store is about TEAM they teach you how to work as one.. "
good,working for target as gstl was a demanding. pay certainly not equal to work load. management fair. co-workers fun to work with. can not be promoted higher without college degree. target missing out on a lot of good managers.
good,"Good place to work for a few months, and learn some appreciable skills like patience, organization and reasoning. Worked with a lot of great people who made long shifts easy."
good,"I was hired to work at the Starbucks, and I did, and did it well. However I also worked many many other positions - cashier, pizza hut express, softlines, just to name a few. Sometimes I didn't have a choice I would just be called randomly while at Starbucks, and sometimes they scheduled me not at Starbucks but somewhere else - I didn't like that but did it because I wanted to get paid, and because I would have probably been fired if I said no."
good,"Exciting and upbeat work place. The management has grown so much since I first started, but still needs improvement. The company big as it is it wasn't all about numbers, but to personally grow and develop as a person. The most delightful part of my job is helping the guest in person and over the phone. Each day was always something different, ranging from operating phones and assisting  guest to time sensitive projects that were challenging but met."
good,"The team members are productive, we take guest services seriously even when the guest give us a hard time. The hardest part was dissatisfying the guest after having done all you could to help. A cashier's day starts and ends at the register, we do not do anything else but ring and bag."
good,The management is the worst part of the job. Most enjoyable is vibing with the guest. I've learned patience at this job and how to solve problems trying every advantage possible.
good,Fun work place for a sixteen year old. No benefits! Can't move up with this company. Work hard with very little recognition.
good,Great team work. Learned leadership and corporate workings. Employee empowerment and goals reached daily. Hard to move up with other stores closing and moving management to small amount of opening.
good,"has all the pros and cons of any other retail job , bad hours , incompetent managers and a whole lot of nothing salary is a little better than major competitors"
good,Target is a great place to work. I believe in our new CEO and the leadership team currently in place. I believe in the direction the company is headed.
good,I have been at target for about 3 months and I cant wait to find a full time job somewhere. You are often treated poorly by the guests and your hard work will be overlooked by managers but they will notice if you dont do something exactly right. Starts out fun and interesting and exciting but quickly turns into something you dont want to be doing for more that 20 hours a week. Schedules are inconsistent and people are unwilling to trade hours.
good,C'ètait vraiment formidable de pouvoir appris dans cette Entreprise.
good,"typical day will include a high volume of guest coming in and out of store with questions and request which you will need a lot of patience , Management at target varies depending on your department and leader on duty which I think is the hardest part of working at target , not having the support you need in such a high pace environment but you can always count on the support you get from your coworkers, you count on each other to work out problems. Its all about team work!!!"
good,"I enjoyed the people that I worked closely with, but did not appreciate the management. The pay was great, but didn't care for the job itself and the disorganization that made it more difficult than need be."
good,"I really enjoyed Target as a whole. The people were great and they were flexible with my schedule around school. It's a great first job, but there is not much room for advancement."
good,"This environment is full of stress because unqualified management, unmotivated workers and a lack of organization hat is not very conducive for growth. They can be good at providing for you when you work on holidays but aren't very considerate of your personal availability. I do not recommend you working here."
good,"Good employer, shift are able to change, and guest are greatly appreciated. I learned how to operate the service desk and complied to guest needs."
good,Little opportunity for advancement to achieve more hours and pay. However the atmosphere at this store is comfortable to work with.
good,The employees are nice and helpful. Management are pretty decent. The hardest part of the job was dealing with horrible customers. Management show appreciation to their employees at times.
good,"Management should make the instructions much clearer,  instead of getting penalized for following their wrong directions."
good,"Extremely dependent on the culture, if not extroverted extremely hard to advance. Your experience is largely based on your supervisor, good or bad."
good,Simple rules and regulations but the culture of the store is alittle overbearing and the compenstation sometimes did not always meet up with what was required. Diligent people who cared about the job and customers not so much about their workers
good,"A typical day at Target featured stocking items on shelves, and helping guest with their request. I learned that the customer/guest comes first, no matter the type of request it is. I also learned that I am very patient with people, had to be, and that helping others just made me feel good. Management on the other hand was dicey. My coworkers and I felt like there wasn't any sense of direction, and we were on our own most of the time. The hardest part of the job is when multiple guest ask sales associates for help, and that associate is busy helping guest by him/herself. However, the best part about the job is when guests leave the store satisfied because, associates helped them."
good,This job was probably the hardest job I have had yet. You have to be very dedicated and very fast when you are doing your assignments. A lot of pressure was on me to complete my tasks correctly.
good,"I had to really multitask at Target. Working at guest service I had to deal with returns, checking out guest, price match, online pick up, answer the phone. I was usaully the only one that worked at the service desk so it would get very overwhelming at times. I did have co workers to help with back up if I had a guest the had a returm or an issue that took time doing. I felt that the managers could have been a little more helpful. Overall my co workers were very nice and we all got along great!"
good,"Little to no room for advancement, weird hours, but you are secure in having your job. A degree can get someone who knows nothing about this job a position managing you."
good,This was my very first job out of high school. At first I didn't mind it but then I got a new boss and she for some reason liked to pick on me and it made my job really hard.
good,team leads are terrible there but not all of them. loved my co-workers. Discount was not too bad. The hours there was really not good.
good,"Assisting customers on sales floor stocking shelves back up cashier when needed management very friendly when needed co workers nice hardest part of job when running in to a problem, most enjoyable part is working with customers"
good,"The most enjoyable part about my job was engaging with the customers and building relationships with them. I learned how to keep the guest entertained and happy as they waited in line when I got busy.The hardest part of my job was the miscommunication between our district manager and our department managers in what was expected of us. I enjoyed my co-workers high energy, positive attitudes during work and my job."
good,"Everyday you come into work around lunch time, you check the inventory and see if any phones came in. If any phones came in you would scan them and log them into them into the system so they would be apart of the inventory. After you would do that you would check and make sure everything around the cell phone department is in correct placement and if not do so. While doing small task you would also greet guest and help as much as possible. At the end of the day before you clock out of work you would make sure everything is in the correct placement, dust, clean, wipe the phones of finger prints, check the inventory, and make sure all the paper work is done and collected."
good,"we started of at the assembly line to collect all of the boxes. after we go about our day stocking shelves.When it became busy I would go and assist the cashiers. The hardest part of the job was waking up at 3 AM, as far as the most enjoyable part I would have to say the employees there made the job that much better."
good,Target is a great place to work. I have learned so much about working with a team and building lasting relationship I have also grown as a manager. The hardest part of the job is working weekends and closing shifts
good,"Target is a great company and a very much loved brand but Target Technology has some miles to go when it comes to defining vision and handling talent. "
good,"target has very strict rules, which is easy to follow, but DO NOT mess up in anyway or you will be asked to leave immediately. This company has extremely high turn over rate."
good,its just a job !! It was fun in the beginning but if don't kiss butt or if you complain you get your hrs cut . Some of the people that work there are really fun and nice and seem to care about you but then their are others who are just on a power trip like I'm a team leader respect me lol yea right do something to get respect instead of walking around the registars in a circle acting like your working.
good,"Hard work, tough on the back.  Hours a are varied. For me, retail is not the job for me  Don't like stocking and unloading. The job was never the same everyday, that I liked."
good,"Target has a good work culture and work life balance is also great."
good,"•	Guided customers through the store credit cards application"
good,its a fast paced job picking items and putting them in there right places in a quick amount of time. The managers are very helpful and are always around when you need help. You get to meet a lot of people. The hardest part of the job is picking around 250 items in one hour. Its nice that you get to move around a lot.
good,A typical day at work is staying ahead of potential problems and giving the customer a clean place to shop with all products in an easy place to locate. learned speed is an important part of retail stores. management and co-workers have the same desires as yourself. hardest part of the job was keeping with duties while putting out fires. most enjoyable part of the job was getting the day done in Targets ways and outlines.
good,Understandably customers are the most important part to any retail operation but not at the expense of actually abusing your employees to where they hate coming to work
good,"Experience will vary between small and large stores, as corporate involvement tends to be less prevalent in smaller stores. Expect a typical retail environment either way, fast-paced with a large workload and the occasional angry customer to help. If you enjoy working with people and have a bit of a thick skin, it can be fairly satisfying. You can build a good reputation for yourself by being willing to train in other positions; however this makes you more valuable as a team member, so it may also damper your chances of promotion. Most of the work is not difficult, but good time management skills are imperative to success."
good,"A typical day would include pushing items to the floor while helping guests find the items they need. Target is stressful for the reason that they give you tasks that you MUST finish and they will keep on you until it is finished, only to give you more tasks to get done (which sometimes have nothing to do with the work center you are working in.) The managers like to push ""guest service"" but get upset if you don't finish your task because you were helping a guest find something that they needed. I am a very fast and efficient worker but if I am helping guests find items that they need, its hard to get it done as fast as they would like. I have learned how to manage time better in order to get my tasks done within a shift. The management and coworkers are very friendly but also cliquey. When it comes to guests, most seem to be very friendly and helpful. The hardest part is being able to finish tasks fast enough for the managers liking while also helping guests. The most enjoyable part is getting to help people find items that they need along with stuff to go along with it, because you have made a personal connection and know what they might also want to go along with what they came for."
good,"My coworkers were not friendly. "
good,i loved working for target its a great store the item sold in target are a decent price. My experience there was awesome i have no complaints the only reason why i left was because i was going back to school.
good,"Overall Target is a good place to work, just really bad pay and growth opportunity. Culture is good though, coworkers really  look out for eachother. Management; however needs to be more genuine and look out for its employees."
good,"Target is a fast paced and ever changing work environment filled with a lot of great people at store level which is the key to Target's success. Management changes often, unfortunately the good ones move though to quickly. There is some room for improvement but can be difficult. The most rewarding part of the job was the great relationships I found and developed with my co-workers. Everyone would work together to help one another out and becomes a second family."
good,"Diverse work load with structured and unstructured data sets."
good,"Lot of work but little appreciation, Management doesn't seem to care about employees, Co-workers were fun to work with, low compensation for the amount of work done"
good,"Ensuring guests were checked out quickly."
good,Management is highly disorganized and play favorites. There is no real mobility opportunities. My metrics are always in the top 5 and yet there is nothing to show for it. There isn't any sense of being on a team. There is no career molding. I volunteered for various departments to learn and grow within the company but there is no one guiding employee advancement.
good,"stock and restocking items"
good,"planification des taches ,reconnaissance des membres planification des inventaires,les horaires des employes  faire des planogrammes l'habillage des manequins"
good,While working at Target it was a very fast paced environment. I met a lot of different people. It wasn't easy in the beginning but after a while I got used to doing the tasks. The team members were very nice people and made easy to get along with them.
good,"I would recommend this job to any young adult looking to experience what it is like working for the first time.  You are molded to be productive, respectful and confident individuals able to complete any task given to you.  The toughest part of the job is learning how to stand all day on concrete flooring and the proper shoes needed to support you. I enjoyed when lunch time arrived to be able to sit for just a little while."
good,"Very  Hard Working Maximum Walking, Standing Lifting I've learned how to go the extra miles for others help others get finish with there work as well."
good,"Target is very fast paced, but the training gives one the ability to keep up. Never fear falling behind, your team members will help you! Leaders are always on call, and will physically show you themselves what to do."
good,In the Business Partner role you will act as the SME for the retail business and work very closely with the IT team to develop applications to drive productivity in the stores.  The corporate environment at Target is very political.  Very much a chain of command and you don't necessarily feel like you have the ability to speak you mind.
good,"greet guests,learned about displays merchandising,management is lousy,co workers were good,hardest part dealing with public,"
good,"a typical day at work was unloading freight and pushing to the floor."
good,"typical day: checking out endless customers"
good,"Each day started with an assessment of who out of the 10 team members scheduled showed up for work that day. I also had to assess which tasks (pricing and planogram) would be completed based on how many team members reported that day.  Each planogram work day was planned out 10 days ahead but the pricing workload changed each day and had to be completed that day. I would prioritize these changes this around if the workload came in heavy.  I also dealt with the many vendors that came in the store each and every day to make sure that all their product was stocked on the floor and organized in the backroom. Each and everyday I had to prioritize, delegate, and manage the team of 10 to 20 team members in order to get the work done on time."
good,"make us work like slaves for close to minimum wage. Could've been worse but rather not work there. Was in college town so a lot of females around, friendly guests but some managers were a joke."
good,"Pay was not very good especially for the amount of work done during the holiday and hours were not the best either. The only pro I can think of would be the discount since target is my favorite store, just no the best to work at."
good,"I worked as a Cart Attendant at the Cedar Park,Tx Location. When I was first hired on I was excited to work for a company that I enjoyed shopping at so much. Target always had a relaxed friendly atmosphere."
good,The pace of the job can vary. You get to come in contact with different cultures. However can be demanding for such little pay.
good,"Target was okay at first, but quickly became a battleground where employees fought to be a Team Lead's favorite. Doing this promised more than 16 hours a week and you could get close to 30 if you got at least 4 Red Cards a day. Managers and team were nice enough, but the upper management needed some work."
good,You have to love people in the retail environment to be able to work at Target. The people who you work with are great but the rules of the company keep changing and it's hard to work so many hours with little to no recognition.
good,"Target was an interesting job. It had its ups and downs like many, but the one thing I really did enjoy was the people who I worked with. Some worked harder than others but it still felt like a family most of the time. What I did not like was the changing or Target. It no longer was about being better than Walmart it became a battle between all the other Targets."
good,"Company does not have good practices for hiring management, as a result many locations do not properly handle their team, and this leads to them promoting employees who have no skills for a managerial position. People are not held accountable for their responsibilities and general morale in most locations is terrible.  Everyone just wants to punch the clock, get paid, and leave."
good,"It's a place only for people, who are managers. The workers, while needed, don't really get the opportunities for advancement as they should. I saw it up close and personal. I was a cart attendant, and tried to cross train as much as I could. But there was not much of a future for me to advance further than where I was."
good,"the customer service/guest relations was always a priority, but employer to employee relations weren't. Co-workers were awesome, and the most enjoyable part of my day was successfully helping guests find what they were looking for."
good,"Fun retail environment. Management knowledge is limited, though. Lose too many good employees due to lower wages/benifits. Needed to work too many hours before benefits kick in."
good,The culture at Target is very limiting and focused too much on change versus execution.  I spent 25% of my time networking the advancement of my career versus focused on the work and my team.  It wasn't just me... this was the guidance from each of my leaders.
good,"working in this company is ok....the early morning hours can get tiring after a while...co-workers are ok, ones who have been there a while can be a great help but one learns this flow team job by the second day...wish they would allow for more hours to work but if not in good standing with your immediate boss, you'll never see any..."
good,Working in the store was great while I was going to school. They really worked around my schedule so I could get school done
good,"work at target is fun if you are social if not you can tell the management will favor other people instead of you."
good,"I worked at the Guest Services desk for a year.  I was part of a great team.  I worked part time and was promised a career path that included promotions.  This never came to pass.  The promotions were given to the younger group.  I felt that I was being passed up.  Management ignored my desire to become a bigger part of the company.  "
good,there are a lot of great people working at target and they emphasize customer service. the management wasnt always willing to listen and often made mistakes.
good,"I enjoy the fast paced environment where I can work on many different things. Though being understaffed most of the time, minimal raises, no real recognition, and low chances for advancement makes it hard to want to work there for an extended time. I like the people I work with and I understand it's retail, but it's been harder with every year. When I first started I was recognized for doing a good job and given chances for advancement and now everyone is too overworked to properly work with each other. Otherwise it's been a a great part time job."
good,A seasonal position on the night crew. It was  hard work and very hard hours on the body and mood. I was worn out very quickly it was very physical and emotional draining on the body. Back and shoulders were always hurting.
good,"A typical day at Target starts with me checking up with my team leaders on what needs to be accomplished for the day. I'm typically in the backroom of the store, putting away merchandise. Occasionally I'm on the floor assisting guests, stocking merchandise, & cashiering from time to time. From management down to my fellow co-workers, everyone does their part to meet our goals, although there can be improvement in that area. The hardest part of working for Target is, trying to multi-task in a variety of areas. You'll find yourself doing a number of tasks all at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job, is interacting with my fellow co-workers. At Target, come across a variety of personalities."
good,The pay and benefits are fine. The expectations are unattainable. Not diverse and inclusive. Love working with my teams and managing talent. Not a fan of the store structures and requirements for promotion. Not happy about being a corporate puppet. Day to day tasks are fine. Team is excellent.
good,Target was an okay way to start off learning and growing work skills. It was very dependent on sales and promoting which I learned from but ultimately didn't want to pursue.
good,The pay was great . But its a warehouse so it was very hot and dusty. They have a high turn around on management . You are watched all the time
good,"Results driven environment."
good,"-The shift was overnight and very exhausting, but I made the best out of the overnight situation by the enthusiasm of other co-workers."
good,Target is a great company to learn a lot from! I learned much of my money handling and sales technique at Target. Great company to interact with customers of all kinds!
good,Picking up and folding racks and tables. Pulling and pushing product to the floor. Great customer service skills and experience.
good,Target is in a state of flux and change... some for the better and some for the worse. Store level opportunities provide the most promotion opportunities however that comes as a significant price from a work life balance perspective.
good,Good place to work when getting through school. You can learn a lot about multiple departments. But the company does not have a lot to offer in moving up.
good,A typical day at work is putting aways merchandise. I've learned time management and accountability. Management lacks training in some areas in the store. Co-workers take pride in their work. The hardest part of the job is moving up in the company. The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting vendors and reps from other companies.
good,"Overall staff was not treated fairly, there was too much pressure on the team members."
good,"Target is a fast-paced performance driven organization. Your direct supervisor will truly make or break your experience. Decent pay, decent benefits. Headquarters is highly political. Field based positions have less work/life balance."
good,Enjoyed the chance to become the cake decorator.  Got to improve my skills and had very patient bakery manager who helped me to learn.
good,"Sold cell phones for Radio Shack inside Target. Management was adequate, but pay was dependent on commission and many people did not know our department was there. Co-workers were fun, but often times had to help Target employees with customer service."
good,"I look forward to reporting to work everyday.I love meeting new people and it is gratifying to see how I can help make their experience much better."
good,I enjoyed my time at target but a manager who's name i will not disclose framed me for a personal reason which made me loose my job
good,normal part time work.  kind of boring. not a lot of thinking needed to be done to complete the job.  did not agree with the Hours I had to work: 4:00am-8:00am. I learned that pretty much anybody can become a manager over there at target. it was basically temporary.
good,"Descent option for students due to limited hours available, 4 hr minimum shifts, and 9/5 job mentality (as opposed to a career)."
good,"Depending on your specific job, Target can be really fun. Being a cashier is stand still almost. This is a job that you can not move up in that easily. Most employees stay grounded in their position for years. Its minimum wage and increases on pay are rare."
good,"I enjoyed working in holidays and closely with customers."
good,"Receive all incoming stores and supplies, unload trucks, pull and back stock stores, load trucks assist customers deal with vendors, secure high item stores. Maintain filing system and enter all data on windows based computer system."
good,A typical revolved around setting up a new display or stocking shelves in the store with a group of workers assigned in that area
good,a typical day at work would consist of opening register and assisting customers. the management was very professional. there was not anything hard about this job the most enjoyable part would be talking to customers . I learned how to communicate well.
good,Unload nightly trucks and place in correct areas in the store. Pull needed stock from backroom to fill store shelves. Open boxed from truck and place on shelves if the items were still needed. If the items weren't needed on the shelves you would place items on a designated cart.
good,"my day at work started off with heading to the office to pick up a walkie and a portable product scanner.  after that id head to my assigned area and stock the shelves if I wasn't on front counter duty.  If the store was slammed I'd head up to work counter until the business slowed down again.  Due to the sheer size of the store we were spread out all over the place, so messages would take a while to reach the receiver if they were missed on the walkie, which could happen depending on where you are in the store.  The best part of my day was working in the electronics section.  I'd say the hardest part of my job was answering the barrage of guest questions when business picked up, as well as straightening out merchandise over and over again due to misplacement."
good,"a typical day was busy with the managers stressed forgetting who was on break and who needed to take their break.When you were on the job you were to clock in find the manager to see who need to get covered or just hop on a lane. As a cashier we had to push red cards which wasn't all that bad,and always give great customer service and help clients. Also had to take turn cleaning the restrooms ,which didn't really happen if a personwasnt busy they had to clean the restroom when it wasn't their turn. On a relax day we clock on,clean the lanes and wait to ring someone up,the hardest part was to keep calm on the busy days especailly during the Holidays.The thing I most enjoyed was the down time being able to talk one on one with managers and knowing they're human too"
good,"It is what you would expect from a typical retail job. You work 25 hour weeks, some days are good and some are bad. Overall its a job you work while in school or a second job."
good,"I enjoyed going into work knowing I get along with my co-workers. It was nice working knowing that we cared about each other and would go out of each others way to help one another. I would get difficult guest from time to time, but anywhere you work that will happen. I love my HR manager, he was a very heart warming person, and I felt I could go to him with any problems. The only thing I wished would of happened for me there with all the years of working there was advancement."
good,"A typical day at work usually involves working as a cashier, guest service rep., and or GSA if a break needs to be covered. Mostly with cashiering and guest service I tend to the needs of a guest whatever they may be in relation to what Target provides. Management is considerably stable but does rotate and communication does suffer at times. Co-workers are generally friendly and are a joy to be around. The hardest part of the job is dealing with people/guests because even the little things like issues with pricing or signage can become dramatized but for the most part things are handled well even in heated situations. The most enjoyable part is also the people/ both guests and team mates, because they can keep your spirits up when your feet start to hurt and you feel like you might not make it through the day."
good,"Typical day included customer service on the sales floor and over the phone, stocking products, back-up cashier.  Sometimes it was hard to complete tasks in the alloted amount of time."
good,As the company continues to try and move forward the slogan expect more pay less is also applicable to the employees. Leaders are often given less payroll with more objects. Generally the extra projects fall on the salary team. The company does have amazing benefits and you will learn an incredible amount while you are with them. For those who are adept at networking the company is a wonderful opportunity. You will never work harder anywhere else in your life.
good,"A lot of time standing"
good,Was not bad at first when I started their in 2009. But when you working with team members and team leaders that are lazy you have to leave. It messes up everything once one person do not do one job and cleaning up after people is very annoying.
good,"A usual work day at Target as a back room member included coming in getting ready for the day, meeting and greeting shoppers, associating with co-workers and attended to business."
good,"Working at Target gave taught me a few things. I mostly unloaded truck so my work days were quite busy. The few co-workers that I do work with are very nice as well as the managers. They are very flexible with your needs. The hardest part of the job is learning where everything goes, however, the most enjoyable part is the satisfaction of finishing the truck."
good,Working in retail is like being in High school things are so childish especially with management.
good,Target was not a place that I would have planned to make a career.
good,"The day is consumed with hands on work, no time to do all the other job requirements, I have learned that it take a real passion to work in retail. Management is too consumed with the bottom line and not the people. Some of the co-worker are helpful but its every man for themselves, especially when there is a District Office visit. The hardest part of this job is retaining good talent. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the growth in others."
good,"It was a learning experience, however it was seasonal so I really wasn't there long enough to get a grasp of everything. I will say the the most enjoyable part of the job was talking to customers and problem solving"
good,"I would not recommend working here unless you have no other choice. I have worked for Target for almost 7 years. You may have one job title, but you will be required to know more than your area and you will be scheduled for those areas just to make the amount of hours that you want. Any little thing you may do wrong will be recorded in the computer by your supervisors. You may think it is just a little reminder or talk, but they will be recording that conversation on the computer. It is high stress and you will be afraid to do anything wrong because you will be written up for it, no matter how hard you try to please the managers. My breaking point was when they wanted me to work Thanksgiving holidays."
good,"As atividades realizadas são sempre inovadoras e urgentes, fazendo que você desenvolva sua criatividade para solucionar as situações geradas.Existe muita rotatividade de funcionários o que não nos faz criar grandes vínculos de amizades. Os Diretores são jovens e arriscam todas as suas fichas quando acreditam que o negócio terá potencial de dar certo. A parte difícil é que muitas vezes temos que desenvolver competências que não agregam valores na carreira profissional que de fato queremos seguir, e muitas tarefas desenvolvidas com mérito não são reconhecidas por nossos superiores fazendo com que acreditemos que estamos remando contra maré e estagnados em nossa função. A parte mais agradável é que temos total liberdade de criarmos soluções e processos que possam vim a agregar valores nos projetos, e o senso de urgência nos faz sentir útil e capaz."
good,The team member job is not a difficult task to complete. It involves basic addition and having everyday conversations with people. The hardest part may be your management.
good,"My typical work day consist of opening or closing the store.  Checking the quality assurance of Pizza Hut, Starbucks, and Target PFresh. Then I have to walk the whole store and create task list for the team to fix any concerns. I run a staff of around 40 team members each day. Delegating and following up with the team members to make sure all task are completed.  Coach and or terminate team members when required.  Write business walks and come with action plans everyday to assure all task are completed  Secure all money at open and closing of the store.  Securing the building at nights when closing.  Making sure all team members are in compliance with their break schedules  I write schedules for hardlines and electronics depts.  I walk with inspectors from Steritech every visit.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the team members.  They are fun, hard working and I have a very good working relationship with all of them.  I have also learned while with Target to come up with new ways of delegating and to invent new idea's for better Guest Service within the store.  The hardest park of my position is terminate team members when I have tried to coach them and teach them the proper way procedures are to be done.  And then they do not listen."
good,"Co workers for the most part were great going to miss them opon leaving the company,I gained a vast amount of job knowledge from my time in a retail environment. Hardest part of the job was u get little training and R expected to know ur new job well,safety will be compromised to reach the companies expectations ( witch R almost impossible) If i had five to describe the target distro center they would be hurry-faster-not fast enough.. u R a number not human so dont make a mistake."
good,"The typical day depneds on what department you work in. Management on an hourly level gets 7/10, on the executive level 3/10. Co-workers would get a 5.5/10."
good,"Learned a lot, but terrible pay and a lot of double standards."
good,"It was a ok place to work, I was only a part-time employee. Could not see myself working retail full-time though."
good,"Ive been with this company for seven years. It was great for the first three years That I worked there, but now its not the same so many changes. The hours are poorly decreasing.. I've learned that its an interesting experience working here..I would say its the people that make this job my co-workers always have a good time working with them."
good,Target is a ok place to work but they dont care about their employees.
good,"A typical day includes helping guests through out their Target experience, going above and beyond to make them satisfied and continue to shop at our store. "
good,"Typical day was driving sales and cashiering and picking up the store."
good,"I worked for Target for three years and really saw my self there for the long term. However, the last year or so saw great change in the attitude of management leading to the company becoming cut throat like many other big chains and no longer focusing on a friendly team but one that is paid less and works more. If Target returned to its previous ways, I would return in a heartbeat but at this time, I could not see working for a company that only seems to want to cut you down at every turn."
good,"I worked very hard at this Target, but after a while our Team Leader was fired due to budget cuts. I was then expected to do the job of the Team Leader without any of the benefits and all of the responsibility. As with any job there were people who slacked off, while a small number of us picked up the slack and worked hard without any recognition. Hard-working or not, my co-workers were like family."
good,it was a fairly easy position working as a cashier and helping customer in the customer service area.
good,"Great company to start a business career, learning sales goals, payroll management, gaining and keeping customer loyalty."
good,"When I joined Target, it was a fun, friendly place to work.  Within a couple of years, changes at the top of the corporation happened, and within a couple of years, those changes trickled down to affect individuals on the store level.  Whereas at one point, Target was really great about promoting within and developing talent that they already had, they quickly shifted to a policy of hiring new people, typically fresh out of college that had no prior experience with the company or retail in general.  This led to a quick deterioration of results and morale within the store, and other stores company-wide.  While Target may be a fun place to shop with competitive prices and interesting merchandise, to work there is another story entirely.  The people I work with are great, but we are all burdened with extra hours, less competent superiors, and a store culture that relies less on our talent and ingenuity, and more on a predetermined and HQ-tested guide that assumes all stores throughout the country are the same and can achieve the same results with a uniform plan.  This is not the case, and just one of the many reasons why Target is not the same fast, fun and friendly place that it used to be."
good,"The job itself is fairly easy, the hours arent all that flexible and do not really conform to my life schedule, it's alright."
good,"I worked as a sales floor associate which they call hardlines. I had to make sure the store was clean and help the guests along the way. My coworkers at Target were fun, loving people. I learned a lot from working here. The managers weren't all that great. They lack motivation and did not listen well to the employees. The hardest part of the job was when I they send me to finish someone else's department and I still had to finish mine. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see happy guests and help them out with their shopping."
good,Breaks are not always given on time and on long shifts the second break is usually forgotten. They keep you just under the hours to collect benefits. Their raises are the worst I have ever seen.
good,the people i worked with were really nice and fun to be around i enjoyed working here until my last 2 months we got new management and a lot of people that i worked with was quitting and getting moved to a different target. typical work day was decent was not to busy but we always had somethin to do.
good,My days at work are making sure that my team are working with a great sense of urgency to get new product out to salesfloor. I jump in and help out as well and make sure that my team is taking care of.
good,"On a given day I find myself working at a minimum of three different work centers in one day.  I have become very well adapt at time management to accommodate all these different positions. I also find myself on frequent occasion working later then my scheduled shift and also not working the work center I  was scheduled for to begin with.  Also to make a comment on that, with the new MyTime scheduling system it seems that hours are very hard to come by, and its a constant struggle to get enough hours to pay the bills.  I fell very strongly that there are two cultures in place, with Upper Management being one and Team Members and Leads being another.But do not get me wrong I do enjoy working with my fellow co-workers and interacting with our guest on a daily basis.  Some of the things I can take away for this job is I have learned to be adaptable, I have learned to be flexible and work with all kinds of people and personalities, I have learned how to handle time constraints and pressures and how to maximize my abilities to accomplish the goal in front of me. Lastly I would say the most valuable lesson I have learned is how to work within a specific system, and with management that may be difficult to work with."
good,"pay was horrible for the amount of work they wanted, but It is a good place to start for anyone who is out of high school or in college. No real room to grow, and management is not the greatest."
good,"Work is very simple and straight forward. Management can be pushy at times, but overall do a decent job. Co-workers are great and they have a good mix of personalities. If a flow team member be prepared to do the most physical demanding work with the least amount of compensation. They do not value the position do to the ability to easily replace members. The turnover is very high."
good,Great hours to work. I good team of people. there is nothing else to say.
good,Not what I expected or was sold during recruitment.   Good culture but in the end the lack of hours and resources to complete tasks made success impossible.  Tremendous amount of leadership turnover in my time there.
good,"Great place to work at if the management is actually doing their job. They are called leaders and instead of leading they tend to whine and complain. They are called Executive Team Leads however they are not worthy of being called Leaders rather bosses would be a more appropriate word. To be a leader you must lead by example, to  be a boss you bark out orders and expectations and if you do not follow them, well thats your problem because you are expendable."
good,"Target is a company with a fairly young employee demographic. Therefore, there is a large turnover. They hire young college graduates as first-level managers, this leads to a fair amount of inexperience among the store staff. As these young managers gain additional training they generally take advantage of better opportunities outside of retail."
good,The place was fun to work at and was easy work. Customers are a bit rowdy and make it tough. Management didn't care too much for employees and there was little ability to move up.
good,"a typical day, is unloading the trucks. Restocking the shelves. working the same isles every night. I didn't learn much. management didn't know how to communicate with each other it's team members. My co-workers were okay, some didn't do much work. But there were times when it was fun to go into work. The hardest part was staying late to finish the work that people left behind. The most enjoyable part was clocking out at the end of the day."
good,"Managment was lacking at my store, however this job gave me so much experience and gave me some much needed skills."
good,This job has taught me a lot about the retail environment and other related work places. I proven I can teach myself a lot of things but it goes unrewarded because there was no pay raise or promotion involved in taking on the cafe.
good,target has a way of pushing out the people who they dont like. just because they dont like the workers doesnt mean they arent hard workers and get the job done. its all about personal vendetas. no matter how hard you work they will always seem to shove you out if you dont follow there thoughts or beliefs. the pay is ok and they benefits are not good. you practically have to take half of your already low paycheck to pay for them.
good,"Long, hectic, busy days, often disrupting work-life balance. Pay is good, though."
good,the hardest part is being there for 4:30 in the morning. enjoy my coworkers and their conversation as well as help when needed.
good,"Target puts heavy promotion on their team feeling more like family, and it becomes apparent to guests within their first visit. A typical day involves group low-down on the tasks for the day, and working cooperatively to maintain company standards. During my time working for this company, there was much emphasis on management making sure you take breaks as you should and are getting your full break times. "
good,over worked /underpaid. co-workers are great made some really good friends management could stand to be a little bit better they really could commuinicate better with one another it can be really stressful at times with all the miss commuincation going on and not enought team members to cover a shift sometime it was like being in high school.
good,"Very busy"
good,Typical day at work starts with me pulling boxes off the conveyor belt and placing them on separate pallets by department.  Then we go out on the floor and stock the shelves. Hardest part of the job is waking up to be at work at 4 am. Other than that the job is easy. You just need muscle and energy.
good,"A typical day at work is fun! Most of the guests that come through are friendly and happy. While working here I have learned how to multitask and recognize business needs within my area in the store and some in other areas as well. I have learned how to order supplies and deal with difficult situations. I have awesome co-workers, we all help each other out in any way we can. The hardest part of my job is dealing with a lack of communication between management and team members. The most enjoyable part of my job is when the regulars come in and chat. I love hearing how they are doing!"
good,Great place to grow and develop as a leader with a strong focus on feedback and continuous improvement.  Pay and benefits at the executive level is great. The amount of change can cause volatility at times and tends to feel reactive in nature.
good,"I loved working at Target when I first got there, I saw myself advancing and had a good time whenever I was there. But after a change in management the whole environment of the store took a turn for the worse and it is now one of my least favorite jobs I have ever had."
good,There was not enough hours being given to the employees. Communication between managers and employees was sometime misunderstood. Working conditions were not always suitable. The most important part of my job was unloading trailers and making sure merchandise is placed on the right panels. The most enjoyable part of my job was the enthusiastic personalities of my team members.
good,"fast paced working enviroment, busy all day. not much training given just figure it out yourself"
good,"For the most part it is a good place to work as long as you stick to the same schedule. They would rather have you work long hours a couple days a week, than hire more people. Most managers are micromanagers so it is hard to get anything done in the little time you have. You are short staffed most of the time so you end up wearing more than one hat when you go in--which isn't a problem if you are crossed trained to work in other areas --which they say you will be but mostly you just learn things on the fly. Job security is okay if you are good at your job and don't call in all too much. Getting days off is hard sometimes but not if you put in for it about a month in advance. Customers are like most in other retail jobs but, in my opinion, expect too much when they are regulars and see you are short staffed. Not much chance of advancement even with seniority."
good,"started with my career   as a contractor "
good,Not bad besides management and boring work. jsijsfkjbsdkjbns .d.sdf.sdf.sdf..fsd.fs.df.sd.fsd.f.sdf.sdf sf sd
good,A typical day at work would start of slow but around 4 in the afternoon it would start picking up. My team was about 5 associate witch i was in charge of and they are an amazing team to work with hardworking and responsible a mean i did set really high expectation for them as soon as they started working for me.
good,"a standard retail job, where i got to do a little with the pos system and signing system"
good,Typical day at work consists from 4 a.m. till 11 a.m. 4/6 days per week. I was responsible for unloading trucks and stocking shelves.
good,High impact marketing company.  Worked in operations so felt a little separated from day to day HQ activity.
good,"I started as an assembler (put the store together) and became a cashier.  I was able to advance to an uncertified pharmacy technician which I enjoyed so much.  There were two pharmacists and the female pharmacist was wonderful.  She taught me so much about homeopathic healing, The male pharmacist was very knowledgeable and taught me about the different medicines and what they do.  He was training me so I could take the certification test in the future.  My  only co-worker was amazing and became one of my best friends.  She knew it all, backwards and forwards.  The pharmacy team was great.  The store managers were not as supportive to any of their team members, except a select few.  The hardest thing about working there was not voicing my opinion when they did things that weren't ethical.  They preached diversity, diversity.  Yet when it came to a young lady that I took in because she was in need of a safe home (she worked there too), she was called a name that was unbecoming of her race. She became like a daughter to me and a sister to my daughter.  I found that I couldn't and wouldn't work for a company that would do that.  The corporate office would not step in."
good,I enjoyed working with the team members. It was a great environment and I learned many things on the job
good,A typical day has its daily tasks laid out for team members before they come. Tasks may be added on as deemed suitable by the team leader. Co-workers are very friendly and helpful. They are understanding of new workers and great to work with. The hardest part of the job is trying to help the guests who enter the store with their questions and needs. The most enjoyable part of the job would be having time left in the day due to early work hours.
good,I met some very fun and great people working here. The management department wasn't so great. They really didn't value their employees much and weren't willing to work with me around my school schedule
good,"Manage registers, check guests out, keep area clean. There is not much to learn when they don't like advancing you."
good,"sometimes long day depends on the work load greeting the guest can I help you find something driving sales that's the gold  fast,fun,friendly"
good,"I have been with Target for 5 years.  In that time my tasks have varied quite a bit, some very rewarding, others less so.  For the most part Target tries to keep itself to it's own brand; Fast, Fun and Friendly being both Target's motto and lifestyle.  Management was encouraged to direct us not only in our tasks but promote a positive atmosphere for both guests and our fellow employees.  Whether it was the 4am Truck unloads, working the sales floor, or even closing in the backroom, a positive attitude was always encouraged."
good,"This job is very easy for anyone to do, but the pay is minimum wage so if you have a family to take care of this would not be for you. The environment is really fun, the people were great! They do not offer full time shifts everyone is part time."
good,Pay does not measure up to workload required.  Self-Reviews were confusing. The questions asked had nothing to do with job duties performed.
good,"Work was relatively easy, annoying but easy to do. Maintain carts, make sure bathrooms are clean, cashier when I was needed, maintained the front area to look clean, took out the trash in the front of the store, bathrooms and starbucks/pizza hut restaurants. What I learned there is that a lot of customers seem to think its okay to make a mess, because ""Its someone else's job."" Which, I personally think is not okay. Management was okay, they were okay people, a bit bossy (since they were the boss) but overall, we got along. My co-workers were probably my favorite part about the job, since they always tried to cheer me up and since I had the crappiest job in the store. I loved everyone there. Great set of people. The hardest part of the job for me, would be the weather, but I absolutely loved being outside and walking around the parking lot."
good,I enjoyed working with guests; the compensation was low and could not advance quickly.
good,It was a fun place to work but not worth the pay and hours. Had to many workers not enough hours
good,Some day when working you can have the best of your life and those others day you will have a bad days. Every client you met will be a surprise. New manager has new sets of rule that don't compliance with work areas which slow it downs. Most enjoyable part is when you get help from others employees.
good,"Target is a great company to work for when in the right store with great managers. Be aware that some locations are not as great and management included. Compensation is average and sometimes below. But the atmosphere is awesome. Target as a whole participates in many charity events, so it is easy to network while volunteering with the company. The Fast, Fun, and Friendly work environment will stick with you for years."
good,"Target was wonderful to me while I was recovering from a personal injury and was extremely supportive during this time.  They allowed me to change departments, to continue to be part of the team and contribute to the store."
good,"A typical day at Target began at 6am and usually ended around 10am, which I felt was a little aggravating. Waking up at 5am to only work 4 hours made me feel like a tool. Even so, I felt great about the job though and got along with all of my co-workers and managers except one. Which subsequently was one of the factors why I parted from the company. I learned that when you work in retail, you don't really work in retail unless you're a member of management or some figure of authority. I also learned that diferrence between working a job and having a career plays a great deal in your attitude when in the workplace. That was one of the hardest lessons that I've ever learned but I am so humbled and gratified by the experince. I never knew how the actual work I performed as an individual employee affected the direct growth and sales of a company. That happened to be the most enjoyable part of the job for me."
good,Too many work place dramas. Employees were more worried about themselves the company morals.
good,Assist customers with any questions and a lot of zoning isles.  I learned how to communicate more effectively with customers.  Management are nice and sometimes provide snacks for the employees are down to earth.  Co-workers are fun and willing to help each other out.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with.  The least enjoyable part is closing.
good,"Being a cashier, I was able to communicate with many different types of people. Had great relations with my co-workers and my employers. The great part of working here, I was able to utilize my people person skills."
good,"fast pace at times."
good,"Help maintain a fast, fun, and friendly work environment for Target guest. Additional job duties include stocking shelves, maintaining a clean work environment, assisting in sales, and performing cashier responsibilities, in some cases. I portrayed a friendly, personable attitude and motivated personalities."
good,"E' stata un'esperienza importantissima che ha lasciato in me dei ricordi bellissimi."
good,"Target invests a lot in its team. This is a great place to work and learn the ins and outs of running a business from the ground up. You will make sacrifices in terms of work/life balance, but that it is to be expected sometimes."
good,"I got a very decent amount of hours. lots of good experience for later. though when i moved out of town and asked to transfer or help transferring, I never got a response. So i ended up having to quit after weeks of inquiring about a transfer."
good,"Target is truly a great place to work, other than during holidays. Not because of the shoppers, but because of management. When the holidays come around, the college kids come to work at Target, and those of us that are there all year long get penalized. Meaning, our hours get cut, bad. Often, you feel the frustration of working SO hard only to get cut back when new people come in. Unable to pay bills, and unable to buy family Christmas. Honestly the worst thing about Target."
good,"It was just a seasonal job the Christmas holiday. But, I truly enjoyed working with them.  Always busy and never bored...Great people work there."
good,A typical day at Target is like any other day in a retail store. It was busy at Christmas and slow afterwards. I learned customer service skills and some management responsibilities. The management was good and fair. The co-workers were nice and cooperative. The hardest part of the job was satisfying unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers and making them happy.
good,I actually really liked this job but they fired me when they found out I was pregnant.
good,"- Considerable emphasis around talent development"
good,Balanced workload.  Not a lot of career advancement if you don't have a 4-yr degree.
good,Great place to work..little career advancement opportunity
good,I really appreciate this company and now have a better appreciation for retail workers they are underpaid and have work weekend.Target treats you as family and everyone knows you. They volunteer to help people. Target takes pride in their store and brand. They even make employee stay after hours to clean up the store so it looks nice for the next day. The only thing is holidays the returns are so much it had us staying two hours after the store closes. No holidays off except Easter and Christmas.
good,Customer service learned how to work cash register and sales floor.  Management was ok.  Co-workers good.  The job was not hard at all.  Most enjoyable was interaction with the guests.
good,"Retail is not for everyone.  You either love it, or you hate it."
good,"Teams focused on social compliance, supply-chain sustainability, product safety and quality assurance, product investigating and recalls, and operations all work together to make sure we provide the best products for our guests."
good,Began as a fun place to work but change in management has left a lot to be desired
good,"When I am not a guest service team member, I occasionally cashier. My day typically begins with cleaning and organizing my work area and zoning the front lanes. I then assist guests with their purchases and intermittently sign people up for target credit or debit cards (sometimes both). As a cashier and as a store our goal is 3% (3 Redcards for every 100 transactions). My current personal conversion score is over 25% and my stores score is 3.64%. Ultimately my goal as a cashier is to help the guest as quickly and efficiently as possible, while maintaining a positive and friendly attitude so that they leave with the best possible impression of my store."
good,I really enjoyed the work and the other employees but the management was some of the worst I have ever experienced
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with and the values of the organization, however, the schedule was not flexible and not conducive to family life."
good,"Working with a great team was the best part of my job. We were able to tackle a great deal of work with minimum help. I worked with an excellent team which was able to accomplish more workload than the average team. I learned that the best way to lead a team is to lead by example. Setting a higher morale standard for my team allowed me to set higher expectations and hold my team to a more effective level."
good,"I have to say Target was the worst job I have had. The things I had to go through in my 3 years of employment there were the hardest to swallow but I wont go into detail about them, however, I recommend no one to seek employment with them."
good,"As an executive, you learn tons, grow as a leader, and are compensated well. Advancing can be a challenge at times, and getting into headquarters is a nightmare."
good,Hire and Fire work place. Fast pace great work place good only for individuals without responsibility.
good,"I work primarily as a cashier at the register lanes.  I have learned various ways of positively interacting with our guests and making them feel pleasant and comfortable.  I enjoy working with the other cashiers and appreciate the assistance and support which the GSTLs (cashier supervisors) provide.  Unfortunately, the managers at the higher levels are not very friendly or supportive.  The most difficult part of my job is the pressure we are under to convince the guests to sign up for a RedCard (Target's credit/debit card).  My favorite part of this job is the daily interaction I experience with the customers; especially the younger children who are shopping with their parents."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with.  However, it is hard to advance, even with a college degree.  A typical day for a backroom team member consists of timed CAF pulls as well as managing the flow of back stock.  During holidays and back to school, the backroom atmosphere can seem congested and logistics become more complicated.  When it comes to backroom management, my direct supervisor did a great job.  However, his boss and some of the other LODs (Leader-On-Duty) were often helpless when it came to resolving backroom issues."
good,Low pay with no way to earn more other than management. You will typically work the sales floor which means you clean up after customers and stock shelves.
good,even do it didn't work out in target cause at the time of me working their the management their was not enough hours and also no room to grow in the company so I seek new employment at another company. I would go back in a heart beat if I would have 40hours and benefits cause that's another thing I didn't have.
good,"Enjoyed helping all guests at the store learn different ways to help guests weather at the front lanes or returns. When starting with the company I was a cashier got to guest service and then promoted to a team leader this was in Valencia LA area. Here in the valley it didn't seem they wanted to promote within. "
good,"Managers constantly contradict each other, I didn't get proper training, and my job suffered because of it."
good,"Keeping up with new ideas,keeping a posative attitude with people you work with! Sticking to the rules,but introducing new ideas at the same time! "
good,Good benefits.  Hourly supervisor position is flexible with good work life balance.
good,Fun place to work but management was no good. Management did not report incidents and where not very supportive of concerns and did nothing about complaints
good,Great place for temporary and seasonal work. Lots of team work and team building.
good,"co workers are reliable and friendly "
good,"I started out as a cashier and was trained in food ave, customer service, fitting rooms, sales floor, and trained the new employees on register. It was a fairly nice place to work and the coworkers were pretty friendly. They didn't give a ton of hours but if you needed more or decided you needed a day off, employees could put their hours they wanted off on the main sheet and others could pick up those hours. I thought it was a pretty good practice especially with so many employees. Also you can get a raise during your yearly performance review. The better you perform and do the better the raise."
good,Typical day is filled with busy work. Very easy going environment with great people to work with.
good,"On a typical day I would either open as a cashier, a customer service employee or starbucks. I would work long hours short breaks and would have barely enough time to breathe. I did meet a lot of new people and I did like interacting with customers which made the day go by a lot faster."
good,"On a typical work day I get to interact with team members from across the store and customers. Normally I work in the fitting room and make sure the area is organized and greet the guests coming in and leaving. I also help them find items they need in other parts of the store, or call other stores to see if they have the customer's item in stock. I also spend part of my day re-organizing the racks and folding tables. I also push out new product. I learned to become a team trainer and really set an example for other team members. My co-workers are always friendly and willing to help out. I know I can go to any of them if I'm having a problem, and they can come to me. The most enjoyable part of the job is definitely helping the customers find what they are looking for, they are always so thankful and it makes my day to help people."
good,While working at Target I learned how to use various pieces of loading equipment and worked with many helpful co-workers and managers. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with all of the call outs that happened on a daily basis.
good,The work is routine and constant. There isn't much room for improvement or growth. You are constantly in the same spot each day and constantly doing the same thing. 
good,The most enjoyable part working for Target was the fact that the team I worked in were more like family than friends. The hardest part of the job was the favoritism amongst some of the managers and workers. Overall working here was mostly a positive experience.
good,To work long hours and then go home with satisfaction knowing that you have put your best efforts.
good,I have worked for target for approximately 8 months and in the time I have learned a great deal. A typical day consists of arriving at work before 530am and staying until at least 330pm. In that time I am responsible for managing the logistics work center of the store which includes several different integral processes.
good,2.5 of 5 starts overall. Not much work life balance. Work 12 hour shifts and every other weekend. 
good,I leave how to handle different types of situations. It helped me be more confident around others.
good,"good place to work with good chance for advancement however un relaistic when unexpected medical issues , second jobs or family personal issues arise "
good,"Answering the phone, straightening throughout the store, greeting the guest answering any questions or concerns. The guest is always right and always first."
good,"My time here was very interesting, there is always something to do to keep busy. Being there work horse and getting over 40+ hours they kept promising me more advancement but the management never delivered there was always an excuse or a reason why my raise would be the same as others. "
good,"providing great customer service through phone calls "
good,"The typical day would be to make enough Sushi to fill the Sushi case, prepare ingredients for the next day and clean."
good,"On a daily basis, I have to oversee a team that sets aisles and puts out new merchandise. It can be quite hectic at times, which I like. I enjoy the complex days where you can see a major difference in what we have done by the time the store opens the next morning. There are days when the work can be too much to handle and we have to struggle to make it through but with a great partnership with peers, we are able to band together to make anything happen. "
good,Management was lenient; enjoyed hearing about great customer service. 
good,"Target had a nice environment, but each day I didn't know whether I was going to be a cashier for the day or working in guest services. I earned $8.25 an hour. My coworkers were very nice. The hardest part of the job was when I had to push the carts from the parking lot. My build does not suggest that I can do that. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was working in guest services. I loved helping the customers."
good,Pretty good place to work. Friendly staff. OK hours management is understanding
good,"Target has a lot of potential, and grow as a company. A lot of different opportunities to advance. Great team atmosphere. "
good,demanding and stressful work environment working for very little work.
good, 
good,Target is not a place you want to work for for the rest of your life.
good,Restock items from Guest Services onto shelves. The most enjoyable part of the job was finishing all the stocking before we left.
good,"Steady work, fun co-workers and friendly customers, Low pay, lack of communication from management, unrealistic time frames"
good,Target is a highly collaborative environment with some extremely talented individuals working on catching up with the rest of retail.
good,"Assisting customers, merchandising, cashiering"
good,"Although I love what I do, I need a new challenge.On the average day, I am faced with the product loaded onto 14 pallets. I must first unload the truck, stock the pallets of product to the sales floor, return them to receiving...where I use a crown lift to condense old pallets and make space for new ones. Highly organized and great communicator. I also help out in other depts where needed."
good,"Typical at Target was not a concept, most of the time you had different tasks, people, management or co-workers. Nothing stayed the same for long. I learned how to evolve when changing personnel made it difficult to find resoruces or task to be completed responsible. Hardest part is that you are just a name and a number on a clipboard."
good,"Stood on feet all day! Rude customers, but I enjoyed talking to most of them! I didn't learn a thing, well I learned what sexual(not too much sexual, but it was there) harassment on the job was. Loved most of my co-workers! Best part of the day...going home after working 1 to 2 hrs overtime when the store closes."
good,Lots of tanding.I learn good team effort and good team work.Co-workers very nice.Enjoyed meeting all types of people from different cultures.
good,"I think Target, Corporation does a good job making work enjoyable, for what it is. It's a great place to start your working experience, provided you have very little of it. It's been fascinating getting to know the inner workings of a mass retailer. Supposedly you can move up in position, if you are determined to stay with Target. The only thing I would say to someone who wants to move up is that it's definitely not as easy as people make it seem. If upper management doesn't want you in a certain position, I think they make it quite clear that they want to keep you somewhere else. However, it is a good job that offers decent benefits if you are currently in the process of looking for better opportunities elsewhere. Essentially, it's a nice place to make friends and interact with guests."
good,This job was very fast paced and we were always busy. I learned a lot by working with the diverse team.
good,"My typical work day id from 6am until 2:45pm unloading and pushing a truck. I have learned how to manage my time wisely inorder to be productive and acomplish what I need to get done. I find the companies managment is very unorganized and leaders lack communication to one another. My co-workers have taught me a lot of skills and keep me focused and to be productive, which is pobabbly one of the hardest parts of the job. I would say the most enjoyable part would be at the end of my day when I finish my work 100% and can go home feeling accomplished."
good,"But they overwork you. Although they talk about employees having work/life balance, I don't think they mean it. You learn how to meet and exceed your expectations for yourself, but rarely ever meet your boss's expectations."
good,Target took care of you when you worked the holidays. HR was really nice and responded in a timely manner. Felt as though flow team members were treated like robots and not people.
good,help customers get in and out with what they want all with a fast fun and friendly attitude.
good,"I loved working for Target...the company. Their ideals matched my own, and I really felt that I would stay with Target forever. Now come in Newton, North Carolina...unless you are a favored one, you are doomed for termination. Senior management is the worst I have ever seen. Back stabbing, stone throwing, vengeful, ugly leaders. Made me embarrassed to be a part of it. There is an ""out to get you"" mentality in the Senior management team that threatens your job EVERY DAY. Since day one in Newton, NC, I felt my job was in jeopardy, always having to look over my shoulder. If only SOMEONE would listen to the Employee Integrity Hotline...I know for a fact that nobody took my concerns seriously....especially when the HR Manager is one of the culprits with the poorest attitude. She and a few others needs to go....then the Distribution Center MIGHT have a chance to showcase the true talent they have. Until that happens, all the good ones leave."
good,Although the company was in good spirit most of it's employees were not
good,a good place to work for if going to school.
good,"Work was not that hard but became complicated through lack of guidance and good leadership, Some nights longer than others but this experience made me a better worker due to the circumstances"
good,Answering phones and helping out the guest with anything I can/ they need.
good,"I gave 15 years to Target. I moved up from an ordinary sales floor team member, to a Price Chage and Sales floor Team leader. In this position I managed 2-about 20 team members a day. I would supervise daily price changes that needed to be made and continously make sure the floor was stocked and well organized."
good,"Within my three years so far as an employee the team is very engaging and has great job advancement if you put in the work; however, hours are based off of payroll and sales so it varies week to week which can be very frustrating. The management team does not support their team very much and overall moral of the work environment is very gloomy and not enjoyable."
good,not bad place to work at most people are friendly and awesome
good,"good teammates decent management, job included a lot of heavy lifting and strenuous labor"
good,"Good job, good environment as long as your not military, trying to go to school and have a family."
good,Working with stock; placing items on the shelves and then once the store open helped with customers while stocking shelves throughout the store.
good,"Work hours normally start at 8am, at this time equipments are gather together to commence duties for the day. one of the most important thing I learn and still learning that it is not merely attaching a price to an item, but you have to make sure that the Department class item(DPCI) and the Universal product code( UPC) correspond to the item- the term Price Accuracy."
good,"The situation at this Target has likely improved, but we were under a very difficult manager at the time. She had a ""because I said so"" attitude and chose to manage with threats over praise every time. The cronyism at the time made the employees uncomfortable with approaching HR about her behavior. I wish I'd had the nerve to go to corporate at the time."
good,A typical day was simply signing onto a register and ringing up guests as quickly and nicely as possible. There was a lot of emphasis put on staying in the green when it came to ringing up purchases to the point where it was intimidating.
good,"The co-workers are very down to earth/friendly. Everyday was a learning experience for me. I learned different tasks day to day. A typical day at work was always fun. I really didn't have a hard job. Some days it was challenging though, I was able to get through the day without ""breaking down"""
good,Target is a great place to work; however work is not steady. The pay is great. Management changes every year so once you get used to one particular managerial style it changes on you.
good,"A typical day consists of zoning, reshop, assisting the guests, going for back up"
good,Target was very fast pace and friendly I worked long hours on the weekends.Driveing inventory around the warehouse as a team player we relied on each other to follow through with getting our jobs completed on time. What I learned about mannagement is treat others with respect and hold them acountable for mistakes.The hardest part of the jobs were that it was always 12 hours a day and only on the weekends.The most enjoyable part was the working environment i liked the way we all worked as a team togeather safely.
good,You always must maintain communication due to moving all around with powered equipment around other co-workers. Having to read serial numbers correctly so you can sort and load freight to its proper location.
good,"Good job, overnight hrs, but hard workers are not being rewarded properly, no or little advance raise, and was only seasonal work"
good,"not an easy job, high stress many tasks required in little time with little pay."
good,not good for people that are non-assertive... Iam fortunately but customer-employee interaction ws lacking at that location.
good,"This is a good Job, good pa, fast fun and friendly atmosphere."
good,"Not a terrible bad place to work, Team Leaders could be better organized at night. Can get crazy during overnight cleanup as well as stocking shelves."
good,"A typical day at work would include unloading the trucks that we received with merchandise, sorting the merchandise into distinct groups, then stocking the store shelves with said merchandise. I learned how to deal with guests as part of the Flow Team in Electronics, as well as how to upsell and sell items to guests. The management directly above my position was excellent, but the store management as a whole was not exceptional. It was not poor, but it was not great. The hardest part of my job was the lack of advancement and unwillingness of management to assist in needing areas. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning about the retail industry."
good,"handled customers one on one, hours were fair employees were very friendly"
good,Was probably one of the hardest things i had ever done. The way they treat their employees isn't fair. You have people that are willing to come in whenever and they take complete advantage of them. I closed almost every night for them for about 6 months. The HR was barely ever there to talk to. (the raliegh store off grove barton) other than that the other people I worked with were great. They kept me going and made closing not that bad.
good,"I worked at the Starbucks counter. I worked with 1 other barista most of the time, during rush hours there were more co-workers. I was responsible for opening and closing the Starbucks area, often alone. I enjoyed working for Starbucks through Target because the hours were better than a regular Starbucks, and there were windows that I could enjoy the sunrise before it got busy. Starbucks management was flexable, They provided the team members with training material, we were responsible for taking the time to go over new procedures, they verbally quizzed us to make sure we knew everything. Co-workers were all supportive, new team members were integrated quickly. The hardest part of the job was when I transferred from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, my new store was not following food safety procedures and were confrontational when I brought up the rules. After a discussion with Starbucks and Target management, more hours were allotted to the Starbucks team to make sure everyone know safe food handling procedures and where the food safety manuals were located."
good,"unload truck and stock store, learned about the company, management is terrible, co-workers are fun, nothing is hard, getting my work done fast"
good,Co-workers were great to work with. I had never worked in retail but feel management gave me good training.
good,"I cannot really comment on Target as a company because my assets protection team never really considered ourselves to be apart of the regular store team. My boss was an ex-marine and he was realistic and down to earth, and my co-workers were just as enthusiastic about the job as I was. We all loved the nature of our work. When we came to work it didnt feel like a job, we all developed strong bonds and the work environment was like a 2nd home. For me there was no difficult aspect of the job, every day was enjoyable. The pay was good enough to help you get by and the chance for advancement wasnt too vast but because of my immediate team I liked the job very much."
good,"perform duties as assigned, i learned how to work as a team to get jobs done when necessary. the managers were friendly and easy going but when it came to advancement played favoritism. the hardest part of the job was performing jobs alone when they were a two man job. the enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,A typical day at work its really busy.
good,I enjoyed helping others find what it was that they needed.Assistng others and making them happy is a great feeling.
good,"Depending on the location you are at and region, really determines how your store is ran. i beleive some of the managers should not have their jobs, i dont think they value their team members."
good,"typical day includes counting endless medications, phones never stop ringing, constant traffic at the register. management is below par though co-workers get you through the day if you're lucky."
good,The management was okay here. i didn't like working here because they didn't treat their employee's like they should've which just made it not fun at all.
good,Hardest part of the job was getting a new ETL training him and him treating me like I wasnt anything important. Easiest was customer service I loved working with people. Not enough Team work from the manager that was directly over me.
good,i had to work with the public worked from 5pm until 1 am i likebingo
good,Employees are very friendly and accepting of new employees!
good,A typical day at was stocking the shelves and keeping aisles clean. I learned to work under pressure during the busiest time of the year. There was very little communcation with management. I mostly interacted with senior staff on the sales floor. I got along fine with my co-workers but there was a little tension between some of the senior members. The hardest part of the job was trying to let customers know in a respectful way that their demands for certain items could not be met.The most enjoyable part was being given a task and completing it without having to be told a second time.
good,Company offers average benefit plan with very few perks for a company of this size. All training and development is focused around Target and they offer no certifications or skills that advance a person. If you are engauged you can develop your leadership skills and everyone will walk away as a better leader.
good,"a typical day at work is pulling the autofills out of the PDA everynight to replenish the store with products bought throughout the day and backstocking the truck and what does not fit on the floor. I have learned how to use the wave and the crown and also how to do audits to make sure that the counts are accurate. Management is ok, but they have their nights and sometimes plays favoritism. The co-workers are awesome to work with in the backroom and some of them on flow too. The hardest part of the job is to get mostly everybody to work as a team to get the job done faster. The most enjoyable part of the job is punching out when the work is completed and paydays."
good,I am the Senior Teamlead for Softlines. So I am in charge of 10 Team members and their training. I excel in the knowledge that I have led to the support of the company.I feel that everyday in my own way I feel that I contribute to sale percentage and profit.
good,"Ive been with Target for three years. I started as a cashier moved my way up to guest service, now im currently a front end supervisor."
good,I would go to my team leaders to find out what register I was going to be on and if it wasn't busy they would tell me an area to zone. I learned new selling technique's when it came to selling there cards. I never really saw management unless I needed something from the office we mainly dealt with the team leaders. All the co workers were pretty friendly and would help me when I would have any questions. The hardest part of the job was getting cart loads of random products back to there places as fast as possible at the end of your shift and not get over time also. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people and just seeing them happy once you helped them.
good,"Was overall not a bad company to work for, at least they did close the store on some holidays unlike a lot of places. It always kept you busy which I really liked because the time goes by so much faster. When we was not busy and had no customers they would allow me to go and work in the apparel clothing departments. I was hired in as temporary. The only thing I did not like is they made you park really far away almost behind the building and had to walk all the way around to the front door even when it was late at night. As far as co workers go most of the cashiers just stood up there and did not do anything and that seems like thats the people they keep. Im a really hard worker and am on time everyday and am willing to learn new things."
good,"Managers micromanage like no other. If you are labelled a warehouse worker, you are stuck and have virtually no way of advancing especially without a college degree. If you do have a college degree, you probably won't advance. In the 14 years that the DC I work for has been open, only 4 warehouse workers have been promoted to Group Leaders and there have been hundreds, if not thousands, of warehouse workers that have had a Bachelor's or higher."
good,"Working at Target is a good place to gain valuable experience in running the daily operations of a store as well as team management and on the spot feedback. The hardest part of this job was the constant addition of job duties and responsibilities, which in turn lead to longer hours worked and less work life balance. Also, in my experience with the company Target does not promote from within, so there's really not a lot of room for advancement."
good,Early Morning Flow/Backroom consist of long work periods and one 30minute lunch. Never make enough hours a week to get and benifits package. Advancement is not based on senority. An education will get you along farther in this company with no retail experience at all.
good,management is unfair treament is very biased. but coworkers are great
good,This job is okay for someone young or someone trying to pick up some extra but thats it. The work day is what you make of it. Management is okay but could be better. The hardest part of the job is dealing with management. They really had unprofessional moments during my tenure there. Co-workers are co-workers point blank period you might have problem you might not. You probably enjoy clocking out the most at the end of the day.
good,It is a nice place to work until you are ill. Then they tend to fire you not matter what!!!
good,"Overnight stocking is not very difficult, you must sort and organize all freight so it can be put out in the store. I work with clothing it's a bit harded because alot of the freight is new, so I must make a place for the clothes."
good,work at target is enjoyable. we unload trucks and push freight to the floor. management changes frequently and because of the economy work is slow and the hours are not there. also no room for advancement. co workers change often also. big turn arounds in all areas of the store. i like the physical part of the job but do not like that the hours are not there anymore. moral has been low because of it.
good,Day began early receiving freight trucks. Had limited time to get stock ready for floor distribution. Co-workers were great to work with daily.
good,It was a great job. I just couldn't really handle night shift hours
good,It was a good place to work. although pay doesnt alway equal your responsibilities. management did not give hours to the people that deserve it.
good,My biggest responsibility at work is on the sales floor where I can assist guests with product and locations. I am learning a lot at Target but I do not feel like this is a career path for me.
good,i like working with different types of people so that didnt bother me but i couldnt get a day off to save my life.
good,very busy place to work. you could easily find your self doing all the work
good,"For a mere three months, I have been working at this store. To say I am satisfied is a very hard thing to say at times because of the amount of hours I am given and the lack of organization of the store since the grand opening."
good,"Manage several work centers, planning, and managing talent."
good,I was not scheduled. Asked manager for my schedule and was told I would receive a call. Never received a call. Was fired for NC/NS. Called and asked about the situation and was told I could not have my job back...
good,"A typical day for the back room team lead is to facilitate the stocking of all merchandise that has arrived from the daily trucks. Processes and steps are devised to help put away product faster and much more organized. The hardest part of the job is sometimes there is so much to put away and if people call out, it just doubles or triples the work load on everyone."
good,I have been employed with Target for 3 years and there have been good and bad times. During my time at Target I have learned to understand people more as well as understanding how to handle issues that may take place during a typical work day.
good,I clock in and check which station I work in the 1st 2nd floor etc. Then check in with my supervisor and log in into a cash register. If there was no customers I would look for go backs(Things people leave behind) Collect carts and help customers.
good,"Target delivers an okay service. Guests either like you or don't like you. I learned four years of my time here, I find the most exciting part of the work is the store attracts a lot of business on weekends."
good,"Straightening product on shelves,adding product from stock room back to shelves.Backroom duties are receiving and stocking retail products in appropriate location trough out the backroom.Very labor intensive job that teaches you to be organized.Management at the time was turned over by corporate.There is a high turn over rate in all aspects of the store.Co workers were great, but a lot left that were great and reliable, due to poor management.The hardest part was never having consistent hours.One day you work nights till close then open the next day.The best part was meeting new people and helping them find what they are looking for"
good,Working with target gave me the oppurtunity to work in a team retail enviornment. Restocking merchandise and keeping up with inventory control showed me the retail side of the industry vs. the warehouse.
good,You learn every aspect of Target's retail
good,Freindly co-workers. I have learned great organizational skills.
good,"Everyday is a typical day at work. Between being over the Jewerly and Cosmetics area the duties are to completed the reshop from overnight, which doing reshopping I would complete the zone. Doing this help me map out what needed to be done for the day work. (reserach, scan out, reshop, planogram) Next I would check out Daily Message, Transtion, and Sales, with work between on the floor and Brand I will map out the day work. Enless major project from the Manager."
good,"I would great customers, cash them out, make sure they had the most convienient shopping experiance."
good,"At the Target in Gilbert, AZ this was a Fun Place to Work. I worked in the bakery. I had one of the best Managers. Your experiences with this company will vary from location to location."
good,The day generally begins with getting the received items from the truck stowed away. Then begins the hourly item pulls for which must be completed within the hour. These run from 11 a.m. until 7 p.m. The occasional voice crackles in over the radio asking for a particular product and with the appropriate item code (or even sometimes not) I go and track it down as fast as possible.
good,"Good place to work, clean enviroment, discounts good, good corporation, good matching program"
good,"Has the potential to be a great company, but working for Target has it's advantages and disadvantages. Positives: (depending on your area or store) you have the chance to work with great people, but the negative is sometimes you can run into to people that feel like because they have a position they are better than you. Target no longer pays like they use to that's the bad part, no overtime. If you are looking for your first job by all means let it be Target rather than Walmart it's a choice you won't regret."
good,"It was constantly busy, but there were still those times where I wish I had more to do so I would not get bored."
good,"There is not much room for advancement, the hours were only good around holidays otherwise just enough for insurance"
good,"Creative, diligent, detail oriented & technically sound professional with over 6 years track record of delivering consistent results, currently spearheading as the Executive Shared Services (Merchandising Team) with Target Corporation India Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, with expertise in product management & development, merchandising, quality assurance, vendor management, customer relationship management in the Manufacturing and BPO industry."
good,"When you apply at Target, just make sure you are really sure about your availability because you can't change it later. They have a lot of rules and some of them don't make sense. Mixed communications. They have a 10-scoring system so you have to work really fast on the cashier line, try to have more G's than R's, you will be confronted when you are in the red. The pay is low and the insurance is high."
good,"An overall great place to work! just wish could have advanced, it was seasonal, but nevertheless the people were awesome and had a little mystery to them. i enjoyed my brief time with this company."
good,"I did enjoy working here, I liked that it was busy most of the time. But the management always put too many tasks on one person, and then became angry when they weren't completed. The store manager was never there, and any time you had an issue to bring up with him, he was never available. I didn't like that it was nearly impossible to advance, and when it came time for raises in the spring, instead of being honest and telling the employees that the didn't have a lot of money to spend on raises, they gave everyone bad reviews so that they didn't have to pay them."
good,I loved my job for the most part and it wasn't necessarily difficult but the higher ups definitely made us do jobs that were theirs. My coworkers were amazing and everyone is excited to help which made my time there enjoyable.
good,"Improvements have been made, but company has invested time and resources mostly to online. Stores reward hard work on occasion but largely use their best employees to compensate for their lesser ones."
good,"Really enjoyed job but, not everyone was treated equally. Looking for a new job with similar pay are nicer management. I feel like I was not treated well here."
good,Workload increasing without adequate help to compensate.  Fellow team members are fine.  The corporate changes are the problem that started about a year to a year and half ago.
good,Great job but lack hours and can hurt when bills are coming. Typical work day varies on season and time period. Slow when no holidays and fruitful when they are holidays.
good,"Don't expect to move up while working here. "
good,"The work is fairly easy as it is just putting product on the shelves. The only real downside is the hours and management. During most of the year you're getting any where between 9-25 hours a week. They recently ""overhauled"" their process on how to get the product out to the floor but it nearly tripled the amount of work and you still need to get it all done in the same amount of time"
good,"Poor management due to everyone wanting to be in a position of authority. Under appreciated workers end up having to do the jobs of others, however flexible hours and pays well."
good,"Customers are nice"
good,"I’ve learned while working at target both physical and ethical strengths that I carry with me every single day. From physically building displays or helping build fixtures and gondolas, to just learning how people act and treat each other."
good,If you're applying at Target don't expect to have regular scheduling. Work hours are all over the place. I would not recommend working at Target at all. I worked at the one in Downtown Portland and it's probably one of the better Target's to work at.
good,Working at Target was a Semi-challenging and rewarding experience. The atmosphere was somewhat laid back and most employees and managers were friendly. The work itself was fast paced and sometimes challenging. Overall what I assume was a typical customer service oriented job working for a big box retailer.
good,"Target is a good job if it's your first or second job. They pay $13 which I think is unfair for all the work they require you to do. Management is bad at times. There's a also a small chance of promoting. If you want to be there for the long run, you'll be there working there for a long time without anything ever changing. Raises we got they would always take away after a couple of months have passed by. I learned a lot, to be independent. To work well with a small group. Communication is taught too, because you need to be able to talk to your team members, leaders, or any guests that may need help."
good,None of the managers ever knew what was going on and they were always leaving early and wouldn't talk to anyone. They would keep telling you to be quicker and to hurry up but none of them actually knew the time that it took to do the work.
good,"Overall the place isn't a bad place to work at especially considering other retail options."
good,"Good work/ life balance, left company due to an opportunity to relocate near family in Pennsylvania. I would recommend Target to operations working professionals."
good,"Target is a good job for those with a strong work ethic and a willingness to succeed.  However, advancement into managerial positions is quite difficult without a college degree.  I learned a lot while I was at target and was able to apply some of those skills to future employment."
good,The average day at work would be very tiring and stressful. I constantly felt anxious and frustrated. Never wanted to go into work. But the coworkers did make it better. The hourly compensation was good.
good,"I've worked for target twice and both times I've had issues with management. They're very cliquey and have their favorites, and if you're not in that group, its kind of awkward and uncomfortable. I always felt like I was being watched and talked about. I cant focus with management breathing down my neck. Also, very hypocritical."
good,It’s a good job for extra money. Positions beyond shift lead only go to college graduates with a Bachelor Degree or above and management tends to be young as they are are generally recruited straight out of college. Hours of work can be erratic and drop dramatically between January and March. Not recommended as an only source of income unless you become management and are given a salary rather than an hourly rate.
good,Their main focus is on customer service. They go out of their way to make sure the customers are satisfied. The process to move up is very detailed and requires quite a bit of training.
good,"I learned a lot about my area and products and enjoyed most everyone I worked with. Part time is as low as 4 hours in a week, so not for someone needing a full time job."
good,"Always meets store standards, works well with others follows directions,completes tasks on time, does more than is asks, good interaction with customers"
good,Teamwork I like everyone was really nice and I loved the environment. The reason I was let go was because they couldn’t work with my schedule which was very disappointing cause I really thought everything was fine but oh well one more experience to take.
good,"people are cool at Target, sorta fast paced during the holiday season, and people get a bit moody but it was fun. I was seasonal, I wanted to work past that once january hit and they let me go the next day."
good,"The people I worked with were overall nice. A few hardly did any work, and I was stuck picking up their slack. Management would back them up, and leave me with their work to finish. Their policies regarding being sick, made no sense to me. If you called in sick, they would write you up. Moreover, they would have me come up to the front to be a cashier when there was a big line. This made no sense as well due to the fact that they had hired many cashiers for season, and they still needed sales associates to cover for them. In addition, the team leaders would mostly instruct the team members to complete tasks, but would hardly help. They would mostly sit in their office all day, or stay on their phones. There was even one incident where a team leader fake fired a coworker of mine.    Lastly, I would say the hardest part about the job would be trying to finish organizing an entire section on your own during a busy day. The most enjoyable part would be the satisfaction of helping customers with choosing outfits. They would leave the store feeling confident and happy with their purchase."
good,I was hired as a seasonal worker. I never received proper training. The managers have no time to help you but I don't blame them for that. They have too much they have to do. The majority of lead workers just ignore you.
good,"6/10 i can really only remember my own personal experience and it was a war between  work and school and they counld't help me, they couldnt find a solution to change my hours so i could go to school so i quit"
good,Target has a good way to help their associates with breaks and meals by forcing you to. Good aspect of taking care of the workers so they aren't over worked unlike most company's I have been with were they will squeeze life out of you for the minimum salary.
good,The management at target isn’t good at all. They make you do a lot of task for such little money. The hours are strange. Never had a full team. Multiple people would always call off
good,It is a grueling place to work at. Very monotone and boring because of the lack of challenge. Also the pay is barely above minimum wage. But the hours are alright.
good,i learned a lot from working here about making displays and working closely with people which is something i had not done much of at my past jobs. it gets really busy so you are always having to fill the floor if you work as a general merchandiser and expect them to drag you to other departments
good,I love the people I work with but I was promised 30 hours a week and now I'm barley getting more than 10. Fast working pace but the management is decent.
good,"Pros"
good,"Anyone could be called on to help at the registers at a moment's notice.  When lots of customers are in the store, this can happen frequently throughout the day.  I learned how to arrange merchandise to best attract buyers.  I also learned that customers have little respect for the cashiers.  The store cares about making sure the customers are happy, both with purchases and with the way the employees treat them.  The hardest part of the job was being treated like an idiot just because I was behind the register.  The best part of the job was when they left me to just stock shelves, with little need to assist on registers."
good,"Usually you do the same thing depending on your department. You learn about merchandising and sales. Management in my opinion is not the best and can improve a lot. The hardest part is dealing with management, most enjoyable part is helping guests."
good,"The workers made the job what it actually was, management was unorganized at times, no steady formality then they wondered why some things were done wrong in the work area and no steady leaders do to fires"
good,Having worked there for the holiday season it was very busy in my area. I ended up being the only one there due to people leaving almost regularly. As the month passed and the days got slower it was apparently time for me to go go even though I had put in a lot of work on very early hours. They said they didnt have the hours. But despite my hard work and many others there were plenty that seemed to have been kept that could care less about the job. Pay was good though.
good,"For the time I worked there, advancement is very scarce. Management talks a big game of being there but are never around. I worked in the guest/ customer service before, and wanted to change to a different area. It took over 5 months to get some other shifts not related to cashiering and guest service. Overall if you can deal with stubborn customers who think their right but aren't, but you're willing to put up with that then by all means go for it. But be ready to be stuck in that cause you're ""good"" at it."
good,"I really liked the team that I worked with. They were super friendly and helpful when I needed assistance. However, as an employee, there was a lot of expectation to meet deadlines in a short time span."
good,"Poor management, however, the job was high paced and kept you busy so the shifts went by fast. Job was a very independent job, you have you list and get the objects needed for that list."
good,"Hours can be cut at random depending on the season. Management isn't the best, but most jobs are simple and pay is good. Can sometimes get impossible task that you have no choice but to power through. Plus most locations in the store besides cashiers, DO NOT TRAIN YOU PROPERLY!"
good,Target was one of my first jobs  And with that it wasn’t even our job that required me to do nothing more than to scan product and take payment quickly.
good,"The training was pretty straight forward. They threw you on the floor to shadow someone else and they would guide you. Leadership was hit and miss. Some managers were kind, others seemed to wanna throw you under the bus or were living on a power high."
good,I loved it once I got the hang of things & got rolling it was a walk in the park from there. The team is caring & will never disappoint you always going to keep a smile o  your face
good,"Guests are number one."
good,Target was a nice place to work for the first year but it felt like they were overstaffed as i would always see different/new people working when i would come in which slowly cut down to one shift every week or two.
good,unless you have a collage degree do not expect to become a manager and expect to only work part time. Target is great if you are looking for something part time or in school as they will work around your schedule
good,"Everything with my experience with Target was okay, but the only downsize that Management could not care less about you rather you did a lot or a little. Management did not know how to address a lot of problems that would occur in the business and expected the workers to figure things out on their own."
good,There have been many new changes that have made it a negative work environment on 95% of the employees. Most of which makes the customers very unhappy because the customers can not shop around all the freight on the floor that the employees have to work. To many causes for accidents with customers and employees to happen
good,At first Target was great but after working there a few years I felt as though upper management had no idea what was really happening in the stores. They would send down things and expect us to do them not knowing what was really going on in the stores. Sometimes this made the expectations a little extreme. I personally was held accountable for something that happened when I was on vacation for a week. Overall ok but I will not be going back.
good,"Team is fun, hours are long - expected to play many roles within the store if in a management position. It's retail at the end of the day. "
good,"I liked the company when I started working there. However, a lot of issues are being had with the modernization plan. Experienced severe hour cuts, toxic work environment"
good,Working for Target is nice for those looking to build upon social skills and general retail knowledge and for those in the High School / college working demographic . Would NOT recommend as a Career option in the long term however.
good,"Working at target had been a great experience so far. It is my first ever “real” job, I have learned many different skills including social and work skills, as well as improved my work ethic."
good,Target was very busy so maybe that's why management didnt pay much attention to employees. The customers were often in a rush and/or full of complaints such as the overall set up and placement of the store. It was not full of smiles & it usually seemed like a high stressed atmosphere.
good,"I worked at my Target for several years. My honest review: "
good,Target is a company that work 12 hour shifts with a 30 min break and a 20 min break. Its a easy job but not a easy job due to your running back and fourth from one end of the mod all day. And you have to make quota so your body be tired. You only work three days out the week 36 hours a week
good,Working in softlines it was often under staffed. A great job for people who like fashion and clothes. You work longer hours and corporate management is okay.
good,"At first, I was excited being that it was my first cashier job. But as time went on, you begin to notice how unprofessional and unorganized they were, especially when it came to hiring. My first year, around Christmas time it was peak so everyone received a schedule with more hours than usual, but the following year, they over-hired by almost 100 employees!! This caused everyone’s hours to drop, leaving most of us to fight for hours, especially since we were averaging a day per week. Overall, I’m not really liking this job anymore. And to anyone looking to work here...good luck."
good,It was an high rate experience. Management is flexible. Co-workers are pleasant to work with. Help is always near if you have any questions or need help assisting guest. New and easier ways for guest to check out.
good,Over worked and under paid. Team was amazing but target is a slave ship. Micro Managers who walk around dictating over walkie talkies. Or they stay in their offices.
good,"I loved working at Target.  It was always busy and never boring.  Flex fulfillment was like going on an all day treasure hunt every day.  Since your primary goal is to provide an excellent guest experience you are always praised for taking the time to meet a guests needs even if that means you are behind in your personal daily goals.  I enjoyed the pressure of our daily goals, however I never felt as if there was crushing disappointment if you didn't manage to meet them.  In my department especially our daily goals were intense but I loved the challenge.  I did however feel as if our compensation for our expected achievement was incredibly low.  If i had been better compensated I would have stayed.  I still visit my ex-coworkers.  I loved the people I worked with, they were hands down some of the most wonderful people I have ever had the privilege of working with."
good,It was a great first job. I enjoy the fast pace environment. I work as a stocker so I really enjoyed to quiet during the early hours. I would definitely recommend working here.
good,"I worked at Target for about seven and a half years.  I started in the grocery department and did the occasional cashiering shift.  Most of the time I was working at target I was also going to college, so I had to take a leave of absence during every semester.  They were always good at being flexible with my school schedule and letting me come back during the summer."
good,"Mornings are busier than Nights"
good,"My shift started at 0400 - if you don't mind working that early in the morning, and unloading trucks, it's OK.  You will be doing that all day.  Lots of turnover.  Some team leaders were not that great.  They replaced my manager about a month into the job, and the store suffered by his leaving."
good,"-Less productivity and efficiency"
good,"While the pay is good, and some managers from some areas are very friendly, i belive that their hourly employees need to be treated to more humane standards that way people wont be quitting on the spot atleast twice per month."
good,"I enjoyed my time at Target. However, the hours were sparse and the room for growth was minimal. There always seemed to be difficulty when trying to contact someone over the phone."
good,"very big store to work at speaking for myself I worked at a Super Target, even more space. driven sales goals, great discounts but not very flexiable when it comes to scheduling"
good,Target was my first and only job so there isn't really anything else that I can compare it to. Though for the time I was there it was a pretty good job experience. It taught me alot about working and life.
good,You don’t get that many hours. Target would prefer to have 10 people working 16 hours week then to have 5 people working full time. They continue to hire people so less hours every month. And they will not let you cross train in other department for hours they will just hire someone else. The pay is minimum. You don’t get benefits because thats for full time people only and only mangers are full time
good,I left due to poor upper leadership Target does a lot of things right but they definitely don’t have the best upper level leadership running their Groups or Regions
good,"The thing about target is that you are working with multiple managers. There is an HR manager, There is the store manager, there is department managers that are called team leads and although you may be assigned to a department, you may not Get your department team lead that day. Managers work on floor with you, district managers pop in too. So be prepared to do a lot of impressing. Also there is a Whole lot of drama in these stores. They will give you a lot of hours seasonally, however you have to impress them enough To be able to stay. I’ve heard that throughout the non-seasonal hours you get just about 10 to 15 hours. It has become increasingly difficult since they have raised the wage. My advice to you is good luck. Seniority does a lot in this job."
good,A typical day for me was managing a team to raise sales.  Everything revolved around sales and payroll.  Work/life balance was very hard with working all holidays and most weekends.  Taking vacation or personal time was next to impossible due to never having anyone to replace you.  They did pay fairly well and had great benefits.
good,"I learned how to effectively communicate with guest, and provide exceptional customer service. The best part of the job was being able to assist people with their needs and questions about various items in the store."
good,Target is a retail company focused on customer service and sales. It offers hourly and salaried positions. Great company for individuals looking to grow with a company.
good,"When I was hired at Target, I let them know I could only close 1-2 times a week. Most of my shifts were closing shifts. It wasn't unusual to close one night and open the store the next morning. I was frequently assigned to  self-checks which didn't have comfortable flooring for long periods of standing. It was more comfortable for me to stand at the regular registers and check out guests from there. Thankfully, one of my wonderful co-workers preferred to work the self-checks, and whenever we worked together he was happy to switch with me. I was also frequently assigned to bringing in the carts. One time it down poured while I was in the middle of getting carts. I had a rain coat on, but my pants still got soaked. One of my fantastic co-workers insisted on buying me a pair of pants so I could be dry again. I told her she didn't have to, but after she insisted I let her know how grateful and appreciative I was for her generosity. She said she was surprised Target wasn't offering me dry pants to wear after I was caught in the rain, getting carts for them. In the last month or so that I was there, my weekly hours were drastically decreasing. I went from 24 hours one week to 18, then I was offered 13 hours."
good,Since it was only seasonal I was only there for a short period of time but it was great. It got very stressful on christmas time but nothing no one cant handle. The other employees were kind and helpful.
good,"When I first started I felt passionate about working there but as the year went by I slowly began to lose my energy for the place, I feel like I could do better."
good,"Good compensation and benefit packages, however the work life balance is almost nonexistent. Impossible for a single parent with no support system to work 12 hour days and rotating weekends."
good,The job started of well but as the turnover happened with management. Culture shifted iimensely and the workers felt it. I loved my employees very much. They worked very hard but my bosses made things much harder to hit productivity goals by not valuing the workers.
good,"They hired me part time a few months before the holidays. I picked up tons of shifts when the holidays hit, and really worked for my pay. The job overall wasn’t very hard just fast paced. As soon as the holidays were over, they only scheduled me one or two days a week. After that it wasn’t worth working there anymore."
good,"Target may give you benefits but the productivity numbers arnt worth the stress. OM (managers) will applaued your work with a ""but.."" followed right after. Production is very important but the stress and strain your put through isnt worth it. It has great pay if your able to have a robot mindset. Having friends or family work with you makes it easier but as soon as they leave or get fired its not worth it anymore.  Dont forget the 5-700 charge on your insurance if you're any kind of smoker."
good,"Good place for those trying to have a part-time job while studying. The management can be difficult, but overall the pay made up for it most times. I recommend giving it a shot."
good,"I am a current team member who was placed in the mentoring program to become a team lead. I've tried several times to get out of it but every time I'm blown off. I'm over-worked and tired all for the pay of the minimum like everyone else. I do a lot more work than the other team members as I am being groomed to become a lead. They have me running around constantly making decisions where I feel like I shouldn't be doing because at the end of the day I am a TEAM MEMBER. They will work you till the bone until you have nothing less. I have a certain schedule I have to follow even though I am in college. I am told I cannot take these certain days off so leaders have the luxury to get that day off. The only good thing is I work primarily days, I get benefits and I get hours. It doesn't matter if the other team members don't to their job or stand around because Target is too forgivable. Don't do it to yourself."
good,Overall Target is a good place to work. The team members are nice. Easy to build rapport with regular guests. I enjoyed making sure each and every guest had a great experience. Went above and beyond to solve guest issues.
good,"Target is a fine place to work if it's your only priority.  If you need any flexibility, don't expect HR to be understanding for a second.  The expectations from management always felt impossible for the limited staffing."
good,Target was one of my jobs that I've done. It wasn't very hectic but it was pretty tough. Balancing school and work isn't so easy. But I somehow did it. I started to work at target in the summer because I wanted a summer job. I quit because college was starting and I wanted to focus only on my education.
good,"Starting at job was fun, was getting enough hrs for part time but as time progressed, hours have been cut, would rather keep my lesser pay and get more hours in order to survive todays economy."
good,A typical day includes greeting and and ensuring the guests are attended to and provided with quality service.There is general comrade between team members and leaders. The most enjoyable part is having a satisfied guest and meeting your given target. Things can become difficult whenever there is a breakdown in communication.
good,"Great pay, but with mental breakdowns. Specifically, the Target in Traverse City had poor management and poor communication. They see their employees as props that can be replaced and not as people."
good,"It was fine the work was average. The management there was pretty bad. For a good amount of time, we didn't have a manager, so we had to swap many managers out for other people"
good,"I personally can’t work there, but others would be fine. They need more people to be stable in hardlines. The management is absolutely fine, all they need is to worry about hardlines."
good,pay not compatible with cost of living. Theirs to many chiefs not enough followers (everyone wants to be the boss). They have their brown noise people already. Its best to be yourself and do your job.
good,"Procedures in the past year have changed at least 4 times. There is a task list for every work area and certain time goals for various items on the list. So you are constantly having to adjust , time goals with procedures."
good,Typical day consists of delegating out task to achieve the daily goals. Assessing what work load will be higher priority over another. Follow up with team about efficiency and urgency.
good,"The whole place has a slow pace movement buy you had to pick up with your duties if management added more on you. You have to go in ready to work and a break sheet to know when you can take you breaks and you meal break. However, meal breaks are off-hours."
good,"Working at target was exciting depending on who the cashier manager was that particular day. I typically loved when it was busy because, I was able to meet a lot of genuine and friendly customers. The hardest part of the job was standing in one place for 7 hours, Working at Target taught me how to become a great multitasking cashier."
good,overall it was a good place to work pay was good and most of the other employees were good at teamwork i would recommend this job to future employees and my friends
good,"I was hired on the spot during the holiday season.  I was seasonal but they ended up keeping me. My coworkers were great, my managers were ok. Some managers are cool others are blahhh lol. Customers are going to be customers lol. But I really enjoyed working there, employee discount was okay as well. I loved the cartwheel target app"
good,I don’t think I get paired enough for where I live and never got to a high paid position in this company even though I worked there for years they don’t give much hours which makes it harder to enjoy working there full time
good,I was a cashier so i met with different people throughout the day. I enjoyed meeting the new people each one with a story different from the next. I seen how people acted during times of the day. I enjoyed making the guest happy and giving the kids stickers to make there day.
good,Had some issues with miscommunication. Needs better assessment of managers and employee communication. A lot of at work drama that was left unresolved numerous times without any manager to clear it.
good,I love my job itself and like the regular employees that worked with but when it comes to supervisors and managers they just treat you like a robot. Like everyone is miserable working there because of just a few people in management. I really miss it the job itself but I couldn't deal with the supervisor and management issues. If that changed then it would be awesome 100% job!
good,target light weight sucks they don't really care about their employees the people you meet there are niced but the managers are all so preppy and only care about the money it is a weird enviornmnet
good,"What I hated most about target is strict they’ve become. And trainees suck, you’ll get in trouble later for doing something that you didn’t even know you were doing wrong. It’s truly sad when you are one the hard working employees and is wrote up for but the mangers don’t say anything to lazy non working employees. They are very understaff most of the time because of this continuous cycle."
good,"The management were really bad at delegating roles, they typically had favoritism to some of the workers they were friends with and if they did have something against you they pretty much would show it with how they treat you"
good,Didn't like that it was only seasonal. Would have love for it to be a permanent job. Managers were all very nice. The register was easy to learn. Would apply again
good,"Prepare for a little less traditional interview. Target would like to know about experiences and how you overcome situations, rather than focus solely on past employment recommendations."
good,"The company meant well. I got paid well, benefits were great. Just the overall culture at my target wasn’t good. If there were issues in a department managers would just put a bandaid on it instead of fixing it. Plus managers would gossip about employees which I had a huge problem with since it’s very unprofessional"
good,"It was a good company to work for to get great retail experience!"
good,"The first year I worked at Target was awesome and so were all the coworkers. Throughout the last year, management went through many changes that got to be very confusing regarding who wrote our schedules or who we answered to. They continuously added on rules and extra cleaning tasks on top of training new baristas. All that piled up got to be very stressful and they expected too much of us. We always seemed to be short-staffed. Overall my experience with Target was decent but it could have been better."
good,"They barely give you hours & if they do, they’ll take them away. Also, they don’t communicate that much to you. "
good,A good starter job for a young adult.   Management was always flexible when it came to school and family functions.  Learning customer service skills was important.
good,"Like alot of places, management is what can make or break the work experience. over the three years i spent at target, I got promoted three times, through hard work and determination. The main issue is that alot of managers do not seem to care as much as they need to. 90% of the issues that i encountered could have been prevented if managers just did their job by holding others accountable and knowing when they need to step in. There was a wish-wash of accountability, and there was alot of favoritism. Day to day changed, because in retail your job isnt the same everyday. I learned alot by what i encountered and my own drive to learn more. I was mostly self taught, due to training being a huge opportunity at target."
good,Co workers are friendly and helpful. Upper management will give you a sense that you are inadequate and inferior. They work you to the bone but pay excellent. Dont expect to get more than 15 hours a week. Plus side tours get an employee discount!
good,"while working at target was busy and quite fast paced, it was also kind of boring because it felt extremely repetitive and your work was mostly independent rather than with your coworking team."
good,There are have been several changes in last few months in supervisor and management somewhat difficult to adapt to. When first hired felt like a team player with good support system. Unfortunately now going to job not so confident this is going to happen.
good,"A lot of different jobs to do in each department. Fast pace, multi tasking, lots of bending, team work and knowledge of product. Need to have good customer service. Must be ready to back up on the registers."
good,It is like any other retail job but hours are different every week. The pay is good as long as you get a good amount if hours. Needs improvement in management.
good,It's a very fast pace work environment to work in which I think is not worth the pay. You must be flexible and willing to train just about anywhere in the store. The hardest part was keeping up with task while always making sure guest were happy. It is very easy to move up in the company. The team leads seem to get away with more than a regular employee would. You almost never get a pay raise and if you do its just a few cents or the minimum wage going up. I worked here 5 years and got the same amount the new workers were receiving.
good,Working at target was for the most part fun and exciting. I found working for target to be a learning experience because there was always room to learn more.
good,It was an ok work place. The team members were awesome.  Some days were better than others. The hours weren't always good. Management was a hit and miss.
good,"I was the entertainment brand specialist, meaning that I was the person that covered the music, movies, and book section. Every Tuesday was new release day, which meant that the whole section shifted around. While having to take care of the entertainment area, I was also expected to cover the electronics and toys section. This wouldn't have been a big issues, but often times I would be the only person to cover these sections until the midday shift came in, which caused some delays in getting my primary duties fulfilled. To top it off, I was also expected to take care of any reshop baskets, which again interfered with my primary duties. It wouldn't have been so bad if the management would have simply acknowledged how much work there was and how 1 person couldn't handle it all."
good,I would like target better if they paid more because they make us do a lot of work for minimum wage. They try not to give a lot of hours to everyone but they could really use the people.
good,"For a retail job it wasn't horrible. I had most of my problems with the management structure and that they hardly ever promoted from within, always hired new team leads and such from outside. They were also not very understanding when it came to the limitations that certain disabilities can cause and thus made life hard. My coworkers were lovely for the most part and the pay wasn't bad. Honestly wouldn't go back, but it wasn't the worst job I've had."
good,"Was a great place to work when it was Target pharmacy. Always has enough hours for staff and great compensation. Then, they were bought out by CVS and it became like working at every other CVS where money is the bottom line and hours were cut"
good,"A good place to work as far as general culture. It's not an easy job, but the team is collaborative and friendly."
good,"Enjoyed working with the people in my department. Management was good for the most part and they were understanding with regard to personal issues. During summer, hours are cut and that was hard to deal with getting less pay. Overall it is a nice place to work"
good,"The only way to last in this job is by having diligence. Requires full awareness of time and organization. Managers' expectations are high, but are willing to compromise if they have to."
good,I worked part time as a seasonal employee.  I liked the atmosphere and working with our customers. I stocked the shelves and took any excess back to the stock room and keyed it in as such.
good,Nice environment lots of people to meet that are nice and welcoming. Love the job itself I enjoy what I do. Flexible scheduling the only thing is that they are short on hours to give all the time.
good,"If you need a little money coming in and want a physical job, work here. Early mornings for stocking and afternoons for inventory.  Must have degree for management job. Target always needs cashiers."
good,"Coworkers are amazing, environment is great, and the pay is good but management has proven time and time again that there is a lack of communication being passed through the chain of command. Expectations are set extremely high although attainable at times, most are not always met. I personally feel Target only has the stores best interest in mind and not it's employees who help play a major roll in keeping the store together."
good,The work is fairly easy to learn at target but the work culture wasn’t the best. Managers were immature and made it known you were very replaceable. There wasn’t any form of security. They constantly let people working there for years go just to hire a new wave of people.
good,It is an ok place to work. The manager need to be nicer. It does have a life work balance. The job is pretty simple at first then it get to be too much for someone the paid.
good,"It is a great place to work but you do have to work a lot of long hours, sometimes it is short-staffed so you have to do a lot of team playing. I am glad the pay went up as well."
good,"My work day consists of arriving at teh store prior to the open & gathering the appropriate devices to supply to specific front end team members, getting the allocated cash & filling the registers for each department. After the store opens & employees arrive, I review the day's tasks & assigned break times, then I go into the ""cash office"" & complete the previous sales day's deposit & allocate funds for the next account day. Once finished I am responsible for ringing up guests purchases, taking payments on their account, completing online orders, processing ship to store orders, communicating with other departments to assist guest efficiently, & providing addition cash/change to registers when requested. Through a typical day, problem solving skills, time management, & multi tasking are utilized greatly."
good,Depends on you and what you are there for and personality also depends on the hours that are given really nice people who work there lot of volunteer work to do with the company
good,"Target is a decent place to work for. They're progressive and friendly to different lifestyles. They pay fairly competitively compared to other places. But, as is typical, they do their very best to never, ever have anyone work full time to avoid having to pay benefits, and they only provide overtime very, very, very sparingly. The location I was at is now closed, sadly, but the management team was pretty decent, and the team itself was quite nice. Things have changed since I've worked there, but I don't consider Target as a bad place to work."
good,It seems like what you do at Target is very repetitive and doesn't allow any growth to train in any other departments. When you are put in a new department training is very quick and not taught with the best abilities.
good,It can be a fun place to work but in stores most managers have little experience when they begin.  Be prepared to help your managers understand how to effectively lead teams.
good,The people in my department were awesome to work with but people were really gossipy. If someone heard something happened to you they would run it through the whole store and everyone would make fun of you. And management was really strict with everything especially RED cards.
good,Target is okay to work for but I'm looking for a full-time job and they can not giving me that and cannot even give me 25 to 30 a week so I have to move on for me. But overall a good company to work if you or in school looking for part-time job.
good,"Good coworkers."
good,"Employees paid unfairly. I did not receive a fair raise after my first year of working there. I got a review from a Lead who marked me as an “average” worker. I worked Cart Attendant; being least supervised, I felt underestimated and I was not valued for the work I put in to satisfy the visit of any/every Target guest."
good,During my time at Target the store went theough a major change in store managers. The turnover rate is very high. Managers did not communicate well under pressure. The work load on employees were sometimes unrealistic.
good,".First job"
good,"Worked here for many years. The only reason i’ve always stayed was because i fell in love with all my co workers, everyone was like family. They hardly if EVER promote within, very stressful workplace and the workload is way beyond the pay"
good,"My main problem was I was given a task and then pulled away from it to do re-shop, which made me fall behind on my task, then I was asked why I hadn't completed said task ""timely enough""."
good,"The Target I worked for was quite varied in the personalities that worked there and people who came through, I learned a fair amount. Towards the end of my time there I was not surprised to see how different and stressful things were considering no one had stayed there very long."
good,The Store that I was at was in need of some new management. The pay is more than fair. What is expected of you is average. Breaks are nice. Discount is weak.
good,Good first job and gets you on the right track for retail. Has many opportunities to lean new positions and shifts vary to accommodate school schedules.
good,"A typical day at work is happy and upbeat. Everyone smiles, everyone is helpful and every employee makes rounds thruout the store to welcome the guests and help them find whatever they need. Everyone is helpful if a section asks for help every section falls in to help...need cashiers everyone not helping a customer opens registers to get the lines down. Its a great place to work. The only problem is getting more hours, its like pulling teeth to get work hours."
good,"Clock in, stretch with the team, unload truck, pallet items, shelve items. Learned to stretch before working. Store wouldn't run without this team. Hardest part was the hours as it was overnight. Most enjoyable part was that I stayed so busy that the shift felt like half the time."
good,"If you want to be micromanaged, this is the place for you. It was fun working here when I first started, but since I have a new department head who doesn't know what they're doing, it's gotten annoying."
good,"Target was a great experience to work at , professional . Push you to accumulate RedCard savings to customers & want you to provide best possible customer service ."
good,"An ok place to work overall"
good,The job itself was fine but often other coworkers would end up walking around the store not doing anything so the workload would be passed on to other people. Management didn’t really seem to care to do anything about it.
good,The service at Target is customer focused but only to an extent. If your helping a customer too long your supposed to call for help even if your knowledgeable in the product.
good,"It was a good company to work for. Everyone was very nice and worked hard together, they take scheduling and missing days very serious. That was the reason I was let go"
good,"Check and respond to all emails, messages etc.  follow up with my team on all assigned tasks and confirm workload for the day.  It's an environment that focuses on providing the best possible experience for the guest in all aspects from scheduling, to interactions, promotional offers and so on."
good,"Plan your day for meeting after meeting, only to followup on emails in the evenings. I was fortunate to have grown up in Target  and have had many opportunities to work on amazing work. The culture is who know who, plan to have many GTKY Coffee."
good,"Target provides good pay and benefits for team members. However, there is limited career advancement, at least in the warehouse I work at. There is poor communication between departments and between the team itself."
good,"The job pays well, but the people who are in management positions take the job way to seriously to make the position enjoyable. There are nice people that work there, but I have had tons of scheduling issues."
good,The hours are not guaranteed especially closer to the holidays. During November to December you will start to notice hours being drastically cut. I had a great manager who always fought for a decent amount of hours but I wouldn't suggest anyone to try to feed their families off of this company.
good,"I was with target for fifteen years and I watched it change quite a bit. It's a great place to work if you need a part-time job, or if you're just starting out, but it's difficult to get enough hours to maintain a family. Ultimately, I left because of a bad manager, but I enjoyed my time there overall."
good,"A good place to work while completing your degree. You do need to be available on weekends and it will cut in to your studying time. Management is pretty reasonable about the daily workload, but certain policies seem hypocritical at times and at odds with other policies (we're all about guest service, but won't ensure we are adequately staffed to meet guest demand). They will train you to make sure you know how to do your job, but good luck finding functional equipment to fulfill said job (the handheld device is a nightmare to use because of poor quality assurance). Coworkers tend to be friendly, and there is a real sense of teamwork and community. After a year, Target will match what you put in to a 401k up to 5%, but other benefits are non-existent until you become a Team Lead, even if you work 40 hours a week. The hourly pay diminishes over time, as your yearly review will always be right before minimum wage is increased, enjoy that 2% pay increase for a month and then not get comped when minimum wage goes up."
good,"I typically am quite busy when at work, whether it's training or working on a new task. I've learned a lot about retail and enjoy the environment in which I work. The only downfall is the lack of communication between the managers, but they are working toward fixing it. The team is all very nice except for a few rumors here and there. I love the feedback I receive when I go above and beyond but wish I was better compensated for the extra effort and work that I put in. I love my managers and feel that I can go to them or my HR with any issues and be completely honest and candor and that the issues will be dealt with. Overall, I really enjoy working here and would love to work my way toward becoming a leader myself."
good,"It’s a temporary job for a person looking for something temporary or part time."
good,"Came here as my first job, didn’t know much but the co workers around me were very helpful, management was not always the best and there wasn’t really any room for advancement"
good,Not a bad place just hate the hours and wish that my management experience was recognized. And need better pay. Leader staff are friendly and customers are nice.
good,Not the worst job but definitely stressful. Management could be better and so could the hours and pay. Overall not bad but wouldn’t want to stay there forever
good,"It was okay, the job is pretty boring so you have to stay busy or  you will lose your mind. They train you for cashier so that's nice because you can go do cashier when things pick up and that keeps you pretty busy. My management was rough at my location, I needed to change my availability for school and the manger on duty said no and told me to put in my two week notice so there's that."
good,"I wouldn't recommend staying here or trying to move up because that gets messy and management is not the best. However, for a part time job if you have school or anything like that, Target isn't the worst place to stay. Hours can be an issue, sometimes only getting one or two shifts a week. During seasonal times they do mass hiring so the hours get spread out; I can't say they get much better than 3-4 days a week."
good,"We would clock in, meet with our team lead who would give us assignments such as restocking the salesfloor, cleaning up the aisles, or helping the front as a cashier"
good,"Working at Target is good for anyone who is competitive in the work field and doesn't require much down time. It's very fast faced on the sales floor and you are expected to do whatever is needed, so flexibility is a must."
good,"The managers do not lead by example and most would.  They micromanage the hard workers like myself, and leave the non-workers alone.  Management will give you direction, and then it changes the next day."
good,Fast pace environment. Where organization and productive is encouraged. Training is highly important and other team members are supportive and helpful
good,I was a cart attendant at target for a little longer than half a year the pay is minimum wage which is not enough in my opinion for all the things I used to do the work environment is stressful and you are called on every 15 minutes to go do stuff inside the store they expect you To do alot like maintain the restrooms clean the front of the store take go backs to the back of the store to wrap up and help cashier and also help guests its hard to maintain and keep up and do everything they ask of you especially if your backed up on carts they don't care if your backed up on carts or not there's people in guest service who do literally nothing all day but watch you work hard and no one offers to helps you even if they see you struggling to keep up they don't care if your late for lunch or late for your break and on some nights when the target truck would come to restock the store you would have to do all of the above plus bring out cages and carts on certain aisles and it's almost impossible to do I almost always stayed 15 to 30 minutes after my shift was supposed to end just to complete all of my tasks I finally had enough and left if your looking for a job at target don't apply for cart attendant
good,"i hate it a lot "
good,"The job was most fun when going into the back to pull stuff to the floor.  The job was least fun when having to push target rewards card, especially since being a cashier wasn't the main part of my job."
good,There were too many management changes while I was there. Hours always got cut because they would hire too many people and have to give them hours especially around the holidays.
good,busy and slow times. Management not always fair.  Constantly hiring and therefore unable to get full time hours no matter what your availability. Hired as full time employee yet never given 40 hours.
good,Management does not care about the individual workers. The best is the other employees who are all treated not so well. Always say they have hours but never give them out.
good,I wish they took care of their employees. They’ve now added on at least triple the work and think a tiny raise will “compensate” I’m sorry but a two dollar raise won’t get me to do the work of three people.  Their  Ultimately just trying to fire two people and keep one with a two dollar raise.
good,"In my time spent with Target, I picked up many valuable retail and sales management skills. My team was close, and we enjoyed working together. The thing that made Target lose its appeal for me was my team manager, who was always stressed and yelling at her team members. We were under constant stress and pressure to make her satisfied, and nothing ever seemed to be quite enough for her. I worked at a training store, which meant higher-ups were always visiting and we always had to be ready to deal with them. Certainly, all Target stores aren't training stores, nor are they managed by individuals as demanding as the ones at my location, so I encourage you to apply and try Target out for yourselves. I highly enjoyed the team member culture but was frustrated and unhappy with the way I was being treated."
good,"Productive, fast paced work place.  Always changing ways of doing things.  Trying to use less employees to do more work in a lesser time frame. They do a terrible job communicating between themselves and with their employees."
good,"I have worked at Target for over 2 years and there has never been a time period where things were stable for more than 3 months. Constantly my managers were changed and everyone had to get accustomed to a new boss and new rules. We were left unmanaged for most of my time being there and it becomes stressful for my coworkers and myself as we had to attempt to manage ourselves. Our weekly schedule was never reviewed correctly or any attempt to take time off was never looked at and rarely accepted. Majority of my shifts there's only two people working at time which is understaffed and makes my job harder for me. Whenever we are understaffed, our customers complain about the rate of our service which we can't do anything about. The only thing that keeps me working back there are my hard working coworkers."
good,"I’ve seen supervisors call guests “the b word”, treat the guests however they felt, and did not maintain professionalism in the workplace. Although guests may be difficult at times, it is important that supervisors know how to handle most situations professionally. Certain supervisors such as above mentioned tend to be rude to team members as well."
good,"Management treats you like scum of the earth. You may be doing exactly what they want, but they will turn on you and treat you wrong for doing so.Teamwork is Key"
good,It was a great place to work I was there for ten years but needed more hours of work. Managers aren’t really nice to their employees but I’m sure the culture has changed since I was there
good,Target is a good place to work. However the management of target is not the best. They really only care about whatever works for them rather than caring about the employees.
good,"Overall, working here is pretty alright. The team is fun and friendly and management is pretty cool. The workload isn't anything more than what you'd expect at any other retailer. The store is currently going through a lot of changes, both cosmetically and internally with a new store operations model that is currently being rolled out. Morale is not the greatest at the current moment, but with all the massive changes the store is currently experiencing, low morale and turnover is to be expected."
good,"I was a cashier so I was restricted to a small amount of area to roam around. Most of the time I was bored because most tasks were taken care of, yet I would get in trouble for not doing anything. Cashiers were always pressured to sell the Target Credit Card which seemed so greedy. It was only a temporary job so I don't have any actual complaints it was just average."
good,I can’t really make a living off of target due to the fact that it doesn’t give out enough hours and you are not able to go past 40 hours and it isn’t the ideal job I’d want.
good,At the beginning there was low pressure and a lot of supportive learning but they quickly allow you to work on your own. They trust you are capable of completing tasks and respect the team members in that manor. Occasionally the tasks they expect are unrealistic but it never effects over performance.
good,"My job at Target was only meant to be temporary. Though the amount I was rather generous, the pace of the job was stranious. It was only really fast pace during holiday landmarks other times it was rather lacking and made it difficult to look forward to"
good,"I consider myself to be a hard worker. I enjoy majority of my team but I feel like the rest see this job as a paycheck. I understand some people are just passing through but for some people, this is the only job they can do. Half my team strives to maintain the store but the other half of my team don't seem to care and we come in the next day doing double the work. My LODs are pretty chill right now and I feel like I have a good relationship with them. I think if you build a relationship with your LODs, they will have your back. Same goes for the leads and the AP team. Unfortunately, Target was a very team oriented store but now it seems like each part of the store is breaking up to the point where each person takes on the role of multiple positions that needs to be crammed into a single shift."
good,work life balance is something they talk about but don't actually embrace the concept.  Work is life and anyone who is trying to find balance will be considered less than on the team.
good,It was highly stressful. I constantly felt like I didn’t belong. There are some WONDERFUL people who work there but the negative outweighs the positive.
good,"In the beginning we had more people to work with and the job was very manageable. Unfortunately as the years passed so did the amount of workers, resulting in workers being stretched too thin and less tasks being completed. This has also resulted in a large turnover rate, every single manager I've had has either quit or relocated, except a couple . Fortunately the pay is gradually going up, but as a result we have shorter work days, somewhat deleting the point of it all."
good,"Fast paced, stressful environment.  Training is sufficient for tasks assigned,  Management styles varied among multiple levels.  Which can lead to a chaotic workplace culture. The best part of the day is helping the guests, and working with some great team members."
good,"Employees were often prevented from seeking placement in other Target divisions. (i.e., from store to distribution center) Applications were held and employees were denied transfer opportunities.  Promotion opportunities were not often offered to in-house employees. Very few employees were given enough hours to qualify to receive health benefits. Employees who were well-liked were given more hours, whether they wanted the hours or not."
good,The community is wonderful. The target team is comprised of hardworking people that are easy to talk to. The worst thing about working at my target is how hard it is to get fired. Some coworkers call out weekly and face very little consequences.
good,"For the almost three years working there my managers would tell me that if we need help to ask and they would give you help, they never really did, the women in my department were petty and would talk about each other behind people's backs, the managers including the store manager would talk about other team members in a public area like the breakroom. It was stressful and they put a lot of work on you that you had to complete before you would leave."
good,"If you aren't willing to be on your feet for 8-12 hours a shift then this is not the gig for you! Co-Workers are fun and energetic, if you are a person who loves to move constantly and keep yourself challenged to improve every day than this is for you!"
good,Target is a retail store and so there are a lot of things that could use some attention. For instance the management staff needs to be re-trained. I think before you hired people thee needs to be an extensive background check on some of the management staff that they hire.
good,"Great job to start you off, but very poor management. HR members will not help. It becomes a job where everybody comes in only for the check to survive."
good,"The job paid really well but when it comes to scheduling or co-workers, the place was a mess. People would call in all the time and I would end up working 30 hour weeks when my max hours per week was only 20. Very stressful to deal with that while being a full-time college student."
good,"The good thing about target is that you’re likely to get hired even if you have no job experience. I’d say it’s a good start for those who need a place to start. The thing that annoyed me the most was the scheduling. They make their schedules every thursday and sometimes I didn’t even work after wednesday because they barely give me hours so I had to physcally go there on my own time to see my schedule. I don’t have a car so I had to take a lyft which takes almost an hour’s worth of my salary in one trip to get there. And I DREADED working at self check-out. The supervisors are sometimes abset for a “short” period of time and minors can’t sell alcohol (I’m a minor) meaning that we have to get our supervisor’s approval (or any adult co-worker, but they have their own jobs to deal with and don’t always have time) by having them walk to our register and type in their Team Member code."
good,"It can get monotonous and strenuous with the moving and heavy lifting, but the pay wasn't bad (if you had the hours, that is), and management overall was decent. "
good,"The Target workplace was a slow and tedious experience. This is probably true for most similar jobs in the field of cashiering though.  Some days at self service, I would stand in one spot, doing nothing, for five hours, take a lunch break, and then go back to the same spot for another five hours. This may be ideal for some people, but I can't stand that kind of boring work."
good,"Target is a very fast paced working environment,that means you have to be fast while on tha clock.Its good to work there because You have to be a multi task individual otherwise the company will let you go.At target you basically do everything like customers service and stocking even something you have to na a backup cashier.It was good but sometimes it get stressful especially if it’s super busy or holidays season"
good,It is a job. They hire everyone part time so they do not pay benefits but they will give you consistent shifts if you really want to work 3-4 hours a day.
good,I worked for Target portrait before it closed. The sales portion of the job was my favorite. The manager had me do things that the assistant manager should have done.
good,I love working over at Target. U only focus on your job as a cashier and good customer service. You have easy job assignments that only require around your register only.hours vary depends on stores business if store is doing really good you have more hours.
good,It's a typical retail job; Inconsistent hours and stressful. The managers help a little day to day at my establishment. It can make or break the job by how engaged they are.
good,Often times we walk into 8-9 hours worth of work that is expected to be done in a 4-hour shift. Stressful amount of work with good pay. Around the holidays you can expect to work 35-40 hours a week then be cut as low as 10 hours a week once Christmas has passed.
good,"Target has the same problem that walmart has but they try to be more ""classy"" about it. They have their bad mangers and sour workers and crazy work hours"
good,"If you don't push the envelope and don't dare to be different then you are fine. If you want to be great, then get ready to sacrifice some hard work and long days, but don't get upset when the person who does a quarter of what you do seems to reap the awards. Ethics and inclusion are humorous at best."
good,It pays well but after the holidays they give no hours. I have been at 5-12 hours per week for over 2 months. The pay per hour is good but when they don't give hours it doesn't matter how well they pay you.
good,"Great co workers. Yearly pay raises. Fast paced work environment. Unload stock one truck per shift. Originally working 40 hours per week, change in management, then working 24 hours"
good,I felt like I got paid a reasonable amount but the managers are rude and don’t seem to care about the employees. My manager has said a ton of microaggressions and racist comments towards me. Not a fun place to work at and on top of all that they cut peoples hours and are very inconsistent. Also they recently changed the store manager at the Fitchburg location (which is where I worked) and he is also very rude to his employees.
good,"A lot of unprofessional interaction with certain management, lack of communication between staff and associates makes for silly misunderstandings. Not too stressfull if you are able to focus on your work and be friendly with customers. The work isn't hard just tedious or lacking at times."
good,"Target isnt a bad place to work if you have decent managers, my location suffers from terrible management who wont acknowlege the work their top team members do, nor compensate them for it. My manager in particular wont speak to you unless you are his favorite and won't even think about promoting you if you arent in his little circle of favorites, so dont expect alot from any of managment."
good,"There are lots of good and bad things at Target, want reliable hours? Look elsewhere they base hours off departments so you could have 40 hours one week and 20 hours the next. Management is a mix bag, some will listen to you but don’t expect things to change, actually always expect change apparently corporate (or so they say) are constantly making changes seems daily so no set in stone rules for the job to follow because it may be this way one day and that way another. All the leaders are on different pages and can be confusing when being given a task. Aside from that the employees are great I like almost everyone I work with, and was also given appropriate leave for bereavement (though it did take 2 mo to get my funds) overall it’s okay way to many rule changes, no guarantee for hours, but almost everyone is great and easy to get along with."
good,I love the new people I met but overall the job very stressful & lack of employees. They cut down hours especially they had Favoritism. The co-workers and management all act like they were in high school.
good,"I loved the team members of Target, and most of the management. I made some really amazing life long friends there. One department team lead thought they were in charge of the entire store and did not know how to talk to employees. She also liked to promote younger and newer hires who had no business being a team lead, it was quite insulting.The official store manager was great. The stress of the apparel department was what had me quit. It was always under staffed and the whole clothing department was a mess. We could never keep up. I liked aspects of the job but it's not a place I would recommend. I know a lot of people who have quit and have been so much happier."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with interesting guests and coworkers. It always brings a smile to my face when people tell me about their day and how wonderful the weather is today. Overall though Target is fun place to work.
good,"I loved this job at first, it was fun and a joy to have. As usual, managers change and leave, but the Store Director for my store did nothing, and always had ""special projects"". Now its been 3 1/2 years and every single day I work (whenever I do) I'm immediately mentally exhausted and tired of being there. THERE is no room to move up in the store, and when they decide you can get a new role, it takes months, even years."
good,In the morning when I open I start by going to my lead and finding out what is in store for the day. Most of the day is spent completing orders for guests to there satisfaction. The management is very helpful and knowledgeable and willing to help if an unforeseen event appears. The hardest part of the job is learning the new drinks that come out. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing my regulars and meeting new people
good,"working as a cashier was always fast-paced. you're the guests last interaction before they leave the store so you want to give a lasting impression. when it'd be a rush during the middle of the day things tended to get hectic, lines would be backed up, you're trying to go as quickly as possible to tend to every guest. overall, i met some amazing coworkers, cashiering was a bit too much than what i expected."
good,Fast pace work with a ton of criticism and a heavy work load with no hours. Management can be nice or not so nice. The employees all vary and the back room is less than satisfactory.
good,Target is a great place. The building was always clean and management always made sure that every team was on the correct path in order to keep their departments clean and efficient for customers.I decided to leave for a job that was closer and higher hourly wage.
good,"This job as a Flow Team Member in Target is a pretty good job for starters or people looking for a better job. You can even start off with a decent pay of $11 to $12 and is a pretty laid back but fast paced job to work in. However the training, management, and work hours are poor. At times when the holidays start, employees will get decent work hours of 30 hours or more, even for some part time employees who work very hard for the company. However, when the holidays end, work hours gets severely cut to 4 to 9 hours a week, which no one can be able to sustain off of unless their using this job as a way to earn extra money with whatever other job they may have. If you really want to start off with a job that pays their employees while, I recommend this place, but not as a long term job."
good,"As a part-timer, I felt rushed into my position and thus called out for the errors I'd made while being unaware of the actions I was supposed to have taken. I'd also asked about what all I had to do, and was given some instructions, but not actual specifics. I never even knew there was a sign in and sign out sheet next to the coordinator's office."
good,I could not recommend this job because of the lack of hours and rarely having 2 days off together. There are no benefits for part time employees. The people I worked with were great.
good,"I personally did not mind working here throughout college. It just gets boring after awhile, and hard to change positions once in a certain part of the store."
good,"Target is a very interesting company. While my time ther was short, I came to see many employees did not like it there. My manager was great, but it seemed that everyone else did not like their's. I can't give this place a decent rating just because of my lack of time working their, and it being the busiest season(which seems like people don't like to work during this time of year)."
good,"The pace is fast, the atmosphere is fun and the people are friendly. Every team member is encouraged to innovate, contribute ideas and discover solutions as an important part of a world-class team."
good,"I learned how to provide great customer service, that""s what they really push for. Hardest part is the stocking and providing service to customers at the same time. Management is poor at noticing hard workers are very judgmental."
good,Horrible hours and rude managers. It is very nice that they pay 12 dollars an hour but it is not worth it when you look at the amount of hours that you are granted per week.
good,"Target was a good job for the 3 years I worked there, I had never worked at any job longer before Target. I was allowed and encouraged to learn multiple areas. Target  is not a great permanent job unless you get lucky and move up after someone leaves...or dies. Target has an unfortunate requirement in cutting the hours for a few months to make pay roll, which can make it difficult to know what your weeks will look like. You are allowed to post your shift for any day of the week and someone can take it, usually how people get their hours back. The Target I worked at had very lazy management with a poor attitude at having to help you. I ended up having to learn and solve any problems myself before going to my managers and getting the ""I don't know"" answer. Again, very difficult to move up in the Target I worked at, you can be trained and ""Put on the Bench"" for a manger position but it is not likely you will ever become one until the position opens. Target has great pay and I was able to rent a home with some Spectrum Internet and get out of my parents house. I would recommend if you are planning on working for Target to work as hard as you possibly can and aim for a team lead position. There is no point in working there unless you do."
good,"Learned a lot with my career with Target and appreciated the experience. The past year a lot has changed- every store and district are different I just happened to have a bad store and district."
good,Overall great to work as a first or last job.  But opportunities are mainly if your a salaried position.  If you have the opportunity to get full time or move out go ahead!
good,i learned customer service but poor pay for the work we do. everyone has  to do almost every position at the store. they have flexible hours and discounts.
good,"When i worked at target i met a great bunch of workers that were very dedicated to their job. Unfortunately the management there wasn't so great. It made me sad to see all the workers scared of how management would react when they needed a day off, even if it was for a family reason. "
good,"Target was a typically slow paced job "
good,Very fast pace environment sometimes hostile with guest service counter. Discounts were great. always got good hours signing up for shifts. Benefits were to expensive through the company. Overall it was a good place to get my experience and foot in the door for more opportunities.
good,"The cart attendant job at target it a fairly good one in my opinion. My job consists of cleaning garbages, bringing in carts from the parking lot, and doing an assortment of other tasks to maintain the store such as helping in the backroom when needed, bringing items and flats to the back, etc. Managers and coworkers were nice for the most part and I enjoyed the work I was doing as I was usually allowed to work at my own pace."
good,"On an average day about 40 customers visit, many with different needs.  The skills to listen and communicate are most important.  The tools available for solutions are limited so managing customers expectations is critical.  As I enjoy customer interaction and problem solving, this job fits my ability and enjoyment."
good,A typical day consists of unloading the freight from the truck as organized as possible then stocking the shelves. Depending on the season hours are limited.
good,"When I first started, I was strictly apparel and worked with a group of girls who I soon became friends with. It was very fun and I enjoyed going to work everyday. They gave me so many hours and the managers were so great and respectful. After a year or so, the managers started leaving and things started to slowly change. I kept getting thrown around into different areas and slowly started hating my job. One manager in particular would single people out (including me). If anyone were to correct her or not agree with her, she’d make your time at work as unpleasant as she could. She’s shouted at employees on the floor in front of customers, made someone do 9 hours of work in 1 hour and has complained about me to my supervisor for being slow (I was sick and super depressed that day) she didn’t even ask if I was okay. I had strep and had to leave 1 hour in and she insinuated that I’d be fired. The GM of the store is super sweet and apologizes for her but does nothing else. I am now strictly unload and hardlines. To get promoted, you have to kiss up and be friends with the managers which is absolutely ridiculous because there are a few great employees who’d be great leaders. This job should be temporary because your pay won’t rise all that much and management changes. Be prepared to be thrown around into different departments."
good,"Overall Target was a good company but the lack of work-life balance was really draining. Especially having a boss that would not recognize any of your accomplishments and constantly demand more. The work was about 10 hours a day, close to twelve during the holidays. I really enjoyed my co-workers and the employees who worked for me."
good,You’ll always have something to do. When I left I noticed that the goal was to do more with less month over month. I understand the goal is efficiency and keeping payroll in check. Not the worst job ever though.
good,Although target was quite stressful the environment was fun and we got our jobs done. My manager was not the nicest person but knew how to do her job and have us get our jobs done efficiently.
good,"Working in both cashiers and customer service always kept me busy, from solving problems and grabbing orders! The rush was always nice, but the hours were not"
good,"Not a bad place to work, I was a student at the time but they expected me to work 30 hour weeks while they knew my class schedule. Not a terrible work load considering both school and work but it was a bit too much for me personally."
good,"Convenient location, nice work environment, friendly co-workers & management.  The job was easy and wasn't stressful.  I enjoyed helping customers.  I would have liked to have continued working there."
good,"Most of the time you'll bee pushing, which often is stressful if you're unathletic. Other than that, the environment is fast-paced and fun. You're always busy doing something. Whether that be helping a guest or stocking shelves, you'll be busy."
good,"When I was offered a job at Target it was initially meant for me to be there long term. Then it turned out to be seasonal. I only took the job offer because I was told there was going to be opportunity for growth but human resources had a hidden agenda of keeping me seasonally without informing me until 10 days to the end of the position, was severely disappointed that I was not given the curtesy of knowing the position was temporary before I accepted the job."
good,"Overall good. Every job has its pros and cons. The workplace culture is fun depending on the department and who you're working with. This job is what you put into it, if you have a fun team and good management then its a good $12/hr job."
good,"I worked in softlines at the louisiana ave store. It was an easy job, but   you get no consistent hours. You might have 20 one week and 8 the next. Pay is good, starting was 11 and after a couple weeks it bumped up to 12.50."
good,"the dynamic in the Danville store is just plain mean. they feel that they can say anything to you as long as they come back before the end of the day and apologize, like being in a bad marriage."
good,"it was a good place to work. work was very demanding for the pay. taught me a lot for further careers. management is usually hit or miss. some managers did so much, while others got away with doing nothing."
good,"I work in the backroom and there’s so much to do but we don’t have that many backroom members. So what my store will do is have people that don’t care about their job, let alone mine, to come back and do my job when my hours get cut. They never do it right. People just put stuff wherever.  And then when I come back for my 2 days a week I just get to look at what looks like an establishment that hoarders have been living in."
good,"I actually enjoyed the job at first but it quickly turned super mundane and I felt extremely over worked. It started to feel like no one could be right because the managers kept changing what the “rules” were, and weren’t communicating changes to the other managers so everyone was always on different pages. The managers would make you feel bad if you couldn’t stay past your scheduled time and the amount they expected was simply just not doable in an 8 hour shift. Great customer service was an extremely stressed trait they needed all of us to have but they didn’t understand how long it took to help the customers?? I eventually just lost respect for the managers and my mental health caused me to leave."
good,"I have enjoyed my time with Target until recent Modernization changes, and the Management team that came along with it. Before, Target was amazing; everyone knew what they were expected to do, the workload was very fair, and the days weren't stressful in the least. However, following Modernization, Target's new operating policies that seemingly change by the day, the company has become a very hard place to recommend for anyone with other options. Under Modernization, countless roles/jobs have been condensed with a number of co-workers losing their hours or positions entirely, the workload has skyrocketed as more work is expected for each team member, and the overall culture has become more negative as moods continue to sour. While some people may jump at the opportunity to make $12.00/hour to start, Target Corporate has clearly shown a disdain for those with tenure as their pay was not raised to reflect their time spent with the company. In other words, and in many cases, someone who's worked with Target for 5+ years will now be making the same amount as someone who's come off the streets day one. "
good,"I was hired as a part-time seasonal cashier with the possibility for continuing after the holidays but was let go on 12/23 with my last day being Christmas Eve. One of the (very young!) cashier team leaders told me I was no longer needed and said they really liked employees who wanted more hours than the 10 or so I was looking for. Interesting for two reasons: First, I'd asked if I could work a full shift and a half shift, 2 days a week, when I was hired and was told no problem. Second, after starting I was told they didn't like to give full shifts because they needed to give other cashiers more hours. ??"
good,Expect more pay less. That’s what you get. Mismanagement is not the best. HR is only there to protect the company not help out the employees. Very cutthroat work place.
good,"I love my coworkers and love the people I meet, the work just isn't always desirable but it is retail so there's not a lot to expect from it. Management helps you learn"
good,A typical day was having a manager coming around to tell you what to do.  Once you did it they would come back and it was always.  Best thing about Target is there benefits.
good,"I would not recommend this place to work unless you are in school and in need of a temporary job. If you are not a part of the clique, you will not be promoted. Corporate wants to make sure that everyone is kept under the minimum of hours so the company will not have to shell out insurance."
good,"I really do not have much to say because this was a seasonal job for me, but for the most part it was a very relaxed job. The uniform policy was not as strict as most places and the staff was amazing. During the busy hours, you need to keep a level head and not get overwhelmed."
good,I enjoyed working at Target but it was just seasonal and I was not one of the few employees selected to continue on after the holiday season. I enjoyed my coworkers and the consistency of knowing what to work each shift.
good,"Team Leader"
good,"There can be a real lack of communication and understanding of policy, which leads to different managers telling guests miss-matching stories."
good,Everyone I worked with was very nice to me and very helpful in learning how to do my job. I learned how to put things that were damaged in charge back. the management was very nice.
good,"If you're looking for a few extra bucks and/or want work experience, Target is a great place to start. If you get the opportunity to work in fulfillment, take all the experience you can get because their system has become more efficient over the years."
good,"Target is a company where they will take as much as you give and ask for more.  It is retail, so expect grumpy guests, managers that will challenge you, and inconsistent schedules.  Company is in a big flux right now as it is trying to identify itself more, grow, and combat Walmart and Amazon.  "
good,The team members and team leaders you work with are very friendly and understanding except for the Store managers. Relaxed workplace environment but it can be very boring at times making the shifts feel extra long.
good,I have been working with  Target for more than 2 years.  People are very nice until new management.  I feel they don't value employee's loyalty that is why people leave.
good,The workers are good. The manengment was not good at all they’ve never done the jobs that we do and expect us to do the job in a timely manner and that wasn’t good enough for them.
good,"I was a team member when first hired, and although the pay is not enough for an adult to live on, it was a nice part-time job to supplement my income with flexible hours. I enjoyed the customer service, and stocking product. "
good,"Target is technically my first job. I enjoyed my first year or so here...but over time, I found myself wanting to advance and move on. Target is not the ideal job for advancement."
good,"My first sales job. It was not easy but made me the person I am today.I worked up the ladder and became a sales floor trainee and was offered team lead position but the culture at target is to be desired. The greed of the guest is also a turn off beside having to clean the store after every person has ran through all the goods,"
good,"In the time I have worked at target, I have experienced a number of management changes. They did not appreciate the devoted employees and often put sales and budget cuts ahead of the employees. For example, they cut payroll down to save, and people who relied on the hours they were usually scheduled, would be left with half of that. They are an accepting company and have an overall good culture, but at the end of the day are still a retailer, so every employee is easily replaceable to them."
good,"Work culture depends, it keeps changing as new people keep getting hired. But they barely give you hours to avoid having to give you anything and its like they dont want you to advance, they just keep you at the same spot and misuse you for your work. it's frustrating. can't work there forever."
good,high energy always smile and always stay alert of false coupons. getting people to sign up for red cards is a must make sure cart stalls are not full. and be on time
good,My experience at Target was Decent. I was assigned tasks and I completed them with efficiency. I got along with my team members and we completed tasks with little to no issues.
good,"I loved working at Target at first, I knew exactly how many hours I was getting and exactly what position I was. The longer I was there, the more messy it got. I was a cashier cross trained for sales and that messed with my hours significantly, as well as the management. The pay was great for a retail job and for the job requirements, but near the end my hours were either full time or nothing at all. The environment was quick paced but other co workers and tasks keep you busy. Not a bad job if you have just work one position in my opinion. Also the discount is nice too!"
good,"Target is hard work, a lot of moving no standing around . When your on the floor you have to be help guest and stocking merchandise. You have to be able to handle customer , stock and back up when called on. While moving at a face pace"
good,I was hired part-time but was able to pick up hours often to be able to get a 40 hour work week. Management was reasonable and understanding. I overall liked working there.
good,I worked at target in the 90's so for me I was in high  school. I remember the job being stressful and people were rude. Management was not very helpful and the training was not good they just threw you on the register.
good,"Management was mostly competent enough, but you move sideways, instead of up, co workers were mostly friendly, the scheduling system was easy to use, not great hours"
good,Long work hours with long weekends. Business was going in a bad direction. Frequent manager changes. Feedback was often ignored. Net enough training in machinery.
good,Great place to work and use as a secondary income as I did.  The Company is very flexible with your primary job schedule and is willing to meet your needs to an extent.
good,"Target has better pay than others in the industry, but the culture is highly dependent on location. There is opportunity for advancement if you work hard."
good,"Put prices on merchandise."
good,"I was very excited when I started working at Target months ago. Hours were pretty consistent, work was steady, and my coworkers were really nice. The only problem is as the year goes on, the work load increases and the hours decrease. They expect you to do all the same kind of work you did before, or even more than that, in less time, while also cleaning/zoning your area, assisting guests and making sure your area is matching the visual merchandise guide. They expect a lot from each worker and honestly getting paid anything less than $15 per hour, with no chance for overtime is just unreasonable."
good,It has honestly been too long for me to write a review on this company. I can tell you that working here gave me the skills needed to advance in the retail world.
good,"The management was horrible and always put to much work on your shoulders . Other than that it was fun , good hours and free lunch sometimes.The guests were even nice"
good,"It was alright, I wouldn't do it again. I'm at a stage in my life I need a job that's more concrete. This is something for someone that's in high school that wants to make some money."
good,"Good for teenagers or as a part time job. People get promoted by popularity  not what you do. Breaks are never on time. However, it a pretty easy job the register is easy to use and the guest are better thant Walmart customers."
good,"I had a great time working with most of my coworkers. The atmosphere was laid back, but sometimes demanding where one must complete tasks as requested. Loved helping guests to the utmost of my ability, The management at my local store was horrible. Hours were based on how much was sold in each quarter, meaning you may go from 35 hours one week to 8 - 9 in the next. The pay was great, too."
good,"Enjoyed the position, just not the intense micromanagement. Typical of a call center environment - too many metrics, too many self-reviews, not enough focus on helping the customer."
good,Don't work at Target if you have to adhere to mandatory court ordered visitation with your child...you won't get scheduled for it although it's mandatory.
good,"Enjoyed co workers and helping guests. Enjoyed training other team members. Enhanced public service experience."
good,"A typical day at work was okay, I felt the management could have been better. I was training newer employees and I had no problem with that and I am a fast learner so it wasn't bad but the management didn't really go out of their way to help newer employees."
good,"Went from 32-40 hours a week for the first  4 months then  they did a remodel & after that for the last 4 week it was 12 hours, then 10 hours, then only 8 again do when I seen for the 4th week in a row I was only going to be working for the next 2 weeks was a total of 18 hours for 2 weeks I had to go! I have 2 kids to support!"
good,"Target is a great place and I would recommend this to some people that just want to start working, but the management is just horrible. The pay rate is alright, but sometimes the workers are very rude to their co-workers."
good,It is a good company to work for if you would like to advance and they are flexible with hours.  Good benefits once you have been established.  Good services for team members
good,Really want you to succeed but management is constantly changing but with not real direction. Great company if fit the mold but if you don't feel left out.
good,"I worked for target for 4yrs. during that time I did electronics, cashier, plano-guides. inventory, stocking. Overall management was good. my time there was pleasant. I met good friends that I still keep in touch with. The only down fall I had was when they gave someone with no experience electronics lead position. I was more than qualified for that position. They over looked me."
good,"i worked there for the holidays first time, it was crazy i worked black Friday night til 2 and had to be back a work at 10 the next day. crappie customers and we had to give them the Disney experience"
good,"Do your research. Working at a Target can be great fun and really rewarding, you will never be bored and can be paired with a really fun, hard-working team. However, after working there for a year we got a new STL (store team lead) and he began treating people poorly. I chose to leave since he was not valuing people or their time, he was very petty at times too. "
good,Target is a pretty fast-paced place to work depending on your position. Certain times of the day are busier than others. I learned a lot about the inter-workings of larger retail stores. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and management was okay. I would say the hardest part of the job would be dealing with some of the customers. Everything else was great.
good,"It’s an ok place to work, but not if you’re not a fast paced person. Management doesn’t really try to better you like they should. It’s pretty much a “you make it or you don’t” kind of thing."
good,Great people to work with very diverse company.  Very fast paced atmosphere always changing to keep up with the changes in the retail business.  Flexible schedules available to meet your needs.
good,"Up until this May Target was an okay place to work.  Then they raised their minimum wage to $12/hr.  Because of this they cut the labor hours in each store. Most employees had their hours cut by 20%. The stores are now pretty chaotic with needed work not getting done (price changes, departmental changes, stocking).  Things are only going to get worse when they raise it again this next year. Yes, the hourly wage looks good but you don't get the hours you assume you will get.   If you need 30-40 hours don't apply here. If all you need is something like 20 hours you might not mind it here."
good,"The work wasn't bad and there are some great people who work there, but some of the management staff are pretty passive-aggressive and are very disorganized. They give pretty decent hours, but they denied all of my requests when i tried to change my availability to go to school."
good,"It starts off pretty decent but after a few months it is the same thing everyday. A lot of your coworkers make up for everything, but all in all would not work here again."
good,Target was a really great place to work. Management was always nice & helpful. If you needed a day off due to illness they aloud a doctors note so it wouldn't count against you. However the pay was not enough to live on.
good,"I worked as a hardlines team member for a short period during my time in community college. I would say that the management was relatively friendly and understanding of peoples' situations. The demand from the job was not too high, but I think that the pay was not worth the effort put forth as it was a very high-paced, stressful work environment and many times customers were not very friendly to the employees when items were not in stock or things just did not ""go their way"". Overall I did not hate my time at Target but I would never work there again, nor would I recommend it to anyone I remotely like."
good,Its a place where I got a lot of experience. I would recommend any newcomer to start at target because it helps you get all the working experience you need.
good,"We started work at 6 am an depending on the shift we would work 10 or 12 hour days. There was always mandatory over-time. "
good,Even tho working for target wasn’t for to long I had another chance to hone my skills more and improve myself as a person. Overall it was a very decent place to work at and I’d go back no probelm
good,"This job was great at first. My managers liked me, I made more and more friends with my coworkers the longer I stayed there. Unfortunately poor management decisions and awful work schedules led to my resigning."
good,"I worked at three Target stores from 2000 till now.  My supervisors are good.  I have learned many different jobs while with Target.  I can stock, unload trucks, research and replenish, set new areas, do price changes and train.  I can backstock and pull merchandise to replenish and I am learning to do ship to store and online fulfillment orders."
good,Overall it was a nice place to work but management sucked. It gets too personal. Some people were onlu out for their own. If you worked hard and a position comes open they will hire from outside of the store
good,Company has done a 180 within the last year going against everything it stood for since day 1. No more work life balance and any visits from upper management leave you feeling hurt.
good,"Whether or not Target is a good job depends entirely on who the managers are, which means it can vary nightly based on who's in the building. If it's the middle of winter, expect everyone to be there, so the people who know what they're doing will be in charge, and things will run smoothly. The rest of the year, just try to work on the same days as the people you can actually stand."
good,"Was a model/ shining employee for almost 8 years never called in or had any problems but I was let go for not punching out for meals in time. Granted I was on probation for doing the same thing almost a year prior, the second violation is automatic termination. VERY DISAPPOINTING."
good,If management were on the same page with their communication and view on how task are assigned and completed in a productive order things would not seemed to be so crazy and unorganized. It is a great work experience but lack recongizing hard workers and team players. Because of management lack of communication they have lost amazing workers and to me some of those people played a key role into target success at times.
good,"I was a cashier for a few weeks at Target in Frisco, TX and it was a good job, but not something that I would pursue as a career. There are opportunities for those who work hard to work themselves into management, however, because I was unable to have open availability due to having children that was not an option for me. I had to end up leaving because I had my second child and was not making enough there to pay for childcare."
good,Good entry level job that provided flexible work hours. Slower pace of learning provided a calm environment. Learned how to use a Point-of-Sales system
good,"I've worked for Target for nearly twelve years and while it's had it's up and downs like any job, I can say that overall my experience with Target has been a good one.  The management is at worst, willing to work with you and your schedule and at best, accommodating and friendly.  The pace can be hectic as retail jobs go and a lack of scheduling makes completing tasks difficult and at times impossible when considering guest traffic and spot filling roles left unfulfilled by the hiring process."
good,"You need to work and go home, don't make friends there is no one that will have you back when you in trouble you will be written up and if that occurs three times you will be met at the front door at the beginning of your shift and fired. If you conduct yourself in a unprofessional way you will forfeit you termination appeal and have no options. Managers can write you up and you cannot attest or appeal even if signed or not it counts against like a strike from a prison. Good Money, Good benefits, but false image awaits for you inside the building. We had anonymous survey one time and everybody who wrote something bad was called to a meeting throughout the day to discuss, what happened to anonymous."
good,"typical unload and stocking job. Nothing really special, just do what you gotta do and you'll be fine. Most of the timelines they give you are mostly unreasonable, but they won't really say anything about it if you don't make it."
good,Not too bad but it was a lot of work for a team that didn't have enough associates. it's an easy place to work at if everyone is on the same page and there are no favorites.
good,A typical day at work is very inconsistent as a worker. You stay at one place and thats it. I learned how to deal with other people's bull better. There is nothing hard about the job bu the inconsistent hours. The most enjoyable part is some of the other workers.
good,"My job consists of problem solving and managing the overnight logistics team and aiding them in the process of unloading trucks, stocking and managing inventory.  I'm responsible for moving in a quick manner to make sure the store is ready for opening the next morning and all of the materials are pushed out onto the floor."
good,"Good job, the management is up in the air on some occasions. The hours are inconsistent. Also raises every year are not really good. My biggest raise was 28 cents."
good,"The store was always clean, well taken care of. The biggest issue that I had was how rude the management was towards the guests along with the employees."
good,"When I first start working at Target I loved it. I loved my manager, the team, everything. Now there's new management, I'm not so sure that I want to work there anymore."
good,"If you like retail, working for Target is fine.  The pay is low and sometimes the supervisors/managers can be bossy.  Target's pay and work credo is at is like their motto for the customers:  ""Expect more, Pay less!"""
good,"I wanted something where I could be around people.  I started out doing seasonal work and ended up staying, helping out part-time wherever they needed me."
good,Good flexible times but overall advancement is limited due to outside hires. Great training that lasted about a week but it was definitely worth it. Got to work in almost every area of the store so I learned alot.
good,"The morning consisted of starting work at 5 am. The managers were nice and the people I worked with were also very nice to work with. I learned how they organized their stockroom and floor layout. Additionally, I learned how to use their forklift and pallet jacks. The culture was ok. The most enjoyable part of the day was working alongside my supervisor. We got along very well. I felt there was not much room for advancement as when I talked to other managers that were there for 15 years+. I felt I needed for a place where I could grow faster and have better opportunities for my motivation and skills."
good,"Perfect job for the people who want to do the least. Job requires no brain power or physical tolerance. Just a strong ability to bite your tongue. Occasionally you will get a rude guest but if you can handle that, you can work at target."
good,Management was simply atrocious. My work environment was horrifically stressful all the time. I did not receive proper treatment or the hours I needed.
good,"Great place to work for finding your first job. Everyone is super friendly and caring. Just wish management and corporate sees that when not putting enough people on the schedule can be stressful at times to get everything done. Back in Electronics you are actually in charge of four different areas that include, electronics, toys, sporting goods, and seasonal. How the new schedules are now, you are by yourself most of the time with little to no help from the rest of store and seem forgotten."
good,Enjoyed working with the public on the front end check out. Helps to be personable instead of mechanical. Main issues were the poor management and leadership skills in store. Continuous improvement needed in that department! Wages are NOT compensated for experience! 20 plus years experience and making 50 cents more than kids coming in the door for their first job!
good,Lengthy interview process.  New request app sucks.  Overall very willing to work with you.  Very nice discount program.  When a problem arises you cant solve you blink your light and help will come to you.
good,"Arriving at scheduled time or early if needed. Talk to team members or managers about work scheduled for the day, week, having a clear idea for the company goal. I like a straight forward management, consistent schedule, benefits for employees. Work is something we should take serious but at the same time, work should also be something you enjoy and not forced against you. Management change or store change will be the hardest, and just coming to work knowing I can help someones day by talking to them."
good,It was a seasonal job so not much chance to make it on permanently. Was offered the job but it was out of the way so i turned it down. Good job for teen
good,"I loved my position at target, but unfortunately poor leadership and management was the ultimate reason why I left. My team lead was lazy and unproductive which left me doing the majority of the work. My lead would try to find reasons to have to ""talk"" with me and overall I felt targeted by this person and my efforts never went recognized even though I was carrying the load of our team. I was an instocks team member and I genuinely enjoyed doing the work and interacting with guests, it was why I stayed so long. Target unfortunately hires managers who are straight out of college with no work experience which makes it frustrating for those who are paid less just because they don't have a college degree because ultimately the new managers have no idea what they are doing."
good,"You don’t want to be here for long, this should only be a temporary Job if you ever decide to work for target. This will be a good job for like college students ."
good,"FLOW team is the overnight logistics team for Target. Where I worked in New Britain, CT was slightly horrible, inconsistent hours, poor management, employees would come-and-go, some would just not show up ever again....and I can't blame them. The amount of work they have us do is nowhere near what we should actually be getting paid for doing. Not only am I sweating from 4am when we start our shifts, but it doesnt stop until we are done with our shifts. Target would literally not function without the FLOW Team every morning, and there's really no appreciation. Even when we've finished the truck early....we could ""always be better"". It's very discouraging waking up during your best hours of sleep to come into work at 3-4 a.m. work your behind off for hours and feel like you still weren't good enough. A lot of people quit, some managers were fired, but overall some of the people I work with are really the only reason I'm still here. The pay needs to increase for the amount of work they want us to do before the store opens at 8 a.m. & we need more encouragement from our leaders, not micro-managing and making us feel like we aren't good enough."
good,"Co-workers are great, and job requirements don't change. This is a fast-paced work environment though. This does make the days go by faster. The guests are what try your patience."
good,Constantly changing environment but not everyone is willing to change or accept that some things just don’t work. Very busy in the weekends and midday.
good,"Overall I had a positive experience working for target, the hours could be demanding sometimes I would come in at 4 AM then the day after I would have to be in at 2 PM until 11pm then repeat.  However I forged a lot of strong friendships from this position working with a wide varities of team members."
good,"A once in a life time experience, I do not want to experience again.I was a very somewhat busy environment. Great helping the guest choose their glasses and set up appointment for eye exam."
good,"Target is a very unique company to work for.  In the job of logistics and backroom where I worked, I had a lot of responsibilities.  I would be responsible for pulling product from the back so that it could fill the floor and also was responsible for making sure that the backroom was organized and clean.  Also as a logistics trainer I was responsible for training new backroom team members so they felt comfortable in the backroom.  The management at Target varied from each position in management.  The workplace culture seemed upbeat for the most part but during the tougher parts of the year the culture tended to be less positive.  The hardest part of the job for me was delegating between multiple tasks as this seemed to be something that often happened at Target, having to do many different jobs all at once.  I would say that the most enjoyable part of the day was completing difficult tasks in a timely manner."
good,"Most nights are fun to work if im with the right manager, as for mornings, some are not as well because i could have at least three different mangers so id have to hear all different orders, some have their own benefits ahead of others and in most peoples opinions are not meant for the position. From working there for five years I have been cross trained in nearly every department available to me apart from a few i would need college degrees to train in. The most enjoyable part is being able to help people find items their looking for or help check them out at the registers"
good,"I worked under some of the most forward thinking managers I’ve ever met. I was able to move around in the store, switching between cashiering and baristaing at the Starbucks. I was also able to stock shelves. The way management was set up was very confusing.many of the managers they had never managed before, so it would get difficult, however most decisions were made by multiple managers. I would definitely recommend working at target, especially if it is your first job."
good,"When I started it was a very fast, fun and friendly place. I worked hard but never felt like I received the gratification or compensation. Near the end, I felt dispensible after learning almost every position. The managers who I loved almost all left and the place became very, ""sell, sell, sell."" oriented. The managers began to grow superiority complexes and I knew I had to get out. Decent job if you just need some extra cash and don't care."
good,"When i first started working at Target i loved it , management now is getting off and its slowly going down hill for me. I would still recommend it for someone who is a college student or someone who wants to work during the season,"
good,"The day is spent sleeping to stay awake all night, fast paced work.The breaks are perfect to fuel up and nice break from the fast paced work. No lack in option of choices working in a store. The hardest part is the beginning working in the freezer just due to negative temperature."
good,"I was laid off back in January of 2017. I was actually employed under Lifetouch Portraits LLC. Since working for a retail photo studio, I have decided that is not what I want to do. This job didn't make you have any skill to work for them."
good,"trabajo de madrugada, y te mantienen en una posicion te dan un break si hay tiempo y el supervisor de noche se dormia"
good,target is a company that is good if your looking for partime work very rare to find a fulltime position and what they do is give you fulltime hours but hire you partime therefore are able to cut your hours when ever they feel like it
good,I just had a hard time adjusting here. They expected a lot out of you for the amount that you were paid. You definitely cant make a living off of $10 and hour.
good,"Really good for a high school or college student or a good part time job, hours fluctuate each week, no set schedule, hard to get overtime, and TARGET has a high turnover right in my personal opinion"
good,Target is a temporary job for a high school and college students unless on wants to pursue a job in management and/or business. Other than that it does it's job for pocket money and those trying to get a job during school
good,"Target was a great place to work, but the environment is changing. More work is expected out of less people in a short amount of time. Work days are on average 5 hours with a work week of 20 hours. Everyone is scrambling for hours and many need a second job to live on. It can be very demanding and stressful. However, I've always experienced a team that is supportive of each other like a family to help each other get through the stress."
good,"Target, is a nice place for your first job. A job to get in and get out as soon as you can. Very Stressful and management is very poor and unfair. Team members are not treated with respect. I did, however, learn how to solve problems without a manager to be able to become a better leader."
good,"It's retail. So that being said, there are many aspects to the job. Mine in particular was logisitcs. Very demanding, fast paced and physical. Every store is run differently, most times with the same goals.  Some aspects have not been changed in decades.  They have new goals, new processes they want but dont work on the core of the issues. Again certain aspects have never changed, or unloading of trucks. They continue to take away from certain work centers, like logisitcs, but do nothing to help stream line the process, just expect more for less....."
good,Target has many positions in which is best suited for the employer. Every position is monitored by a supervisor in which critique the employer and determines an appropriate payroll. Target is a stable job that requires strong mentality for the company well being.
good,"It was good for part time student near uncc. Hours fluctuate when not in holiday season. Management and senior level workers sometimes give you flack for no reason. But when everything is done well, they do reward you with snacks sometimes."
good,I have target 5 years of me. It was super fun at first getting to know new people and retail tips and more people skills. But we did go through a lot of different mangers at our store...and it got to be very inconsistent. And soon became not challenging enough and no futher opportunities.
good,"management seemed to be very poor, lack of communication. a typical day at work seemed to be stressful and fast paced, the hardest part we're my peers"
good,"Hours are not very good, you are able to pick up some shifts though so it kind of makes up for it. Very relaxed place to work at, probably would recommend to a friend."
good,"Overall I loved most of my co-workers and we accomplished a lot together, but our work is mostly unsupervised because we had been there longer than the supervisor."
good,"Constantly busy, which is a good thing. No matter what you set your schedule at through availability the management can change it and set it to what they need. The management was not very helpful and didn't improve situations. The workplace culture is alright, busy and stressful. The hardest part of the job is having to close the store so many days. The most enjoyable part of the job is to stay busy."
good,"High paced and stressful environment. Main complaint would be that management doesn't have a clear, unified vision. Subordinate managers often left without clear direction and feel unsupported. Regular events with free food."
good,I enjoyed working in a face pace environment.  It wasn’t until the end when a supervisor joined the team and started to sexually harasse me that my job became miserable. Target was a great place to work up until then.
good,Target Distribution was a good job for what it was. I made good money there and had good hours. The distance and the reliable transportation got me but other than that everything was ok.
good,Part time sometimes to extremes and management says its hands are tied with payroll. Other than that it is a good place to work. They put a lot into accuracy of items in inventory on sales floor and located in backroom. Equipment is adequate.
good,"Started each day with some stretches and a meeting. We got our work orders for the day and went to work. Once done with our first orders we would go back to the scheduler and get more work tickets. Sometimes we would run out of work and be sent home. Worst part of the job besides our shift manager was the heat. A lot of the people were miserable to work with also. Not considerate at all and lots of ""favorites"" within the company. I enjoyed the job itself."
good,fast pace and very nice people and lot of different benefits for you family. if you work in e&f there is alot of good guys that are willing to help you out.
good,"A good sales job for sales oriented people, albeit stressful at times. You are often on your own in a job that requires a lot of technical knowledge, which can feel overwhelming."
good,"Target is a sales driven company that strongly promotes guest service above all else, no matter the job description. Management is average, with very minimum power to opinion given to regular team members. Expectations are high and getting higher with minimum starting pay increasing, which is fair. Scheduling hours is very inconsistent even with open availability. But, workers and new hires are always treated equally no matter the background of the employee. Target undergoes dramatic changes every year to help boost sales, effecting work schedules as well as increasing workload. With the idea of working harder in less time, it’s fairly obvious that Target’s goal is to create as much profit as possible disregarding what team members are actually capable of accomplishing."
good,"It wasn’t bad nor"
good,It is a great place to work if you are right out of college. A lot of young people work at Target from all over the U.S. Beware of people trying to sabotage you.
good,"- Hard on your body"
good,"A typical day of work depends on which department you are currently in. Mainly within any department as a general team member, you’ll simply be organizing shelves and assisting customers throughout the day. It is really not much to learn and even when you would like to advance within the company, management is not the most helpful with that push. However, the company is very cultured and this brings experiences when dealing with multiple people. The job is very straightforward and basic."
good,"My main complaint was that I had put on my application that I couldn't work more than 25 hours a week as I was a full-time student at the time and most of my work weeks were 32-38 hours, with no reduction in time. Other than that it was a fine place to work. My coworkers were fun to work with and it was nice working at a retailer that people respect."
good,Nice people and if in the right department people werw always willing to help and most supervisors and employees were nice and professional. But if you were permanent employee you could tell the different but either way no one disrespected you.
good,"Most days at Target are spent focuses on balancing task and servicing our guests.  We seek to engage our teams and work efficiently to reach goals.  The leadership serves a critical role in implementing change and is required to be resilient and embrace challenges.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the team, but the hardest part of the job is the lack of work/life balance."
good,"Is not a high paying job, you get paid minimum wage and the hours can be good or bad depending on the season, but overral its a minimum wage job that is above standards and HR is pretty helpful with what you need."
good,The management team is not the greatest. I have heard that from others who worked at different Targets. They don't really care about their employees. People mainly stay for the great pay and benefits.
good,Most of staff was enjoyable. Went to work and did what I needed and felt for the most part appreciated. There were daily goals to work towards and most customers were friendly.
good,"It was a nice first job, the training was nice and it was quite fun when I got the hang of it. They worked around my school schedule and gave me good hours, I would definitely recommend."
good,Being a cart attendant and cashier there isn't much to accomplish or room for improvement and its a routine job. They push you really hard to have customers apply for there Credit card/ Debit card. They do not like to offer full time unless its really required or at least the Target I worked at. The staff was great but as far as the management it was awful . You always had one manager telling you to do one thing then another manager questioning why you are doing certain things. Lack of communication .
good,At Target they have their own culture. My work experience there was a positive one. The working hours were good because you got off work in time to do other activities in life.
good,The job itself wasn’t bad and neither was the pay. The only thing was that you had to keep up with their demands. Long lunch breaks were a plus and most of the staff were courteous.
good,"The management at Target were always very nice and understanding about any school or personal issues, but it still has all those retail caveats."
good,"Not much breaks, hard to find people to help me when I was learning. I felt as if people were always too busy to help me help the customers when I didn't know what I was doing"
good,"Target is a great place to start. It is a good place to get some experience in customer service.  By starting out at Target, you can easily transition into another field with the experience you gained at Target"
good,"Target is a great place to work depending on your goals.  "
good,It is fine to work at Target as long as you work the early morning shift. I worked that shift and had very little customer interaction being on the presentation team.
good,For me the most enjoyable part of the job is when I get to unload the trucks that we get in. In some places the management is lacking just because we are understaffed and sometimes the employees have to run the team when the Team Lead has to go to lunch.
good,"typical day was cleaning restrooms and providing customer service to people as far as carts, cleanups and where to find items throughout the store. was fassed passed"
good,I worked at Target for 13.5 years in a variety of positions. I was able to advance rapidly after receiving my degree but as the years went on and payroll continued to be slashed I found myself consistently without a team to lead and having to do tons of the day to day work myself. I left for advancement and for the type of work I was doing to match the salary I was receiving.
good,"I enjoy making coffee for starbucks, pay is good. I think that scheduling could be a lot better than it is and the employees should get the desired amount of hours. I also think that employees specifically in target should in some way be able to earn a requisitioned drink like other target employees who sell a RedCard. I also think starbucks is disconnected from the rest of a target store, and doesn't receive the help it needs when it is needed."
good,Target did not give opportunities to move up in the department. They did not want to pay you for all the work you had to do in the work place. Sad to say they are currently shut down.
good,"Great people, friendly work environment. "
good,"Not the best place, but a place to help you get some money. If your not the extreme hard working type then advancement isn't really in your future. The people are friendly though, if that counts for something."
good,"I think I would've liked working at Target but the store I was hired at was under renovation, and so they were under the heavy eye of Corporate Management, and that made the job unnecessarily stressful. I was asked if I was comfortable offering Red Cards to customers, but they did not tell me I would have a required quota for Red Cards that my job would be hinged on. During orientation, they stressed the fact that cashiers were the face of Target, and customer's lasting impressions of the store was on our shoulders. That's why excellent, inviting, upbeat customer service was so important. Once I was in the position however, it wasn't about that at all, it was about forcing Red Cards on EVERY customer that came through the line, even if they said no (my manager told me this) ""up to two times"". I was also expected to ask each customer, no matter if they had 30 items or just 1. It made me feel extremely awkward, like I was a salesperson and not a cashier. I was only given 2 warnings when I was observed not asking about Red Cards, and then was let go. It gave me a bad impression about Target overall, when I thought it would be really great."
good,"It was my first job and I was new in the country as well so it helped me a lot to get familiar with the environment."
good,"A typical day at work was signing in, and going straight to cashiering, You would stand the entire time and only get a fifteen minute break everyday. The management was poor. I worked really hard and enjoyed when I had customers that were nice."
good,Red and khakis starts to get annoying...great if you are in school...TARGET loves to outsource...if the store is not making  money then you will not get the hours...
good,Going to work at Target consists of making sure shelves are neat and stocked. Answering customer's question to the best of your ability. When cashiering was the most enjoyable
good,"I’ve made a lot of friends working at Target. I enjoy going to work, no matter which manager is there because they make you feel like family. I’ve learned so much by working here and I’ll be forever grateful."
good,"Target is a good work place. You have flexible hours and some people there can be nice. You get good pay, but if you want to apply it's kind of hard to get a job there"
good,it was fun and you actually learn. It was stressful at times due to the fact that selling red cards wasnt as easy as people made it seem. The management was a bit understanding. The hours were little and so was the pay.
good,I was a victim of discrimination when I worked here at target . The walnut creek location has very low minorities and people of color that were employed .
good,"fun workplace your co-workers are easy to work with, cashier helps customers with purchases, stocking shelves, good pay, willing to work with you on your schedule"
good,Working at target was a good job to have. Provided decent hours and a good work environment. Scheduling was flexible and management was good. Working together with coworkers was the most enjoyable part of working at Target.
good,"Working here was miserable. They gave me no security with being there and the only benefit was 10% off if you used a RED card or cash. "
good,"Fast-paced, very good pay, lack of communication between upper management and other employees, constantly changing, semi-flexible schedule, stressful during peak times (holidays, weekends, seasonal)"
good,"I've worked at target for almost 5yrs now and in the beginning it was ok, however it didn't take me long to find out what the problems were there."
good,Got a lot of good experience working for Target. Was able to work my way up and advance in my career. When you get to a certain level its all about who your boss is and who you know.
good,"It would be the best job in the world if we were actually paid according to how much work we really do. The few people left on the  hardlines sales floor team members minus the beauty section actually do the most work. We answer call buttons, cover for just about every department, answer phones, clean up behind the truck team, make the store look presentable and tend to guests. I really believe it's only my store that is this bad.We have lost so many team members and managers since the holiday season. The new management staff could be great if they didn't selfishly take all of the hours for themselves and do nothing while they're there. They also lack on communicating what they want from they're staff, new rules, new staff, etc. If the salesfloor team didn't talk to each other no one would know what's going on. My store specifically is undergoing a lot of changes but I think they're trying to improve too many things at once with an inadequate amount of staff to implement the changes."
good,Not very good hours and never know when may get sent home early. I wouldn't recommend if for anyone who has a lot of responsibilities. Its a lot better if you have a second job.
good,"There is a severe lack of accountability in the workplace that ultimately allows the hardest working people to be tasked with even more work simply because they are competent while other people are able to essentially push their work off on other people to get by. There is a clear lack of opportunities to advance at Target, especially after the mass layoffs a couple years ago. I enjoy the work I do and the team that I work on, but the lack of opportunity and accountability make it a very frustrating place to work."
good,Have worked in all areas of the store. Closing was always a hazel as that it either would be on person to various areas to have it as best organized which was OK though what made it dreadful was that others did not work as hard. Many have to pick up after others slack which is annoying when closing. scheduling is very flexible management was decent.
good,"I enjoyed working at this store as a first job, I would not recommend it as a long term job unless placed in upper management because it's not likely you'll move up."
good,Consistent hours do not exist for most people. Raises are far and few. Great people to work with. Must have patients to work the guest service desk.Not all supervisors are consistent with store policy.
good,I love to succeed in life and work myself up into a higher position. working in an environment where i do not have the opportunity to succeed is leading me to proceed for a better job opportunity.
good,I would clock in and either work the front register and or get assigned to wherever needed in the store and would assist customers with selections and inquiries.
good,"Everyday went the same the job was always the same and repetitive but the people you worked with is what made the day go by and also the fact that we could listen to our own music while working, it allows the work day to go by quicker (needed on slow days), I learned how to work hard and give the job my all so that when i leave the store after my shift i feel i did the best i could. The hardest part of the job was unloading the truck because it pushed us really hard to get done quickly so that we could get to stocking."
good,"I like working at target except for some other co-workers that bullied me, good thing I know how to stand for myself.  Salary is okay if you are new to the industry and wanted to gain experience."
good,my overall opinion of my experience at Target is really subject to the location that i work at.  i hear that there are very different experiences depending on where you work.  my experience has been mixed
good,"The culture at Target is the main focus. Making sure that the guests take first priority is always paramount. Ok management, and easy going schedules."
good,"Daily Preventative maintenance checks for approx. 4 hours, follow-up with daily breakdowns 2 hours.  placing supply orders, researching repairs and training."
good,I've worked at target for 1 and a half years I wish I had that time back....Achieved the best numbers in the company's history (NO LIE) and I was two seconds away from a promotion and it was taken away due to a technicality.
good,"While the work environment wasn't the best, I still absolutely loved my managers. I just simply couldn't believe my paid time off wasn't approved of after 3 years of no vacation. Ultimately my reason fr quitting was that I wanted to pursue the medical field"
good,"I was excited to work there after a month, but then I started to a lot of overturns, I was get paid $5 less than new hires that I helped trained in. Manager was unprofessional. This was all at the time of working there. Nor for sure how it is now."
good,"typical day was busy and there was always something to do "
good,"If you're looking for a part-time job as a cashier/salesfloor/logistics team member, Target is great and pays well.  With certain management, the HR team struggles.  Management doesn't value HR's role, leadership doesn't support HR practices, HR team isn't given enough time to do their jobs, and the pay is pretty low for the HR team.  Leadership also frustrates team members often - with scheduling, communication, etc."
good,"Bike assembler, stock floor products, worked front lanes and customer service.  I would stay at the bike rack to talk with customers and fit people for best riding position to ride bikes. I would explain how the gears worked for easy riding."
good,I love working at Target. I have been there 11year half years and fun and friends. Make new friends and meet new kind people. Work around schedule have school or college.
good,it def a good start up job. very easy going and relaxing. stocking shelves or helping customers is very simple and straight forward. they give you exactly what you need fr the day to day acivities
good,From the time I started working at target to now its like two completely different places. Management and corporate have changed so many things where its hardly recognizable anymore.
good,They fire me because they did not want me to go to school on days they were scheduling me after I had already explained to them the days that I go to school. Worse place I ever worked.
good,"I'm middle of the road, low profile, taking care of #1. My 2 cents isn't going to effect Target Corporation."
good,It is as the title says. There were WAY too many politics in the workplace and it SEVERELY impacted the efficiency. There were many days where trucks failed to be unloaded and/or products stocked because management would always stop you to do something else before you had a chance to finish.
good,"I was a cashier to start off with then got transfered to be the receiving manager.  As recieving mananger i was responsible for logging in jewelery, electronics, books and vendors.  Pay was minimum wage.  Not enough hours"
good,Typical day at work is being asked to complete your work as well as something that another person didn't get to finish on their own. Some really great people work there. Don't count on being fairly compensated or appreciated for the work you get done.
good,"Overall great starting job, I enjoy working early or late shifts. I have learned how to work with a team as well as taking orders from superiors for the overall good of the company. The most enjoyable part is working with the customers while this can also be the hardest part of the job too. Learning to work with people I believe is a valuable asset to any company looking to hire individuals."
good,Its a relax place to work very chill but also fast pace got to finish everything before the store re opens again only four hours everyday and its Monday through firday
good,"The work is by no means difficult. The pace is sometimes fast, other times faster but the mood remains professional yet not rigid. Customer service is a top priority followed by efficient logistical handling of merchandise."
good,"the hours would never stay the same, some weeks you get all 40 and some weeks you barely making it to 30 hours and the pay could have been a whole lot better"
good,Great place to work.  Long term is not an option .  Target hire more students.  Management there have favoritism but that should not matter.  As long as you do your job that should be enough.
good,Target is a great place help mold and manage talent. It can have a great culture and team environment but that is 100% dependent on the management and how they decide to run their store.
good,"The Target I worked at was pleasant and easy going or the most part. It had just opened when I was hired. There was a Starbucks and a Pizza Hut in our store so I had the  opportunity to cross train in those restaurants as well as in customer service. However even thought I was experienced in cashiering, customer service  (in returns/ photo), Starbucks and Pizza Hut I did not receive any sort of raise for the knowledge I attained. A great starter job however hours are not set and pay was minimum wage.  Managers were nice and positive."
good,Workplace culture is pretty relaxed depending on what department you are in it can be fast paced. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing your regular guests on a weekly basis.
good,"When I first started working there, I loved the job! Hours were flexible. Environment was cool. After a while, things started to change. It was fun but not a place of advancement for someone like me."
good,"The reason i had a bad experience was because of my boss. He expected a lot more out of me, wanted me to work 200% every single minute over a 4 hour period without breaks, after the 4th hour i got a 15 minute break, not a minute more. "
good,"Target Optical depending on where you work can be a pretty decent job I really enjoyed working with all the other stores that I went to,unforchunately it's that one or two people who make your experience a bad one and when you try and talk to upper management (who are on there side not yours)  it trickles right back down to the person who has an underlying issue with you and then suddenly starts finding any reason they can to remind you that you can get fired for just about any reason they want, and then stalk you at work including the other stores you work at including pictures of what your doing."
good,"I worked at target as a seasonal apparel sales associate for a couple of months. I had a good time overall, I learned a lot about dealing with unruly people as well as just how soul sucking a retail job can truly be. I left mostly because my hours were terrible and declining steadily each week. I also left because of the general public. I dealt with too many crazy people that would harass me and even had things stolen from my car while I was at work there. Beyond that, I found no opportunity for advancement within the company since there were people who had been there for years still doing the lame tasks that I did as a new member. I think TArget is a great place to work if you like a team atmosphere and a constantly changing work environment. I ended up leaving, however due to terrible scheduling and feeling unsafe."
good,"While the pay is nice, sometimes the environment isn't worth it compared to other jobs in the same field that are less stressful. During my experience at Target, (at least at the current store i'm working at.) clerks are consistently not showing up because of the work environment provided at Target. From the knowledge I have, it has something to do with he expectations given to the management by their superiors, and the stress of those expectations are passed down to the clerks who are making much less than the management. This creates an environment that is difficult to cooperate with on a daily basis. When the job isn't stressed by unreachable expectations from the management, it can be a very great way to make above average pay."
good,Management does not care for the overall well being they hound you for using sick hours make it difficult to use sick hours and they deny all requests for vacation hours if HR is not personally reminded 3 times a week three weeks before hand. they refuse to give quality food we had canned chili for thanksgiving and Christmas not even some chips .
good,"every morning there was a meeting about how well everyone did the day before."
good,depending on the department your working in overall its okay but stressful. nothing more than a okay part time job. some of the mangers don't like to do their job so they'll call you to.
good,working at target was nice besides the fact that you NEED to keep get redcards every week to insure your stay after the 3 months from when you started.
good,"of the other managers, don't expect to be moved up. Ever notice how all the managers at target look alike? No guaranteed hours, some weeks as low as 8 hours, some almost 40. I worked there about 5 years and barely got any raises. I was given keys to the cash office, was forced to cover all the management duties without getting paid management pay. I trained the people that were hired to be MY BOSS, yet wouldn't promote me. Because i wasn't friends with all the managers and i didn't look like all of them. TONS of favoritism. But overall for maybe a first job, It's a great place to start out, but could never make a career of it."
good,The hardest part of the job was back stocking the products after distributing out the products. The best part of the job was talking to people and helping out.
good,"Target is an awesome place to work as far as the way the store is run, the people you work with typically have good attitudes and most people are friendly but they do not have any benefits basically and nothing to secure they're employees"
good,"Set up new Planograms/revisions by measuring and adjusting shelves, peg hooks and fixtures, stocked merchandise, and provided customer service by greeting and offering assistance to customers."
good,Changed leaders to many times that cause team to to get to know who your working with that way team could be a better working team together. And much happier team
good,"A typical day at work consist of picking up clothes off the floor branding zoning working the truck push and reshop. I have learned how to do price changes, work the back room, scan the truck, in stock, "
good,Had fun when first started but got bad. Hrs were not good and for what had to do pay was losey. Was not full time and the drive was not good. If late even a little you were written up.
good,"I have not worked at target in a long time so I do not know in what direction the company is going. However, I do know that if you did not have a degree from HU/ODU then you were not considered for management which I do not think is fair."
good,Target is a place that only seems to care about money that comes in and not the employees that are there. They forget that if the employees don't feel like the uppers care about them the work will go down.
good,Management changes every so often  it's boring doing repetitive things new hires are lazy and not motivated  double work  some times you can't take every break on the shift board some times it's stressful pay is good if you get enough hours
good,"It’s a very relaxed and entertaining work place, they have great people that work there. Definitely not disappointed with working at target, but more hours would have been a great help."
good,"To sum it up the management are snakes. Don't plan on getting hired after 90 days. but the other employees are amazing, super friendly, and helpful. The pay makes it worth it. Along with the other employees."
good,"Id go in about 10 minutes early to organize my register, greet customers and help them find things they needed, or help to find something, management was not the best, not very helpful and when the front end was unorganized or cart attendants weren't doing their jobs too I had to used my break to clean the entire front end, instead of managers asking other workers to complete the job they were hired for."
good,"Liked working on the truck unloaded and pushing the boxes on to the conveyor belt. Fast paced, made time go by fast. Would have liked to be hired on full time."
good,"A typical day at Target is never boring, there is much to do especially when it comes time to the holidays. The enviorment you are in is very friendly and welcoming. The management team tries to help with every possible way they can. The hardest part of the job might be the the rushes but they are also the best part because they put you through your paces."
good,"Target is an interesting environment, differing from store to store. Your best way to gauge how well you think you'd fit in at your local Target is to talk to team members currently employed at that specific store."
good,"Get to work, clock in, warm up, hit the line your place on, and begin packing boxes. Some right out of college manger's that have no leadership skillls or dont know how to manage. for a 12 hour shift you only get one 20 minute break and one 30 minute lunch break, so the rest of the time you are standing on the concrete floor, moving along the line .Meeting new people and having good conversation while working was a plus day to day."
good,Decent work place left cause of pay at the end of the day I've got to pay bills so had to get another job but i liked most of the people i worked with.
good,Great starter job for teens. Good for retirees.There is room to grow and get into upper management.Co workers are friendly and very helpful.There are opportunities to learn each department.
good,it was a a good job to have. the only issue would be management. not being able to communicate wit them about anything. if you are going through an issue they dont care for it.
good,target is a good place to work if your going to school or have more than one job because there really good with working around your schedule as well as working around family schedules like I have a family day every sunday and when I first started I didn't have sunday off I went to hr and they flat out told me no and said I should have put it on the app. I went back and talked to a manager because family is very important to me and I have had every sunday off we have good management as far as team leads and lods but there is a small communication problem with target.
good,"if you need a semi quick income this is for you but if you don't have the time and or hours to dedicate then this job is not for you since you have auto generated  shifts. "
good,"Management focused on gaining visibility instead of developing teams. Very ""status-oriented"" culture with lots of networking required- i.e. ""coffee statuses""."
good,"My ETL is awesome.  Constant feedback both good and bad, which is great.  You always know where you stand and any improvements to make.  Fellow employees are great too.  Only one fellow TL is disruptive, but there are always one at every work place.  Retail is what it is, always changing and trying to keep competitive in an online world.  You never know if your big box store is going to close.  Hours vary week to week, your benefits coverage depends on your average hours.  If those drop consistently, then there goes your benefits."
good,"Targets is a good place to work. If you do your job , job security was excellent. They also provide good benefits. The only thing I did not like was the hours"
good,Worked at target at Boca Chica. Only one location. Most of times when visiting store looks like they need more customers. Store is big but doesn’t measure to Walmart.
good,a good place to go while in school looking to make extra money and not looking for very much hours. You have to have a college degree to really get far with the company but is somethihng you can do with the company.
good,"The most enjoyable part of a job is to see a customer leave with a smile on their face after checking them out. The hardest Part to get extra hours more than 20 hours a week. A typical day includes the ability to satisfy the customer through consistent and quality of service, check out the guest while chatting with them, and to make sure that my work area is pick up and clean. What I have learned from this job is that doing small things can make someone day."
good,"I enjoyed being a part of the team, and had the opportunity to work alongside some great role models. I learned a great deal and had the opportunity to utilize those skills."
good,"Most of the people including managers were great! Being a Guest Service Attendant however was not great. It is a position in which it is hard to feel ownership for the front end. You train new hires, but you can't actually hold them accountable. You can't alter the schedule, but you have to be flexible in how you manage the store's assets when it gets busy up front. You have to handle guest complaints but you are not a manager. You are not a cashier, nor service desk team member, nor a team leader. You're just kind of stuck in limbo. Leadership needs to do more to incorporate the GSA position into the leadership of the store. They also need to make GSA a position that does more to prep them for more responsibility. Overall, it was an okay job with some really fun people, but I wouldn't recommend it as a career."
good,"Pretty laid back and everyone works together as team, management is considerate of employee concerns and will try their best to help. Its a pretty great beginners job to gain experiences and skills."
good,"the place would be a good work site if they learned to be a team. the managers are self-centered , and very lazy. they do little to nothing for their team."
good,"I would not recommend this job if you are looking for a set of stable work hours. The amount of hours you receive is really determined by how well the store is doing, which they DO NOT mention in the interview"
good,"It's a good first job to have, but the scheduling is ridiculous. Trying to work here and attend classes isn't working, because of the hours I have. Breaks are too short for the amount of time we actually have to work. Some employees just leave their carts around and don't do their jobs, which leaves other workers having to do them. The staff calls team huddles at the worst times and just stands around watching newer employees for most of their shifts."
good,"Working at target isnt that bad, we are just limited when it comes to hours. You never know when you will work or how long you will work. Too much supervision but not enough help or equipment to complete the tasks that you need to perform."
good,"A typical day at Target as a Guest Service Assistant (supervisor) involved opening / closing cash registers; general cleanup; front end display set up and take down.  Ensuring all displays stocked and neat; coordinating breaks and lunches; gathering carts or assigning cart duties; handling guest inquiries and issues; cleaning bathrooms; Cashier and Guest Service backup.  Coordinate check lane flow (ensuring quick, friendly service); promoting Target Red Card.  Assist management with various tasks as needed."
good,"I worked for target for 2 year and , in them 2 years I was able to learn a collective of things , move up in the team  become and do things I wouldn't have thought id be able to do overall great job.."
good,I love target because it was my first real job while I was attending college gave me plenty of hours and work around a lot of peers my age. Target allow me to grow with the company staring off as a cashier then ending up running the whole electronic sections great experience
good,"Target was the first real job I had and I am thankful to have started my work experience with this company because I learned a lot."
good,"Team members are friendly and helpful, management is not. Understaffed so the workload is double and very stressful. They recently increased the base pay but when I was employed there it was very low for the workload."
good,"A lot of opportunity to cross train in work stations but you can end up doing more work than what you are paid. I managed to get promoted quickly by my work ethic, consistently working all my shifts (not calling out) and my flexibility to work different shifts. But this is not conducive when you have a young child or children. It is tough to balance both."
good,j'ai bien aimer travailler chez target mais je trouvais que c'était un peu désorganisé et pas assez productif a mon gout et je pense ces peut etre une raison pourquoi sa fermer au quebec
good,"Get your work out on. Be Fast, Fun and Friendly! Be safety minded. Follow set procedures and protocols. Give your best everyday in every thing you do."
good,"Work can be physically demanding for long periods of the workday, but it is expected and accepted to take time to acclimate to. Great emphasis is placed on providing quality customer service, and doing so is made easy by accessible resources, equipment, and supportive teammates."
good,I enjoyed working at Target.I meet really nice people. The management team was excellent. My sister worked for the company as well for 5 years. The hours were great. It was convenient for commute to and from.
good,Good company as a whole to work for. They usually care about the employees. Management usually consists of fresh out of college kids that are receiving the biggest paychecks they have ever seen and are afraid of losing that. This has caused some issues with qualifications and professionalism. Loss prevention is based off quotas regardless of what anyone else says and the numbers are excessive and unreasonable.
good,"Target, out of many of the available retail stores, is considerably an average work place. There are many other retail stores where it is worse, but this isn't the best. My co-workers were great! But the management was poor. The whole reason I quit was because of one manager that made my job extraordinarily harder than it had to be. The work as well can be a bit stressful, often time we were incredibly understaffed, making the work load on my shoulders immense. But when we did have the correct amount of people, it was a lot more manageable."
good,"Typical day involves restocking clothes and the typical duties associated with being a cashier. The workplace culture is lacking, although the people that work there are quite friendly. Management was friendly, as well. The most enjoyable part of the job was the flexible span of work hours available... and a discount on clothing and home goods."
good,"No set schedule."
good,"This is a good first job for anyone, I simply lived too far away at the end and the team atmosphere was nonexistent even though that is supposed to be their main concern."
good,"I worked with a Manager that was jealous of the fact that I had 4 children from 1 dude, that was my husband.  She thought I had different baby daddy's, so she cut my hours and I left."
good,Typical day at work would be to come in at about 10-10:30 clock and go straight to the truck we go from the truck unload to the floor bowl-out from there to the actual stocking process when stocking is done it’s either zoning or the back room or‘s are being removed from the clock and sent home. What I have learned is the process of the store front to back the difficulty of making it to the next level of management and that the workplace culture is very demanding the hardest part of the job is dealing with attitudes about predetermined timelines for areas of the store. The most important or enjoyable part of the job was learning all aspects of the store.
good,"Very stressful environment especially with managers who do not seem to care about the overall culture of the team. Not enough hours being given for everyone to successfully complete tasks for their areas so stress is at an all time high. I loved working here when I started five years ago, but poor management and leadership decisions has caused the friendly culture to all but disappear."
good,I do not wish to have my review on here. If you chose to work at Target you are agreeing to work hard. The most enjoyable part is getting to clock out.
good,Work environment depends entirely on upper management. The front end is the worst to work at due to the requirement of getting guests to sign up for credit and debit card accounts.
good,"The training was person to person and the job advancement was easy. However, they are very strict on hours and either give you no hours at all so you can't pay your bills or too many and you can't work with your school schedule. However, a very big department store with a lot of college students working their first part time job but not a place to work full time unless you are a manager. Overall adequate job environment"
good,"what i learned working at target is how to communicate and deal with different people. cashier experience. target is a very fun and professional place to work, managers always very helpful. the hardest part of the job was when customers got upset because the item  that they want  didnt have a location at our store and they had to drive to another store so i had to hear their complains.the most enjoyable part helping customers to find the item they were looking for and seeing them leave with a smile on their face and also when i got good compliments regarding my job."
good,"If you do not like working, being productive, and can not handle multiple personalities then you should not apply. If not then sure go ahead, apply. Have fun!"
good,A typical day was making sure cashiers has what they needed to do their jobs. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers at the Service Desk.
good,"stressful and too much for one man to carry alone."
good,"Working for Target is rather fast-paced. Depending on which store you work at and the manager you get for your section, this job can be fairly relaxing. However, in certain situations you may be working in sections of the store your not familiar with, which can pose a problem for those who aren't able to handle a sudden change in pace."
good,The current CEO plan of reducing store expense included eliminating the team members who have been with the company for 10+ years.  Store management was looking for any reason to write said people up to eventually release them or get them to leave on their own.
good,"Most days would be the same. Stocking items, answering peoples questions and helping out my team members. Most of the workers there were very nice and it was easy to make friends."
good,"Often times understaffed in order to save money, like most stores. Never a 40 hour work week. Some managers were childish and unprofesional. Most employees were very nice."
good,"It has been a few years since I left, but the culture at the time was to routinely pass over experienced employees and hire recent college grads to fill management positions instead. Furthermore, several stores had their hours cut drastically even though sales, foot traffic, and basket size had all increased steadily over the past several years."
good,"I worked there 10 years, and for mist of it I really enjoyed my job. Then there was a change in management and the new team of younger just out of college youngsters that were rude and concerned only for themselves and not their team come on board. They treated the general team members that Target was built on there had work like they were nothing!  Whenever they the new management did something wrong they would throw the blame on the team members and throw them under the bus!  I actually had a member of Management tell me "" I cant back you up to the Store Team Lead, I got to protect myself""!"
good,"It was a pretty decent place to work. Low stress (depending on LOD that day), nice atmosphere, friendly co-workers. Hours are very inconsistent when you start. If they like you, they'll schedule you more. The pay is minimum wage when you start and every quarter you get a performance review + (possibly) a raise. Not a lot of room for growth since there positions that pay more are pretty limited. They were a bit unorganized and would schedule me for days that I said I could not work. You also have to work a lot of holidays or never holidays. I worked Christmas Eve, day after Christmas, Black Friday, Thanksgiving, Fourth of July, and day after New Year's."
good,"Management turnover rate is too high. Most managers don't stay past 90 introductory period. Policies and rules change constantly, a repeating cycle that never ends. Favoritism is given to a select few employees that excel at brown nosing. Arizona target gives us the minimum required breaks by law. Surpassing work expectations gets you absolutely nothing. Employees that do a bad job can't be fired unless they commit murder."
good,"This was a great first job after college.  Lots of Customer Service experience.  Would not recommend this as a career due to lack of ""work-life"" balance.  You work every other weekend and all holidays.  The shifts can change weekly."
good,It's a ok job to work at if you are in high school or college . Ok work environment always doing something . Never really have a set job always floating or helping other people in different departments.
good,Stress was due from the team leaders always on your case about acquiring a Red Card from the customer.   No matter how many times you ask a customer and their answer is NO than manager should understand it is not in the control of the associate to acquire at least one a day.
good,People are real friendly. They push you to do your best all the time. very big on Praise and Thank you. They also give back to the community as a company and also as indiduals.
good,A typical day at work was as expected for a retail store. The management I worked underneath was pretty pedestrian. The culture was consistent with the general population. ?the hardest part of the job was closing at the end of the day. The most enjoyable was part of the job was company events.
good,"I am thankful for Target, I was happy to be apart of the team the starting rate for a GSA is 9% lower than the national average and I was not able to sustain my lifestyle on that. I learned so much and management was ideal the culture was great what I loved most was working with all walks of life and how no two days were the same!!"
good,"This was a tough job but a great learning experience. I got the opportunity to manage a team of people and to manage a department. Target is great about training and developing their employees. This is something that prepared me in a lot of ways for my following jobs."
good,"A place clashed with both likable and unlikable co-workers and management. You learn on hand, but not given time to properly grow as a employee. However engaging conversation with both employees and customers can lead to a healthy relationship."
good,"the job isn't hard, you're right but we probably don't know as much as you think we do. we are trying our hardest and your self entitled attitude isn't going to make things move along any easier."
good,Very busy and did not really feel fully appreciated. Worked extremely hard and always available when needed. Lack of appreciation and recognition as well as pay.
good,Multitasking is key.  Work hard and keep commitments.  Multiasking is key.  Work life balance can be difficult depending on the business.  Managing time effectively can be difficult.
good,"This job started out as a seasonal employee but I worked my butt of in order to show the management that I was worth keeping after the holidays. When your check out speed is efficient , it won't go without being recognized."
good,I was a student while having this job and I typically worked as soon as school let out until close. It was a very stressful job especially when you couldn't get people to sign up for redcards (target's debit/credit card). Otherwise it was pretty decent the hours would go by pretty fast as Target is a very popular store.
good,"I worked for Target for nine years and learned a lot.  I was a Front end team lead, soft lines team lead and an human resources team lead. The most frustrated part of this job would be not having the opportunity for advancement.  With Target you have to have a college degree to advance beyond team lead.  They do not take work history or longevity into consideration for promotion.  You are good enough to train the college kids coming in as your boss, you just can not be the boss."
good,Work place culture was solid. Was am ETL with the company for 5 years and had 5 Store Team Leaders and 4 District Team Leaders. This made my development within the company hard to grow and I felt stuck in the position I currently am. Compensation as far as salary is great but work life balance is tough to manage.
good,"I rather not discuss this employer, this is in the past and i choose not to talk about it. I was laid off and they didnt give a notice ahead of time, and denied unemployment, not a worthy place."
good,"good to have a job, however, the culture of Target is never to compliment good work, but only to point out mistakes... It suppresses a work atmosphere for positive reinforcement.   To put in a hard days' work, knowing you did a good job, only to have a member of management tell you that ""this was not right, or that was wrong""...  I don't think the role of management is to look for things wrong with an employee....If there is something wrong, yes address it and fix it.  Better yet, I think the role of management is to look for what employees are doing ""right"".. and let them know...It goes a whole lot farther at end of day with any employee."
good,Great place to work. Co workers are great and helpful. Loved job recently new management came in and place started to get worse and team morale went down. All they cared about was cutting cost not employee. Made job less fun and more stressful.
good,Most of the time I enjoy my work at Target.  It is fast paced and the people I work with are friendly.  The hardest part is knowing how many hours you will be scheduled for each week.  I am available full time but sometimes scheduled less than 20 hours a week.
good,"There are many departments to work for at Target. The department I worked in most was as a barista in the stores Starbucks. I enjoyed being a barista because it was fast paced, and fun; but there were other departments I wanted to cross train in to better my work experience and knowledge. Sadly, although communicating this to multiple supervisors, and managers they denied my request because we were always short handed in Starbucks. "
good,Very stressful culture due to unrealistic timelines for project deliveries. Also working with offshore had its challenges due to the time difference..
good,Typical retail job but bearable. The culture of Target was in the right place but not always followed by management. At the end of the day the sales goal was always mattered not how hard you worked.
good,Typical day consists of going in and doing your duty to the best of your abilities. I learned how to work within a team. The management varies depending on who you work with. Hardest part of the job was waking up at 3am in the morning. Most enjoyable part was that it was fun for me.
good,"You are constantly ulled in different directions which make it a great place to work for multi-taskers. The fast-pace culture keeps you on your toes, however intereferes with work life balance."
good,I enjoyed working with my co workers and the job itself was great but the leadership was poor.  It's better to hire leadership positions with people who are qualified from experience than from education or a degree.  Everyone is not leadership material.
good,I've had several scheduling conflicts and each time I've spoken with them about it they have worked with me. The management is unprofessional except for a couple of them.
good,"Working at target was pretty good. The over night stocking will for sure keep you in shape. The whole process of unloading a truck was pretty interesting to me, and it was an experience where you could learn a lot from it."
good,Has the potential to be a great workplace but is over run with the inability to communicate and the unwillingness to work with availability. People placed in the correct area of work would make a big difference. Most of the people are great and hard working but it is hard to pick up the slack from the few who do not do what they could.
good,It was a great opportunity to gain management experience under your belt. Target needs to work on balancing work and life and job politics for employees
good,"I was hired as a seasonal cashier and moved up to a Guest Service position 5 months later. The pay and co-workers made the job bearable because I was there almost every week/weekend closing. Which was fine at first but it drove me crazy near the end of my employment there. I tried to move up to become a manager for the front lanes but the managers were always putting someone else in front of me and kept giving me excuses that did not even make sense. I transferred to a different Target due to a move and they treated me as if I was brand new to the company. I was back at the bottom as a cashier again and I did not enjoy it because the store I transferred too had way too many issues. Overall, its a good place to start if you're young and looking for something part-time, just try not to stay there forever."
good,There is room for advancement at Target but the work life balance is awful.  It is retail so you will work every single holiday no matter what.  They only close 3 days per year.
good,"If management likes you, you will go places but if they do not like you, you will normally be called weekly about little things building a case against you. Training is bad, they only teach you the basics and nothing else, but they will hold you accountable for all of it even things you were not taught."
good,"Target really needs to upgrade their cashier system. The people there are really prejudice. The store is a great place to shop because I love target, but I would always get a racism vibe when I used to work there."
good,"You need a wide range of availability and they will try to call you if they are short-staffed. Say goodbye to weekends. Learn as much as you can about how the store works and do some cross training. Unless you are specifically hired for the morning team, you can be opening one day and closing the next."
good,"It was a seasonal job for holidays, enjoyed the customers.  Fun."
good,It was a good experience as well so I managed to contribute to the development of the company as I had good leadership skills as well as management is
good,"Unequal job titles. Some individuals do very little work and if you're like me you'll be working twice as hard for the same paycheck someone else makes doing half of what you're expected to do. I worked for target distribution for over three years, unloading trailers by hand in a very dirty and hot environment. The only thing to look forward to working in their distribution center are the paychecks. If you are willing to trade your physical well being for great pay this is the place for you."
good,Low pay. Something for the moment. Don't expect advancements because those only go to favoritism. There are a lot of corporate politics. I had a great team that kept me going.
good,"* Working from 9am to 5pm"
good,"It used to be a fun place to work at when i first started working there. But as the managers changed work started becoming more stressful. The amount of work required from you is as expected, however some of the supervisors and managers like to pile some of their work load on you and when you fail to do so they actually give you a bad review."
good,"A typical day at work for me is putting clothes away and fixing what people mess up while shopping. I also help people find anything they're looking for. This job isn't rocket science, but it can sometimes be stressful since the managers can expect too much from employees. Overall, the people who work there are pretty nice, but a lot of the people who shop aren't always as nice. If you don't like dealing with people, I wouldn't recommend this job. Scheduling is pretty flexible, however, they often over schedule or schedule outside people's availability which can be annoying."
good,"I have been working for Target for three years now. I have bachelors degree in Business Administration, and was told how I could easily advance through the ranks to and Executive Team Lead role. However what I have seen in reality is that they would much rather hire college seniors, that have little to no retail experience, for a 6 week internship program then move them into Executive roles. They talk a lot about how they want people to advance and have little meetings periodically to pretend like they will do something for you, but it ends up being lateral movements with minimal pay increases."
good,Although this job builds great customer service experience and network the overall atmosphere of job fairness is poor. The chance to move up is hardly available as the position seems to be filled before hand. The scheduling is not always accommodating and will be created to work employees the maximum without providing a lunch break.
good,They were good at being flexible with hours when I was pregnant but that's about it. The people I worked with where always fun and nice but the management was not great.
good,"A typical day of work at Target Corporation in Miami, FL is a bit difficult to describe. I was hired on almost immediately, and continued from there. I was given something below the average for the morning training, and received more training during the second shifts, my primary shifts. I distinctly remember being assigned the morning shift three times in a row, unsupervised and without guidance. Needless to say, I was reprimanded for being unprepared, and when I brought this to Human Resources, I was shrugged off and given lectures because I should have known how to do things, as opposed to having been taught how to do things. My co-workers were pleasant, save for one, who could not contain their emotion. They allowed their child behind into the employees-only area, and took frequent breaks. At the end of each shift, a team manager comes by and checks on your work. My team manager always commended me on what I did do right, and taught me better and more efficient ways to do my duties. I think the hardest part of the job was opening during the mornings without any assistance or training. I strongly do not wish to relive this at any company again. As for the most enjoyable part, the work environment was one of the best, and while my team did not fulfill their roles to the best of their abilities, the rest of the teams and management were excellent."
good,"Always be Customer friendly. Help your fella co-workers.Be on time for work. Need to be felixable,  work as a cashier floor person. Etc...keep your area clean."
good,"Target itself is an awesome place. It's very inclusive and has a very fun, team culture that prides itself on its involvement in the community. "
good,"Cashier, nothing to exciting . work times varied only pt was availble so you could possilbly work elsewhere if you needed a second job. Coworkers not the most pleasant."
good,Good place to work nice co workers ok pay work good hours  when busy. Hours will get cut if they do not make enough money. Hours will be cut to about half until they make enough money
good,"Could have been fun to continue working longer."
good,"My work day started at 4am. I could have come in at 6am but I got an extra $1 per hour if I was at work before 5am. The staff try to make it as enjoyable as possible, and it really wasn't a bad job. The staff members that weren't just using it as a stepping stone were actually really great to work with. I made some good friends there."
good,Outstanding compensation and benefits.  Too many inexperienced managers fresh out of college trying to change the world creates a stressful day.  This was a great lesson in patience and learning to prioritize responsibilities.  Managers seemed more concerned with their bonuses than the sales or bottom line.  Never felt appreciated here and that is why I decided to seek better opportunities.
good,Fast passed work days with lots of interaction. Sadly there is little to no opportunity for advancement or carrier development. Good for work experience and a steady pay check but not a long term job solution.
good,Decent company to work for. Had work and life balance. Willing to work with your schedule. Not too much micro managing. Decent enough pay. No long hours
good,"A day at work consist of checking in with my LOD. Head to my scheduled area for that day, assisting guest, helping with fast service at the checklanes and finally informing the guest of Targets benefits of the RED Card."
good,This is a good place to start earning experience. It does not take long to learn your job and they take their time to train you properly. Management lets you work around your school schedule which makes it easier to work here and go to school.
good,Only concerned  about how many Red Cards the stores get every day. It also goes on your reviews  and if you didn't  get enough red cards verses the amount of trasactions you had you could be terminated  or just not get your .20 raise.
good,"too much politics and under table discussions, not a lot of things are transparent. not a lot of new things to learn. environment is good but it is tarnished by all the politics."
good,"This company is friendly, fun, and fast. All employees are treated as family. Iv'e become a social, responsible, organized, friendly member of society because of this job. You start the day not knowing what to expect, I learned to be empathetic for others, the management is both friendly and occasionally authoritative, hardest part of the job is meeting managements expectations of you for such a low salary. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friends you make, the laughs."
good,Most attitudes about a retail environment become a reality when it is assumed to be miserable. Unfortunately this trend was evident and provided a stressful work environment.
good,Great job to gain experience but the fact they would shove the promotion of Redcard sales down your throat was ridiculous. It was also hard to deal with a majority of the customers because they see the red shirt and expect you to bow down to them.
good,"Good place to work with many benefits and awesome environment."
good,Target will promote people quickly if they are good at what they do and don't mind working long hours. There is not much of a work life balance. When you are supposed to be off you're not. You work every other weekend and there is no such thing as a set schedule. Long hours and you work on national holidays.
good,"Target was close to where I lived and they worked well with my school schedule, the culture for the team members is great. I worked there for about 2 years and would recommend it to anyone who needed a part-time job."
good,"Target encourages students to go to college and promises to help them through it. However for me, they never would work with me schedule. Continuously asked for my schedule to be changed that way I wouldn't be dropped. But they said there wasn't anything they could do about it. The overall atmosphere was not the greatest. The sewer lines broke and drainage flooded the cafe seating area. cleanliness as am employees were out of our control. Management was like clock work though which was nice."
good,Enjoyed my position and the work that I did. The only problem was the inconsistency in knowing how many hours they were going to keep us each day. Ended up not being enough consistent work for me to support my daughter and I.
good,"My time in the soft lines department gave me a very clear idea for work in retail. I was given the opportunity to specialize in different areas like working the cash register, I was taught about the general workflow and expectations. At times it felt as if the newer team members were generally disliked and any behaviour seeming unproductive was swiftly reprimanded. I appreciate the opportunity to experience that environment."
good,"typical day at work is pretty fun, you get to stock merchandise, pull out items, set the line for the truck and help anybody in the store who requires assistance. the management was really good, there's a lot of team leaders who know the stress of the job but there's a few team leaders who were so lazy, nobody liked them and they love to boss people around instead of leading them"
good,"I have been with Target for nearly 6 years and the management totally dictates how well the job is.  I've had bosses that made work a living nightmare, where I was puking at work and they still wouldn't let me go home, but also had bosses that are totally concerned with my well being and life outside of work and want to know my legitimate thoughts on things about improvement around the workplace."
good,A typical day at work consists of me ringing in all guest items and make sure the overall experience was good. I have learned to be very patient and understanding. The work place overall is fast and fun. I enjoy helping guests the most and making sure they have the best experience with our company.
good,"Management - Don't forget that your people are only as good as the information that you give them."
good,My overall experience has been mixed due to the amount of hours given. Target is very stingy about their pay and give no more than 20 hours a week. This is not a job where you can support yourself. Many I have worked with had a second job during the day. The job can be demanding and tiring if you do not rest during the day.
good,"A typical day at work for me is in the office handling all paperwork, staffing, and scheduling of the store. The hours vastly vary every week; advancement is rare and does not occur often."
good,"Ok place to work, with fun people and decent management. A lot of changes that don't make sense and the benefits aren't that great have to be full-time to get good benefits."
good,"When I first started for the company in St. Cloud, MN, I thought the company was fantastic. I believe it was due to the leaders that were at that particular store. I spent almost two years at the Target store in Crossroads Center Mall in St. Cloud. It was a fantastic 2 years."
good,"Working for Target wasn't all that bad. Management was friendly and encouraging, but at times way to pushy with selling  Redcards. If you ever work there, be prepared to be asked to open a Redcard every shift. (Atleast with my experience) I was a cashier, and for the most part customers were friendly. It wasn't a terrible first job, but I wouldn't go back."
good,It's a productive place to work in .the money is great however at different locations management isn't exactly the best. You must have great customer service
good,"The job is easy but when you go above and beyond their expectations they take full advantage of it and ask for more. In the end target is the one winning hardworkers are helping targets profitability. however in reality you are short changing yourself financially. in my 5 years target cares less about your ability to do excessive work. They could care less if you finish in a timely manner they only pay a wage that maintains their profitability. when it comes down to it head count and store hours are literally all that matters, after working at target i'm realizing the one who does bare minimal is the wiser one because we get paid the same regardless target is not a organization that will compensate you for your abilities to perform various tasks in a timely manner. Target makes decisions based on what is best for target not its team member well being."
good,The management expects way too much out of their employers to the point where I voluntarily skipped breaks to get the work done. These unrealistic expectations causes undeserved backlash on workers.
good,They are slowly taking away the night shift position not much job security. I have been here for a year. They expect alot of you every night but give you nothing as far as hours.
good,"Overall a fun, but dead end job.  Corporate culture makes things pleasent and free food is common. Did not pay great, and hours are not great. little room for advancement."
good,"A typical work day would involve food production and preparation, restocking department shelves, and customer service. All of these tasks are assumed and require little to no supervision or even training as they are not difficult tasks. A supervisor will come along and redundantly ask team members if they are going to do specific tasks or that they should be doing aforementioned tasks. Supervisor interaction happens several times a day depending on whether or not there is a visit from corporate. Supervisors also want several things to happen at once without allocating the proper labor to the task, making it so that team members must work harder to fulfill supervisor demands, often to no avail due to lack of hours."
good,"there is absolutely no opportunities for people under 21 to move up in the company. each department in the store works against eachother, forming a kind of war. departments are never willing to help out another department that has requested assistance"
good,"I was only seasonal there so I felt like an outsider because most people have been working there for years, but they work was fine you had to meet a quota ever or get in trouble."
good,"The place is alright for a high school job, but after college and receiving a degree Target doesn't doesn't pay enough money for the bills.  Management was always very friendly.  High employee turn over rate."
good,Had a temporary seasonal job there. I was placed at register and told to stand there. Was not allowed cross training until they decided if they wanted to keep you longer.
good,"Target is a very fast paced job with a lot of internal politics. They do things their own way and tend to stick with people they like. If you ware willing to fake it till you make it then you will do fine here. They often feed you, which is nice. It is obvious that some positions are just better treated in general because of where they are situated in the store."
good,"Not a bad place. Not great pay. Work uninteresting. Typical day is straightening shelves, restocking shelves. In most departments you work alone. Very boring work."
good,"Poor managerial job all-around. Felt like everyone wanted to be a leader. So instead of a good working environment, it just felt overcrowded with wannabe leaders"
good,I have worked for several retail corporations in the past on was not the worst.  The compensation was not bad but the opportunity for advancement was not there unless you had a degree.
good,The management at the store where I worked could've been better. I stopped enjoying work and started to dred it. I'd work at a different target. But definitely not the same store.
good,This job can be both fun and frustrating at the same time. They want full availability but cant guarantee you hours. the environment is busy and fast paced.
good,"working at a store level is a low stress job, but if you want to move up within target its probably not going to happen, they offer great benefits so that a plus."
good,I enjoyed meeting new coworkers that from all over the world. I have learned a lot from them all and we have all made a magnificent team while working together.
good,"Very stressful to work at after my first year due to constant shift in managers, but they supplied food for free in the break room. They promised me a position to work in the electronics department, but then shifted me towards Cart Attendant and gave the position to another employee. This was all during the same manager time period."
good,"This job can either be easy or difficult depending on what manger (LOD) is in that day. Also, at least at my store, they only schedule one person for the entire hardlines half of the store except electronics. Sometimes they will make you leave 5 minutes early so they do not have to give you a lunch. They tend to not give full time hours to avoid giving benefits"
good,Always on the move ready for the newest trends Target wants their employees to be fast friendly and  in the know. they are always flexible with time management.
good,Great first real world job I had.  Working for a large corporation has certain benefits like deep discounts on items in the store and at all their locations.  Great co workers and work atmosphere.
good,"Target welcomes all types of people to work for them but I have found it hard to advance and hours are not always steady. Generally, Target will only hire for part time, no longer full time which makes it near impossible to be eligible for benefits."
good,"On Monday Wednesday and Fridays I unload trucks and get the product to the floor. I train  between 3 to 4 girls on these days, other days I am either  pricing cashing or putting more product on the floor. The hardest part of the job is not getting hours to be able to make it. I am a happy go lucky kind of person I always come in with a smile and say good morning to everyone. I even make the guest feel welcomed. And help them find what they are looking for."
good,"Target is a great company to work for as long as supervisors are great. When I first started I didn't have any problems and I moved up fairly quickly. Towards the end however, I started to notice that management was not looking out for you or your team members and wanted to get everything done to help them. Since it was a college town, we were always short staffed and needed help from leaders and executive leaders but they were always too busy in their office. One thing I have learned working there is don't count on your leaders because they are not leaders and only look out for themselves. They will throw you under the bus no problem. I really enjoyed the customers that came in and my department."
good,My work experience here was good. always fast paced and you always have something to do. You meet new people every day and you can also help out in different departments.
good,"Working for one of the U.S largest companies.. Target was fast-paced, especially during the holidays. The hours were long, and required all of your focus and attention.  Many people came from other cities, to grab the deal we were having. I was a cashier, and i had to be sure to count the cash and distribute the right amount of change in a quick and timely manner. My days ended with restock and putting everything back into it's place..that could take anywhere from 1 to 3 hours."
good,My manager was aweful. I was treated unfairly. When it was time for a raise I received $0.08. They push their red cards way too much. I got yelled at all the time by customers just for asking if they had one.
good,Great job good pay and benefits low raises it's all about team work a great team will make your job much more fun and create a happier environment. Work hard
good,"It was very enjoyable in the very beginning, but after the honeymoon was over broke loose.  Was not a good fit for people that want work life balance as there is no such thing here at Target."
good,"Target is as you'd expect if you've ever worked a similar job in retail or customer service. Like any job, you're subject to the personalities you work with but the culture of the company allows for a consistent work environment regardless of your position."
good,I have good respect for managers easy to work with performed duties at a great level however was a seasonal employee and with a poor sales profit wasn't able to maintain job
good,If you are able to manage your time wisely and work fast then you'll be good here. Have good knees because you will be up and down constantly while helping many customers that feel really entitled.
good,They could be more flexible with their staff but over all they are a very good place to work at and most customers love shopping at target not to many complaints
good,"Started on morning truck unload (flow team), and eventually moved to the back room, which involved taking items out of storage for shelves. Also put bikes together for some extra hours here and there."
good,"After arriving at work, it always felt like forever until the end of the shift. The air was always dry, customers always needed help with things, and the shelves were always a mess. There was always a lot to be done, and so little time to do it between helping customers and walking back and forth across the store"
good,The people are great and the schedule flexible. They train you in multiple areas and encourage growth. They also have great discounts on product and services. The only mildly negative ting is the inconsistency of ours to schedule.
good,"Target is a good place to work overall! I loved the people I worked with but the downside is that the company says they're all about the work/life balance but anytime I requested off a day (personal, unpaid time) for an appointment or another activity with my family, it was like pulling teeth to get it approved, and I was at the bottom of the totem pole! My Team Lead has actually had already approved vacation days revoked because the Store Team Lead (Store Manager) decided that they didn't want her off those days. But overall, I enjoy working with the people I work with, and helping guests is always a top priority of mine when I'm in the store."
good,"My experience with Target has been variable. Great for students as they are flexible with hours, but if you're looking for full-time work, then that will depend upon the time of the year and the district you're in. Your experience may vary, but the real jobs are at key-holder level."
good,A lot of moving. Fast paced. I learned how to lead a team. The hours are extreme. You have to be very flexible with your schedule. During holidays you cannot travel.
good,Was a good part time job taught me a lot. Great people to work with very helpful. The only part I didnt like was waking up early as 5am to be there at 6am but you get use to it.
good,"Typical day at work consists of ringing up & bagging groceries for guests. The ability to talk to so many people and develop rapport with them is both a blessing and a curse. Like most retail, there are more awesome guests than there are bad apples, but still. Coworkers are amazing (only thing keeping it bearable), but sales goals with the REDcard are stressful, and bear down on the ability to enjoy work sometimes. Managers are stressed from corporate pressure to sign people up for the store card, and that trickles down to the front end. Those who get them are put on a pedestal, while those who do not are often talked to sternly with threats of termination or corrective action if they do not pick up the slack. From someone who still cracked the top 25% in sign ups of all cashier trained  team members, the stress still weighs constantly on the ability to give the guests a pleasant experience without having to worry about a supervisor waiting behind them for them to pitch the redcard. If you can be thick skinned through this, you will absolutely love your coworkers and most of the people that come by. Obviously, retail work comes with sales goals, and it's survival of the fittest sometimes."
good,"Starting wage varies somewhat by store and region. Same with the atmosphere fostered by management. I worked in two stores in two states. One was close to awful. The other was fantastic and consistently positive. ETLs ration and scrimp on hour allotments. Some are good at it and others are not. Regardless, regular attendance will be rewarded with a regular schedule at or close to the maximum allowed. The work is easy if you are in shape and motivated by the attitude that your time belongs to your employer. Payroll constraints placed on ETLs can often lead to more work to do than scheduled time to do it. If you can remember that this is not your problem, you can work your hours, get your pay, go home and rest easy. "
good,"Typical large retail store. OK but not great. A lot of standing in one place as a cashier. Some customers were good, some were jerks. Had a decent break room and did occasionally provide food for everyone."
good,"Target is a great place to work, but they are very poor at considering experience that was not acquired at Target. They value 10 years of Target experience over 20 years of external experience."
good,"Each store has its own unique vibe."
good,Target Valencia was a busy workplace with many different duties to attend to. The hardest part of working at Target was when they got busy. Too many people can be kind of hectic! The best part was stocking the shelves for hours. It was surprisingly entertaining.
good,As a cashier you are required to be faster than the timer. There is also a quota each cashier has to meet each week. Conversation between coworkers isn't really encouraged. You must make sure your station is clean if you aren't helping customers.
good,"Ver fast paced job, expectations for incoming employees are set very high. Even though you are part of a team you will mainly be working alone throughout your shift"
good,Hours get cut a lot sometimes you have to really work for different departments to get your hours so learning as much you can work so you can work it's a great place to work if you like retail and I did
good,Good work for new and learning experience to better yourself with others. Management varies on what location you are at but overall enjoyable with decent pay.
good,"Culture is critical and hard to reach goals and metrics as they are constantly changing. Management spends a lot of time going to Starbucks and chit-chatting with each other. Management not readily available for staff. Management quickly pursues critique of staff. Very little recognition or staff appreciation or value of staff member. Very little room for advancement. I've seen individuals singled out for ridiculous reasons. Difficult to make up missed work hours if it's not on your work schedule. Call volume high. Overall, company might be good, but management staff is immature."
good,My other coworkers were great people to work with. job was hard but nothing to hard till the bosses stepped in and tried to make you do way more then your able to do and they were hard on you if you didn't... I would not really recommend anyone to go there because they new bosses are freash out of school and think you are never able to get tired and hurt.
good,A typical work day at target depends on the position. If your a cashier its gonna go by pretty fast if your in the back your gonna hurt. Best thing is to make friends and make the best of it.
good,Target is HUGE Company that has little concern for it's individual employees.  It stresses speed of operation over anything else. I liked the people and management on the local level but on the corporate level not so much. .
good,You have to be moving from the time you get there until you leave at a 120% to meet your numbers. You are bending at the back for 12 hours a night. Very hard labor job.
good,"I had a decent time there the majority, depending on who was manager on duty for the day. I worked customer service, which was already stressful enough without the managers adding extra drama. One manager in particular was very difficult to work with."
good,"Best part of the job is the people I work with. We are a team and function like one. Worst part of the job is working on holidays and weekends. Management is capable. My day consists of arriving at 6AM, unloading the truck, palletizing merchandise, and stocking shelves. At this job, I learned patience and perseverance."
good,Overall decent place to work at. Hours kept on dropping. You have to be on your toes to keep working Here at Target. Co-workers and management are really friendly.
good,"A former retail powerhouse has failed to keep pace with change in the industry.  Target was too slow to identify the risk that Amazon posed and is now struggling to catch up.  This has impacted the culture accordingly, once strong and well defined, it is now fragmented and uncertain."
good,"Working at Target was not a difficult job at all, my job was pretty easy. But other people made it hard. The customers are god awful half the time and I didn't get paid enough to catch attitude from people when it wasn't in my control. Half the team leads are lazy and want other people to do stuff for them and leave us all stressed. And they were too aggressive about red cards. If we didn't get a guest to apply for one ,the team leads would talk down to us and act like we're not doing our job right."
good,"During the seasonal time period which was extremely busy and stressful as a store but was still able to enjoy my job. The community is great and the work itself was not complicated my any means,"
good,"The job was good and money was great. Everyone was friendly once they warmed up to you. However training for the job is not the best and the people they assigned to training positions have only been there for a few months so they don't know a lot about the job themselves. The management team is great with the logistics and analysis gathering skills are pretty decent, that being said to say they are smart and great with computers but their people skills however not so great they can read information to you from a computer screen but can't hold a conversation about your performance or ethics and behavior to save their lives. They really should work on that. Other than that they are a great company to work for as far as compensation and benefits go they can't be beat in their industry."
good,"The most enjoyable part was the team members i worked with and how we would each other at every opportunity we had. The hardest part of working here was the poor communication of management with each other and with team members, also the attitude of management towards team members."
good,"It's what you would expect out of a retail job. Friendly staff, friendly management. High turn-over rate. Not very flexible on availability and hours. I loved the people I worked with and had very little issues with upper management. Not always the most professional, but that's not always a bad thing."
good,"The stocker position at Target is simple enough and if you do all that you are asked you shouldn't have any issues. However, management tends to change quite a bit and as a result so do the standards of work. If you're looking to work for this company for quite some time in the realm of logistics, be sure to be adaptable as it is a necessity."
good,Overall solid workplace when at a store with quality managers.  Opportunities to advance exists and schedules can be flexible.  Attendance is crucial.
good,"I did stock cashier customer service etc... I did pretty much whatever was needed around target "
good,"Great place to work but only lacks opportunities for others. Good employees to work with, and the most hardest part of this job was keeping up to speed and customers. Had to handle lots of pressure at a given time period."
good,Hours and management do not work very well. It is a fun and friendly place to work though. Favoritism happens to play a big role when it comes to overall dostrivution of hours.
good,"I have worked in the pharmacy, not the store itself.  Additionally, CVS bought out Target pharmacy, therefore I cannot comment.  Many employees complain about the hours, however, it is retail and you are not guaranteed a 40 hour work week."
good,"In my opinion my co workers were easy to get along with and dependable when I needed help. The management was unprofessional in aspects as certain things they told me were inappropriate, they didn't work along my needs so I had to end my employment with them."
good,"Very productive , stocking merchandise/product in various areas in store. Market, HBA, Chemicals, Pets, Domestics, Stationary, Toys, Sporting goods and Rear seasonal. As Space Manager I unload merchandise truck, push/stock palletized bulk product, backstock extra merchandise and keep a clean and organized work place. I've learned how to run a team using a technic called the wave process. In which I would keep 90 percent of my team concentrated in one department and as each team member finishes a task, I'll move them along accordingly and as for the 10 percent, is my strong workers schattered around the store giving us a head start in departments as the wave makes its way through. There are many faces in which I work with and abliged to be a part of a diverse group of loyal, hardworking, friendly group. The hardest part is moving up as far as openings and the various workplaces that can either be your advancement or downfall but never in between (job security). I enjoy working with a great team that I am apart of."
good,I had a seasonal job there which means BUSY!!! But it was still good and an excellent learning experience. I would work there again just different location.
good,Good company with plenty of a lot of opportunity.  Company is slowed down by extensive amounts of red tape and political hurdles. Great people and the company is ethically solid.
good,I was happy to have a position at Target if  even for a short  time as it was close to my home and both my superiors and co workers were friendly and helpful.
good,"The job was fun,  but the managers made it difficult by not being positive and talking g up their employees. Being a Cashier was fun and had its benefits but the management needed a change in my opinion."
good,I liked working there.  The managers were fair and supportive.  Provided constructive guidance rather than critical.  Nice!
good,"Be prepared to have hours cut, 3 different managers telling you to do 3 different things. A lot of work for one person on shift, happens a lot. "
good,"Long hours, competitive environment with peers, and work-life balance is an opportunity for improvement, unfair promotional practices, too many metrics"
good,no longer exists in Canada they don't exist stop making me type I do not want to do this survey but you are forcing me to do so stop forcing me to do this it is an aggravating his process..
good,Worked as a temp so its hard to say. The experience would have been more enjoyable if I worked there as a Target employee as opposed to temping.
good,Not what I'd consider a career job for myself. Overall a great first time job for  a young adult or retiree. I shop there alot so the employee  discount is a definite plus.
good,A typical day at Target would be I walk in clock in and go directly to the manager to get set up on a cash register. I learned how to interact with clients respectfully so they receive the best experience while shopping. I enjoyed working with my co-workers especially when time got really hectic the managers always new how to keep the environment competitive and fun. The hardest part of the job was having to work extremely long shifts as a student. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people check out because each guest was a different experience.
good,"Not family friendly unless your management. They are great at acknowledging a job well done. They support team members, until it affects them adversely."
good,"stressful position in the collections department. target.com is a great environment. More refresher training and honest opinions from management would be helpful,"
good,its retail. you know what to expect. customer is always right and sometimes the hours are cut to 20 which makes it a little hard to make it on your own.
good,"My typical day Target, starts with welcoming guests and being able to ring them out and tell them to have a great day/night. If it get slow, i would be told to do a task and I would get it done within minutes."
good,"working at target was a great experience, the majority of the staff was friendly and reliable. the work loads were not excessive when properly staffed, but that's just it, during my year there the last 4 months we were dreadfully under staffed in the meat department."
good,I was given bad hours and was all by myself at night being the only one to get the items needed. hard working alone and sad. I was able to listen to music but in the end the training was why I left.
good,"It was a while since I worked for this company so I don't remember how it was when I was there, and I was only there seasonal, but I believe when I was there I think I liked working there."
good,"As this was my first job, I didnt expect it to be as jam packed as it was. I was dissapointed with how they treated the employees and  was frowned upon if i didnt open up any ""REDcards"""
good,"Your day to day tasks are repetitive, but the employees you work with make the job interesting, and it's a good work environment. Management tries to fairly schedule people so that people get time with their families outside of work."
good,"Although I've always worked with people, I found working at Target a positive experience, especially working with the customers, many of whom created a positive interaction and were friendly and engaging.The hard part was to ""always look/be busy"" and keep an eye on your register while being 20-30 feet away. It was a positive experience for a part time job for a retiree."
good,Basically the only thing i did was walk for 12 hours up and down aisles grabbing items off shelves that customers ordered. But I also helped out with packaging the items.
good,"It's a great work place if it were consistent. You can work 50 hrs one week and the next week you could work maybe 10 hrs. Which kind of sucks, because if you're trying to raise a family that's not enough hours."
good,"I worked at Target for a little over a year and at first I liked it, but then I realized that some of the management didn't care about your personal life or somedays your work life."
good,"was an good part time job while I was pursuing my certifications & going to school , & they had a real understanding on my situation & was willing to work around my schedule ."
good,"Target is a fantastic retail store.  Reminds me of Apple a bit.  They have a great brand and everything in the culture is driven towards supporting it.  This is good and bad.  The good part is that you don't have to be creative, but that is also the bad thing.  There is no room for creative thinking which becomes boring after a while.  I will admit that it is one of the shiniest bulbs on the shelf, but remember to take your five hour energy shot before you go in."
good,"+Training and Development"
good,"I honestly would have stayed at the job if I had more of life outside of work. I was always stressed out even when I wasn't at work. There's high turnover on the store side, including leadership. You will like you can never get ahead. There isn't a lot of recognition that stays long because the next day everything could fall apart. I barely had breaks as a manager, never could eat, worked minimum 12 hour days at times, and working holidays and weekends was not fun after 2 years."
good,"a typical day at Target was usually a mx up of good and bad. For example some days our guest were very efficient and understanding then other days the guest would get nasty and didn't want to work with us when we were trying to work with them as best we can. What I learned while working at Target was Fast, Fun and Friendly service. The management could have been more helpful. My co-workers were great and helped me out the best they could. The hardest part of the day usually was when guest would bring us returns to the register when we had a customer service desk right when you walked in. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people with all their needs when they were able to help me out by letting me know what they problem was"
good,this job is cool and not bad for beginners dtarting out working. Try getting soft lines or cashier hard lines is hard at first. Guests are oleasnt and ignore the ones that rent.
good,Love my job but the constant flux in management can be a little difficult to work with. There is a lot of fun to be had with the Team in general and working the holidays is stressful but something that everyone should do at least once.
good,"Worked with an amazing team. "
good,"The company culture has deteriorated in recent years.  Leaders are expected to work excessive hours.  Strong prioritization skills are lacking.  Cost reduction has become too much of a focus.  "
good,"Stress level and work life balance can be tough at times. Great people to work with."
good,"During the ten week period that I underwent in work placement with Target I gained experience of the retail industry. Although I was mainly working as a floor staff, I was able to interact with different customers, assist them with any enquiries which allowed me to develop my skills in customer service which is one of my attributes i pride myself on. It was a successful work experience program which benefited me immensely."
good,"I stayed at a cash register all day long and for me that's not something I like to do, I'm more of a faced paced person and I like to constantly move around a lot and I'm very good at multi tasking."
good,I learned a lot from this company. I gained training experience and management experience. I learned how to properly clean machinery that was operational in our department. I did inventory counts and ordered supplies. I set up the store for promotions.
good,"I worked for target for about two years. I loved the opportunity to train all over the store, from Starbucks batista, sales floor, the food cafe and cashier."
good,Learned how to multi-task with a variety of different people while working in a fast paced environment. The most enjoyable part of my day was making connections with everyone on my team and being able to relate to people with completely different backgrounds. We then used these relationships to work together and complete goals because we had learned to depend on one another.
good,"Target offered their employees a tremendous environment that made working there an enjoyable experience. My co-workers were happy because of the high standards that the company adhered to. Unfortunately it became obvious that something was seriously wrong with the company shortly after our store opened and as we now know, it let to all 122 stores being closed down. I had hoped to work at Target for many years but this wasn't possible. I hope to find another opportunity to use my skills and experience."
good,"I was a cashier management wasn't fair. I personally didn't think they should've pushed us cashiers to get these RedCards, if we didnt really try we got in trouble but what they (managers) didn't know was that most of our guests that came thorugh, were regulars."
good,"My supervisor was self centered, arrogant, did not show much respect for employees, and thought he was better than everyone else because his position though I had a degree and did not have to deal with his ways. Other than that vibe was great there"
good,"I loved the people I worked with but the company sounds better on paper then it does when you work there. It was a great experience for me, I learned a lot from working there and do not regret it at all!"
good,A typical day working at target included coming into work clocking in then beginning to pull all the product forward on the shelves so that it look neat and orderly. Next i would check to see which products needed to be filled and would pull certain items from the back to put on the shelves in the store. I would also help customers throughout my shift. I learned allot about customer service while working at this job and i still use allot of the skills i learned to this day.
good,"Well respected place, love all co- workers and the  environment it's safe and you Feel at home. No matter if the costumer was wrong, they are always right."
good,"I clock in everyday, I grab my equipment everyday and then I head to the floor. I've learned so much about sales and customer service Target. I feel like my sales skills have definitely increased. The best part about the job has to be the people that I work with honestly. It feels like a family. The hardest part about the job is being scheduled by yourself in my department and having to deal with every customer that comes by yourself with absolutely no help throughout my whole shift"
good,"When I started working at Target I was grateful for the opportunity to work within a company that, I was told, offered growth within. After 4 years of hard, dedicated work nothing has happened. I had many opportunities to move up, but the Managers that were working with me for team lead opportunities have all pursued other places of employment. I have made myself available for any hours and have continuously worked holidays. I am looking for a place of employment that offers, growth, benefits and retirement packages."
good,There was many other workers. I worked for almost every department. Most days I worked at the register and other days I would hep guest service or Starbucks or floors.
good,Wanted to stay with them for a longer period of time. Sad it worked out the way it did. Was so happy when l was hired thought it would have been a dream job and lifelong employment.
good,there was no advancement and the management favored certain worker. it was a very stressful job.i was a cashier for 5 years of and on. u had people cuz u out and be rude
good,Target was a great place to work. Management was just unsettled and employees were working many different job titles as assigned to do. Hours were poor . But it was still an awesome environment to work in being that they were so many cultures to assist and meet.
good,A typical day at Target would only be 4 hours and would start and finish with myself on the register. I would greet people as they shop and see them to check out there items
good,Early morning shift unloading trucks and placing product on the floor. Also making sure electronic products were delivered properly and plentifully.
good,"As a team member, you are constantly on your feet, restocking, straightening shelves and helping customers. During the holiday months you are expected to stay hours after shift to help clean up, but at least compensation is there. Co-workers are friendly but mostly busy days prevent most socializing. As a retail department store, dealing with angry, rude or uncooperative customers comes with the job."
good,"Good lord. Im a cashier, i really enjoy the cashier/talking to people part of the job but the constant ragging from your leaders to get a red card is ridiculous! Thats all you hear all day is ""Are you asking about red cards?"" ""How many redcards do you have??"" If you are not able to constantly hock their credit card to people at the same time as being under the pressure of keeping your grade up above 90 (you are seriously graded on how fast you go, if you get below 90 for an extended amount of time they will get rid of you) this is definately not the job for you. I have to constantly remind myself ""Im doing this for 10 bucks an hour-"" to keep myself from walking out that door everytime i hear the words red card. The first few weeks you work there arent even real, theyre just testing you out. All they care about is making the comoany money and they get upset with you if you get in the way."
good,working at Target was always something productive but it was seasonal and I really did enjoy working there. the team worked well and there was always something new to do at each shift.
good,Great company culture. I appreciated all the dedicated hard working individuals that make this company successful. Leadership can be hit or miss.
good,"it ok for a mundane job till the season hits.sales pick up around that time which makes the days go a bit faster, but if plans to try to move up or switch to  new department is very slim."
good,"A pretty repetitive job once properly trained and although there is a fair amount of work, there is not a lot of opportunity for advancement and benefits are poor. Co-workers are the most enjoyable part of the job, and the hardest part is ensuring proper function of the deli while being consistently understaffed."
good,"The majority of the employees are pleasent to work with and there is always something to do. The problem sometimes lie with the management whom try to act more like the boss than a leader. I worked there for nearly four years and about a month ago I was working on light duty after having a surgury and while on light duty they fired me due to me not moving fast enough for them, even though I still completed my taskes asigned to me before my shift endend."
good,It was a good place to work while in school. Its not very stressful except management can be bad but I am sure its like that everywhere.
good,"I worked as a hardlines team member and cashier for 2 months during the Thanksgiving and Christmas seasons. With just 2 months I noticed how retail really is, first of all my first day of training went BAD. I was put in charge of a register with only 5 minutes of training. To keep things short, it did not go well. As the weeks passed I got the hang of it so if you're a first timer, it will get better. Hardlines was difficult but relaxed, my team never finished the job due to all the management/customer interruptions. I cant complain since it was the bussiest Target in my area. The positives is that there are 3 breaks per shift, two 15 minute shorts, and a 30 min lunch, enough to get to know your co workers. The seasonal closing times are tough, my team would always leave around 2-3 in the morning due to condition in which the customers left the store, and believe me.....they will make a big mess. Overrall I was satisfied with the experience but would not want to work there again."
good,"It was a flexible job while I finished school. There was room to grow and cross train in other departments. I was part time so I was not eligible for benefits and pay was fair, nothing special. For the most part most of my managers were easy to get along with and approachable."
good,"Normally an average day at work was pleasant. We'd unload the truck, put the pallets in their respective places, and put the merchandise onto the shelves. I learned how a logistical department functions, as well as electronic devices. PDAs, My Devices, etc. Management was on par. For the most part the team leads were pretty solid, but it seemed like what mostly drove them was because their superior told them to finish by such-and-such a time, instead of wanting to do a good job themselves. The hardest part of the job was when the team leads would have a bad day. I would approach them asking a question and they would get an attitude with me for what seemed like no reason. I couldn't understand why. Not all of them did that, about half of them did. Another thing I strongly disliked with the company is the crazy hours. The schedules were all over the place. That's another reason why I left. My co-workers for the most part were nice, but a lot of them complained and whined. Looking back I realized that I hardly ever complained, to tell the truth. A good portion of them talked about how the night before they went out drinking, partying, and wishing how they had the day off. As for me, I come from a Christian home and a Christian environment so hearing that mostly went in one ear and out the other. It does however, get old after a while. The most enjoyable part of the job I will admit was the fact that when everybody did pull their weight, we would sometimes finish early and get to go home before our scheduled time. That is, if everybody did their job right."
good,"Work at Target headquarters as a Sr. Credit Adviser, the company is great! However the management in the collections department is so inconsistent."
good,however the hours i am getting right now is not satisfactory. however its not easy to leave when you are friends with most of the team
good,"I learned how to become a Target team member. Learning how to handle a cashier regularly, clocking in, bagging groceries and anything anyone would buy. Co-workers weren't that friendly, bosses were rude a lot of the time. There was no hard part in the job, you did what you had to do. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my guests walk out of the store happy."
good,"Some days working may be hard, but at the same time it is a great experience because I learn a lot of different skills from my managers, and also my co workers."
good,Most days at Target are the same. If you are someone who has been there for at least a few months then it is likely that you will fall into a routine. Some people will typically work in only the department that they are best in and others who are more versatile will work in multiple areas. Management can show favoritism at times. Most employees get along fine.
good,"Target is a nice place to work,theirs always a team member willing to train you or assist you.The managers can be a little unprofessional at times because of the way they speak to team members.The hardest part of the job at times can be working when the store is getting visit ready.The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships you build with the team members."
good,"As overnight flow, it was my responsibility to unload merchandise from packages and restock the shelves. There would occasionally be a truck and I would be in the back sorting and stacking the merchandise onto pallets. I learned how to operate the scanner and conduct ""pulls"", referring to what needed to be replenished on the floor and restocking them. Management and my fellow co-workers were very polite and friendly, which created a great work environment. The hardest part of the job was staying awake as it was an overnight shift. The most enjoyable part of working was during breaks, we would have a team meeting with every staff member and everyone would get involved and do a cheer before going back to work. It really gave everyone motivation for the second half of their shift."
good,"Very busy, learned how a retail store works and how to work in one. Subculture friendly, management and coworkers also friendly. Very good learning experience for me."
good,early morning shift. The hardest part was maintaining a good speed to get everything accomplished int next four hours. The co-workers were great to be around very supportive and helping.
good,"I learned a lot at Target"
good,During my employment here I can safely say that I have gained a lot of experience in retail and customer service from target
good,A typical day at target was a early morning start. My usual shift was usually 4am-2pm.My team members and I would unload the store trucks when we arrived.We also sorted and distributed the products to the floor where we would stock them on the shelves.
good,"Target Center was a great first job.  Learning customer service techniques that help not only in the workplace, but also in everyday life."
good,"Decent Job. It has Flaws, but what job doesn't. If you want flexibility, then this is your job, but prepared to do a lot of work. Not enough room for ranking up in department. The raises received will only be considered important to the individual at 5 years experience of being present at Target. Having a High Tolerance won't get you anywhere. You must be very patient, short-fused individuals will sink because guest satisfaction is everything for Target. Team Members will get frustrated, but that is how Target plans to be a better company. The Pyramid food chain goes like this, Team Members below, Team Leaders Next, ETL'S After, and Finally Store Lead's. Overall Three Stars."
good,a typical day at work usually constists of getting our assigned tasks done in an acceptable time frame but having good peers around you to make it easier and more fun. this job has definitley showed me what it is like to work with a team as well as very friendly managers.
good,"Although the pay was good, I did not have a lot of free time to balanced my personal life. It was a rough job based on location but overall an ok experience."
good,"From 6:00 AM until 8:15 AM the products are unloaded from the truck onto pallets by department (ie Seasonal, Grocery, Clothing). The pallets are then moved to their proper departments to have the products placed in the proper area such as a shelf, peg, display and continues until the truck is completely unloaded. Any non-perishable back-stock that is left from the truck is repacked and taken to the backroom where they are sorted by department to be back-stocked and perishables such as dairy are taken to their proper refrigerator or freezer. After a fifteen minute from 8:15 AM until 8:30 AM the team lead breaks the flow team up to work auto-fills by department (ie Chemicals, Clothing, Seasonal) until the auto-fills for that department are completed and any product left is taken to be back-stocked. During that time from 8:30 AM until 10:00 AM the store is open so helping guests with any requests such as finding where a certain product is to filling in as a back-up cashier when the primary cashiers are in need of an extra lane."
good,"Target has a great group of people that work for them. Their management team is not the best, but most of them are nice and friendly."
good,"I enjoyed some of the coworkers and managers, but I believe the work environment and managers could do better in communicating with their employees. However, I do like how they allow you to take my time off for school and allows you to come back."
good,"A typical day at Target included working the cash register and making sure that the last part of the guest experience within the store was memorable. I learned to be extremely organized and even faster than I was before in my other work environments. Management was not successful in meeting their workers needs to my satisfactory. Though I was noticed for my hard work and ability to get things done in other aspects i felt forgotten. My co-workers were friendly and hardworking. I enjoyed the guest and signing them up for ""Red-Cards"""
good,"A typical day start with greeting coworkers and guests. Can be a fast paced environment around holidays and special events. Red card sales are an important priority for the company as well as being courteous and respectful to all guests. Management encourages the employees, daily. It can become hectic sometimes when dealing with diverse people, but I smile always and remain respectful despite the atmosphere."
good,"Needless to say, Target was a BIG change for me. I came from a small little women's clothing boutique in Burien to this incredibly large department store, so adjusting was a little difficult. I didn't really like using the walkie-talkies, but it came with the territory. The in-store pizza and beverage 'restaurant' was definitely convenient when it came time for lunch."
good,Was difficult being the only full time weekday technician. Would have been nice for more help. Also would have liked an opening with a closer location.
good,"Things are always changing even management, and you take more than 1000 steps in one day. The health insurance has a very high deductible too."
good,"Because I have been with Target for over a decade I have seen many changes. There was a time I got a new Executive in my department every 5 months or so. They just did NOT understand all the things that are needed to keep the process rolling along. "
good,"It was a good job for the time being. Didn't expect to be let go after the seasons were done, but overall it was a good experience"
good,Managers belittle employess and discuss private matters in front of other employees and peers. Hard to advance within company unless you're a suck up
good,"Most employees work by themselves, and often at this store, no one helps.  The customers range from nice to stuck-up.  Management is good but certain projects are pushed back continuously."
good,"i did cashing and sales for target, management was OK, felt like they knew they were going to close their stores in Canada. co workers were OK, not driven, not motivated. Hardest part of the job was to attend a full shift."
good,"Before Starbucks opened I worked as a cashier, a typical day would be scanning items, being friendly with a smile and trying to promote redcards for target. I learned to be friendly and good communication skills. Management was good, I enjoyed working with everyone. The hardest part of the job was doing the same thing over and over the shift felt long and standing in one spot. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers they always made it fun, that always made the time pass by"
good,"Quality company to work for.  Would like to see more compensation for leadership team, i.e., monthly/quarterly bonuses, etc."
good,alot of work to do always multi tasking to get the job done.. learn agreat deal how to run a business.  the most enjoyable part of the work is being with my team i have the best team in target corp.
good,I almost started as a fresher in Target India. It made me a better person. I learnt alot form there. Learn to build myself my image. Excelled in Computers and also developmental side.
good,Target has been a great job for me where I learned a multitude of ways to be effective in the retail and logistics areas of sales and customer service.
good,"If you just keep your head down, nose to the grinding wheel, you're good to go. When you try to stand up for yourself or your team, you clash with colleagues and create enemies"
good,"I worked mornings, which was perfect for my schedule. I was very displeased with management, however, as they would schedule my team for four hours each shift, while expecting us to stay for eight, and come in on days that weren't scheduled at last-minute notice (sometimes 20-40 minutes before the start of a shift)."
good,"Is a very good place to work, but they offered very little hours in your schedule. is more like a part time job or on call job. I am looking for a full time job that can offer me the opportunity to do what i love and at the same time be able to sustain my family."
good,Its a Friendly work environment but management is unorganized and communication they lack to their employee's.  The team leads tells you to do a specific job on a time period but instead they tell you to do different tasks at hand than doing your normal duty.
good,"Fun to work for especially early morning and cashiering. However, management doesn't seem to know management. Co-workers are cool."
good,"Target pays more than most retailers in my experience but working there is without lack of a better word is "" Taxing"""
good,Working for Target is great for a high schooler or college student. However it is not the place for career advancement. Overall work environment is amazing but has its down time.
good,"A typical day in a target warehouse is a ten or twelve hour shift during which you walk around your assigned area doing one of a few tasks, including stocking, pulling online orders, and cleaning. Often we were sent home a couple hours early because the work ran out."
good,Management is hired fresh with almost no experience. Once the Management learns to work with the employees the store runs efficiently.
good,"This job is definitely not for the feint of heart, highly recommended to have been a former athlete or worked in a warehouse environment. If you do not enjoy this sort of work this job is not for you, however if you have experience in the warehouse industry and can work hard for close to 8 hours then it is the easiest in its class. Lots of work on your knees, carrying boxes, but most boxes are light enough to be handled easily."
good,"The store wasn't that bad to work at, we were always busy so days went quickly. My immediate supervisor was the best supervisor I've ever had."
good,Slave drivers that look at you like a number. Decent pay and great benefits but I would not recommend this job. I skipped out of that warehouse after I put in my notice.
good,Be mindful of the politics that go on throughout the store if you want to move up.  I enjoyed working on different teams and gained a ton of experience on leading them.
good,Fun place to work with not so decent management. Greater emphasis on getting red cards over employee growth. Lots of resistance when moving up and little to no discussion of opportunities to move up. Lots of caring individuals and great to work with on a daily bases. Not so great benefits and loss of vacation hours and sick days cut to nothing. Work load was very challenging and engaging I completely enjoyed doing it day in and day out.
good,Working on the salesfloor is challenging as you clean up after customers all day. You learn how to get a lot of work accomplished with little amount of resources.
good,"I worked at Target for a short period of time between some other retail jobs I've held. It is a very good job for people looking to build up experience in terms of customer service skills as the culture of Target is focused on diversity and attending to the needs of every customer in contrast to its competitors. The job was relatively fast-paced during peak hours which kept you on your toes, and there was never a time where there was not something to do. Management is relatively involved with employees which is great for someone looking for opportunities for advancement, and incentives are regularly provided to boost workplace morale. Job related services such as benefits management and scheduling are available for easy access online which is good as some companies are straggling within the technology department."
good,"love all my co workers, but target pays you the bare minimum. Great environment, but really wished they care less about sales and more about the employees working for them."
good,"It was fun working at Target ! Getting to see the new fashions ,working with customers ! I like working through the Hoildays!"
good,"Generally, it's a good place to work. I love to put a smile on guest face and teaching new cashiers procedures that will help them better to complete their job. I just think that the job needs to get back to team work or come up with a plan when things turn upside down due to different situations that have happen during the day. This will allow of lot of pressure to come off of the individuals that are really stars at the job that go above and beyond."
good,"During my tenure, I developed some great relationships and met some wonderful people. The work environment was fast paced and had challenges. "
good,"I go to work early, and I hardly ever have two days off in a row. It takes time to get additional hours, but you can get them if you show initiative. "
good,The salary compensation here is great.  Benefits are decent.  Tuition reimbursement is terrible.  They only give you $3000 annually to go back to school.  You are salary and expected to work 10 - 12 hour days.  They do not give you enough payroll to run the store so you constantly have to deal with complaints from guests and employees.  You are also going to do the work of what normal team members do because you don't have enough payroll to have them work.
good,"Target is a nice place to work. I am a front end Guest Service attendant. A typical day for me starts with loading the registers with funds for the day, checking to make sure all defects were taken to the back correctly and all duties from closing the night before where carried out. Once we open I am in charge of managing all front end employees in their duties. Sending them on their breaks and lunches, getting change for them and taking care and listening to guest who have concerns. I would say the hardest part of my job are those busy days when are cashier to guest ratio is less. My most enjoyable part of the the job is the people I work with and encounter every day. I am a big people person and enjoy making those I work with and see everyday happy."
good,Target is a great place to work. I think if you just go to work and come home with little socializing you will do fine. But beware !!! Target is a huge highschool with lots of gossiping and moving up is only about who you know and who likes you
good,Having to complete projects simultaneously while helping our customers. Managing relationships with co-workers while under stress. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I am able to find an item for a customer.
good,Target was a good company to work for while it lasted. I enjoyed my job & my Managers also & the convenience of working so close to home & the flexible work hours.
good,"As a cashier you are worked until you die. on top of that every time that you work you MUST get someone to sign up for a Target Red Card. If you don't get many red cards then they will not cross train you. If you get a lot of red cards, they wont want you to cross train. you are either working 8 hour shifts or 4 hour shifts."
good,"Uncertain time as company is undergoing org changes and lots of layoffs. "
good,"Great professional challenge, a start-up manufacturing unit to be set up in India. "
good,"I loved working at Target because I enjoy working with and talking to customers. The hardest part of the job was the fact that the pay was so low. It was not until I started getting people to get RED CARDS, (Debit and charge cards) and became so good at it that I was asked to show others how to do it did my salary increase a lot. I enjoyed working with my co-workers but because the pay was  so low that the people  who worked there was constantly changing."
good,"Exciting place to work with a very supportive management. The job is very fast pace and you have no time for breaks, you're always on your feet trying to please our members. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to experience the events that go on at the target center from the backstage."
good,I been working at target for almost two years. I love the people that I work with. I love that our store is always busy. The hardest part of the job would be signing up an guest for an red card.
good,This organization has a very team-oriented culture. The work can be tough at times but you will definitely be recognized for your effort and quality work.
good,"Great experience, but overall not a compatible career fit.  Daily job functions were extremely familiar and simple, much like ones completed on past jobs."
good,"If you can work with the general public you are a saint. Target customers aren't as bad as some though. The culture of the store is really upbeat and fun, and putting out product is not very difficult. My only big con is not getting paid enough to pay any normal life bills (rent, food, gas), forget about extra things."
good,"Starting work at 6am, we zoom to the back room to begin the truck unload. With an average of 1600-3000pc trucks, it is certainly nothing to shake a stick at. As a team we work across the board to unload, organize, and pull freight to the floor efficiently and quickly. Once on the floor, we empty pallets and sort them to respective locations using a code system. "
good,"This company has a high potential to make a lot of money. I came in as a Starbucks barista and ended as a GSA in 8 months. My recommendation is to have a Bachelor's degree before you apply and only apply for management positions. Do not apply for a team member position as it will screw you like it did me. A store manager has the potential to make well into a six figure a year salary with awesome bonuses and vacation. Assistant managers can easily make into the $80K range. The work is extremely easy and manageable. Your work life balance is based on your stores performance. In executive management, if your store is GREEN, it's a smooth 50 hours a week. As a team member be prepared to beg for hours. As a GSA I had hours that varied from 12 to 40 hours a week. Work is incredibly difficult for a GSA as you hold a management position but you cannot coach or really even give feedback. I will let you know I have been passed over three times for promotion to team lead with one of those individuals whom had zero growth potential past the position I applied for."
good,It was a fun concept with a destructive tone behind it. Walking around and asking people that are not interested with a clipboard isn't the way to get people to show you exist. Advertise! I only got 2 days a week with hardly 4 hours each day.
good,The job is not the hardest thing in the word but certain people make the job harder than it is. Part of your job is to assist the registers when needed but some people take advantage of that and call you multiple times without any regard of the task that you have to complete and get done before closing. And considering the extreme heat that you have to work in 9 dollars a hour is hardly enough and even asking for a dollar increase is outlandish to them. One cart attendant has already quit because of the constant badgering and there was only two from the beginning. The cart attendant that trained me before I left warned me before he left that sometimes the take advantage of you just because they can.
good,Target was a fun place to work and I enjoyed interacting with co-workers and customers. I left because I wanted to take on a new challenge in my life.
good,"Great Co-workers, Executive managers don't do anything and everyone on the bottom does not get pay enough for the job they do. Overnight is a lot of work and your pay doesn't match your resposibilities"
good,"All of my fellow Baristas, I loved them all. We had a wonderful time. But the management, one person in particular, who has since left the company, was awful. This person was difficult to work with. Overall, Starbucks was a great place to work."
good,This was my first job out of college. It was a great starting position with excellent pay and benefits. There are also great opportunities for leadership development.
good,"This job helps build characters and customer service skills as a full shift consisted of helping customers choose new cellular devices, contracts, plans, accessories, and date packages that fit them best."
good,"Very fast paced, you'll need to wing it on all your experiences, management is okay, they don't really help much, co-workers needed a little push to be socially open."
good,"Co-workers were great, most of them were skewed towards their late 20's to their early 40's. The management system is really wonky. You really have no idea who is your superior until about a year later."
good,Fun place to work with the right team. Working at Target has helped me become a better leader. It has taught me how to be resilient and adaptable.
good,"I worked at Target for over 10 years, was my first job. I had excellent managers and horrible managers. I was able to have a flexible schedule to go to college.  My manager supported my desire to graduate college, so he allowed me to work whenever I wanted. Also I was able to travel to others stores (all expenses paid) to setup their cosmetics displays. The one thing that made me leave was, when I graduated I applied for an ETL position and wasn't even granted an interview.  Fresh out of college with no retail experience people were getting hired as ETLs. I saw no future for me to grow so I left and didn't look back."
good,"The company as a whole has cut their payroll budget immensely, making it nearly impossible to run a successful sales floor."
good,I am a Am cashier I would come in clean my check lane and turn on the register light and stand in front of my Lane so guest knew I was open. Checkout guest as fast as possible so I pass the speed of checking out. be polite and always greet and smile.
good,"I worked overnight so it was a little different then working day shift there. I loved my co workers, we were like a family. typical night was unloading the truck from the back, putting the boxes on the pallets, and sending the pallets onto the floor in their specific section. then when the truck was done, if you weren't designated to a certain area, then you would just start from the front of the store stocking all the shelves and go all around the entire store until it was done. I was designated to a certain area which was electronics, so I had to check in security, stock all shelves, put away security items, stock multiple dvds and cds, and clean up the area alone. there was no help in electronics, just me. that's what I hated. its to big of a department to do on your own. management kept changing every few months. and if my work was noticed and I had chances to move up, I would still be there. but they will promote a guy before they promote a girl, and ive seen that on multiple occasions"
good,"ok place to work but very long hours and working at night also, but my co workers were friendly and a great people to work with."
good,"Managers are great to work with; excellent coaching; manage ""on-the-fly"" due to time constraints; high turnover creates many inexperienced team members which cannot meet daily metric standards; operational systems seem to be outdated and slow; electronic media promotions make in-store execution unrealistic."
good,"As a leader at Target, I had to efficiently plan my day out to manage multiple task. As the only coverage to help customers, I had to reach out to my colleagues for help in order to manage the department. When news arrived for upcoming releases in my department, I had to meet with my supervisor and create a plan to keep brand up to date. Over all a good learning experience but I am ready for a greater work efficiency and responsibility."
good,Target was a pretty fun job. You get to work with some great people but the pay is sub standard. When you first start you have to start at a really low pay rate.
good,Its a very busy place to work. There is lots of opportunities to advance. Leaders were always moving store to store. Team members are fun to work with. Can't really say there is any hard jobs there. The best part working at Target was fun Fridays!
good,"Maintaing a clean work space, fast paced when completing work tasks, and having a team to work with to accomplish those goals in providing product to the other associates."
good,Target is at a crossroads in its lifespan from either becoming obsolete or pushing forward to get to another growth phase.  It is a unique time at this corporation and only time will tell how it will pan out.
good,"Work at target is like every other retail store fast pace around the holidays and intermediate on the regular. After some period of time it gets repetitive, there is a urge to learn more but at most times its a hassle to do so. The management is young in age but very professional when it comes to the workplace. As for the co-workers they make the job more able due to how diverse the crowd is, bringing new energy to the job everyday. The hardest part of the job would have to be the poor scheduling and lack of hours when it isn't holiday time , making it hard to live off the income you receive, the physical part of the work isn't that bad. The best part of working in  target is there vision, target is a very positive place to work it builds people skills and maturity, I'd recommend the job to a younger group of people to be honest."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the team members. The culture allows the team members to build strong bonds with each other. Although the culture is strong, the management was distant and often not arround."
good,"As a Security Guard, I enjoyed interacting with the customers, ensuring that each customer received outstanding service by greeting and acknowledging every customer, patrolling the building on a scheduled basis to ensure a safe environment for staff and general public and provide information to their inquiries and/or requests. I am comfortable answering telephone calls to take messages, answer questions, provide information during non-business hours or when switchboard is closed and writing reports of daily activities and irregularities, such as equipment or property damage, theft, or unusual occurrences.  My only concern is when apprehending a perp, I may be hit and at times verbally threatened."
good,"Good company to work for, but I found that at my store in order to advance in the company you had to get the right people to like you.  Management typically dragged their feet about promoting from within.  Not sure if this is just from the store I was at or the company on the whole."
good,"I worked at the Target Cafe and a typical day would consist of doing daily routines such as preparing food, turning on machines, cleaning, etc. My supervisor was very helpful if I ever had questions about the routines. Some coworkers would also be very helpful, but sometimes they would be off on very long breaks.The job was pretty easy, so I wouldn't really say there was a hard part of the job. Its basically just following routines and making sure everything is neat and clean. Personally, I would say the most irritating part of the job was cleaning the popcorn machine.The most enjoyable part was interacting with guests. I also worked as a cashier and there was a lot of rude guests, but at target cafe, most of the guests were very polite and friendly."
good,"A typical day of work as a cashier would start with a brief look at the board to see what lane i was on or what I was expected to do for the day. I almost always closed the store, which meant I was the last cashier there at the end of the day. Apart from checking out people at the register, this meant that I was in charge of cleaning/tidying my lane up at the end of the day and making sure everything was in place for the opening cashier the next morning. My day would end with my manager counting my drawer and me tidying up all of the displays in the front area to make sure they looked good for the morning. If I had spare time, I would help other people put up returns in their departments so we could all leave the store more quickly."
good,"You first come in and clock in on an electrical time clock in clerical office. Then, you check the board an see what your task are for the day."
good,"- Huddle up and go over the company info and daily workload and expectations"
good,"Target was my first job and made lasting friends. My co-workers were the best part of the job. We had fun day to day and worked seamlessly."
good,"While Target can't offer most employees full time and high wages, for the type of business it is the best!  The training is good, the management is fair, and they have fun extras and incentives like free food and gift cards!  Hard working people can work their way up the latter though so it can be a carrier job, as long as you don't mind working, days, nights, weekends, and some holidays... it's retail.  I typically enjoyed my coworkers, respected my leaders, and felt that for mid tier retail Target is the best!  Even after leaving the company to pursue other things, it's still my favorite store!"
good,"Okay money, high energy, but was hard to get the hours I needed for school due to the fact of many schedule mess ups and a lot of bad talk from employees about management due to bad schedules and not enough training"
good,"I've learned quite a bit from target, a better work ethic, how to contribute to a team.  No parts of this job are difficult to me.  Its enjoyable to come to work and work alongside people I thoroughly enjoy."
good,Setting planograms to there in accordance with directions from the line listing and also stocking the new product that comes with the freshly set aisle.
good,"My time at Target was most heavily influenced by the many talented and dedicated employees at all levels of the organization. All locations I worked at had amazing opportunities for teamwork. "
good,A typical day at work is filled with laughs and hard workers. Working at Target has taught me that it's easy to do things you've never done before. The management can use some help but when they can they make sure you have the hours you need. I get along with many of my co worker and there are some that just aren't friendly but I still speak and keep it moving. I wouldn't say its really a hard part of the job I do. Some job tasks can be difficult when the proper tools isn't available.
good,They try to over work you with daily tasks because they don't schedule enough people to work. In essence they try to maximize the load on every worker that's there. The wage is low and it takes awhile to move up within the company or to get paid where you would like.
good,"Working at Target can at first be challenging with memorizing the locations of items, to dealing with guest who are having a bad day, however, helping others is the most enjoyable part of the job. Sometimes you will meet people who are in a bad mood, or having a bad day but smiling and being polite makes the job even better. The benefits are not the best part of the job whereas nobody works more than 40 hours a week, leaving people without health insurance."
good,My job at Target was simply not my cup of tea. I always got hours but I was also the only cashier closing and it was sometimes hard for me to get days off. The management did not really communicate well with the lower team members and the job title you where given was the job that you where always stuck with it was very hard to have multiple roles within the store.
good,"A fast and fun enviroment to work in, however there are quite a bit of politics involved.  Being young and good looking seem to be more important attributes to leadership than experience.  Overall though, it is a very good company."
good,"Easy enough work but the leadership at the location I worked at was poor, they took allot of workers from backroom to the sales floor and left me hanging."
good,The pharmacy experience at Target is changing for the worse.  Over  the last few years the patient driven workplace has become a numbers driven environment.  Tech hours are constantly cut while requirements are continually increased.
good,"Beaucoup de promesses, mais malheureusement, ils n'ont pas su rencontrer les exigences tant des employés que des clients. "
good,"Center of Excellence partnering with construction, vendors and store planners to build new and remodel stores."
good,Learned to be a leader and good trainer with people of all different ages. Loved the variety of working in different departments.
good,A typical day at Target is fast-paced and ever changing. As with any retail environment...no two days are ever the same.
good,"Must be detailed oriented and great at time management.  Task aren't difficult but staffing was usually light so ability to 'wear more than one hat' is a big help"
good,I worked at target at a super target.We had contests to challenge us to help guests receive a redcard and contests to challenge each other to reach out to all guests about the benefits of the card.
good,this was a seasonal job and it was nice working with somany various cultures. this allowed me to go to school while working part time
good,It was a really great place to advance innIstarted off pushing carts and ended up working my way up to becoming a team leader
good,"I enjoyed working in HR for Target because I was able to work with the employees to make it a great place to earn their living. I was dissatisfied that one by one, parts of my job were outsourced, forcing employees to get their HR needs from a 800 number. I enjoyed helping people navigate their benefits and ensuring they were paid correctly for working safe and productive."
good,"Target is considered to be a fast, fun and friendly place to work."
good,"Daily operations of the department and ensuring store is stocked up and visually appealing to drive sales and promote guest service. Learnt a recognition culture both verbally and written, recognising team member's good behaviour and performance manage on the spot, when required.Top talent was recruited and the best team I've worked with.Finding the right people to connect with , in the company , in order to replenish and fix issues regarding inventory maintenance.Thoroughly enjoyed working and trying to build a new a company in the country."
good,When I first started working here there were only a few bad managers. The kind who were rude and thought they knew it all without actually doing it all and just pacing around the store until it was time for them to go. Within my last year there I noticed that most of the new managers were like this so I wasn't upset that I had to leave.
good,"Target in Canada is closing soon so there is no safety in this job, Target environment is really friendly , dynamic and empathetic, I loved to work at this company but it happened for this store to pull out from Canada"
good,"great work environment, friendly staff and coworkers, lots of variety if willing to be crossed trained in different fields"
good,Target was a good environment to work in.  The hours are pretty decent.  Working weekends gets old but they close for lunch which is a plus and unique to them.
good,"I loved going to work to help the guest it was very fun to help the them find what they were looking for. The store that I worked in was considered a lunch and evening store so most of the guest were coming in to find something quick and leave, they know what they wanted."
good,"This place is great to start out at. Pays more then minimum wage and has great opportunities for advancement. However, the upper management team can be very clique and are not alwasy forth coming with their employees. They struggle with understanding work life balance and availability."
good,"At Target, you are on your feet for long periods of time, sometimes only getting a 15 minute break through out a whole shift. You only receive a 10% discount and cannot do it with a standard credit or debit card. You have to have a Target Red Card or pay with cash to use your employee discount. However, if you do have the Target Red Card you get an additional 5% discount. I learned how to operate a cash register and how to interact with people on a customer/employee basis. Everyone who works at Target is very nice and helpful. I signed up for direct deposit and they deposited my money into the wrong bank account, so I did not get paid for over 4 weeks at one point. The pay is good, however. The hardest part of the job was the long periods of time that you are working the register. It is either really busy or not busy at all, so sometimes you are swamped with over 7 people in your line, or you are standing around for 20 or 25 minutes before a customer comes in your line. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and making friends with employees and customers. It was my first real job and I enjoyed the experience overall."
good,"Target has a lot to offer their employees and prospective employees. They offer benefits and fair pay to full and part time employees. They are very good at helping distinguish between home and work life. The only problem with Target that I encountered, as with most retail, is that advancement and promotions were few and far between. Yearly raises were in the pennies, even to the best of employees. Also, when we had monthly managerial meetings, we were always asked to identify bottom performing employees even if our employees were all working at an optimal level. All in all, I enjoyed most of my time with this company, but working at such a small location was difficult and pay was an issue for my family and myself."
good,"Good Company but not the best company to work."
good,"A typical day consisted of coming in at 5am,unloading the truck with another team member,then finally organizing and distributing the freight for each specified area.Ourteam leads,ocassionally micro-managed to make sure that the work was done in a sufficent amount of time.Mhy co-workers were very dependable and helpful,if someone needed help or assistance,they were there in a heartbeat.There was really no hard part in the job,for the most part I got through my area withouty any difficulty and was usually finished early."
good,I am up before dawn and work with 200 team members (different shifts).  Each team member has a job to full fill.  Management are present daily to assist as problem solvers.  Each team member is dedicated and hard working.  My hardest part of my job is poor communication and difficult balancing home life (start at 4am).  Most enjoyable part of my job is working with amazing team members.  Our partnership every day makes a successful day.
good,I do not know if it was the particular Target I worked at or ALL targets but the executive management and up were all incompetent and most were college grads that had never worked in retail let alone management.  I do not feel I was paid in conjunction with my daily expectations.
good,"I really do enjoy working for Target! I have worked retail most of my life and I would say that Target has some of the best customers that come in. I would also have to say, the other team members are always so helpful and friendly. I have never once felt like the ""new"" person on the job. "
good,Motivated individuals and teams working for a common goal. Salary is great and it has a strong work culture. Would love to see a good strategy in coming months.
good,"Fast moving pace , friendly co workers , Love the team work its very important !!! I really enjoy the interaction with team members and guest becouse helping people is what I enjoy."
good,"I worked at Target for 25yrs- 3month. I liked the company for years I had great co-workers , I consider them my family, I still do , I had a great time, until about 2010 ,"
good,"Target is an everyday retail experience including guest service and working together as a team to improve the store and always putting our guest first. I have gained way more customer service than I had before. Our management does not really interact with team members as much as they all can. Something I do wish was different was giving recognition to co-workers that do work really hard for these stores daily especially if they have been dedicated to the store for several years. something I can say that i love about my job is meeting new people from different places around the world, it is very interesting for me."
good,"A typical work day at Target is standing at a register for 8 hours straight, mindlessly ringing up customers, and doing your best used car salesman impersonation in order to get a guest to sign up for the signature Target Red Card™ . This card is the life blood of your job as a cashier. Management cares about nothing else except getting their quota on Red Cards™ , despite the fact that you just put in 1,500 transactions last week (That's almost one transaction a minute  at 32 hours a week, for those of us playing along at home), or that you have the highest customer satisfaction reviews out of the entire store. "
good,"- Very results oriented environment, which would be expected"
good,Waking up every morning at 4 in the morning everyday to unload heavy boxes of assortment items. The backroom pretty much runs itself
good,My Shift was 4 am to 8 am 3 days a week. i had to wake up at 3 in the morning to get to work and then unload trucks which is physically demanding while i was exhausted from the unnatural sleep schedule.
good,Target is a good company to jump start your career during or fresh out of college. There is opportunity for advancement and if you have a degree they will do everything they can to work with you in order to become and executive manager.
good,"When I first moved to America, I really wanted to find a job. I got hired at whole Some Choice store but the lack of management made me to leave that job and find a job at Target.I really like Working at Target, but I can deny the fact that I'm an educated and experienced person.I used to have jobs which where more demanding .Though I learned a lot about retail and customer service by working at Target, I really want a job which I can be productive and use my skills.I have been a language corporate instructor and supervisor, I had to have updated knowledge of management skills, communication skills, but at Target I can barley use my talents.That is why I'm looking for an opportunity in your company."
good,Target and really good benefits and took care of their employees by having discounts on gym memberships and such. They had weekly meetings to catch up on goals and to announce how they are doing. The inventory system was a mess though which caused many disputes.
good,Target is a great place to work if your in school. The offer part and full time postions. Co workers and very friendly. Compensation could be alot better.
good,"The place is okay to work at.  If your cashier, goodluck, and guest service well goodluck with that because you don't get paid well enough to do your bosses job."
good,"Good company to work for, entry level position are wonderful, but occasionally the management classes or doesn't work together"
good,Loved working with my co-workers. Managers were pretty nice. Pay was average for a stocking job. Had to work very long hours during the holiday season. Not much room for advancement outside of maybe becoming a team leader. Fast turnover so it always seemed like you were working with new people. Target did a good job though of encouraging a team atmosphere.
good,Coworkers are great! There is always a manager around to talk to about guest issues or personal complications. Ive learned a lot about the latest and greatest technology as well as improved my people skills dealing with guests issues. Typical day at work is normally very repetitive. Hardest part of the job is trying to help guests who are upset and aggravated that we do not carry something; or if they see something online and come into the store to get it just to discover that is is only sold online. Management can be kind of shaky. Electronics scheduling is pretty bad at least at my store. There is only about four of us back there which makes it is literally impossible to get shifts covered if important spontaneous life events occur. The best part of the job is by far the awesome coworkers.
good,"Well they made promises, delivered on all of them except for staying in Canada. Could have been something great if they gave it a real shot. If Target entered the Canadian Market the proper way, IE not opening 133 stores at once, it would have worked."
good,"poor management, little advancements,fun employees, easy job, flexible with school, not consistant with what they except, dirty store, unorganized"
good,"The job mostly consists of straightening merchandise in the store. You are given an area to reset for your shift, while balancing always being called for ""quick responses"" which is to come up to the register to help lessen the customer track in the lanes. Most of the time it takes more time coming up then it does ringing people up, only to be called up again. "
good,"I was hired for inbound area. Trained in outbound, sweeps, small package, depal, warehousing. Worked with all departments to palletize and move product from the docks to warehouse department. Tags were made and put on the pallets."
good,"Target has come a long way in work/life balance!"
good,"A typical day at work consists of dealing with hundreds of customers. On a daily basis I learn how to ""vibe"" with customers based off body language, conversation and purchases. I learn to manage my time by giving myself an appropriate gap to take care of customer needs while leaving myself space enough to take care of protocols (i.e: punching out for lunch before 5th hour, not working into my break times, etc...)The most complicated part of the job is learning how to find various ways to educate customers about our Red Cards without them being hasty with ""no"" responses or complaining about the previous security breach. My most complicated part of the job happens to also be my most enjoyable because it allows me to strengthen my abilities in swaying customers ideas and beliefs from one direction to another."
good,long nights working overnight unloadings trucks and stocking the store. the co workers was the only thing that helps you get through the night.
good,"Working at target was a typical retail job, but had enjoyable people work with. The most enjoyable part was helping people and making their shopping experience easer."
good,My work days would be a few hours a day checking people out at the cash register. I learned a lot of customer service skills while working as a cashier due to the variety of people I associated with daily. I was working as a seasonal cashier which is Target's busiest time of year. Due to the company being so busy it was hard to get a hold of management because they were off doing other duties. The hardest part of the job was trying to make my own decisions only being there a few days when I couldn't get a hold of management. On that note I can 100% say the most enjoyable part was meeting all of the new customers and hearing what they were doing for the day and why they purchased what they purchased.
good,Must be fast and efficient. Management not very good they get easily upset. Must spend most of your time working. Management believes that you need to work your life around Target and dedicate yourself to being there until the job is done past your scheduled time. Overall working there is fun I do enjoy it but the management treats the team like dirt.
good,"I have worked at target for almost 5 years. Its a typical retail experience day to day. The technicalities of the day differ from day to day but helping guests and doing the assigned work for the day is the same. I have learned customer service experience, I have learned the proper way to answer the telephone and I have learned so much about different electronics. My management team in unpredictable. Some days I have the best team above me and I completely feel comfortable relaying any issues other days I want to tear my hair out. My co-workers are generally fantastic but as we are currently in seasonal time the team members who know the knowledge are expected to do much more. The hardest part of my job is being expected to sometimes do the amount of work of two or three people while helping guests and doing my own tasking in the same amount of time as any other shift. The best part of my job is a work with some great people who I have great relationships with and there are those moments that are just worth the work."
good,"Busy."
good,Great job for teenagers or anyone fresh out of college. A lot of advancement opportunities as a Team Lead or Executive Team leader not as much for Non management hourly associates.
good,you start your day by clocking in then going to your work area and getting started. i really enjoyed this job.
good,"Working at Target really helped me learn about how to manage a group of people and show me how to run a business.I had fun working there, as well as working with the people there."
good,"Target is a great place to work if your a peoples person. Target does not pay much and they pretty much expect you do to more than what you are being paid for which is uncomfortable to me. While working for Target my days go by fast when we are busy which is likely on a weekend and when there are holidays approaching. I've learned while working at target that there still are nice generous people in this world, as for the managers they tend to follow their own policy and leave their mistakes up to the team leads to handle, not very supportive. The hardest part on the job would be to solicit redcards , I am required to get one redcard per shift. Which is a target card that offers 3 great benefits such as saving 5% on each purchase, free shipping online, and an extra 30 days in returns in two forms of either the credit version or the debit version each with the same benefits. Overall I love the fact that I can put a smile on a guest face just by a greet and a conversation plus the fact that my co-workers are very nice makes work not so bad."
good,"Working at Target itself is not a bad job; however, the pay is painfully low, as is common in retail, and the opportunity for any advancement is nil.  You WILL be working weekends and holidays, including Thanksgiving evening for the ""Black Friday"" sales."
good,"i worked cashier, Starbucks, guess service, sales floor, electronics, operator, soft lines (the clothing department) jewelry, and took over for management during there break time. all within 6 months of working there. on call the time i always came when they called. they make you do a lot and not very good pay."
good,"I have learned a lot in my 9 years with this company starting as a packer in the warehouse, I then became a backup technician to our logistics department & then fulltime as a dispatcher for logistics & recently I have joined our engineering & facilities team.  I have continued to grow despite some obstacles that were out of my control. A typical day here starts out with a friendly atmosphere, co workers & even some management are what makes the job most enjoyable.  In my logistics role there was a lot of problem solving & a fast paced environment & although stressful at times I very much enjoyed the challenge this brought on."
good,requires much customer service and also finishing routines depending on the department.
good,"A typical day at work consists of covering back up for registers, making sure there is a great guest experience in the store, ensuring the merchandise is in good condition and any other duties that may arise while working on the sales floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping guests who were genuinely grateful for your help and appreciated what I had done. Management was great and was very helpful and considerate with my schedule with me being a full-time student. I am an aspiring law student so my studies can be time consuming however management was never discriminatory to that fact."
good,If I were to work in retail this would be the company I would choose
good,"The job itself was easy if you are good with customer service and can handle monotonous tasks. The benefits were great. I had dental, medical, and 401k all for a great price. The company matched my 401k up to 5%. My issue was with the management. The management quickly became a bunch of business college graduates - people who never even worked for the company before. They tried to change everything, even when it made no sense. They hired and promoted their friends, people who certainly did not deserve to be promoted. I was promoted once in the company, and then after the management changed I had no opportunities to move up in the company or anywhere else in the company that I was interested in. I went from working 40 hour weeks to as low as 8 hours per week but averaged about 18 hours. They expected me to do as much work with half of the hours. I was tasked to do every job that my team leader was supposed to do while she sat in the office chatting with the LOD (leader on duty) and the HR person . I was a very hard worker and very proud of all of the work that I did for the company, and then they fired me. I believe I was fired because I had a problem working hard while management sat around and did nothing. I had actually tried switching stores, and they declined my request for a transfer. For the most part, everyone that I worked with felt the same. Some of my co-workers were buddies with the management though, and they would party with them outside of work. If you can imagine, they got all of the special treatment. They would come in drunk, or 2-3 hours late and the management"
good,I liked working at Target. But I guess my best wasn't good enough according to them.
good,"Very good pharmacy hours no drive thru, long hours management is ok but no clear path for advancement"
good,Went to work in Peoria at 3am mostly 7 days a week. Worked until 5 or 6 pm before I headed back to Springfield. The store was being remodeled and a new Store manager had just been appointed. Great company and product assortment. Too many hours and it took me away from my family all the time.
good,"Co-workers were amazing and friendly."
good,"Working at target is OK, the pay is pitiful, but they are flexible with your schedule as long as you give them fair warning."
good,"The company was an excellent company to work for and it provided me with opportunity to grow as an individual by guidance from the top management structure"
good,"for openers you would come in the backroom and start cleaning up what was not finished from the night before. then work on back stocking all the merchandise in the proper place. also had to pull all the priority batches to go out to the sales floor. "
good,It's a standard retail position. Working in the AP position is not as bad as working on the floor or behind a register.
good,I enjoyed working so closely with the public. The management was great and always quick to help us out with anything we needed.
good,Turnover rate for management at this location was high and resulted in poor communication to the entire team.  Workplace became undesirable and was not very flexible with scheduling.
good,"very organized, friendly environment, great work morale, good management"
good,"I work from 3AM to 8AM but am allowed to stay over and finish left over work. When I arrive I got straight to recieving to unload the truck and organize pallets with boxes off of a conveyer belt which usually takes an hour and a half depending on the size. Next, I would Typically start putting boxes in there location and stocking shelves or I will fill an empty position if there were call offs. I use a pallet jack every day and have become fluent with manuevering it. Co-workers play a big part of my job because if one person is lazy I'm usually the one to fix it and can become stressful. But when everyone is getting along and is working as a team the atmosphere is astonishing and productive. The hardest part of my job is probably unloading the truck because you're throwing every single box onto a conveyer and it is very physically demanding. The most enjoyable part of the job is making friends and having someone to talk to, aswell as looking at a clean aisle after stocking it. The management is very personable and seem to care about your health and safety. They are very kind and always willing to work with and help every worker."
good,"Its just like any retail job. The management changed right before I left. The company was making cuts to everyone's hours and the new supervisors were not friendly and created a toxic work environment. I liked all my coworkers, but under the new supervisors we were not allowed to speak to each other on the floor."
good,"As with any company, management is a real factor in an employees satisfaction/dissatisfaction.  My overall is that the majority are fair to all and do recognize individual performance."
good,"A typical day at work involves talking with my team in order to delegate the days tasks and making sure that what we do on the sales floor is in line with the main priorities for the day. I make sure that my department is clean, organized, and adequately stocked."
good,"Customer Service"
good,Nothing really special either way about this company. Can't think of anything else to write.
good,"I was hired at Target as a (primarly softlines - clothing and shoes) sales floor team member; however, 90% of my time at work was spent up at the front lanes cashiering! The team leaders call for back-up cashiers every 5 minutes - it is impossible to get sales floor work done! I do like the diversity that Target offers, however, I found that a lot of my coworkers were very rude. I also got ""talked to"" for saying ""customer"" instead of ""guest."" The 10% off employee discount is okay - but other places offer much higher discounts! I've worked in different retail stores for the past 4 years and I would say this has been my least pleasant experience."
good,"I worked over night from 10 pm until 630 am while at Target and every night started off with a fast pace while we unloaded the truck but as soon as that was done everything slowed down. Unloading the truck would take about 1 to 2 hours so we spent the rest of the night divided in the store stocking various departments. I learned how to work efficiently alone and be responsible for myself. My co-workers were helpful if I ever needed advice but the hardest part of the job was staying awake. Naturally my body wants to be at rest during the night time but that was also the most enjoyable part of the job, that because I worked overnight I didn't have to interact with customers, it made the job much less stressful."
good,Great place to work the company seems to care about employees
good,Best Company Ever! Bold initiative. Learned great leadership and management skills.
good,I enjoyed working here for the most part but management was horrible at my store. My LOD would never come out of here office to help us and would threaten our jobs if we didn't get red cards.
good,"You are expected to keep an entire if not multiple sections of the store in tip top shape, I didnt learn much the job was simple but hard to keep up with. Management was okay and my coworkers were decent, there wasnt much to enjoy."
good,Way to up beat and childish for my taste. Guys in their mid twenties acting like high schoolers and horsing around constantly. Even managers are childish. You never know how long your day will be. It felt cheesy how hard they tried to talk as a team.
good,"Target is an amazing company to work for. The company has grown tremendously since its establishment  and is continuing to grow. It is a company that will open your eyes and flourishes your experience in the work force. However, I was not happy with the management at all. They were not kind and understanding and appeared very selfish to me after having known them for the past 5 months. I am currently in university and they want me to work full time during the school year, which obviously is not possible. Hence, I was indirectly forced to resign. I handed in my resignation letter as of today."
good,"Must be able to be extra nice to superiors if you would like to move up in the company, specially in the store level."
good,"Target has a good job culture in some stores, but what really matters when it comes to culture is management's skills and attitudes displayed by management. Unfortunately, the pay is fairly low and the benefits, especially for part-time team members, have plummeted in recent years. Target rarely promotes team members to Executive positions. Executives are usually hired outside the company. Many have no previous Target experience and very little retail experience in general. In addition, the open communication, which used to help improve Target, has nearly disappeared completely in many stores."
good,"Overall good job, keeps me busy and I enjoy it. Fun, challenging and always something to do."
good,"Learned the importance of advanced planning in order to keep department running efficiently, and instill the importance of teamwork. One person not carrying their weight adversely affects the entire team. The hardest part of the job was getting all team members on the same page. The most enjoyable part  of the job was building relationships not only with the team, but also with some of the guest who came in regularly."
good,"A typical day at Target consist of unloading the truck and stocking shelves. I learned how to stock shelves properly, back-stock items that cant go onto the shelves. I also learned how to pull product from the backroom that needs to be put onto the shelves. I learned how to do inventory,how to work the cash register, and I was also a receptionist. The management wasn't very good, but my co-workers were very productive, and helpful. When you have 8 hours of work to do, but only 3 hours to finish it all, that can be very hard. The most enjoyable part about the job is being in a friendly atmosphere with your co-workers."
good,"Great company to work for fresh out of college.  They do a decent job grooming you into a career professional that can easily be translated into other companies.  I have been told that other companies specifically recruit Target ETL's.  I learned a lot about business and how to be a great leader.  I loved my ETL team but it is very draining working with over 100 team members who for the most part, did not graduate high school.  A lot of the time I felt like an overpaid babysitter, underpaid shrink. Work - life balance is what you make of it.  It is unsaid, yet required, that you work 50 hours/wk, every other weekend, and have one closing night during each week."
good,"Not much to say about Target. It's nearly impossible to get a promotion. Pay is just above minimum unless the rate gets raised. ""Team Leaders"" often slacked off, taking extra long lunches and having others complete their sections at the end of the night."
good,"A typical day at target was very stressful at times. We was always under staffed. I managed the front end; so when we was under staffed it made it hard to do my job correctly. I learned a lot at target because this was my first job. I learned team work, how to manage a team, guest service, work flow, and how to multitask. My co-workers at target was like my family, and very helpful in every situation. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to teach my co-workers new things. The hardest part of my job was dealing with upset guest."
good,Target Corporation is a great company to help you advance in the retail industry. This company is always looking for new individuals that can help maintain the company objective as retail consumers.
good,The firm was great back in the older days but since they underwent major changes not so great anymore. Co workers were all great and management was ok.
good,"Target was a good place to work because I made many friendships within the store. We relied on each other and helped one another through good times and bad. Overall, I had a very good experience working at Target, however, there was no foreseeable advancement in my future there."
good,too many leads not enough followers. work day consisted of pulling products off shelves then setting the shelves and following that placing product back on the shelves. while completing these tasks i was also responsible for guest interaction.
good,I loved working with my fellow staff I just didn't agree with the way management was running the business.
good,"learned great leadership skills, time management, Loss and Profit reports"
good,Lots of pressure to get things done without enough staff. Salary is not equal to job expected. Very little work/life balance. Coworkers are great. Lots of students. Management gets shifted to other stores after a year.
good,"I enjoyed working there, there were a few things I really didn't like, but they were minor, there was always work to do, which was good"
good,"During the time I worked here, I guess the best thing I can say about it is that I made enough money to get myself through the holiday season.  It started out as temporary but I was asked to stay on longer.  The downside is that the majority of management and senior employees did not inspire the rest of us to work harder.  One manager just wandered around the store chatting up the females.  One was a baker and she was always by his side and never at her station.  Then they decided to call me out specifically saying that I am not working hard enough.  This is when I decided to leave.  I, and the rest of the staff, deserved better management."
good,"At first they make you believe that Target is a great company. And at some stores I believe it is, just not at this location. The coworkers are great but the management appreciates nothing. They sit in the office all day and have unrealistic requirements of the sales floor team members. They have unbelievable amounts of preference towards employees that makes their decisions not fair at all."
good,"- Unload trailer"
good,"Check into online to see my status, load any new shops and then complete shops unless it's a day where I work on the floor only.  First I would see if Electronics needs anything or if there's new merchandise to be aware of then I would work my way through the store using my security devices securing the high theft products and helping guest along the way then I go to the next store across town."
good,"The work is mostly engaging with guests on the sales floor and addressing their needs (helping them find things, answering questions about a product, determining price). I learned how to be of greatest assistance to people; most of the time, when people have an issue, they will not approach you. You have to ask them and make them feel comfortable. Management treats you like children and constantly gives you new instructions. Co-workers were mostly pleasant, a likeable bunch of people. You probably won't get along with everyone, but the same can be said for most workplaces. Most difficult part of the job is trying to meet the expectations set by management, but the most enjoyable part is the gratefulness you see on a customer's face after helping them."
good,"The job was fine, but they change store managers so much and each one has a different way of doing things and they don't care how their decisions effect the lives of their employees."
good,"work is hard. But I learned to work with not so friendly customers and manage situations, provide good service and achieve team goals, work as a team. The hardest part of the job is you are active all day long which is not fun after all."
good,"My experience at Target was explored through many departments. I had previous experiences in cash control, inventory, forklift, and management but, during my time there I noticed that there would never be room for advancemnt growth."
good,"my duties was to greet guest as they entered the Establishment. i was a sales associate that assist guest with there purchase, asking every guest, can I help you find something. I also was a cashier and a Team Trainer that trained oncomeing staff."
good,"Working at Target has it's good days and it's bad days. Personally, I do believe that Target should be a part time job for students. As a team member you're required to so much with very little pay. There are a lot of supervisors and managers and everybody is giving orders; it's becomes a little frustrating at times when u following five different orders at once. The Team Leads lacks communication and that then leads to confused team members. I enjoy going to work to be with my co-workers and just the thought of a paycheck being handed to me at the end of every two weeks. If you're looking for something temporary then Target is the place for you. But, once you get it don't become complacent. Do what you came to do and move on."
good,"On any given day, I would monitor cashiers, cash flow, assist guest in finding everything they would need, kept font end clean of clutter, write reviews, worked at the service desk and at the photo lab processing film."
good,"A typical day would involve setting up for whatever job you hand and maybe handling the cash register if needed."
good,"Accounted for and stocked electronic merchandise and other stock items delivered by truck "
good,"50 hours a week, every other weekend."
good,The Target Team is great but the pay isn't and hours aren't stable.
good,Each day is different based on what is needed for the days business.
good,"A typical day at work involves coming in to my work area and receiving a status update by the co-worker I am relieving. I then proceed to perform my duties in order of most to least important in complete autonomy. There is rarely any micromanagement in my position.The Hardest part of my job involves working a shift in two or up to three departments on my own as a result of co-workers who are not present for their shift.  My co-workers come from diverse backgrounds, and although this is not relevant to the work we do, it makes work more fun and enjoyable. Having a diverse group of co-workers along with the friendly organizational culture is my favorite part of my job."
good,"Its an alright retail environment, however I've seen management in the flow team switch multiple times. The team leads would normally set unrealistic expectations. They do try to give positive recognition towards employees during team huddles(meetings). But after the huddle they talk down on you and go back to setting unrealistic goals while you're paid a low wage."
good,It was fun for awhile until management got switched around and our employees were very upset and many left. I liked my job and everything i did for the company but many of our managers were very unfair and rude.
good,"A typical day at work included providing fast, fun, and, friendly service  to all guests while maintaining a smile and clean work area. I had operated a register for almost 2 years while also being trained in customer service and sales floor. My coworkers were helpful and fun to work with and as far as for management, they were very understanding and well put together. Hardest part of the job I believe was when it was not busy and everything had been stocked and zoned already and there was nothing more in my job criteria that I could do. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to converse  with so many different people every day and making them smile!"
good,"With Target, I got to learn how far my patience really goes as far as non-sense goes. When I was at the Mount Kisco store, I had my greatest years of success during my time with the company. The Mount Vernon store on the other hand has been a very trying experience for me. Management don't take responsibility for their shortcomings yet want to ride you for yours, and take credit for when things go well."
good,only worked seasonal but it was just a ok job. they wanted me to way to much at one time. like stock the shelves work the register and answer the phone all at once.
good,Overall I like working for the company itself just not that particular location. I love working with the guest helping them with there daily needs. I also like working with my fellow co workers. It was just some management skills and benefits I had a problem with sense the company change the benefits and what not.
good,"Unload and stock items typical day at work"
good,"Fast-paced, busy, fun, friendly place to work.  Pay was not sufficient for the amount of work that was required on a daily basis.  "
good,"Great place to have a starter job. Cashier, folding clothes hanging clothes. great managers. no hard parts just an easy job. the co workers are great"
good,"I enjoyed working with the guest, and my co-workers were great. Management was good for the most part, but the register managers were pretty rude to employees."
good,i was use more then some of the other worker since i could do more. they gave me a rise.
good,"Being a cashier at Target can be somewhat fun and not so fun at times. When the rush comes, things may get a bit hectic. My co-workers and nice and fun to be around. They make the time fly by. The best part of being a cashier at Target is all the personalities that come through my line. By me being a people person, I like meeting new people and learning new things. Also, seeing the children that come through my line just puts a smile on my face."
good,typical day at work is working 12 hour shifts starting from 6am to 6pm . management was good and on the job safety was up to osha standards . all machinery you are working with is top of the line . the only part of the job that I didn't like was the advancement through the company was difficult they only hired within the company and also very little room to move up
good,So-so job. Not what I would recommend for those with bachelor degrees.
good,Typical day at Target was fast paced. I learned how to use a cash register. The management really could of used some help with what they were doing. My co-workers were really cool people met a lot of new friends. Hardest part was dealing with a rude customer. Enjoyable part was seeing all the friends that i met there.
good,"If its your first job, or you need a job while searching for something better, this is a decent place to work."
good,"The job itself is very fun and easy, Management is helpful at times of need. Hard part of job is to be in-stock for all guest needs."
good,"Typical Retail. "
good,"Good place to work. The overnight shift was a interesting and organized shift. Each work order was completed in a timely manner. All pellets were completed in reasonable amount time for the day crew to come in. Unloaded all delivered merchandise and process it for the sales floor.  I learned how to be more timely for all sales floor products. All of my co-workers were committed to all job task each night. The hardest part of the job was, not being able to be kept because the position was only seasonal. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work a full shift of eight hours."
good,"Target hired me on the spot and is overall a pretty decent place to work. I love my immediate coworkers, though the politics in the upper divisions of management that unfairly reach to us are highly unacceptable. Our immediate manager is moody, bends the rules for certain people but becomes upset when we're wary on the subject. Some people are picked on for little things that they don't even do, it just depends on our manager's mood. The higher-up managers act like they're doing us a favor by letting us work there for $8 an hour with no tips. They act like we don't work hard, when we're constantly moving. I've been there for a year and a half, and get treated as if I've been there for a day. We're never comped anything, when specific people are all the time, just because they're friends with the managers. If we have a small coffee after being left alone for three hours because of a scheduling error, we're reprimanded. I'm tired of getting treated as if I don't matter. The only thing I like about this job is that I do meet some great people, and have met my best of friends through Target employment. That's the only thing."
good,"Seasonal Employment, No room for advancement. A stepping stone to bigger and better things."
good,"A typical day at target is just like a typical day at any other job, clock in, review your task list (if have one), converse with fellow employees about any and everything, and clock out to got home. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers. Some are difficult to deal with and some are very easy going. The most enjoyable part is working with so many great people from different backgrounds and learning various things from each other."
good,"Target is a retail company which focuses on driving sales while interacting with the guest in a way which we call the vibe. A typical day consist of being assigned your workload, a team huddle and the your work begins."
good,Needed to ensure that team completed all work befor the end of the day and that accuracy was perfect. Co-workers were very friendly and wonderful to help out.
good,"overnight work "
good,"Mainly scheduled for cashier, but you do have to rotate departments. They make sure you are trained to preform duties and you can have a very flexible schedule with in your availability."
good,"Product Inventory"
good,I have to say I enjoyed myself at Target. Working in many different departments learning just about everything helped with team work and making sure our guests were taken care of. The hardest part of my job was not having enough team members to cover the lines on busy weekend or holidays. Not being able to move up on the totem poll. The most enjoyable part of my job were the customers. I love helping and they made it worth my 3 years there.
good,Is a good temporarily job but not a long term commitment. After your eight hours of shift is completed per day you will have to stay up to two hour to do re shop and re organize the sales floor as a team.
good,But not enough hours for employer with many  responsibilities'
good,"Greeting customers, exchanges/returns at Guest Service, sorting out merchandise, running cash register. "
good,"Typical a day is fast paced, always something to do for the team members, I've learned a lot by working at Target such as different skills in learning new areas. My co-workers are friendly and fun to work with. I would say the hardest part of the job is time constraints and the most enjoyable would be learning new things everyday."
good,"Usually when you come in for work it would depend on what time of day your shift started. You would either work stray or start special projects or you would immediately go to the back and start pulls."
good,Mangers were terrible and rude. They didnt understand that was in college and had a life outside of work
good,Counting Freight and Stocking the product. Company is a good fast work flow.
good,"Day in to day out my main focus was to execute.  With the cuts in payroll, I spent more time actively doing my associates job then leading my teams."
good,"My typical day at work starts off with clocking in, looking at the break schedule, and calling for a manager to come and open the equipment cabinet and tell me what section I have for the day. You take the equipment and sign it out. I go to the back into the fitting room and collect my re-shop then start working on my zone. I usually go up for back up as a cashier 2-5 times and back up receptionist 1-2 times. The co-workers are very nice, and helpful. They help a lot. The management is a bit unorganized and can get a bit chaotic at times, you have to stay on top of them to help you or change something for you. The hardest part of the job is time management, I say this because sometimes you only have a few hours to clean up a huge mess, and guests will still be in the store while you're cleaning which can make cleaning more time consuming. The most enjoyable part of the job, is the environment. It is a very welcoming environment."
good,"I believe everyone should have to work a retail position at some point in their lives. Target is a good starting out job and a good job to have while going to school, if not trying to go into management."
good,I was a cashier so there wasn't much to do before I started my day. I just had to make sure my register area was clean. I learned that the customer is always right even if I don't think they are. Management was difficult at time. I guess that's a part of the job. I had nice co-workers. The hardest part of the job was management not having an open door policy when you had a difficult situation. I enjoyed the fast pace.
good,"I do not like that I am not challenged mentally. I typically do not get to learn anything new at work because there isn't enough hours to cross train. For the most part the management is friendly and helpful when they can be. I like to keep it professional, so I keep personal and work relationships separate. Yes, I have a work friendly relationship with co-workers and will help if asked or if I see someone needs help, but nothing on a personal level. There is nothing hard about this job. I enjoy working at target because I get to work with my mother at times."
good,"It was pretty much everyday print out labels working with a pda to get work done. The management was good until we got a new manager then it just seemed to go bad. Co-workers ended up like family since there was five girls that opened the store together and well eventually we all went out separate ways. We all did what we had to, to finish the days workload. The hardest part was when our workload was overload when sometimes we couldn't find our back room things and sometimes when we had a lot of work and they put extra tasks on us so we would end up getting extra people to help us. My enjoyable part of this job was it was easy and to me fun I enjoyed it ."
good,"It was okay to work there, but the management wasn't great.  Some employees thought that they were management."
good,"Target does offer its long term employees a lot of benefits and perks. Over all not a bad company to work for, it is however retail which can be stressful especially during the holidays."
good,"learned logistics"
good,"workload is typically not heavy, I learned essentials tools for working in a warehouse environment. Great co-workers at target, the hardest part about the job is the lack of hours to work."
good,This is for the most part a good company to work for. It gets crazy around the holidays like all retail stores do. It is difficult to have a work life balance during that time. They do like to constantly change managers so that parts gets frustrating.
good,Make shore you are liked by management if not your can be fired
good,I enjoy working at Target. They make you feel apart of a family as apposed to a team like most jobs.
good,"Hi paying retail management job, with  a 60 hour work schedule during holidays and busy seasons."
good,Very friendly managers and fun work place. The only hard part about the job was working harder for less pay.
good,"If you knew the right people or were friends with managment then it was a great place to work, managment often favored certain employees giving them better shifts and a lot more hours. breaks where always cut short and they would always try to send you home in the middle of a shift due to lack of work and to many employees working at the same time."
good,"A typical day does not exist within the company, although there can be numerous meetings with internal and external clients. You need to make time for yourself, especially personal growth and development. Decisions are typically made by Senior Leaders and can be completed very quickly. It is very important to be resilient and adaptable as change can happen unexpectedly. "
good,"the employees are fun to work with but its poorly manage, and your usually stuck in one area so advancements are slim"
good,I worked as a flow member (unloading boxes from trucks)and they sure do remind you that ever day. Supervises were not the nicest but the people that work supervises and above get great benefits. to bad no one under then saw anything.
good,In my years at Target I learned how to better myself with customer service. The most enjoyable part of my job was all of the volunteer events that we did. I also enjoyed helping our customers and finding the right thing for them. The hardest part was trying to advance in the business.
good,I have worked there for about a year and a half. Friendly work environment and flexible hours. One complaint I would have is communication among sales members. Sometimes it is not clear what is expected from employees.
good,"Target corporation is a women oriented company , good facilities , Every day would be fun at work place. Since this was my first company learn t a lot about the corporate world , co yours were like friends. Hardest part was nothing as such because managers were so helpfull , in regards to work."
good,"Working in the back room isn't all that bad only bad thing is that at Target there seems to be a negative attitude almost constantly with the Team Members who work there.  Several people will constantly complain all day about the work that needs done or will complain about each other.  The work itself isn't all that bad, just the negativity of the co-workers is what tends to be a problem at times."
good,Fast fun and friendly work environment. Nice management and co-workers
good,"Overall target is an okay job, but its not a place where I want to start a career. The managers are okay but they do show favoritism, however you can move up if you show hard work and dedication. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and making the guests smile."
good,The work was fun and exciting but the corporate culture there was not for me.
good,"I prepared merchandise for the store. "
good,The overall ownership of a workcenter allows for expansion in managerial skills. It is harder to balance work and life because you feel dedicated to your position and your desire to want to succeed. I was able to build close relationships with my peers as well as team members within the store making it a fun environment to work in.
good,The work days are short and fast. My co-workers are very friendly. the most enjoyable part of the job is when the guest thank my for being so helpful.
good,"A typical day at work is sum what busy at times. Not too busy in the day and busy in the night. Guest get a little messy by leaving merchandise on the floor and our job is to keep the store zoned and according to floor plan. So trying to pick up after these guest is extremely stressful, but by the end of the day my co-workers and I will always get it all together. I will have multiple calls all at one time and transfer to the right destination. The stressful part of that is our team members will be too busy to answer the call and calls will ring right back. So guest will get angry, but I would end up helping the guest out myself. After all of the team members day we will always help and enjoy each other along with all the managers. The managers will always try to attend to our needs."
good,loaded work schedule. friendly place to work. many hours. busy season during Christmas.
good,A place where one can really hone their people leadership skills.
good,You have a monthly goal of getting the Target Debit or Credit Cards
good,"its okay, management can be shotty, and the pay is low unless your a high level manager.  It's a good place to start your work life at though."
good,"Great salary and benefits.  This job is not for the retail guru who is married to his job.  Lots of inter-target marriges, but its hard to balance you life outside of target.  Put it 60- 70 hours a week min."
good,Come in and go get my projects for the day. Also watch over the 6 people who was in my area
good,"I worked in Electronics. Its pretty fun, specially because I love electronics. The other team members I work with are really great. The managers and team leads are ok. Some better than others. Almost all are annoying when it comes to red cards, they want you to get as many as possible and will come close to basically harassing you until you get one or more. They say its to drive customer loyalty but really its just because they get paid extra for each red card. Besides that, pretty typical retail. Will pay enough to get your bills paid but nothing more unless your in high-school."
good,Consider other options first.  Its a lot of smoke and mirrors during the interview process.
good,"Like any workplace with a ton of people, you`ll either love it or hate it."
good,"Overall position is very results and execution based. Typical day at work as a supervisor is 80% hands on, 20% administrative/leadership"
good,Worked as a sales team member as well as backup cashier.I felt as tho i was not being paid to pickup others slack.I found myself many times doing someone else's work.
good,A typical day at work would include opening up the Starbucks area of Target. Preparing drinks and greeting guests. Maintaining a clean and stocked work center and assisting other work centers when needed.
good,Management is not equipped for proper training and the turnover rate is extremely high!
good,"The Team leader over starbucks for this location is phenomenal.  I have never worked with an individual with quick responses in addition to following through with requests, schedules, and issues as well as positives in relation to feedback."
good,"Great place to learn management skills"
good,"- Management from the store-level is inconsistent and frustrating."
good,"When I started with Target in the early nineties they were a fun exciting company to work for.  The pay and benefits were above average.  As the company got bigger they forgot about who put them where they are today, the everyday employees who works in the warehouses and in the stores."
good,"In my 10 years at Target Center I have learned a lot. I have learned how to work along side people with different work pace and personalities then my own. I have learned how to stay calm in the midst of chaos. And most important of all I learned how to respectfully say ""no"". As a security guard we sometimes have to say ""no"" and at the same time maintain all levels of customer service and not upset patrons or coworkers.    "
good,"I love working here for the other members on my team. The leadership here is terrible. They're not good at communicating with you, and they're constantly giving you different instructions without knowing how your job is done. Unless you do what they want they don't like you."
good,"Target can be a great place to work as a full time employee.  I saw that.  I was however a contracted employee, and was basically treated as a second class citizen, even though my work and my teams work were of vital importance to every group that had stakes in digital marketing."
good,"Fast paced, fun, looking to move up. Customer service was great helping people."
good,"My day typically begins either unloading the truck or loading one or more pallets on the line.  After that we bowl out the merchandise and then stock.  I'm usually in grocery, followed by whatever remaining departments are left after that.  Along with stocking, I simultaneously clean my garbage and gather my backstock to take to the back room.  Management is becoming increasingly overbearing and threatening.  Coworkers are a mix of both the hard-working and those who barely skate by.  Few seem to be helpful to other coworkers because of the strict deadlines imposed by management.  The most difficult part of the job is the strict deadlines.  The most enjoyable part is when we get treated to snacks, or sometimes meals in the break room."
good,"Typical day was filling prescriptions and managing pharmacy department. Learned to inter-act with non-pharmacy management as part of total team. Pharmacy co-workers were hired by myself and had a great team, dedicated to helping patients. Hardest part of job was dealing with policy decisions impacting the pharmacy department, that were made  by non-pharmacy management. The most enjoyable part of job was seeing the impact we had on peoples lives, and seeing the department grow."
good,"Mandatory 10 hour days"
good,"Training is not always consistent.  Store management is not consistent either.  Tone of store is set by the Manager and this may differ from store to store.  The hardest part of the job is getting answers when there are store policy changes.  These policies are not always clear and not consistently communicated from shift to shift."
good,I learned how to re-stock shelves with various different products.
good,The company is a good one to work for. My co-workers are fun. The hardest part would be dealing with the unhappy guests.
good,"a tough but fun job you learn a lot about good work ethics"
good,"process daily price changes while supervising price accuracy, ad pre/set-up and competitive shop teams. "
good,"Days at Target varied, although I was hired to work with gaming and electronics I'd be thrown in market or make-up sometimes which was kind of frustrating. Co-Workers were very welcoming and friendly, Management not so much."
good,company was good nights wasent that good for me and neither was the pay
good,working at target is very fast paste and theres always something to keep you busy
good,"management was very unfair, hours not steady, co workers were great hardest part of job was having management do a job that you were not required to do"
good,"Blockbuster was a good company to work for overall.  It was a more fun and relaxed environment early in my time there, but once Netflix and Redbox came into the picture, along online streaming, the workplace became much more stressful.  Competition is a good thing, but Blockbuster's whole business model was becoming outdated, and the focus of customer service was replaced by aggressively selling loyalty programs.  I met my wife at Blockbuster, so obviously the people I worked with there were phenomenal!"
good,"I learned to manage time and multi task. "
good,"Target is a good company, but it is not for everyone."
good,"Its a sloppy workplace, but only because the team leads are rude, and insensitive. Everything is straightforward, and I had a great time working there while I did."
good,"Nice employees and company values but too many employees with a managers label. As a result, projects frequently get passed onto the next shift/team. Average pay scale for Retail."
good,Managers work side by side with team members to complete daily schedules. Completing daily duties and helping guest can be a challenge. Holidays can be very stressing. Co-workers are friendly and helpful. Best part of the job is helping guest with their shopping needs.
good,"Busy day filled with getting your team to perform better every day through coaching, encouragement and floor presence."
good,They took pride in their store and it shows. Very organized and well kept up.
good,"I enjoyed my years with the Target company. I gained much guest service skills, and did thoroughly enjoy my team members I worked with and most of my supervisors. Great place to work if you really enjoy managing retail. Target always is on top of what's new and trendy in fashion and store merchandise."
good,"My overall work experience with Target was good. I worked hard and got promoted rather quickly."
good,Target was a very nice place to work with great co-workers and management. Everyday I looked forward to coming to work while working there.
good,"I worked at target for around 10 months before i couldn't take it anymore, if you are looking to change positions you better be ready for a long wait no matter your skills. i wouldn't recommend as a first choice."
good,"Target is a great place to work as well as shop, you will learn many new task on a daily basis"
good,"As a Guest Service Supervisor, I have had the opportunity to interact with my team and large variety of guests on the day to day basis.  My duties include talent management, delegation, problem solving, and motivating my team to drive for results and to excel in all tasks.  The hardest part of my job is the ability to embody teamwork.  Within our organization there are numerous departments in which managers have their own personal agendas.  As a result of that it is very hard to carry out the goals and visions of the organization.  The most enjoyable part of my job is working hands on with my team.  I have taken the time to get to know each individual on personal level, making them feel comfortable and creating an open door policy in which they can come to me with any questions, comments or  concerns.  It has also given me the ability to recognize top and bottom perform and identify strengths and weaknesses, allowing me to use it as development opportunities.  I have had the opportunity to grow and develop throughout the years and I would love to be able to make an impact on another organization as well as continue to expand my leadership skills."
good,"As a flow team member, the work is pretty good in the morning. Very repetitive but still good. On my average day I would unload the truck, load the shelves, and then assist other departments until the end of my shift."
good,Was security for target corporation. Was a good area to work but at time scary and difficult. Had to stop criminals from stealing product from target unknowing if there was a weapon the criminal had. Was able to learn a lot when employed in computers and management of a team. 
good,"I generally start my day at work by logging on to my PDA and pulling orders as fast and accurately as possible.  We are on a strict time schedule and need to get the product to the sales floor in a timely fashion.  When all of the orders are pulled my team and myself move to the sales floor and help push part of the store before the store opens.  We then move back into the backroom and backstock everything that came in on the truck that day.  I love the fast paced environment, team work, and positive attitude that my job offers.  I sometimes wish there were more challenges for me and more advancement opportunities with greater pay range, but overall I do enjoy my job."
good,Empresa que muito me ajudou a desenvolver minhas habilidades.
good,"Oversee front end operations. Recruit, hire, train and performance manage team of 40. "
good,"Not the best of work environments, you're really just a cog in the machine there, not a whole lot of opportunity for advancement. Typical day of being under staffed, overworked, and complained to that your not working hard enough. Management at my store was horrid, getting them to do anything was like pulling teeth. Co-workers were some of the best I've had, the only thing keeping the store going were the grunt workers."
good,"New Employee"
good,"loved working with my co-workes,typical day at work fast and friendly cusomers "
good,"- Managed hourly productivity among 15-20 team members"
good,"Target has the potential to be a good job. I started as a seasonal worker and then they kept me after the season and told me that I was no longer seasonal, but they would never schedule me for more than one day a week which I couldn't live off of, even when I continuously asked for more hours. If I could work more hours I would no complaints. "
good,"Typical work day: although the tasks may be the same, working with customers is always a new experience and sometimes challenging."
good,typical day at work requires keeping up with inventory and customer service. I learned that not all work places are perfect but you just have to stay positive. Management wasn't so good .My co-workers was friendly. hardest part of the job was trying to work without proper equipment. The most enjoyable part was helping everyone in the store to complete work task
good,"Its a great company to work for in regards to salary and benefits, however, as much as they preach work/life balance, they make it hard for you to have a decent one. They want you available all of the time and has even called my personal cell phone on days off and while I'm on vacation to have me assist and figure things out as an hourly paid worker."
good,"working for target can be a relax day and productive. i have learned about the power equipment in the back room, how to organize and stock items. management is dedicated to meeting the customers needs. my co- workers work in a team to get the job done. the hardest part of the job is not getting the hours you want. the most enjoyable is getting to listen to music while you work."
good,Completing multiple task during work schedule due to the fact that the store doesn't have enough hours to run the store properly.  Management struggling to fill open spots due to cll outs.  Staff moral down due to not getting enough hours in order to take care of their families.  Being able to assist the customers is most enjoyable.  
good,"Ringing up customer items, using cash register. Management was a more behind the scenes, didn't work or see a lot of the managers. I mostly worked with Team Leaders. I knew a few of my co-workers and they were friendly and nice to work with. There was nothing really hard about the job maybe closing at night, cause it took so long at times."
good,Minimum 50 hour work week.  There is a lot of focus on teamwork and partnering with peers and management to ensure store success.
good,"The typical day at work was going in and entering all money from the day before in the system and getting all the registers ready for that day with money that they needed to start in the cash registers. I learned how to run reports and order money, how to make deposits and encode checks. There was only one other person that ran the office with me and we worked separate days, we were always leaving notes for eachother. The hardest part of the job was it was only part time and since I ran the cash office, I could not run register because it was a conflicgt of interest. It was nice going in getting your work done, and not having to really answer to anyone as long as the safe balanced."
good,"1. Executar e implementar todas as práticas de meio ambiente, segurança e saúde ocupacional dentro da unidade do CIAT em todas as operações e serviços relacionadas ao transporte."
good,my day at work was okay management sucks they wont give you your break when it was time 
good,"Expectations are set, but no accomplishment is ever good enough...always pushed to do more even when you deliver the best results.  There is no feeling of appreciation or value."
good,worked overnight with alot of fun people but this is just a job overworked under paid
good,"While Target is a good company with great benefits and flexible hours, it is hard to move up in the company without a bachelor's degree and the management is usually comprised to 20-somethings hired right out of college with little to no work experience."
good,"Pay isn't great and raises are small, but they provide food in the breakroom a lot and the people are great to work with. I obtained a lot of leadership skills from the job because you are expected to be proficient at the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people that I worked with."
good,Most enjoyable part is getting to see the diversity of the customers that shop in the store.
good,Starts from unloading shipments of products and dividing them to proper places they would get stocked on the shelf. All trash are recycled and boxes sent to the bailer. I back stock remainders that can't be stocked on the shelves in the back room.
good,"Each day I'm given my task which is typically either a full aisle to reset or a selection of sales planners/end cap sets which are to be completed by the day's end. After getting my supplies I will begin the new sets, re-merchandising product as necessary. During this time I will be pulled off task twice a day to assist other areas of the store that are in need of assistance, which can take anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours each time."
good,"A normal day of work generally consists of doing roughly the same thing for most of a shift: restocking shelves, helping customers(who are actually in a good mood 99% of the time), and answering calls either on a phone or a walkie talkie. I did learn some things about small team management most prominently that environment is the biggest factor in the cohesiveness of a small team. Many policy changes in the last few years I feel have caused a greater and still widening rift between those of us who were on the floor and management, but it would only be a major adjustment for those of us who were there in the ""old days"". This leads to the hardest part of the job in my opinion is trying, on a near weekly basis, to figure out what management wants. There used to be a clear set of longer term goals and now the goal focus is more ""in the moment"". It is difficult sometimes to adjust to ever changing goals, but the best part of the job has a tendency to nullify this aspect most of the time. The best part are the co-workers. I only worked at one Target location the whole time I was with the company, and when given an opportunity to leave I never did mostly because of my friends. Family is a good word to describe the relationship between co-workers. There were very few times the we didn't get along with each other."
good,"A standard day of asset protection for target would include ensuring that team members and customers were safe. I learned how to work in a new environment. The management that I encountered was different from the military, it seemed more self serving with a front of service. The hardest part of the job is the restrictions placed on the position that limited the ability to complete tasks in the proper fashion. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with limited supervision and completed multiple tasks."
good,Typical day involved working on a vertical CNC milling machine. Days dragged on and the work was very dissatisfying.
good,Typical day at Target was filled with lots of guests with different issues. There would be good days and bad ones as well. I learned to do my best to solve a issue without getting others involved to show guest that I cared about them and wanted to help. My co-workers made my job fun and made the day go by faster. Hardest part of my job would have to be getting items thrown at me from guests and still having to display my professionalism. Enjoyable part of day was taking breaks and lunches with co-workers.
good,"Target is a good company to work at and eventually make a career if that is your preference. Depending on the management and that's for any company, things can change for the better or worse. I went through that transition and team members had a hard time adapting. I was big on team member happiness and development. It was hard to move up in the company."
good,a typical day working for target would be very fast paced at times or very slow at times helping customers or cleaning to the store.
good,"I was an Executive Team Lead (Assistant Manager) for over three years. There are great programs and processes in place for leadership development. There are also numerous opportunities to contribute to the communinty through volunteer events. The work schedule can be excessive, demanding, and inconsistent. 12+ hours days are common, especially around the holidays. If spending time with family around the holidays is important to you, this may not be the best fit for you. Overall, a good learning experience."
good,"Depending what store and area you are in, Target can be a great place to work for. However, when it comes to work life balance. Because Target is a retail corporation, the hours and workload are also quite demanding."
good,• Led remodel team during store renovation
good,"Target keeps the retail industry competitive with a fast, fun and friendly culture as well as guest service."
good,"if i could describe this job in one word it would be lacking. they lack in concern, communication, team members, products, consistency, flexibility, and understanding. they thing i like about my job, are my fellow sales floor team members, and actually helping the guests to the best of my ability, but because of lack of a strong team, solid hours, and organization, the guests are no longer our first priority, which is what we were taught from the beginning. i have learned that for a retail store such as this, location is everything, and no matter how much you want to leave and broaden your horizon, they always will make it seem as if you'll never find anything better. a job such as that i believe is a job for high school kids, or some one who sincerely enjoys it."
good,"Although employers were nice, better selection of the management team would help."
good,"Co-workers and lower management tend to be best here. There is virtually no way to advance other than learning other jobs. The problem is that this doesn't guarantee you hours, and the pay is horrible."
good,"On a typical day at work I start in a fast paced environment with unloading and loading process while having to work fast, organized, efficient, and safe. I learned key roles of a logistics process."
good,Outgoing co-workers kept the hours flying. I worked there when it was still constructing so it was very interesting seeing the store come to life and fill up with merchandise.
good,"this is great for those who go to school. dont have a busy family. and for those that dont mind working every single weekend. they dont, from time to time, just give you a weekend off. you have to request it."
good,"Early morning shift. Typically working in the stock room, clothing department,and/or market area (if I am not training any new employees). Usually working alone or unsupervised. The management is very friendly. The hardest part of the job is working with unqualified co-workers or having to carry the work of another employee. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping a customer and accomplishing my task list."
good,Cut hours during the slow times which hurts job performence and guest who need help. Will work alot of nights and weekends. Now they are starting to be open on holidays. Hard to support one self with the hours that they give you to work.
good,Target is a great place as a second job or supplemental income. However unless you are looking to have a degree and work your way up into upper management you will never be able to afford to work there as a sole income.
good,it was ok but hardline was the least paid plus sometimes the management was a little pushy and aggravating
good,i only worked there for a couple of months i was only a temporary employee but i did enjoy being there
good,Most enjoyable: Servicing the guest and training baristas
good,"General retail, Target, is not a great place to work if you value consistent schedules and time with the family over the weekends."
good,"A typical work day would entail coming in at five in the morning and preparing the deli department for a succesful day. This would include making 100+ sandwiches, helping with the salad prep, helping with frying all hot foods, assisiting customers and filling their desired party platter orders, working the shipment of needed supplies, ordering, training any new persons to the department, and going to any department in the food area that needs additional help. I've learned that it is always better to go in wanting to achieve the most you can and to learn all that is necessary to complete your job to the fullest of your abilities. However, in turn, that can be looked upon in two ways; as a stepping stone for advancement, or as a person who can be walked all over by management because they are willing to go above and beyond. Management at Target CAN be great but the majority of the time it makes you feel as small as an ant. They only look out for the monetary values of the store rather than everything as a whole, including the small things that can determine the morale of their employees. However, the co-workers are always friendly and help to make your time there better. I believe that the hardest part of the job is trying to get your ideas out in the open to be heard. When you come up with something that is new and innovative for sales, it proves difficult to get others on board to test it out. The most enjoyable part of the job is the feeling you get when you know that you sincerely made someone's day better by helping them out or making something to their exact liking."
good,"Good place to work. They treat their morning stock people well by offering them an incentive to start work before 6am. Higher up management often has negative attitude to employees, but team leaders tend to be understanding and helpful."
good,Clean and great work environment. friendly and helpful staff. But management is very shady. Be extremely careful when they hire you.
good,"A typical day at work would be taking the boxed products off of the pallet and ""Bowl"" them out to their location in the store...I learned how to read the labels on the boxes. I enjoy working with my coworkers. The hardest part of my job is working the third shift hours but the most enjoyable part is working to complete a goal"
good,Target can be a great place to work at I usually clock in for work walkie the L.O.D and let them know of my presence at work and continue to communicate what i will be doing for my shift or if they had something else in mind for me to work on. The team members there are great team members some of them could be more to themsleves but overall we work as a team should.Managment at target can sometimes be a little weird only for the fact that target has so many L.O.D's when there all there every single one of them might have different expectations or one of the L.O.D's might give you a different task to work on.The hardest part of the Job is trying to please and impress every manager there because they all have different expectations but my enjoyment of the day is having a produstive day completing all my tasks and going home accomplished.
good,"Typical day was drowning, most workers were not respectful or they did not look too happy. Management was okay. One LOD, however, was rude and passing judgement along, but I remained respectful and optimistic"
good,"Managers can be unprofessional, But other than that is a overall great place to work. Great people come to shop there everyday with amazing personalities."
good,ok place to work at good job. ok place t work at not bad. this was and is a good job but went to school to better myself
good,I have worked as an Electronics Team member at Target for two years. The best part of the job is helping some one who knows nothing about electronics leave with a better sense of understanding what various electronics can do for them. I learned how to up sell products.The hardest part of the job is dealing with lazy co workers who make the your job harder that it really is.
good,Definitely a place to thrive if you fit the mold....otherwise you may opt to look elsewhere.
good,Great company to launch a career. Great Training and Leadership development. Lots of uncertainties as decisions sometimes made and communicated down with very little notice. Not your average 40 hour job. Work life balance is a struggle.
good,"My co-workers at Target are great. We all work together as a team. A typial day can be very challenging, but aslo very rewarding I have the opportunity to meet and greet many diifferent people from different backgrounds and cultures.My only concerns at Target is your work scedule can very dramaticlly from week to week."
good,"My work day begins at 4:00 am. I have worked in retail many years and have admired Target for their organization and logistics from day one. So, eventually I became interested in the backroom after working as a filler in both hardlines and softlines. I respect all management and admire them. I wish I could have opportunities to learn more but my interest also include children and Early Childhood Education sparked my interests. I received my degree after two years of balancing work, my studies and my new grandaughter which made me more interested in the education of children as I realize they all have great potential.I take my job very seriously in retail becuse I have worked in the business for over 35 years and retail is my first love. But, I want to be a lifetime learner and I feel my gaining my degree I reached a goal and need to pursue my new interests."
good,My typical day at work was unload trucks and stocking the shelves with merchandise.
good,all supervisiors very nice. Did not like the way breaks were given
good,"Ive only been working at Target for 1 week and I'm already looking for a new job. I have yet to meet my team lead, and my trainer was super rude. Everyone seems to know each other and it's very hard to fit in. No one seems to want to help. You are constantly being pulled to different areas which makes completing your task impossible. Just not my thing, I hope I find something else very soon."
good,Loved the job at first.
good,I worked overnight so i didn't have to deal with consumers but overall the staff and management team were good
good,Helped with the store to keep clean.
good,Pay is not enough for the amount of work expected to do. Ive learned how to work under pressure and with a sense of urgency. A typical day is working the boxes from the truck to the line to the floor to the backroom. the hardest part of the job is when these trucks are 2000 pieces. The co-workers are nice people and the management is decent. The most enjoyable part of the job is working black friday
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting so many great people. Working with a team of over 500 team members can be a daunting tasks but it can also be very rewarding. I've learned the ability to multi task on a high level, engage with people from various backgrounds, and I learned how to give tough feedback. The hardest part about the job is the long holiday hours, when you would much rather be with family enjoying the holidays. Target is only closed 3 days a year."
good,"I was responsible for zoning, responding to back up on registers. I helped stock and price and was a cosmetics specialist and did some jewelry specialist work as well."
good,It was great place to work employees were fun to work with as well as mangment
good,From the time I started Target made me feel like family. I got benifits and help learning new skills. I worked the whole store that gave me the skills to move on.
good,the company was absolutely great but the store did not have the best management staff
good,"Great environment, helpful and motivational Managers, always busy and provided food and drinks fequently."
good,"Since working in Target, I have had a great understanding about the position I am in. Sometimes the hours are hard to come by but when you get them you appreciate what you have. I like the fact that we do have the opportunity to give great team cards to our coworkers in recognition for good work and management do care about our welfare."
good,"I get to work at 4am on mon, wed, fri, and some sat. When there I help to off load the truck. Then I go out to the floor to stock the items. Most days the truck has around 2,500 items on it. We work as a team going around the store to get it done. I leave work at 8am. It is a good job, just not many hours."
good,It was a good job while it lasted they tend to hire on a lot of people seasonally so it is hard to stay on after that.
good,"I started as a seasonal cashier, and was quickly trained to work guest services (returns) and sales floor after my 90-day period. I agreed to cross-train in Food Avenue since that team is always in need of help (short staffed)."
good,decent place to work..learn alot..boss was very cool..co workers were boring but ok and nice..customers are easy to deal with
good,"I'm not sure if it's the economy or the constantly rotating management staff, but the quality of environment at Target has declined. There is more workload and less hours every week and the same level and standard of completion is expected of the lower employees. The people at Target are the only thing right now that make it worth dealing with, as the general employee is smart, clean and fun to be around. However, it is a general consensus among those same employees that things are getting rough at our store."
good,I learned new skills and overall enjoyed working for this company unforutunatley there were not enough hours we moved up north and 4 hours a week was not enough to keep working and i was told that it would not change for a few months I was very saddened to have to leave but the gas prices at that time were extrememly high.
good,When I first started at Target I loved going to work everyday. As the years moved on and management changed things drastically changed. The people that were in management were freshly out of college and were not trained properly. The team members knew more than they did. Best part of the job was meeting and working different people.
good,helping guests and stocking shelves you can always find another team member to help you out
good,"It's a great place to prove your work ethic and advance if you wish, however you'll learn quickly there are far too many chiefs and not enough indians with Target."
good,"Between customers and co-workers, Target is great great place to work. However management makes it impossible to keep that ""Fast Fun and Friendly"" vibe continuing throughout the day."
good,"Unload trailer working with a team of 30 people, replenishing the sales floor in a timely manner for the best customer service. Hardest part of my job was the paper work associated with my job, management never took the time to teach the employees that needed extra help handling the paperwork aspect of the job. Co workers were always working as a team and helping one another. Most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to build a better department that increased sales."
good,typical day is ringing up guest and taking returns. I learned that you should kill people with kindness. Management was ok we switched half way during the year and the new one was a little different. The co-workers were ok but most were a little lazy. Hardest part of the job was when we were short handed and busy. The most enjoyable part was learning how things were ran.
good,"Diversity , with open arms. Friendly and customer care is very important."
good,"I worked every other weekend. I was over the Lingerie, Shoes, Accessories and Jewelry departments. Set adjacency and checked for proper signage."
good,"A typical day at work is I pull the merchandise to be put out on the floor, then backstock frieght fron the truck. I learned that you have to be willing to do what it take to get the job done. My supervisor is a great person to work with. The people that I work with is great, we all pull together to make sure that the work gets done in a timely manner. The hardest part of the job is the amount of time that thei gie you to do the work. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we have fun while we work."
good,Worked long hours with nonstop craziness. Guest were a nonstop being in a small shopping center you had more people per minute then most stores.I learned that with hard work the managers trust and help you more. Most co-workers were willing to help 24-7 others just stuck to themselves. You have to be outgoing to fit in right.The hardest part of the job were the days you went in at 3pm and got out at 3am.
good,People I worked with at Target were nice. The hardest part of the job for me was standing on my feet for 7+ hours straight.
good,I loved working for Target. my co-workers were amazing but the management was very lacking in organization and communication. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the lack of communication between management which made it very hard for us sales associates to know which task we were suppose to be working at any time. The most enjoyable part of this job was learning new things and also the family like environment that my co-workers possessed.
good,"One thing would have to say about working at this company would be that the management seemed to really be adement about the work that they have to do. They were good managers and provided, motivation for the team as we worked. The co-workers are usually nice happy people, providing a comfortable work environment. At times, it would seem like your work would go unappreciated. For example, I was a truck unloader. I would break records with how fast me and my co-worker unloaded the truck. All the managers would do at that time is say ""You broke the record, now go even faster"". This went on until we could go no faster and then were shunned for no longer making records. Though the people are nice, and managers are motivational at time, the shifts were long and didn't leave room for life enjoyment and balance, then at other times you would get no hours and would able to afford bills.. Advancement was possible, but it took an grueling amount of time to do so."
good,i wish i could have stayed at the job a little longer but i was only hired for seasonal.
good,Nothing special. Pay was very low and they do not make u feel as if your part of a team.
good,"Co-workers are great, management not so> the hardest part of the job is dealing with guests. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with my team"
good,"Day in and day out Target is changing, I learned a lot from the changes. It is a good challeging career."
good,"My typical work day is being a cashier. Being a cashier, I have to interact with a lot of people, and meet their needs. The management staff gives great feedback about job performances. My only wish is the managers be a little open minded to the employees suggestions and needs. The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting and being social with the guests. Some guests can be a little difficult, when this occur, that is when my become difficult. Another difficult aspect of the job is recieving more hours. if one is not a manager or team lead, it is impossible to receive 40 hours per week."
good,"A dynamic, fast-paced company to work at either as a hourly or salaried professional where opportunities are plentiful."
good,The atmosphere overall was pleasant
good,"fast pace, i learned cashiering and assisting customers. my co workers was cheerful and very supporting of me, i recieved great training from my co workers"
good,My work included: working with/ assisting guests with questions and sales in the electronics department.
good,Typical day consisted of helping customers and cashering.
good,Management was not that understanding. You help customers find what they need and help them get familiar with the store the more you work there and know what your talking about.
good,They days always start at 4am which is 4 hours before the store opens and no matter how fast you go you are always rushed to get the work done.
good,"I was hired right out of college and was the manager for the food department. I was a little too immature to be handed this much responsibility at a young age and I just wasn't ready for 50-55 hour work weeks and getting behind the company mission when I had more in common with the high school kids that were working for me than my ""peers"" who were all in their 30's - 50's."
good,"Everyone knew their job. We would help each other out when needed as some days had heavy shipments and were understaffed. I've learned it's not about how well you perform a task but how fast you can complete it as well. As far as management goes, I felt there were far too many chiefs in one tent. The hardest part of the job was the inconstant scheduling. The most enjoyable part of the job was taking on large tasks each night & my superiors having the confidence in me to work independently, on a team, or in charge of the seasonal workers. I liked the responsibilities I was trusted with & that I could make my team leaders happy by meeting their expectations."
good,Target is a great job to start off with as a teenager. Nice management that works together.
good,Great environment to be in if you are young. This company is a learning company that is constantly looking for fresh talent that is at the top of their game.
good,Unloaded trucks and stocked shelves
good,Was a good company to work for. Was understanding and helpful
good,"Target is a nice place to work at, you meet great people, and a nice clean work environment. The pay is way to low. You do get paid vacation and insurance."
good,"favoritism ( races) on employees, benefits are not okay. i learn about accepting check on cashiering."
good,"Great associates to work with,"
good,"Excellent work environment, colleagues are very friendly and fun. Management delegated majority of their tasks and rarely helped with minor sales floor duties."
good,"First of all i didnt get trained, and i was quote on quote being ""targetized"" . I would get talked unprofessionally to about something that i wasnteven trained on etc."
good,It is difficult to grow with this company while balancing all of your other job functions.
good,"The positive things about working at target are the people, the team I work with is great although we`ve all had our moments like any other job overall I enjoy the job. Target has accomadated me with my schedule and they are very understanding. They are also the only job I`ve had where they give so much team recognition and supply us with food everyday in the breakroom. Being a instock team member we are constently getting pulled in various directions and are the ""go to"" team but if you like fast pace work this job is definetly for you."
good,I worked in guest service. My job was to make sure that I took care of any customer concerns and work throughout the store.
good,"Sign in review any reports during day, go to post watch for shoplifters and any work given by my Team"
good,Putting items on floor and cleaning my area. Didnt learn much. Management was efficient. Too many co-workers. Alot of people doing the same job. Hardest part was lack of hours. Most enjoyable part was seeing guests and helping them find what they need.
good,Target is a fast paced environment. I learned how to work in teams. Management didn't really help if you wanted to move on to the next stage of management. I just needed the tools and guidance to help move to the next level.
good,Typical day of work was unloading huge receiving trucks onto pallets and then placing all products onto shelves. Lots of physical labor with not too bad of employees. Hardest part of the job was unloading the truck because it had to be done fast and the pallets in each section would fill up quickly and the pushers (people who move pallets to each section) rarely did their job. The most enjoyable was putting the items onto the shelves and different areas.
good,"I only work here to supplement my income. Although the pay is lousy and there are minimal benefits, the people who work there make it all the better."
good,I worked here through college. I attained by BBA and easily recognized the poor management. It might have just been my store.
good,A lot can be learned at target. It's a matter of taking whatever chances given. Though they started getting overly strict about some simple rules. pays was okay but yearly raises were 15 cents to none. They started cutting a lot of hours and demanding too much work.
good,"Managing a team of 15 to 20 plus people ,work load assignment ,scheduling ,payroll management,daily paperwork,deadlines and time lines management,all while providing excellent guest service. hardest part of the job is meeting timelines most enjoyables was the people i worked with."
good,"I LOVED this place when I started, but now it's become a place where I ask myself in the parking lot do I really want to go in. Work is very easy and fun. The lack of advance or moving up in position is really slim. I've moved up once, and not that much of a raise."
good,"Many phases of work load in one title, department manager. Not boring as I worked all over the store where needed."
good,"Target as a Corporation is great. They mean well and if you are in well with Managers you will get promoted. However if the managers don't like you, you do not have a shot at a promotions. Promotions are promised to people before interviews and they just go through the motions so they can tell Corporate they did interviews. (Yes I have seen this first had at numerous locations.) However on the whole for a part time work most people are friendly and has a small family atmosphere. Great for a first time job."
good,Steady-pace work with a lot of interaction with customers. Great job to develop customer service skills. Cashiers are forced to pitch credit card sales which may be off-putting to customers.
good,Target doesn't offer many hours and doesn't pay very well. I felt uncomfortable trying to sell credit cards and didn't like that you could be penalized if you didn't get a certain quota. People were friendly but I didn't enjoy this job. I did however like that it was almost always busy so the day would speed by.
good,Ive been working here for 15 months and I hate it. We're almost always understaffed at night and be constantly get nagged about assignments not being done on time.
good,"There was always something to do to keep busy. Everyone worked together as a team. However, the management was poor."
good,"As great as my Target job is compared to others that fall under the qualification of entry-level, dead-end, and having relatively low-education requirements, the longer I've worked at Target the more ways I see the truly corporate mind and body hiding behind the pretty face. Since I consistently work in several different departments- all of which as a level 1 team member (the lowest)- I'm very familiar with the positive and negative aspects of each department which many of my team members experience. I wish i had a bigger voice & better listeners when I try to explain these common everyday problems that compound upon themselves. The best part about working at Target are the people you work with. In the end I think they're the only good reason to ever stay w/ the company for extended periods. At this point for me, it's honestly the only reason i still work there."
good,working at this company was ok everyone was very helpful in assisting you on achieveing your goal. If there was something you did not understand some of the staff members would gladly assist
good,I miss working at Target but the management will not go around your school schedule or other job schedule even if you bring in proof of schedule they still will give you problems some managers we’re pleasant but it takes a couple of rotten apples to ruin the batch.
good,"Great place to work if you're looking to make your own hours. However, more availability means more hours. Often understaffed so you'll need to pick up pace to make up for missing personnel. Pay rate higher than most retail."
good,"This was not a fulltime job as they stated. only got 12 hours to work per week. They hired and laid off the previous employees so no benefits to be offered,"
good,"As a DBO the expectations can be challenging, with a new Store Director  coming in for the first time since 2008. I find it interesting to see how a new set of eyes sees things, and starts changing the operation for the good."
good,"I learned many things, learning how to satisfy a customer, Enjoying/comfort your time as a customer well, feeling comfortable around other workers, caring for one another ."
good,"Great flexibility with scheduling if you do not mind working nights and weekends. Can be tough when you have children at home, but overall a great company to work for with a great mission. They are definitely on the right track and a leader in their industry."
good,I was getting harassed at work. HR never bothered asking me if I was ok despite her knowing what was going on and me trying to transfer for over a month. Petty management .
good,There was nothing that made me happy about working for Target.  I believe I am a hardworking individual but they expected you to do the job that was made for 2 or more people.  My fellow coworkers were friendly and helpful.  The associate discount wasn't worth it.  The starting pay is good and above minimum wage.  Overall happy to not be working there anymore.
good,Late hours poor management. Low pay constant turn over at every level. Lot of politics with management. Understaffed almost every day. Would not work again.
good,"Work is consistent throughout departments, expect to work holidays. Scheduling can be hectic at times and they are very strict on clocking in and out. Overtime is generally frowned on."
good,Was alright for my first job worked there for 3 years I had gotten decent hours when I got there then they started dwindling down after the holidays but other than that it was fine
good,"Pros: 45 minute lunch break. The employee discount and break room was nice and spacious. Pay is above minimum wage."
good,"At target, I was able to continue to develop my skills towards the pharmacy profession. I continued to deal with patients on a daily basis and helped resolve a variation of insurance claims."
good,"Ok workplace, staff is friendly and helpful. Hours and schedule substandard. Could benefit by hiring more full time positions with benefits. Company is more focused on volume and provides little incentives for advancement of employees."
good,Target has been an acceptable part time job for the past year. But the company is starting to cut hours on the majority of workers who need them most.
good,"I was treated decently by management but certain coworkers constantly put me down even with managers nearby,not a healthy work environment if you have low self esteem or issues with your confidence which most new employees tend to have."
good,"Just needed for the busy holidays. Helpful, nice mgmt. and co-workers."
good,the pay is good but they push there workers to do jobs that are too much for them to complete within one shift. If your looking for a job that pays well target is the way to go but their scheduling sucked for me because I was a high-school student working from late evening to late nights not having enough time to focus on my school work
good,"Target was a decent place to work, the only problem i had was that it was seasonal and wish it was more pay. i felt i did a good job but did not get haired on permanently."
good,"It was fun in the beginning but everyone started stressing about who was going to get cut at the end of the season. I enjoyed the job, but felt like management had no interest in communicating with employees."
good,Very busy learned a lot about store functions and fashion and store inventory and customer service and sales also cashier functions and fitting room duties and visual merchandise displays
good,Lots of things to do at Christmas time. Always in a different department every day. Weekends are included. Very busy at the holidays. Big turn over of employees at this time.
good,Thanks for the job.  The pay got a little better.  It was a good position for the term I was there.  I have since moved on to a different industry in a different state.
good,"Again I am having to write a review for a company that is no longer  providing employment.  "
good,Different job types are available for those with different interests.  The people there are all very friendly and helpful and encourage success.  They have stores all over so there should be one close by.
good,Soft lines breakout team is an early morning shift. It’s nice as long as your a morning Person or as long as you’ve had your coffee. The management team was terrible but was eventually replaced with amazing team members who were eager to work along with you.
good,"It's good, people are fun and energized, everybody is friendly and willing to help, and the costumer-base is amazing, just grand, helping people everyday with the target company is a blessing from God."
good,Target had a positive atmosphere which the team members and managers strove to strengthen and include everyone into the atmosphere. The hardest part of the job was only managing time to make sure and complete all the tasks for the day. What I enjoyed most during my time at Target was creating the connections with other team members and leaders which only enhanced the work environment.
good,"It is a decent job, but nothing challenging and I NEVER saw the possibility to grow inside the company, they treat people with respect and all, but nothing out of the ordinary"
good,I used to like and love this job it was fun because all of the good people that come everyday the customers bring me nothing but love and happies that's the only thing I love about the job
good,"I worked as a seasonal fullfillment team member at Target and it was overall a nice experience for me. A typical day at work involves clocking in, letting team leader know you arrived and they tell you what to do for the day. Fullfillment is taking online orders and orders that will be mailed somewhere. We get assigned a task on our device and we have to look for items which people purchased online and scan the item inside the store or in the backroom. It was very easy however it's frustrating when I couldn't find the items in the store. The co-workers there are very nice and helped me with locating items. The job also consists of boxing items which customers bought which was pretty fun in my opinion. Everyone there was nice to me, they helped me open up more which is nice. Never be afraid to ask for help or you will be behind. It's a fast paced job but you will get the hang of it. I guess one of the cons of working here is that the hours are inconsistent. One example would be going to work one day from 3pm-11pm then the next day I'd be scheduled to come in at 6am which means I'd get not enough sleep which I didn't enjoy. They also schedule you to work holidays except Xmas which is okay I guess. It wasn't that great working holidays but it's whatever, it's busier on holidays too. Sometimes they put you in a different department even if I was in fullfillment sometimes I'd be stocking in the store which only happened a few times. Customers are nice, if you get hired ask HR for a name tag because I thought team leaders give it to us but you have to tell HR to give you one. Overall"
good,"I have learn many different skill , it expands the learning experience. I’ve learn a lot. I have developed many relationships that have help me through it all so I can develop in a professional way."
good,I enjoyed working at target. It was challenging at times and gave me the work experience i needed to experience in retail. They gave great hours and the pay is excellent
good,"It was very nice and cool. I loved working there. It was very brilliant. I was lucky to work there, they delivered my newborn child. I love Target, so much."
good,"My position was seasonal. Target's workplace is very tidy and generally friendly. I did not learn much during my seasonal employment. The management was very helpful during training, but I learned most things through repetition."
good,Target is a great company to work at they are very understanding. They’re main priority is customer service provide whatever it is to make sure the guest has a good reason to come back to target
good,"The upper management did not listen to the managers/teamleads/team members of the store. Target does not reward previouse seasoned experience or a good record/work ethics but instead has an entirely different manager rate you for yearly raises. Lots of favoritism of  minorities existed, and promotions were often givien to minorities in favor of other deserving employees. Lots of good people were trampled over."
good,"They were cool, just wish the hours could of been longer, they drop you like a bad habit once they are done with you, I didn’t like the way management treated people."
good,"a typical day at work is very busy, I learned a lot, management wasn't always very helpful, the culture was accepting of everyone which was very nice I think and the most enjoyable part of the job was the people i got to work with"
good,I haven't worked at Target for approximately 10 years so I don't remember much of what they provide. I do remember being oddly close with my coworkers.
good,"Basic job, what you expect when you think of being a target employee. Different jobs within the store (clothes, tech, backroom) which is pretty cool. Otherwise basic job."
good,I love my job at Target but the cons outweigh the pros. The management here is really bad about actually caring for their team members. The atmosphere is very drama oriented and not a fun place to work.
good,"Target is an excellent first-job environment.  They have reasonable pay, decent hours to give, and straightforward work policies.  That being said, I found it was a very difficult place to work long term.  Target broke my spirit and the corporate policies are difficult to understand and therefore difficult to relay to customers.  I was not properly trained in store policy at any point in time and no one should be expected to be formally trained in that either."
good,"Cashier machines are easy to handle, the locals are friendly, reasonable hours and breaks, no judgement, supervisors are helpful and good teachers, communication is a must since everyone is busy, and lastly theres no micro managment which makes working there stress free."
good,"Pull stock from the backroom to stock shelves inside the store.  Assist guests with products within the store and pull from the logistics area."
good,"One thing I did like about this job is that I was always busy so the day would go by fast. I do like getting close to coworkers though and with this job, I could not really do that."
good,At target I enjoyed being let loose to work on my own task and projects with little interference; but managers have a hard time communicating the tasks to the employees and the start of shifts.
good,"Comfortable place to begin work history. not much room for advancement. Managers are flexible when scheduling hours. Could be given more hours to reach a true ""full time"" schedule, but over all is a great place to work."
good,"Meeting daily demands of a busy retail environment requires great efficiency and adaptability.  I have learned many skills including relating well with customers, supporting the needs of upper management and keeping the store up to date."
good,"Typical work day is fine, understaffed frequently but there's no quality of life working at Target. No PTO until 1+ years working there, hard to get time off."
good,Working at target is something I won't forget. It had its rough days but for the most part i felt like i was doing work that mattered and that helped the customers.
good,Target really wasn’t a bad place to work I just had a very bad work ethic and didn’t really realize how important having a good job and making good money was
good,"It's a great company to work for. Great benefits, pays well and depending on the team and Leaders you will enjoy working there. But some locations are horrible to work in especially Brooklyn."
good,I get there in the morning and start getting things off the truck then see what I have to do in my area for the day. I enjoy working with my co-workers  at work. Management  could be better in the way they do things.
good,I have just earned a level of respect for cashiers now knowing exactly what they go through on a daily basis while helping the customers I to want to serve the community with patience and compassion
good,"Generally, I was pretty happy about the job I was hired to do at Target, which was mainly unloading trucks and stocking shelves."
good,"Poor upper management. "
good,"For the first year I really liked it there, it was tiring but paid well for part time. Then they changed some things, and management got stricter and I got moved to cashier because I couldn't keep up with the ridiculous pace I was expected to work on the floor. The hours also got really inconsistent, some weeks I'd get less than 10 hours and other weeks id get almost 40. Wouldn't really recommend unless you're going full time."
good,Left because of no hours and and not fair for team member that is not appreciated by management...expect a lot to be done in 4hrs shift..you have to do zone push and mainten the zone nice and neat.
good,"A typical day was doing the same thing every day. Usually will zone out sections of the store at a time. After so, you would help put back items that customers didn't buy. Sometimes you would go and help cashier when needed."
good,Target is a good company with great corporate ethics and team-centered culture. The workload for salaried managers makes having a work/life balance very difficult.
good,"The training was being stuck with a team member for one day and than I was expected to do the same job they were doing the next day. Registers were actually taught  well, though by someone who was relatively new so some questions weren't answered. Most managers were decent and fairly well organized but my manager treated most of us as cogs in a machine and always had us switching focuses halfway through a shift. Hours were very flexible, and most of the team members were awesome."
good,"i don't really remember to much i was working with them a long time ago"
good,Your training is like crash courses. Management doesn't always resolve problems in the work place. Everyone isn't the most respectful. Depending on your area hours can be great or terrible but you can always pick up shifts. you can only pick up shifts in your area; unless you are cross trained in other areas and Target isn't always willing to do that.
good,"Cool people to work around."
good,"I really didn’t like being a cashier at target, maybe if I was on the floor my experience would’ve been different. I found the job kind of boring and very repetitive."
good,I liked my job at first.  They were very attentive to the younger workers.  The person that was the head of cashiers did not like the fact that I talked to the customers.
good,"I learned how to use their ""my devices"". My coworkers were nice except for one guy who was a pervert and would harass the female workers.  When this was reported to HR and my manager they said they'd no longer schedule me with him.  I ended up being scheduled to work with him for months until I left because I couldn't take the harassment anymore."
good,"Just there for seasonal. Just an inbetween job. The management didn't seem like they really had a plan for seasonal employees so I wasn't trained, so I had no way to advance or have job security."
good,"As a sales floor team member, most of the day is spent restocking shelves over and over in a single section."
good,"Target is a great company to work for and is very innovative.  If you work in stores you will work close to 60 hours a week as a leader, so work life balance is very challenging.  However, that is the norm in retail.  HQ lobs have a much better work life balance but it is VERY challenging to go from a store to HQ."
good,The pay there is really good they just want you to be someone your really not. They started off giving all of us great hours and then as the weeks went by our bourse got cut shorter and shorter.
good,target is what is to be as expected at target which is to me that of catering to the customer we refer to as guests thats what comes first all the time
good,"Overall I enjoyed the company and the people, the management could have used work. I wasn't getting enough hours and was frustrated when I was getting the bare minimum"
good,The management and team leaders need serious improvement to make target better. There is too much noticeable favoritism going on within the team leads which makes the work environment very hostile or makes team members not want to work or deal with them or sometimes makes the workers choose who they do or do not want to work with. The leads show no proudness or enthusiasm in their work or in their workers. Never show gratitude towards the workers for great work and tends to focus more on the negavity to discuss amongst each other and other team members and do not care if their heard or not.
good,I been employed for 5years and have engage so much experience. Really great company to move up. I really enjoy working there because my leads can help you and understand if you need some changes on your availability.
good,My favorite part of this job is the coworkers. You will meet some of the nicest people when working here. The most enjoyable part of this job is having friendly people by your side.
good,This is not really a job that you should consider a good work enviroment.  They hire managers at the age of 18 who do not know the laws of giving break and lunches.
good,The upper management are excellent to work with.  They take customer service very serious.  Flexibility is somewhat ok.  I think your experience depends on your supervisor there.
good,work is not that difficult but can get hectic at time. i recommend this for a first job but not a career. cant really advance in positions there unless you know somebody or have a degree.
good,Retail is retail. It always comes with high highs and low lows. You realize early to become a team player rather than feeling like you are on your own or have to be on your own.
good,Your managers will work with you sometimes and can be hard on you sometimes but you just have to work through it and make sure that you get what was needed of you to be done
good,"Great place to work and loved the employee discounts that was given to all employees."
good,Pretty fair job. Nice environment. Busy during holidays. Management was understanding and friendly. Co workers were nice too. Would recommend to anyone that likes retail
good,Working schedule should give their employees at least 8 hours to rest before beginning their next shift. Should treat employees with value and respect.
good,I enjoyed working for this company for the most part. Managers were helpful and the pay was good. There is a variety of things to do and learn which was nice and every day had an element of different
good,"I loved working in the Starbucks pay during the time I worked there was great "
good,If you need a job during the busy season for retail jobs then I would seek out this business for good pay and decent hours. Don't expect to be kept after the busy season you are only there temporarily.
good,"Target started off as an excellent work experience. Later on in the job, things got tough, due to management accusing me of things that weren't happening."
good,"I rated the company as three stars.. This is not a bad result, but I believe there is always room for improvement. My time with the company was enjoyable.. My operation ran seamless"
good,"The downside is anywhere from August to December we can get mandatory for 56-60hours a week. While fulfilling orders, I have a strict productivity rate per hour to maintain. I work Saturday-Monday, 12 hours a day."
good,My managers always worked with my schedule there. The pay was decent at the time and the minimum wage has since raised to $15 there. Overall I just had a hard time moving up.
good,"Target was a good company to work for as far as the job. It helped teach me a lot of things. However some of the manager positions would let it go to their heads and would boss people around rather than show them their mistakes, I myself dealt with this problem and I saw others go through it too."
good,Working there is good at times. Management had been down hill for a while and there is no real sense of where the store is going. Management relies way too much on employees to get things done.
good,"The job itself wasn't that bad, honestly the worst part about it was the customers. Management was about what you would expect in a place like this, generally nice, but they very rarely had your back when it came to a rude customer. Decent starter job."
good,"While working at target, I made a lot of connections with other workers as well as helping customers. I loved working at Target and would recommend anyone to work there."
good,The time invested in training the Ship to Store department and other departments should take more than three days...especially for a seasonal associate. The better the training...the more efficient the worker can be.
good,Pretty good place to. Nice people. Scheduling is unpredictable.Management is helpful. There on some late nights during the holidays. work can be as late as midnight.
good,"As a front end employee, I consistently utilized my excellent customer relations skills.  Parents, Mothers with young children, as well as the physically impaired customers always fully appreciated my assistance with transporting their purchases to their vehicle."
good,Caring place of employment that gives you the opportunity to progress in a career at Target. They also pay very well in terms of minimum wage. Good place to work!
good,"The pay is pretty good considering the job itself. Lots of drama, and employees that aren’t at the front end have to work in solitude. Managers can be very rude and unprofessional rather than mature and managerial."
good,"Working at Target was great.  I would there for 12 years, however, in year 11 when I transferred to be closer to home, I did not get the same since of belonging as I did prior to transferring which played a part in my leaving the company."
good,"Target is all about making sure that the customer has what they need. "
good,It was an okay place to work at. They would never give me the weekends off even though I took it off early. They were some what strict about dress codes and it was just an okay place to wokr
good,Most of the people there are ok to work with. If some get promoted they start to act like they are more than you are or forget where they started. Not a great enviroment
good,"- pretty typical larger warehouse style of retail , lots of merchandise"
good,It started out real cool but there was no advancement at all and the insurance plan was not what it was cracked up to be. And they are really not true team member friendly.
good,Target is a pretty good place to work overall. I have learn a lot and met a lot of great people. I like the fact there is a since of teamwork at target.
good,"I enjoyed working there and the environment was amazing it was just my transportation, otherwise I would still be working there and the pay was good.."
good,"Rivoli group is reputed company.Where you can learn manythings and get yourself implemented as one of the best potential employee. Company deals with luxury products like watches,leather.Eye wear etc."
good,I only worked there seasonal. They do not give you much training at all. They coworkers are kind of rude. I only worked there for a seasonal stocking job
good,"This job pays very well, but work life balance does not exist. There are no consistent scheduling and you never know what the day will turn out. Management is not good."
good,Ok to work there if your young and need a job and the hours are good if your going to school or college you can pick your hours and shifts it’s a ok job
good,"Everyone is nice and understanding but management is all over the place. Maybe it because of the holidays??? Anyway, its nice working there but it’s the little things that make it not worth staying"
good,Workers there are usually upbeat. Most supervisors are always willing to help and are giving advice. Workers always willing to lend a hand if a team member is behind.
good,I have worked for the company for 8 years and I didn't have any problems until after I became disabled. Everything I did became too slow. Other people that were disabled were also experiencing their hours being cut. It's terrible that such a large company could allow hard workers to be treated in such a manner.
good,its like working at any other mega store just have an upbeat attitude and have knowledge about the store you good there are opportunities to have different roles just ask and apply
good,I liked working there until I needed to leave the job. They wouldn't let me quit. I just had to stop showing up for them to understand I no longer want to work there.
good,"There is very productive work environment. On the weekends there are surprise food days and everybody is happy for those. If your a student, I do not recommend working here because your availability take forever to get approved."
good,I sometimes felt like they didn't appreciate us and wanted us to be robots. Only a few team leaders and ETLs ever said that they were thankful for the amount of work that we did.
good,I left Target a short time after I started working there. I found that the hours I was expected to work interfered with the time I needed for my studies.
good,"Everything is okay in the work area sometimes. The environment of the workplace was TERRIBLE. Carts everywhere! Some customers were nice, some customers were rude. They did give good hours to me, just the work was a lot. Never working overtime again."
good,"working in market (putting away food from truck deliveries) is tense and overbearing, you will have your hands in the fridge/freezer for hours depending on how many people they decide to schedule that day."
good,Target was my first job and my coworkers were great! Management could've been better though. It was a good first job to get me through the bills I had at the time.
good,"This job is good for teens or someone who doesn’t have a lot of bills. U can work here to maybe pay your phone bill or something. It’s good if you just want a second job for a lil extra money. Not for someone who has BILLS, like me. I only get about 4 -6 hours. You will maybe get days but u won’t get hours. The pay is 13per hour but that’s not much if u get no hours. I haven’t made a 500 check in a  Year . My checks are 1-400 dollar every two weeks. Not enough money.  Especially since I have to take disrespect from customers every day "
good,"If this is your first retail job, and you do not like to actually work, then this is not the job for you. There are expectations, and always something that needs to be done. Just sitting around is not an option, and actually just getting in the way of others. If you do have good work ethics, and like to keep moving, then Come work at target."
good,"I have worked at the Evansville North Target for almost 3 years, and throughout the years the experience that I have had has been down hill. The first year I enjoyed the new experience and the ability to be with cosmetics everyday. However the way management was handled and training was not top priority. The newest store lead has brought better attention but does not bring back positive reinforcement individually to employees."
good,"Friendly team members, easy daily tasks, fast paced environment, stress & pressure during the busy Christmas period, satisfaction of helping customers when needed"
good,"Was a good job  "
good,This was my first real job and I did like it for the Time being although I did like my co workers and other staff I would not work there again........
good,A place where work will feel very fulfilling if completed - requires a balance of people skills and time management. Managers are competent and will do whatever is in their power to help the team succeed.
good,"I miss working here , I loved being here It felt like family here . My typical day at work was I come in have a smile on my face and help customers through the check outs ."
good,"It's always busy in the workplace. You're always on your feet, helping customers and other employees. Which means there is hard work to be done. Target is where I learned patience for others. Management is always over your shoulder, breathing down your neck. However, they do try their best to help you out when in need. The hardest part would have to be holidays, it's always shoulder to shoulder. Many complaints on whichever item we ran out of, kids getting lost, little fights here and there, messes to clean, items out of place, the list can go on. The most enjoyable part would be that I got to interact with others, maybe a tourist out of state or country."
good,"Overall it was a great experience to work for Target. Over the years I've had the opportunity to understand my role and grow so much in Merchandising. "
good,"I don't fully remember what it was like working at Target, due to the fact that it was during my senior year of high school. It was hard work, and I was let off instead of being kept on, as I was a seasonal higher."
good,Its a regular job just like any other associates job. I think its ok if you like to deal with people and help them find thing all the time. Its like adventure time everyday
good,"Over time it became draining , its not a forever job, find something you love to do ir something you have a passion for and pursue it... this job is only worth it as a stepping stone to get where you really want to go"
good,"Ideally, working in an asset protection environment is best under cover and the store security left to uniformed officers. However, with that being said, the perks to working here were limited given the time I worked there. The training was fast paced and daunting but once on the floor working with team players, there was some excellent first hand experiences."
good,"It's a great part time or first job. If you're going to school or have other obligations but it's not the best place if you need full time hours. They simply don't hire anyone full time, ever."
good,"One the more enjoyable things that I had with this company, was the day to day regular customers, I liked that  I was able to make their order and have it ready and out the door in a timely manner.  I also liked working with my manager that I was assigned to. The environment there was pretty easy going at times, and a controlled chaos in peek times."
good,"You clock in, start work, they tell you where they need you or what you need to do, most times busy, they prioritize to helping guests first and always making them happy, hardest part is keeping up with the demand of what we have to do"
good,Overall the work atmosphere is okay.  There was high demands where you must get their company credit cards and to scan quickly or you get fired. The workplace is filled with different cultures when I used to work there.
good,The STL and LOD always find new duties to do for us. a typical day will start with meetings and end with building reports for managers to review what I have done during the day.
good,"Management is very helpful always willing to work with you. The downside is the low pay and low hours within the company. If you plan on starting off at target and working your way up you will be lucky to have 28 hours a week, you might want to think about getting a second job."
good,"After working here for a few years, trying to advance was never gonna happen. Not because I wasn't  right for the position,  but because I wasn't a personal friend of upper management. Yet the person they would promote, I'd  end up training. After doing that a couple of times, I decided to quit."
good,Target was a good place to work if you’re not looking for a full time job. They don’t work long hours and paid minimum wage when I was there. The employees were fun to work with.
good,"An average work day at target was fast, productive and always challenging me with a scenario that required adaptive skills in order to overcome. Whether that was something regarding a customer with a unique request or simply a scenario that I had not experienced yet before, Target always provided a way to better myself as an employee."
good,"Target was interesting. I'm very comfortable and relaxed with warehouse work, but at the same time I never had a job with such vague instruction. Long nights with little direction. Great pay though."
good,"Target is a great place to shop and a great place for an entry level job.  Their consumer goods are moderately priced with a very high quality and the neighborhood is great, affluent and diverse.  The story was constantly busy which ensures more job security, and the opportunity to gain more retail experience and meet people from all walks of life."
good,"Are to assist the guest in store, Cashier, clean up and maintain the sales floor. During a closing shift,   I did store recovery, Store operator, Cart Attendant."
good,It is a good place if you want to learn new skills. Some higher managers are great. Lower level management depends. You'll get enough hours at the beginning but after a year definitely get considerably lower hours. Work environment is not much bad if you can tolerate all level of people's reactions on you.
good,You start with a ton of hours and make very good money the longer you stay the worse it gets. Unless you move to the back and help stock they refuse to let me move and I’ve been there for a year and a half now
good,It a part time job to pay the expenses while study  at the university .Other  things to work in the free hours  to produce to myself an d the society today.
good,"I've worked at 2 Targets now. My original Target was great! Simple job, come to work, unload the truck, flow through the store as a team interacting with your co-workers as you work. As long as your work was done in a reasonable time, the managers were happy. Then if you wanted more hours just ask. But then I moved to a new Target and things changed. Individual work, strict deadlines. Lots of scolding if you were not meeting the the deadlines set even if you were completing all of your work. Managers conflict innthier orders to team members because they are all scattered. One would cone by and tell you one thing. Then another would come scold you for it because that wasn't how THEY wanted it done."
good,"Good place to work and gain costumer service experience , tho some things need to change . Manager need to see what it’s needed for the workers . Also new equipment, some  handheld devices didn’t work properly"
good,a typical work day at target was ok business as usual like any other day on the job.my team members was fun and easy going to be around. I learned how to get another with coworkers and customers during some of the most busiest times of the year. the culture of the workplace was great crazy and insane energy from all different kind of people from difference places from around the world. the hardest part of the job was the beginning when the company was a little understaffed but being in target we made do with the hands that we had. but overall that was the was the past part of being a team member because no matter the amount of work we got the job done.
good,The management was not the best. Coworkers attitudes were not the best. I worked whenever they wanted me to day and night even graveyard. But wasn’t acknowledged for it. Still told me what I need to improve on that wasn’t really necessary to the job.
good,"The work at Target is fast paced and often, demanding. It demanded a Team effort to accomplish the many goals we had. It requires knowledge of computer skills and often changing goals. Customer service was of vital importance and it was necessary to greet every guest with a smile and the individual help he or she was seeking."
good,"Working at target was ok. The people where great to work with never a issue. Even though its 4 in the morning, everyone is smiling and in a good mood. There where just not enough hours. You would probably get about 12-16 hours a week."
good,"It was a good part time job to save up money for going to school. Paid fairly well, hours were not a problem, and the environment was friendly and inviting."
good,Working at Target provided a fun experience given the individuals that work there and the culture of the store. Break rooms were often stocked with food provided for all.
good,The people that work the same position as you are very friendly and train pretty well. The management is the issue. Management like at every job has the problem of favoritism.
good,I liked working at Target for the most part however I was not always be treated in a respectful way by all team leads. I've had leads snap at me and just overall seem very stressed out and I've seen the stress at times trickle down to team members. I've had coworkers tell me they were yelled at by leads or treated very aggressively as well.
good,It's retail. It's a good job if you are looking for part time like going to school. Depending on what area you are in the work load isn't too much. The management was probably the worst part of it all in my time there I have seen leaders leave and be replaced and leave again and then they all have different ways of doing things and do changes.
good,"Target is great place to work at, if you enjoy retail work. Great community of workers will make a working day go by quick and discounts for products  will have you shopping for everyday essentials."
good,Working in the area I was employed at was challenging but rewarding in its own way. It wasn’t a hostile environment but it did teach me about patience and working on my craft in a high risk store.
good,I learned many different skills from Target. But most importantly I learned how to be good with guests and with helping them find their items. It was hard learning where everything in the store was but I learned eventually.
good,"Working at Target was one of the most strenuous experiences of my life. I came into work happy everyday and left so burnt out from everything they required of me. They pay is really really good so I stayed, the co-workers made it enjoyable as well. Overall I'm really grateful for the lessons that working at Target has taught me, I wouldn't be as hardworking of an employee if it weren't for them."
good,"I learned how to management my tasks everyday and at every time, if it would get busy what to prioritize and do in moments of need, hardest part about this job was that there was no much time to slow down as usually target it is a busy place where guess would always come at any moment of the day and I would have to be ready to answer any question the guess would have."
good,"target  is not the easiest place to work, but my store built character and skills. I am proud to say that I learned a lot about retail in Target. the sad part is that everything is based on time. the newest ETL is amazing and understands we are not robots and thing wont get fixed overnight, but the pressure is there. The reason I left was personal, so I would recommend Target to the fast, organized, positive, and head strong person to make it."
good,The workplace was good environment and the co-wokers were friendly and helpful. I worked stacking and replacing the food products and backroom stock. Helped customers with any questions about the products.
good,"Working at Target was an exciting experience at first during the group interview process and the one on one interviews afterward, but while working there some of the customers saw the employees more as just drones rather than people. The management seemed very distant at moments not being as friendly with some employees and other employees also seemed very distant and not very friendly. The most exciting part about working at target was being able to go on breaks."
good,Fast fun friendly environment. Manager takes care of the employees well. They gave you chances to grow within the business very rapidly. Benefits are available
good,target is an easy workplace where I help other associates unload trucks and fold clothes and hang clothes out on store consumer floor. also use register
good,Its a retail job so its hit and miss with the hours that you'll work and with how busy you'll be. There were times that there was no one in the store and others where it didn't seem like there was an end to the customers in the check out lines.
good,Working at target was great however they push you to sell the red cards which got over whelming. Other than that it was a good learning experience and helped with communication skills
good,"It you go to work everyday with a good attitude it's not a bad place to work, very safety conscious, it is tough physical work but the schedule can sometimes make up for it"
good,Good job...Inconsistent hours are the main drawback. I would recommend Target for second job but as no fulltime for front end entry level employees hourly wage is great but getting hours are difficult.
good,"They make sure to ask many situational questions, in order to assess your capability of handling a large team, and multi tasking. Problem solving is a big part of the job."
good,I got to unpack all clothing. Either folded or hung the clothes up then took them to the proper areas to be put out. Only down fall with this job was not enough hrs and they keep hiring more people instead of giving current employees more hours.
good,I enjoyed unloading shipments and helping customers find what they were looking for. It was a seasonal position and was not offered a full time job after the holidays.
good,"Target is great for a starter job as a teen, but there's not much else I can say about it. Learned a lot of skills I can hopefully now apply elsewhere."
good,"if you meet the right people in your department you will love the job, but trust me you don`t want to meet the wrong guys. its a great job though"
good,I loved it the first couple of months. Then our supervisor changed and it went downhill from there. The new supervisors lied constantly and no longer respected you or your time. It became unbearable. The job would have been great if not for management.
good,"After one week of working, was asked to be an opener. I am a quick and eager learner. I do not have to be told several times. Great communication skills with customers as well as colleagues."
good,I enjoyed the opportunity to help a customer find what they were looking for.  The downside was the stock was always needing to get to the floor and wasn't done in the time allowed so that the aisles were cluttered and it was hard to work and then get the floors cleared.  The pay was low and Corporate sets the yearly amount of raise and so the pay was low.  There was no incentive to work hard when pay was not based on performance.
good,"In the middle of a restructuring. Work is increased for most departments, with hours cut to match. Work is often always behind, while having to deal with customer service as well."
good,This seems silly to write a review for my job at Target Canada as it is no longer open and has shut down? It was one of the best jobs I have ever had with an amazingly positive and supportive work environment.
good,Fast track warehouse work. Very productive stayed to myself and worked. Very good if u are looking for a second job with hours in great pay! Have good flexible shifts you can pick from also a friendly environment to feel safe.
good,A typical work day will consist of inventory and item check for prevention loss. Checking statues of camera locations for possible theft. Regulation parking lot traffic.
good,Not the hardest work in the world but not the easiest either. aspect of the job is definitely customers and the kinds of questions and things they would ask for and if you gave any back sass you know you get in trouble by management so you just went along with whatever it was most people all right but you know you get those few people.
good,"The night shift has the best people to work with, but the time frame is just hard to deal with. The dayshift co workers were not bad, but the management just wasn't that good and caused alot of back ups"
good,"The customer base seems friendlier than other retailers, and so does the colorful employee base. It was a joy interacting with people in the workplace. That being said, the job process and environment seems frequently mired by corporate stipulations, work process changes, typical corporate retail tropes, and ""surprise responsibities"" - some of which don't make sense."
good,It started well but then after like three months past. Management start acting up (started gossiping about people) and the also bring there personal problems to work.
good,Working at target was a good experience for me because I was working in the kitchen that was something I liked to do and I got to learn how to make pizza and other foods
good,you will develop great leadership development skills which will help you with any other job after target. Expected to work a minimum of 10 hours a day.
good,"I had a pretty pleasant work experience here, pay sucks, management is ok at best. Nothing that stands out to me as note worthy about the company.  "
good,"Need better management. Communication with employee."
good,"Beaucoup de possibilité de développement, malheureusement, les choix stratégiques de cette entreprise l'on amené à fermer tous ses magasins au Canada"
good,The target I worked at was so unorganized. It was hard to help guest because things were not stocked properly. It was hard but the pay was good. The other employees were awesome as well.
good,"I liked the culture, environment, and values of the company, and the pay was pretty good. However, they are very strict about availability, especially on the weekends, and if a supervisor doesn't like you they can easily deny it (and did). They are also very task oriented while saying they aren't and to focus on the guest, yet they push you to get all your stuff done even if there physically isn't enough time. Everything is very unorganized and everyone has the attitude that it's ""not their problem"" so some things never get done until it's a bigger problem. Overall, I wouldn't recommend unless you are specifically looking for a retail job and already know the similar demands, and can be available on the weekends."
good,There was always something to do when working at target. The best times working at target was during holiday season. The store was very busy and filled with joy.  The pay wasn't that great which is why i had to advance my career.
good,"face paced job always need to be on the move to get the job done not enough workers to handle the multiple delivery trucks. workers are friendly and helpful, but training isn't that great."
good,"The company teaches you good foundations in leadership abilities, but doesn't extend beyond that. You will not learn technical skills and how to apply thought leadership to better deliver results."
good,Not a bad place to work for especially for a first Job but if you are a college student definitely do part time. If you aren't a college student it will be hard for you to move up in the company and I wouldn't stay here for more than 2-3 years
good,Pretty good place to work but sometimes the hours do get hard to acquire if you are a full time employee. Overall the work is straightforward but sometimes they do require you to do more than can possibly be done.
good,"It was a seasonal job and a cashier. My responsibilities included handling cash, scanning bagging items, giving change and a receipt, and occasionally helping resolve a grievance of some kind."
good,Target is professional but sometimes it's hard to deal with the new manager. I am trained on a lot of the functions there so they switch me around a lot which is fine.
good,I worked seasonal and it completely shows that seasonal hires are really not cared about. There absolutely no praise towards them even though they do about the same sometimes even more work than an actual associates. Management is nice but not really helpful.
good,"As far as a long term career at Target is concerned it should probably not be your first option. While target stores are aided by a strong management team and team members willing to work hard and be a cohesive unit it is hard to maintain a peak, well trained status as turnover is high. High School/ College students would do well to gain valuable guest service from a company very oriented to its guests."
good,Professional workplace tough job but fun employees. Job could get very stressful and difficult especially lifting the boxes and unloading all of the trucks.
good,It was boring but I made okay money and they gave me a lot of hours. It’s not usually super fast paced so if that’s the type of work environment you like.
good,"Target changes constantly, however it's a great company to learn retail.  There training is great, and they are very technologically driven.  It is fast paced so be prepared to work hard."
good,Target is a great job in retail.  I was hired and kept on after seasonal. i was cross trained in various areas of the store and was able train other the same.
good,"As a Target seasonal worker, it was great there was much freight to be worked in the stock room but the team effort was great and made the job much easier."
good,"The communication was poor within this Target. The management was ok but needed some work, for example some of the managers would get frustrated that some people couldn't work more hours when they well know that person is in school."
good,"They are raising the min for pay across the teams but the trade is they cut hours and then want people to do extra work and time you to see how much more time they can shave from any task. very quick to stack on multiple tasks when you walk in and then add more on within the first hour or will tell you to comply change all your tasks and then try to get someone else to do it, which may happen to you on the reverse side."
good,Target taught me how to deal with various personalities and attitudes. I dealt with various customer and problems on a daily basis. I was a team driven work environment.
good,"Exempt employees have long hours, work/life balance can suffer.  Benefits have come a long way and are pretty decent.  Lose PTO if resign or termed.  Enjoyed my position with Target.  Very clicky."
good,"Other than that, the company has gone down hill. The management team is horrible."
good,"This company has great pay and benefits, but at the cost of expecting even a basic entry-level team member to complete the work of 3 people in 8 hours or less. Corporate strategy shifts every few months, so nobody is ever on the same page about expectations. Leadership is expected to sit back and manage, but it is impossible when payroll never allows it."
good,"Target was a fair place to work, and the employers attempted to make the store an enjoyable experience, but I found the work tedious and tiring and monotonous."
good,"Target has a horrible way of distributing among it's employees, and in the same space, is stingy on the hours it would take to actually do the work. Overtime? Forget it, unless it's around the holidays then they're very generous."
good,"When i first started, it felt like a fast, fun, and  friendly environment. Everyone worked as a team. with the new pay raise, they NEGLECT the needs of their employees! GUEST SERVICE is also being neglected!! Management sucks now! everyone at my former store was replaced with  people who's focus was no longer guest service! The hours were very unstable! Target needs to focus more on their employees as well as they focus on guests!"
good,This job was okay. It was good enough to pay the bills. they gave you a lot of free stuff easy job. sometimes the customers on the phone where rude. Decent place to work at
good,Management is incompetent and assigns more tasks to individuals than they should. The backroom was a logistical nightmare. God help the workers at the San Dimas Target.
good,Target is just like what you would expect it to be. I worked in the cosmetics section of the store and occasionally would be called to help other parts.
good,Overall the workplace was not too bad although the pay and hours were a little odd. It did teach me how to cashier and work with customers. I personally did not enjoy the area and travel distance to and from work.
good,"It would be nice to be able to get full time there, not much of a chance for that to happen. Fast-paced and hot.  Not scheduled enough in order to receie health insurance."
good,I do not have any comment on this company. They did not offer enough hours to live on. Was close to home and convenient to commute to. Thank you very much.
good,Good internship program. I appreciated having a mentor that I can talk to if I had a question. I enjoyed being able to work with a different department in the company.
good,"I only worked at Target for a short period of time, around 2 months i believe. My time there was very normal, i would've liked to have stayed past the seasonal position time frame for the employer to decide if they would like to keep you or not! Overall, i have nothing but glowing things to say about this job or my time working at Target."
good,"Target is a great place to work at for the retail experience along with great communication skills you will aquire. If you work hard for the company/ store, you will be able to rise within the company quickly."
good,Target is a fine place for someone that needs the pay and wants to work in a relatively nice environment. I was always treated nicely at target but no place is perfect.
good,"It started off as a good job for work experience in the beginning the pay was good but I wanted to find another job opportunity. overall target was a good company to work with, but after alot of major changes to the work task time goals to be very choatic, with unrealistic time goals to complete a workload for the day that is why I left."
good,I learned at target how it is to work in a retail place. It is very busy and little to no down time because of fixing the sales floor/ restocking/ helping guest on sales floor/ register/ and answering phone calls for guest. The most enjoyable part of the job was answering phone calls and putting items on stock for the guest.
good,"I have enjoyed my past 12 years with Target. As in any company, changes are inevitable. It was unusual to go one year without changes. Recent changes have been the biggest and honestly the most frustrating. I loved the people I worked with, but hated the micromanagement. It often seems like team leaders are doing the majority of the work, while the executive team leaders are sitting in their offices."
good,"Target was great when it started like every relationship when it starts. But it slowly starts to drain you. It’s a tiring job for little pay, but the experience is bearable. My coworker weren’t all great but the ones that were kind to you were like family. It’s a good first job."
good,It's okay just average but the health insurance could be a little better. Plus the employee discount should be better. A typical day is stocking the floors. You could also be assigned register tasks. At the end of the night you reshop and put all the returned merchandise away. Also you have to do some cleaning not much but just some every now and then. You have to be able to multitask. Providing good customer service is also a must.
good,"I worked there for two weeks, it was regular paist, the staffbwas generous, some managers were nice amd worked with me amd some gave me a hard time. Inwas there for two weeks because I took the bus to work and it was delayed and when I got to work I was a half hour late and I got fired and didn't get a chance to explain."
good,"I was a cashier and my typical day was opening a register and check out customers. Other days I would supervise the self checkout aisles in substitute to being on the register. I would also restock items and collect coat hangers to restock. My coworkers were nice and chill since we were all of the same age group, but my manager was annoying and strict."
good,Part time wasnt many hours like that its a fun job to do you get to pick and package peoples merchandise and serve them well. Also its not bad pay for a partime job
good,"They were a fun company to work for, but with so many changes in management, its very hard to remain stable or comfortable. The changes that came swept most employees out of the door."
good,"Clock in, check with your leader and your job assignment, and do the necessary work task for the day. Workplace culture was hectic but rarely boring. The most enjoyable part was helping people and working with my teammates."
good,You have to be very productive always on ur toes. you get to meet alot of people if ur a cashier . all smiles very friendly get to know ur co workers and ur managers.
good,It was ok i just want a better opportunity to do something more in life im 26 and want a job that i can call a career and be happy and satisfied doing that job
good,I work security at target and I get paid the same if not less then cashiers. Brought it up with management and they said it’s up to HR management. (She only likes a few people she would never give us a raise)(she only cares about her self)(She always on vacation)
good,Besides being poorly managed I wouldn't of had any other problem with working there. I had been brought on for part time seasonal and ended up becoming full-time.
good,It was pretty interesting working for cashier meeting different people I’ve always wanted to be a cashier counting money and seeing what people like to buy
good,Good culture and great on-the-job training setting people up for future success on how to become leaders in any corporate environment.  Ability see all sides of a business.
good,"Physical work, expectation is that you are responsible and continue to work without supervision or guidance in instances. Easy to become dependable. Difficult to train on equipment at some points of the year."
good,"I was only a seasonal that wasn't hired on after, but I would have loved to stay. I enjoyed the work I did there and the pay wasn't too bad for it. The managers I had were nice and the employees didn't seem bad either."
good,"Target is cool, good pay, but not enough to live off of, let alone support a family, especsally if you do not get your desired amount of hours which will likely happen with payroll cuts."
good,I would go back if I could every job has its issues but I did enjoy working there. Spend mostly all my paycheck there.  People were all very friendly and you will find many customer that go on a daily bases and will get attached if you like people.
good,Do not work here if you need a living wage Some management have no clue what they are doing poor pay working during the holidays you can barely spend time with family
good,"Target is a great company to work for, everyone is nice the only thing is that the only way you can get moved departments is if you transfer stores. When even knowing you have asked about it more then once because of personal reasons. Other then that target is a good place to work. The other thing is they want you to do 1 min per box when you are stocking and then get all 15 Ibotta done. A little bit much."
good,"It is a tough and demanding job. 6 am start times and no breaks are allowed until the job is completed witch can take up to 5 hours. 5 hours of standing and lifting boxes of chemicals, furniture, toys, Clothing, pots and pans, stationary, food, and One Spot. Understaffed and underappreciated we work 4 to 5 trucks a week and it bumps up to everyday during the holiday season. Management lacks understanding of the job we work. The best aspect of the position is the people that are apart of the inbound team."
good,"Overall working at target wasn’t great but it wasn’t awful. It’s a great job for those who haven’t had a job before. You get a small discount, and frequent breaks. I’d recommend it as a first job."
good,a lot of manual labor is required. this is a more formal place to work at. the management is great. its nice to have a corporate job and get paid weekly and after a certain amount of time you receive benefits.
good,"• Collaborated with team members to ensure that customer expectations are met."
good,A typical day at work you would clock in and get your equipment for the day. You’ll have a meeting with the group you’re going to work with and get assigned a position for the day. Usually they’ll tell you how much work if left from the shift before and what you have to reach till your shift is over.
good,It was nice I learned how to stay organized and work well with others. I learned to pay close attention to detail when organized or stocking. Working at target overnight gave me to encouragement to prioritize my time more wisely
good,"It’s retail, so you’re never set with a certain schedule every week. The team I worked with got along quite well and we all supported each other, as well as management."
good,"Fast-paced and collaborative work environment with a diverse workplace culture. Management is fair and open to communication. A typical work day includes merchandising items so sales floor looks full, pulling computer automated batches to remove excess stock from back of store to sales floor, auditing merchandise prices, and revising merchandise displays to drive sales."
good,I was able to assist customers and learning to use and maintained time management. The work environment was productive. Hardest part of job was not being able to give customer merchandise needed.
good,this is a good job good job good good job good job good job good job. I liked the job it was hard work but too hard for me. tough eight hours of hard work
good,It was a job just like any other job. You clocked in and Target owned you for 8 to 12 hours. Not much more you can say about it. It's the same anywhere you go.
good,The leaders at Target are constantly under scrutiny to meet quotas. Working on the floor can be confusing and frustrating because the store leader wants one thing and the team leaders have to interpret it right or it's done wrong. Helping the guests is a priority and it can be hard when your on a deadline.
good,"Normally I would come in, find out who's the lead manager see what task they assign for me and get right to work. "
good,Trabaje 10 años en esa tiemda pero no lo valoran a uno como empliado.
good,"I left because they did not want to give me vacation days and my grandpa was in dominican republic dieing, they did not want to let me leave for a family emergency."
good,"I didn’t enjoy working at target. It wasn’t fun. The pay was decent and the work was fairly easy, but they based performance on the amount of red cards we gave out which is dumb."
good,This was a decent first job.  They were very accommodating in personal and school life as I started the job in high school.  Certain managers would hold workers to unreachable standards
good,"Really fast pace morning shift, worked 4-5 hours and it was around 4am when we had to punch in. Work mostly as a team and help one another when needing it."
good,Nice friendly place to work. I started unloading the trucks and stocking then moved on to register. I also worked in the dreesing room but then wanted more. So I straed doing work in the pharmacy to get a feel for it because its what ive always wanted to do
good,In the beginning it was a great place to work. Everyone was supportive and friendly. About a year int my career with them things went downhill quickly. I was on my third store manager and fourth direct supervisor. Turnover there was insanely high.
good,My almost 7 years at target has been interesting. A lot had changed from the dress code to just how the way the job is done. Some has been good and some has been for the worst.
good,I took this as a second job. I informed management that my first job took priority and they agreed. Target kept trying to call me in for shifts they knew that I couldnt work.  After a month I was called in the office immediately before a shift where they fired me then asked me to work the rest of the day because they needed me. I resigned that day.
good,"Wasn't a pleasant place to work. Supervision was poor, employees did not do there jobs due to lack of supervision. There was no training and there was a lack of safety. I was left in an area working alone loading a truck which should have had 2 people in case of injury as the warehouse is large and no one would have heard or seen me for quite some time. Had to walk a long ways to get to the lunch room wasting a good portion of our lunch time and same for breaks.."
good,Fast paced environment. I worked as a cashier which required sales skills as well. I had to leave because of physical concerns with standing for so long.
good,unload truck at a timely manner … rush to the floor and stock your department while assisting customers. Multitasking is a big key when working at target.
good,"Target store locations are very stressful during holiday seasons. They work on a limited staff business model. Due to that, target is not a great work experience."
good,Never would I think I had to write a bad review about target. I’d always loved target till I started working there. They DO NOT work with any schedules. I have had lots of problems with management  especially HR. I went to report something and suddenly my 40 hours a week turned into barely 20 working the shifts everyone hates during the busiest days of the week. I would only think about going back if I worked a different store and area.
good,"working at target is really easy, with great team member and okay management the store run it self basically. it is very clean and organized and the pay is good."
good,Target is a very productive company.New experiences everyday while working. The staff as well as management is very friendly as well as encouraging. Any position at Target has room for growth.
good,"A good fast pace job, getting a hold of HR is difficult at times, friendly employees, good benefits, and they train you for multiple positions Incase you want to switch positions."
good,"Fast pace, good job  depending what department you work in. Organized store, and helpful staff members. Very clean and enjoyable place to work within."
good,Target did not do a good job when it came to treating employees with the same consideration all across the board. However it pays well and theembets below Management's proved to be likable.
good,"Target is a fast paced work environment. The workers are friendly, although management needs to improve. There isn't anything difficult about the job."
good,"I've worked for Target for over 6 years, started out working in the cafe and made my way up to Team Leader. Target is not a bad place to work, however, it is consistently changing. Sometimes the change is good and sometimes it isn't. Management overall is pretty flexible with schooling and life issues and you get to interact with many people daily and you never have to take work home with you."
good,"Good pay but stressful for such an easy job. If you work front end managers push you for red cards. Hours are mainly from departments no one can work or likes to work at i.e cafe, Starbucks... they would like you to have open availability so if you’re in school good luck trying to work that out."
good,The people are great to work with but there is a lot to be desired. It's extremely hard to get promoted and it's just easier to get a job some were else after a a year or two.
good,"The job itself was not hard, just demanded some pysical work and being able to move at a fast pace. Being a warehouse temperatures can get extremely high (but they do let you know this prior to joining). Pay was great and getting paid every week was even better. Had to resign due to the heat which caused bad aniexty. Wish I could've stayed, but what doesn't work for some will work for others. Overall, I have nothing bad to say about this job. I'm just not a physical person and was unable to do the job."
good,"This job was good, It paid the bills and was pretty fun. But the managers were not that great. They acted as though they were better than everyone they worked with."
good,"Place wasn't so bad, however started going down hill fast. Sure their is opportunity to go but not much and not unless you are a favorite. Hard work isn't reward. Better than other minimum pay jobs."
good,When I worked their I felt like they would train you to do so many things and you would bounce around doing different things all the time. Their was always so much work to be done and not enough time. Sometimes you would do more than you should.
good,"Provides an opportunity to learn and grow in a new field. "
good,"I was originally hired to work in soft lines for apparel and accessories, but moved to hardlines to be a beauty consultant. It was enjoyable at first working in beauty because everything had a place and order, the training was beyond helpful and informative, and the employees were genuinely helpful people (not just to customers but to newcomers as well). Then they started making too many changes all at once that made NO SENSE whatsoever... How is a beauty consultant supposed to assist a guest with foundation matching, but we're not allowed to make samples of the product or swatch on guest?? The tabling events every Saturday are a waste of 4 hours because guest do not care about the product demonstrations, they just want the free samples (which are usually gone fast) and they do not drive sales up on products. Those 4 hours could've been spent pushing so there wouldn't be so much back work the next couple of days! SOME (not all) of the managers and team leads were rude and weren't helpful. They had no problem demanding that things got done, but when asked for help they couldn't explain how to perform the task themselves. Almost all employees are cross-trained which makes getting hours easier, but becoming an expert in their area harder due to all the new rules put in place that are constantly changed like how frequently people change their underwear! The pay is exceptional compared to other minimum wage jobs though."
good,It was a good job to pay for gas and insurance for my first car. I was a cashier and was consistently hounded to get people to sign up for the target red card. You stand in one place for long periods of time with a short break.
good,You have to be physically and mentally strong to work here but it’s good pay for nonskilled labor. You can make great money but don’t expect any fulfillment or management acknowledgement.
good,Wasnt my best experience. It could've been better with management and the way the store was ran everyday. A lot of people didnt like to do there job. Benefits were ok if you were a full time employee otherwise not
good,"Target is a great first job for young people. It gives you the feel of retail and the pay is great. Easy money for an easy job. However working there for multiple years gets really old. They are always making changes to the way they do things. Change is normally good, but their changes are quirky and most of the time not beneficial to the way the operation should be ran. Sometimes they set too high of expectations to their employees which gets frustrating. Overall, not the worst place to work but definitely not the best."
good,No comment  prefer not to respond to any of the review summaries about my preview employers. I have placed no comment the job was great no complains would work there again
good,"Very high turnover, leadership always looking"
good,I didn't work at target for a very long time. I did work some wonderful people and the management were flexible in the hours for me.  The management cared for each member working there.
good,"As an ETL, you can work 24 hours a day and feel like you still didn’t accomplish enough. Working 60+ hours weekly for the pay didn’t seem worth it in the end. Management doesn’t fully address issues head on. Overall depending on your position, it could eat you alive."
good,"Target is a pretty good place to work if you're a high school student or a college student who still lives at home. They have a friendly environment and they are very big on team work. They also start people out at $13.00 h/r which isn't bad for retail."
good,Target corporation is a very good company to work for that being said I did not particularly care for the way they schedule or the lack of hours for average team members
good,"Left because of stress , Managers expect so much for so little pay. Black Friday started out at 7am then 5am then 3am then midnight  then 10am.... how much money does the company need that it makes its employees sacrifice family time."
good,"While the higher ups expect too much to be accomplished for the amount of time you have, and the pay and benefits aren't great, in general the people are good, and you get solid early work experience. Most managers I had were good, and the best ones worked right there with you on hard projects and built you up. The lousiest ones set too high expectations and left you hanging, but that was rare. Your managers probably won't want or be able to take on your ideas, though, so don't go in hoping to make much of a difference for the better in the way things are run. "
good,"Lots of stocking and making sure everything looks nice and neat. Put overstock/backstock in the backroom. We were mainly on a time crunch. "
good,"it was an ok work place and liked the co workers, when it was slow I got to move around and do other things which I liked. the customers were friendly most of the time and I enjoyed my shifts. they were accomadating to my needs."
good,Great place to learn about products in the department you are placed and a dedicated work schedule that grows more in responsibilities the more you progress. Great department managers that are always helpful in teaching and with progress growth within company. Down to earth co-workers with similar interests and easy to make friendships.Top management could be seriously improved.
good,"It was a ok job, being that I started at 3 or 4 AM. That way I still had the rest of the day to do other things. I worked there for 11 years. I had to leave there due to my father passed and I had to take care his estate."
good,Was always something to be done by the people who worked the morning shift who didn’t finish there tasks. And then if you finished everything they would add workload to who ever finished first. And no chance for advancement to management
good,I feel like I did not get paid for what I was deserved begone favoritism and everybody ain't get the same rights as other others it would terminate you with no reason or Foreman OS exclamation
good,"A typical day at work in Guest Services (my department) at Target is trying to maintain my composure when dealing with guests that are extremely rude, letting guests yell and scream at me, looking out for scammers, and working directly with TSS (Target Security Specialist). It is not fun."
good,"target is a nice, friendly enviornment to work for someone who like to work retail. there is room to grow with the company. it is not s set schedual some weeks you get a lot of hours and others you are lucky to get 20 hours"
good,"I am preparing various foods for the guests, cleaning/organizing kitchen area, unloading freight and making preparations for the next day and shift. I also make orders weekly. I train new team members how to properly prepare foods and keep kitchen organized."
good,"The store was ok, it would get busy on the weekends and when the holidays are approaching. It can be very chaotic and can be stressful. The customers are rude at times but some are cool. The typical day was clocking in, check with the manager to see where you are at and start doing your jobs. Either doing reshop (putting products back in their place) or working at the cashier. The coworkers were really cool but the management was horrible. A couple of them were kinda rude and they play favoritism. They seem like they don't really care about you. The place is unorganized too. When I was hired, I didn't start my training until 3 weeks later. I kept on bugging them about it, calling them, going to the store and ask them and they wouldn't give me a precise answer. Overall, it was an okay job."
good,"Everyone I had met were the sweetest people I could ever hope to work with. Management was iffy and the environment is very stressful and fast paced, but after some time it's easy to adjust."
good,"Depending on the signed duty of the day, ""front lanes"" it can be a little circus. Depending who's Management for the day, they likes favouritism. Guest complain about pricing and stuff and management dont back us up when we say it's this price and they see a different price on the shelve especially our supervisors' supervisor. We Service desk changed alot due to new management. It can be bad at times because of items missing or we just dont have it in stock. Guest get angry when we do our jobs."
good,"I like Target, but there are no benefits and not enough working hours available. I like the team members and the team atmosphere. Casual dress code is a plus. Management appreciates my skills and hard work."
good,Overall I loved my coworkers but was disappointed that such a lucrative company does not compensate their employees adequately; I think retail would have less of an employee turnover issue if staff was properly paid
good,Worth working at this could moany for needing a job only worked seasonal here great staff fun and an easy place to work some day stressful and busy others slow
good,"Have to productive. Company gives you two 15 minute breaks paid, and one 30 min unpaid whenever you work over 8 hours. Time will fly by on busy days, and a lot of guest interaction which is fun!"
good,"It was shown as a team building place and it was supposed to be strictly positive, however it was fairly difficult towards new employees due to the level of competitiveness."
good,Good pay and no two days are ever the same here. management turnover  rate here is ridiculous. Be prepared to work the warehouse is HOT and Dusty drink plenty of water.
good,i enjoy the people I work with but they do not off full time for the people who want to work it. The only people who get full time are the employees who get moved up.
good,Challenging if you need full time work Unable to provide advancement opportunities. Lack flexibility with scheduling needs. No longer a family friendly place to work.
good,"I worked for Target for 3 years starting off as a team member in Starbucks and eventually getting a team leader position over grocery and Starbucks. The job is quite demanding in the way that I would supervise two departments and the communication with other management was oftentimes an area to improve. Target does follow its core statement to help all families learn the joy of everyday life and you come to embrace Target's culture over time. The company does equipe you with important skills like time management, communication, organization, attention to detail and most importantly for Target, providing an exceptional guest experience."
good,Do not want to say too much since I am still currently employed there and do not want any backlash from this review. But I will say that my location has a manager issue and it really needs to be handled. Also the hours aren't reliable. For months I was only getting like 10-15 hours a week sometimes less. Had to get a second job but even that wasn't enough. Can't wait to leave and find a more reliable jobs. Not a good job for those who need stability and reliable hours.
good,"Paid less to do more, you get work on top of your work, labeling, repacks, individual boxes, scanning, stray, and pulls. And on top of that, if you don’t finish your work, the team leads get disappointed in you. At least you know they want you to be there, but we have goal times in which our work needs to be finished, but it’s super unrealistic and everyone knows it. Everyone. No one really gets informed about anything and we’re all working our butts off so that the night shift team can sit on their butts and not help us out with the freight that we didn’t get to. So we have a lot more work in the morning that we can’t finish. So we’re always behind"
good,"this was a fun place, I enjoy being busy so when we were slow the time went slow. I really enjoy working with the management they were really easy going!!!"
good,"I was a contractor and we were treated like second hand citizens. We were known as the “black badge” group as team members all had red badges to enter the building, etc."
good,N/a i dont really have a review on this it was a great experience working here untill i got tire of working there and they also they would only give me like 4 hours a day
good,Target is a good place to work. The main problem is with the office politics and management. Management takes advantage of employees and does not fulfill promises of raises and advancement.
good,A job with opportunities to grow as long as you dedicate your time to them. Opportunities to grow are offered once you show you will dedicate any of your time to them whether you are a scheduled or not.
good,Love working with my peers and team members. Upper level leadership in-store and out created a culture making challenging or any type of feedback positive or negative a punishable offence.
good,requires a strong back and mind to work here. they treat their employees fair if you are in good with the bosses otherwise they will over work you and treat you poorly
good,"They definitely do not need to hire the amount of people they do because the bad part of it for everybody is less hours. Overall a decent experience, a decent working experience"
good,"- Diligent working."
good,Management are pretty much all nice. Some do have attitudes. The discounts weren't that great. Your job position was pretty lonely. Many keep to themselves or their own little group. Sad to say you talk to customers more throughout the job. Its quick paced but easy if youre a fast learner.  Do keep in mind customers will be nice and super rude
good,Throughout my time in Target I have several good and bad experience. In my time there I was we had several disagreements but always got the job done. There was little communication in the work area.
good,"There's not much to say really, it's a pretty standard job no matter how you look at it. Cooperate would come up with new, most often worse, ideas on how to get work done, went through about three different systems in the course of a year"
good,"Target is a good company; however, working as a sales representative is very hard and managers make you do a lot of heavy work. I wouldn't complain but the pay is not good."
good,I would recommend if your looking for a part time other than that I wouldn't recommend they have a little bit of hours and they make you multi task ...
good,"Poor training program, I was entirely unprepared for my job when training was over. Also the schedule is terrible, working for up to two weeks with no break and no overtime pay. The work can be rewarding but it is also incredibly physical."
good,"When I first started at Target, I felt great! I was hungry and eager to work. Now, I dread going to work everyday because I just have no desire to be there. Higher management believes we area robots and to have everything done in minutes when they take longer than that. They do not care about personal well-being."
good,it always seemed to be busy but that was mostly becuse we seemed pretty understaffed so i was always running around and learning how to do new things.
good,"Working at target was bitter sweet. you find good coworkers, and not so good ones. It can be enjoyable, but you do have to work a lot to be respected, the more you work the more responsibilities you get. Paid was below average and responsibilities were not equally distributed among team members."
good,"The projects can be fun and exciting. There can be little to no planning, however, and it can be extremely stressful. There are a lot of managers but few leaders."
good,Everything about the position was average. Good work ethics. Some management was good. Better organizational skills regarding the leadership is definitely needed as well.
good,Honestly enjoyed working here at first but management got updated and now nobody is on the same page anymore. You read the sheet to find your duties for the day and then are promptly moved to a thousand different areas by multiple managers throughout the day which leads to your work space being ignored.
good,Low hours great location poor pay fair management improper training schedule is horrible room for growth great customers real busy work fun atmosphere
good,To politically correct environment leaned way to much to the left liberal side work was fine pay was good but it was like walking on egg shells worried about hurting someone's feelings
good,"Learned great customer service skill"
good,In my experience a typical day at Target would start with checking in with whoever your specific team lead is and getting an idea of what your task list is for the day. If you're a cashier it is pretty straightforward; you cash guests out. On the salesfloor you push products and neaten shelves. The issues would come when trying to decide what was priority and what could slide. Whether to keep stocking shelves to get product on the floor or to neaten the shelves to make the store look nice. Management never seemed to be 100% on the same page and were not good at dispersing large scale information and rules and regulation to the team members. Other than that the environment was calm and easy.
good,"I was a cashier, I hated how the registers were based on fast you were.  The management and staff were nice to work with though. Learned to be patient  and friendly with the customer at all times."
good,"I had a decent experience in the optical section. The employees were very kind to me and tried to help me in all the ways they could, where there as no training for my position."
good,Didn't really like working here u have to train in all positions and ask every customer if they want a red card wihch most decline all of this for little pay and little hours
good,Good company.  Take care of there employers as long as you work hard. They were really great about my scheduling because I have a 3 year old . Super easy to work with.
good,Target just doesn't give most employees the hours they want to earn and live a comfortable lifestyle if you're a student and do not plan to make a career at target then it's perfect for you
good,"I felt that this job was a really good opportunity for a first job. I had a lot of fun working there but management was poor but on the flipside, I learned a lot"
good,"If you’re a new team member it’s good to start with Target. But if you work more than 5 years,they do not appreciate your hard work,cutting your hours   You losing your benefits. It’s not fare. Getting pay as much as new team member. No difference"
good,"-guest servicing at all hours during shift"
good,"Pay is decent however never recognized for what you do and the impact you make only the areas you lack if any. "
good,Management is lazy they mess with your hours and everybody wants to be important. Some are  puppets.They want to be liked so bad they also are not team players. Everyone wants to be the boss instead of being a team player they cut hours and over work you but dont want to give overtime with all the money target makes on average and the customers that come and spend getting paid overtime shouldnt be a problem. I like my job but they need to treat us like we have bills to pay and families.
good,"As a Team Lead there often was not time to actually lead the team because I was mostly working and often times alone in the department because available hours were low."
good,"I worked for target for 9 years as a team lead, the job is fast paced, constantly changing, and demanding. The pay was very good, but the leadership structure is flawed. They want every store to operate exactly the same, regardless of volume. They do not celebrate individual ideas, just adherence to company policy. After a remodel and new business direction i was let go without warning for not being a part of the new direction. If you’re ok with doing whatever the company asks even if you think it’s not the best fit forfor your store, this is the place for you."
good,For high school senior and college freshmen this would be their best bet for quick employment the atmosphere is more so like a stepping stone for better career opportunities elsewhere
good,Not a bad place to work. The 10% employee discount was nice. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers who I grew fond of and became friends with. The most frustrating thing about the job was the lack of communication between the departments as well as lack of communication between the employees and the higher-ups.
good,Pretty good place to work at! But not inoff hours. They have very good benefits. And are always willing to help if. If help is needed. They also take good care of the employees!
good,The managements schedualing was very poor but otherwise would healthy working enviroment. would continue to hire new employees yet would not be able to fill requests for more available hours.
good,"Target is a place with a very high turnover rate when it comes to team members and managers. All for good reason, this place is basically a career trap. Target pays everyone pretty much equally since they started offering overnight team members $15 an hour. The catch, is that they regulate your hours and schedule. Meaning, you never know which days you're working until they release the schedule. This also results in fluctuating hours and therefore fluctuating paychecks. And this doesn't even include the changing retail seasons, where some parts of the year (Janurary to around June) are slower months for Target, which means less hours for team members. So if income consistency is something you value, Target may not be for you."
good,"It was a great first job, was there for long enough because I felt comfortable with my work. It's a solid experience with great people you work with, but things could get a bit hairy at times (Busy weekends, holidays, peak hours) and would tend to get more tossed to you then you could deal with."
good,Typical call center work. Lots of options for work schedule for full and part time. Really like to push the Target culture. Lots of room for advancement if you have a degree.
good,"This is a job for a college student. I worked at the Alton Target over Christmas break, several years ago. It did help me learn a lot about customer service, even as a cashier."
good,Decent job. Good pay but awful management. Hours are all across the board (the first of the year my hours went from 30+ a week down to 5-10) not hard work BUT your bosses except you to get 8 hours worth of work done in a 4 hour shift and that’s not including other areas of work you have to do because scheduling was off and we were short staffed. You don’t get your work done? That’s a coaching for you with a possible write up. Oh and none of this is ever their fault. Always ours🤷🏻‍♀️
good,Job was very discourteous to its employees. Received very little training from the management and too much oversight. Manager had a tendency to harass the stock room workers.
good,Really aggressive about hiring recent college graduates. I went in expecting an experience that I didn't end with. I realized that companies are often more aggressive about recruiting you than they are helping you reach your goal in the company.
good,"We are paid 13/hr now but we get very few hours.  If you google it you'll find corporate is making managers across the nation do this. "
good,"Started off fine, but was being moved to the market area of our store. This would be fine if they actually had a proper leader in place to do the job correctly. Towards the end of me being there they changed leaders around and the new one was great. But we didn't have the man power of 3 people to stock 15 carts a day with the hours given and maintain proper floor presentation"
good,"Its a fine place to work for always changing and the work with school schedules.  They have good benefits, they try to keep you informed about changes so over all it's a fine place to start working"
good,"Great place to work for someone who's athletic and can stand n be moving heavy objects for 10-12 hours a day. Poor management because they have favorites, but as long as you get on no bad sides. You can make a career out of it."
good,"I had a brief engagement there. My work was not stellar at that time. We lacked infosec vision for this work. I didn't know what I should focus on first."
good,"Fast paced environment, you never know what you're walking into each day. Management often places unrealistic expectations on team members given the workload already assigned to them."
good,decent place to work. flexible. not the greatest in pay. cutting hours back. management needs to change...…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..
good,"My Manager makes my job extremely hard considering she sees an issue and blames it on me when there are multiple employees in this job. The environment is calm but the work load could be over bearing at times. As well as the hours. The managers in total and HR do not care at all about any of the employees, except for when someone reaches out to corporate. Im currently working here but im desperately seeking a new job."
good,"I loved working there, the first 4 years. They are making a lot of changes that are not making their employees feel appreciated and important any more. There use to be more room for advancement and good hours with good pay. Now there is good pay but less hours and expecting way too much out of one person. Most people are very unhappy and a lot of people are leaving."
good,It was good and easy job unloaded trucks and stocked floors. I also talked to customers and helped people.Great first job or college student job     .
good,Most work days are the same. Once you clock in you go to whoever is over your department and receive your instructions for the day. Sometimes you help at the registers as a back up cashier.
good,"For the first months, hours were between 20 to 30 hours a week only working between 6 to 8 hours a day. Being called in on days off is normal, best to ensure time and schedule accordingly."
good,"I had great leaders who appreciated my work ethic, but I could only get up to 35 hours a week, leaving me out of benefits range. Some of my coworkers were averaging 20 hours or less because the company can only ""spend"" so many hours in a month."
good,this was a very eye opening experience that showed me how th world really worked taught some skill that i learned with hardship and tribulation but was an overall good experience
good,"Target's typical day consisted of me un-loading trucks, early in the morning. Working we a group of individuals we un-loaded trucks and then we would put the trucks away all in the same morning."
good,Never was a fan of Target and now after working there for a few months I dislike it even more. The people that worked there weren’t very friendly and I just didn’t care for the job in general
good,I was only there for a short time. I was a seasonal employee . I was asked to stay on but declined due to the lack of hours offered.I also felt that I had more to offer the company in another area but there was no openings at that time.
good,I don't have any strong feelings for the company one way or the other. The days were long and the pay was average. I found some of my co-workers to be engaging and the managers competent.
good,I loved my position but management was horrible. Laughed in my face when I took a day off because i needed to attend a funeral. Not only that but I had several people that worked in my section and I was the one that ALWAYS did everything because they knew I would do a good job. I didn't mind at first but after awhile you need help and all of that pressure starts to build and when I tried to talk to several managers about it they said thats just how it is.
good,Fast paced fun and friendly work environment. Professional and family oriented place to work. Drive to make guest happy and satisfied with the target shopping experience.
good,Gave me valuable experience to take into the future. It felt like a great place work at because of the people around me but it sometimes felt like upper management outside of shift leader would not really care for their team members and just made sure the job got done.
good,It was a good experience I learned a lot working there. The training was okay. I wish I could have got trained a little better but it was a good experience working.
good,I wouldn’t work there ever again cause they way they treated me when I was doing my job and I was getting  acused of not doing my job when I’ve got more carts done than most people
good,"If you don't like going in and out of the store all day, from extreme hot to cold than this is not for you. every day was sweaty and exhausting. the job title may be cart attendant but you will also be the janitor cleaning spills, the bathrooms etc."
good,"Had it not been for the low availability of hours, I would have liked working at Target. Very few coworkers were able to achieve a necessary 40 hours a week, and inconsistent hours made it tough to schedule a second job."
good,Target is a great fit job fun and relaxed place pay is decent no overtime mostly part time but good first job for someone just starting  fun place to work
good,Worked at two locations. Great hours to allow an individual to further his or her education and the company will do tuition reimbursement based on a business degree.
good,Target is a good entry level job. they provide training in order for you to do your job correctly.  employees are friend and kind.  most customers are easy to deal with
good,"Target made a big deal about paying their employees $15/hr. However, they decreased the payroll so that fewer employees are doing more work. So they didn't really lose any money by doing this, and employees get burnt out quickly and quit."
good,"When I began working at Target in 2017, everything was very well organized and executed. After a set of bad decisions concerning allocated backroom space, removing overstock from an offsite location, and not having a store team leader for nearly a year, team member work ethic and workflow efficiency took a nosedive. Although new management has alleviated many of my previous complaints, Target corporate's modernization changes have made little sense for increasing sales, productivity, and efficiency. All this combined with my accumulating responsibilities with no increase in pay has me finding fewer reasons to recommend this job to people or to stay here."
good,"I worked in there for about a year & it was terrible, managers expected the impossible, lack of communication between manager & team members. But it does has good things, if your working as anything in the front of the store the team members are very good most people are nice & respectful & every supervisor is there for you"
good,"It's an ok place to work I would guess. I don't have too many problems with the place overall. The co-workers were relatively decent, the hours were long but bearable. I'm not sure I would like to get back into a position with this company but I don't have any major problems over-all."
good,"I made many friends working at target, and wouldn't replace my time there for anything. However the corporate culture they is vapid and over bloated with middle managers that effectively have no impact and no real purpose."
good,"Your shifts can be anywhere from 4-8 hours usually, but can be 10-12 hours if you pick up another person's shift along with yours. The coworkers are friendly for the most part. A lot of the work expectations are unfair and management rarely listens to the concerns of the employees. Hours per week are very inconsistent. Some weeks for me would be 12-16 hours or about 31 hours. There are plenty of opportunities to be trained in other departments so that you can pick more people's shifts but each department can only schedule so many hours among the employees. Overall, I would rate this job a 7 out of 10."
good,Little career focused when it comes to the employees alot of broken promises and favoritism. Hardly enough coverage when it was a weekend with managers who kept overly freaking out about everything. The hardest part was not having enough coverage in areas of the store especially around holidays and special events. My customers were wonderful and so kind.
good,most enjoyable part of the job as a cashier was ringing out the guest and helping them makes decisions on what looks good in a room that they were trying to decorate. Management was Ok it was one person that would nag you the most but you just have to kinda ignore and keep doing what you doing.
good,Working here taught me good customer service qualities as well as how to work with a team. I also learned that retail was not my favorite thing but I knew it was temporary while I was achieving my undergraduate degree.
good,"Target is a corporation that I personally enjoyed shopping at, but once I started working there, I realized just how inconsistent management was. It seemed like they allowed other people to do their jobs for them, and only focused on benefiting themselves rather than the entire team."
good,"Day to day work does not vary slightly, corporate makes a lot of decisions that vastly differ from how the sales floor works. Massive power/advancement gaps."
good,"It’s not such a terrible place to work, i just prefer working more with people and i don’t usually get that option here. I also thrive off of positive reinforcement but they typically look at what i have not accomplished rather than what i did. My typical day will start off with getting go backs for the department i’m in, i’ll put them away and if there is new shipment, i’ll grab that from the backroom and put that stuff away. I also zone, which is folding all of the shirts or whatever is out on the tables. I also answer the phone and help guests find an item they want and i help people throughout the store. It’s a quick learning job, I learned how to work effectively in my department really fast, but i’m still learning new things everyday!"
good,The pay sucks and doesn't match the work that is assigned. the hours are consistent though. The managers at my store were very nonchalant and didn't really hassle the works too much.
good,Hard to progress. You're really gonna make me write this review? I'm just going to write incoherent nonsense because forcing users to write a review like this is an expletive backwards
good,I was a cashier and gathered up carts when needed. Also cleaned the bathrooms. I helped the guest find what they were looking for. Helped in the backroom area with setting things up.
good,"Target was a good place to work for in the beginning. I was working full time while being a full time student. They needed a night time manager, but they were not willing to give it to me simply because I was a full time student. All of my shifts where the evening shift so it would be a perfect position for me. I was recommended by my supervisors for the position but the assistant manager denied me because of my ""availability"". I felt that the management team where not willing to work with their employees, regardless of how much effort the employee showed interest or ability to preform the tasks they were ask to complete with excellence."
good,"Dont make any friends and it's a ok job. Like any job in customer service. The guest is your friend. Management stand right in front of employees and talk for hours and gossip a lot. Notting is dont when you use open door policy because all management solely only trust and support all management. ""Cast system""."
good,"I worked in softlines. That is the clothing department. I was in charge of folding the clothes, or hanging them in the right place. I assisted customers when they needed my help."
good,Assist all Guest with purchase.Worked Service Desk with returns.Sorted merchandise per designated department. Scanned all area merchandise for restock. Load / unloaded weekly trucks.Stocked merchandise for different departments. Restocked backroom on a monthly basis for new stock merchandise. Changed themed areas as needed per holiday. Organized assigned areas as needed.
good,a good place to work but no benefits love working with the public very understanding about personal business  h r very nice  like the swap board the most
good,"As the title states. Target is customer focused. In order to succeed there, you must go out of your way to make the customer feel welcome. Even if your behind on your tasks, youre expected to help customers. Though this is expected."
good,Working in target made me have a quick experience in retail and being able to do discount for customers at the register. Having a good bond with employers as well.
good,"As a part time employee and full time student. the hours were not distributed fairly, however the work environment was relaxed and allowed me to grow."
good,"The job was all around solid. The backroom was a little more physically demanding, which worked out for me just fine as I like to stay active. On top of this you are working with a team throughout the day which just makes working on task much more efficient."
good,"Target used to be a wonderful company to work for. With new protocols, they for got about how to treat their employees and expect way more than they can give"
good,"Target is ok, as long as you just do what you have to do. No one bothers you until you mess up. People are usually chill for the most part depending on what department you're in"
good,"Target can be a good company if it focus on its employees  they will work better if shown you appreciate them and harder.. I learn how to supervise , I learn  how to use Microsoft "
good,The workplace was inviting. The team worked together well. The amount of hours you could be scheduled for were slim at times. The break room is also quite dirty.
good,"In the beginning, I enjoyed working at Target, but overtime, it became tiresome. I slowly lost interest in being an employee there. With being a student athlete and working there, it became stressful.  On top of that, some team leads treated me differently after finding out the boss they thought were so mean loved me. Other than that, I've learned how to improvise. Task that would require multiple people to get the job done were handle by myself a lot of times. I've learned to keep personal experiences and work separate. Even if I had  a terrible day, I never let the customers feel that energy (because they definitely can). And the most important part, IT IS OKAY TO ASK FOR HELP. Many times, you'll get task that can be overwhelming and you will need help. It's okay to be ask your team lead for help, as long as you complete the task and not goof off. The hardest part of the job was honestly standing on my feet for 4 hours at a time. Everything else was manageable. The most enjoyable part was making friends with other employees and hanging out outside of work. I also appreciate the ""big boss"" for making sure we were fed if we had to come in to work every holiday."
good,Target was a good place to build team skills. It was very fast paced and demanding. Had to wake up very early to unload the trucks which was one downside.
good,"I was glad that they had a week long period of on the job training where I was taught the locations of everything I needed for my duties. While I was taught to use the register, I ended up not having to work it very often. Management was nice outside of one D-bag and I liked most of my co-workers and the overall work environment. Probably the hardest part of the job when we had busy days and I was the only cart attendant on duty so I had to struggle to keep up with stocking."
good,"While the workplace had a very relaxed setting, I had a pretty tough time adjusting to the expectations. Every shift I worked I would be told by the different managers different rules that I was told to follow. This was very confusing because the rules continued to be different from every manager I was working under for that shift, that caused me to be very unsure as to what I was supposed to be actually doing and left me feeling like I was walking on eggshells. Also, there was a huge lack of communication between HR and other managers which caused a lot of confusion."
good,A nice steady environment. Plus you get discounts with partnering companies such as Starbucks. A very flexible schedule that allows you to balance work and life.
good,"bad pay rate, but the job was good and I love my job and managers was rude and lazy, i wouldnt want none of my friends working there, the job is not worth it..."
good,"Keeping a safe sales floor and and clean store to shop in, helping customers finds products they need and looking for. The hardest is restocking the selves. Helping fellow co works indifferent parts of the store. It was fun getting to know the different department in the store and the people that worked in them ."
good,I barely got any hours but the job itself wasn't the worst thing in the world. The other employees were alright and management was pretty chill. Pretty solid work.
good,It was an overall great environment with very friendly and helping co-workers. HR was very difficult to work with and was disorganized. I learned social skills and customer care. The hardest part of the job was the working conditions when the air conditioning was not working.
good,"This was one of my first jobs - I don't remember much about my experience working at Target because of my age at the time, but I remember enjoying speaking with customers and co-workers."
good,"I was a seasonal job hire, very fast paced when it comes to unloading the trucks. if not fast enough you can get your hands smashed another box. So just have to be careful is all."
good,I only worked seasonal at Target as beauty advisor. I wasn't given the opportunity to grow with the company. I don't have enough experienced time working at target to have an opinion.
good,opening and closing of store maintaining the stock room insuring the sales floor is stocked and maintained and staff is maintaining their assigned areas . I learned how to prioritize and minimize the work load each day .a very challenging management program .an equal opportunity employer.the hardest part was the work load with no help.The enjoyable part was interacting with the staff.
good,"Not too tasking, easy job to maintain. Teamwork is very important. Different tasks everyday. Time management an excellent guest service goes along way."
good,"You will be cashier trained no matter what position you do...Its mandatory now....That being said, working here was fine..Its just you NEVER get full time hours."
good,The manager was not wiling to see the open sides of the store's associates.. .. looking for the best work environment needing to provide for my family
good,Its pretty nice working there. Hrs can vary from 40hrs a week then the next two week you will have 8-12 hrs a week..Its a half full half empty perspective. How you see it is how you interpret it
good,"Customer service, stocking and ensuring inventory is on the side counter to provide a great shopping experience for the customer. Areas to grow and succeed."
good,"They mainly care about their own behinds,  you have more chances to get promoted if you are friends with management, hard work, knowledge and results will have you stock in a position or store, don’t even think of getting promoted if the management “needs and values” you. They hire management that just graduated form school and don’t want to work. You’ll see them on their phones and chatting about their personal lives and expect you to solve their work problems with the excuse that they are learning."
good,"Learning and growing into a position that I can excel and advance in is the overall goal"
good,I crosstrained into many positions and they kept putting me in a position I asked to be done in. I was overall grateful to help with any job I had but I merely needed more than that at the time.
good,typically its very relaxed and slow paced on most days for the most part. helping guest can be a pretty fun and fulfilling experience but it can get a bit tough too depending on the truck size overall id recommend target if your looking for a first time job
good,"i think that target is very good, it allows for people to work the hours they want with the added benefit of being able to shop for groceries before or after work"
good,"Busy stores, customer service is of utmost importance, managers work hard and expect everyone to also. Company promotes fast, fun and friendly service."
good,"I was with market source a third party company inside of target for mobile phones. Target it self is amazing and the team is like a family and it shows,"
good,I only worked there three weeks. so I dont  know much about the store. I worked for the taxi bell/pizza hut express. It was super chill but that was 14 years ago.
good,When i was there in the two different  locations the folsom store everyrhing ran smooth and the pheonix store ran smooth until manager of the store left it got rocky and a lot of employees left.
good,"You'll deal with a lot of people every shift you work. I don't recommend cashiering, due to the fact that people always release their anger and bad moods onto you. Fast-paced environment. Gives solid pay for what is expected from you."
good,"I helped guests with heavy lifting of products to their car, got carts from outside and brought them inside, took care of the bathrooms and make sure hangers were dumped from the lanes into the hanger bin."
good,"Worked on a team that stocked, management was communicative, store was always clean, productivity was in a timely manner, nice people to work with, good shopping experience"
good,"•	Maintain a clean store"
good,I was hired in during the Christmas Time. I enjoyed working there. I left because I needed a set schedule.  The schedule at Target fluctuated and I never knew what days or hours I would have to work until the schedule came out.  When I first started the schedule came out two weeks in advance. Then it was only a couple days in advance.  Hopefully this has improved.
good,"Enjoyed ringer up guest and helping locate items around the store, Giving them idea on how to decorate a certain area in their house old or even helping the students with school decoor"
good,I was not an employee here. I only worked here as part of a school requirement. I was in the pharmacy 3-4 days a week for 4 hours a day and the pharmacist at that time was awesome
good,Wasn't the best place to be. Its extremely unsafe in the backroom with fire isles being covered and barely able to move at some points. Team Leads should make out the schedule for their team members no the STL. Being a full time employee and only getting 20 hours weekly was not a good experience
good,It can be a great and fun place to work but the LOD’s can be stupid and expect the most and they will work u to death and a lot of them aren’t understanding and the STL is super unprofessional and too petty for a 40 year old man seriously do not recommend anyone to work at Dallas south target
good,"Usually have friendly customers, and co-workers. Fun environment. Working as a cart attendant was great while I did it, they allowed you to listen to music and was fast pace so the time flew by."
good,"No chance for contract workers to get full time position, I'm not sure how anybody gets hired full time there. Great people but no chance for full time employment"
good,"Target used to be a great place to work, but the store chain has declined in quality over the last few years. It can be a fun place to work if you find a good crew to work with and end up with decent managers, but do not expect to make any major advancements in your position."
good,I worked there for a numbers of years. It was fast paced situation. I was moving all of the time. For the most part the I liked it. I got along with my co-workers and the managers. It was a good place to make money fast.
good,"The new operating model has streamlined processes and driven individual business ownership, but has proven increasingly difficult to implement in high-volume stores."
good,"The job is too demanding for the lack of respect , no real incentives for your hard work & dedication to the company , it’s just too much in a whole ."
good,"Everyday was something new"
good,Quick pace and running boxes to certain areas that are assigned. There lunch breaks were nicely made and it was a decent job to have for night time. the hardest part of thob is not getting tired.
good,Sometimes work can be stressful when it is busy and there is a lot to do. I am Hoping that the management will improve as they start to make changes in the store because right now the management is poor.
good,The managers were nice and made sure the mandatory breaks were taken. It was sometimes too loud in the break room if you wanted some peace and quiet. The lockers were not safe as most of them were broken and one could lose their personal stuff. The staff were friendly and always willing to help.
good,I was a loss prevention specialist. most of the times i was in office watching cameras and making sure customer safety was in order. other times i was store greeter being polite to customers and checking reciepts and making sure all items were purchased
good,"It was ok, I wasn't at target for long only three months. The experience was ok learn a lot in the three months I was there. Learn about cash register."
good,"Great work environment but not enough hours. Cram 11 shifts into one day. Constantly on your feet. Great People, Decent discount. Overall great place to work for part time positions."
good,A typical day at target is stressful. Have to meet deadlines or else the managers will harass you. The hardest part is dealing with the managers the customers are fun to talk to
good,"But that doesn't mean that it's worth your time. They pay better and the corporate climate isn't bad. They did cook-outs and celebrate Holidays which makes for a fun time. I also was able to be myself most days and that pleased the customer and gave me a decent feeling of inclusion. For three years I advanced from cashier to guest service to carts to Curbside pick-up to order Shipping to working as a GSA (without being paid more for it). The whole time looking for promotion to GSTL (or another Team Lead) and only receiving a pat on the back (like some stuffed bullseye dogs) or complaints about a few times I was late or/and times I had issues selling red cards. It's great for really young or really old people but for the 30 something father of two kids, it's not enough money at the entry level to be worthwhile."
good,Target's typical day of work is being told you can do 2 peoples job in short hours. Being griped at when its not done. There is no advancement in Target.
good,All in all target was a family and a team and as a whole unit. The best parts of working with the target family is that everybody was on the same page and much got accomplished by being that way.
good,"Hardest part of the job, working with people and stocking shelves and back stock all at the same time is super stressful. At Target, the guest comes first always. Sometimes that can be challenging especially with the new changes the company is putting in place. Overall, it makes the time go back quickly when I'm on the job and my managers were hard on me but fair. I am glad I had the hard mentoring from my leadership, I feel it was the push I needed to see what I was good at and what I can improve."
good,"Look this was a long time ago and it was retail. It was far from a dream job, but it wasn't bad. I dealt with entitled customers (guests in target lingo) and had my first experience working full time."
good,"I learned how to multi-task such as working as a cashier and transitioning to working guest service and helping out on the floor. There are opportunities to advance, if you see a future in retail."
good,"It’s been so long since I’ve worked there but my only complaint is just younger coworker who did t do anything, other than that it was a very decent place to work"
good,Working at target was iffy. you have good days bad days. I learned how to organize clothing and also how to interact with all types of people. The hardest part was the business and being able to finish your work by the end of the night.
good,"Target was bittersweet during my short seasonal stint. The environment is very friendly and the whole Target Team is positive overall. I struggled with all the walking, constant 100-lb lifting/dragging/stocking shelves."
good,"Not my first choice but good part-time job if you are going to school or between jobs. Management can be a little disagreeable, but can be worked with."
good,"Target as a company is not good to work for but the store I work at the people are awesome and understanding, they've always been understanding of my situation and worked with me."
good,"Loved everyone i worked at target with. However many times i would find myself without enough hours to pay the rent, which made it a very stressful job."
good,"Depending on which department I was working in the days were all different. While working in the fulfillment area, it was extremely fast paced and went quickly. Working on the sales floor was a slower pace yet still busy"
good,"lots of people"
good,"It’s okay this is a job for someone fresh out of High school and just needs some money, or someone who has older kids and just need something to do. It’s always changes going on."
good,it's a good job but there's a lot of set backs and management is just not as good as you would like. Also there's a lot of favoritism with hours and it's not a environment you would like to stay in.
good,Assisted women with beauty products healping to find make up that was age appropiate and that would help them to obtain the look they wanted. I learned a bout the brands of make up they carried so I could explain to the client about the particular line.
good,Wasn't given that much training since day one. Was good at first until later down the road. It started to get worse as soon as people started to leave.
good,Need to pay the associate and team leaders more money they do alot that gets uncounted for and it's not fair especially to the working single moms like my self that try to make customer happy and get bye
good,Target is a wonderful job. I would definitely consider it a good job especially if you’re able to get 40 hours. Moving up to HR would allow you a set career.
good,The target team is sure one that gets along with everyone they’re fun to be around and make a good environment for the people also it is enjoyable to work with the team
good,dont ever work for a target express unless you want to feel like the whole business depends you. Managers dont know how to deal with modernization or new processes. Theres too many overlapping departments. Dont bother telling them you have two jobs or want something better because they will bully you to quit or fire you for a pathetic reason.
good,Target had very flexible hours and a great work environment. They are very accepting of LGBT+ issues and also are very friendly. Working there was a good experience but I had to stop due to personal reasons.
good,"They kept constantly changing the front end and what requirements were expected of the cashiers. They kept demanding red cards then they stop then they start again. Co-workers were pleasant to work with and some tried to work together while others didn't. It just depend on who was in charge of the front end how smooth or how hard it would be. Hardest part was getting use to standing behind register if you haven't done that before. It would take about two weeks to get use to that. While I worked there, I would always do my grocery shopping. They would have good mark downs and savings with your red card on top of that. I really liked that. However, I don't work there now. So, I don't shop there. It's not close to my home. I would hear a lot of customers love to shop but, they lived too far or the store got closed that they use to go to."
good,With every job there are pros and cons. This is a good job if you're looking for something to have retail experience. It was fun working with coworkers in this environment just be sure you're the retail type of worker.
good,Target was a easy quick passed job meet alot of people and learn alot about retail anyone could do this job its that simple very busy most of the week
good,"this job can be fast paced and this also will allow you to grow, takes a while and he job can also be hard if you can't do things at a fast pace but if you have good work ethic you'll be fine"
good,Target is a good place to work if you have an additional income.  Management is pretty laid back.  As long as we got our work done they didn't bother us.  Target isn't a stressful job.  It's constant easy paced work.
good,"While I worked at Target the main focus was getting people to sign up for ""red cards""& making sure you were assisting the consumer in a timely manner.  Although it was a competitive environment, they were flexible with your schedule."
good,I have not worked there in years but i'm forced to do a review for it. Target is an ok job if you are in school. The pay is not good and the turn over rate for target seems to be high.
good,"it was a temporary job, i didnt work their long, they had strict guidelines on uniform and attitude. you often went all around the store with a lot of walking"
good,I would be boring most of the time of the day but the pick back up later on. I learned that you always got be busy because it doesn’t look good for the job
good,"The jobs was great because of the people I worked with. The boss were interesting. When I work there I always closed, so we had to get the Food Ave. ready for the next day."
good,"Interesting and ever-changing environment, constantly working with the flow of customers and employees in order to keep the store moving along properly."
good,"I was a part of the Asset Protection team so my review is on that aspect of the job. Target's AP team is Very Very strict. The management above your direct AP Leader DOES NOT CARE about you position, situation, or if anything has been done to your person to warrant a response. There is a 0 tolerance policy for altercations with guest, even if you are assaulted in the process. If you want to work for Target's AP team, be prepared to take a bunch of mess."
good,"You will be pushed daily to improve the working environment. Expect change. Will have OT , mandatory during peak season. Will cap out in pay after 3 years."
good,"its what you make of it"
good,"I was hired as a seasonal cashier. Management weren't involved and didn't take the time to teach you. No movies to watch or reading material was given. I did the best I could and worked my shift, was dependable and on time. Picked up other shifts that other associates called out on. I left due to other job at the time offered me a great opportunity of full time."
good,"Typical retail job. Management was decent. Would not recommend working in the electronics department at all. Makes a fairly easy job, much more stressful than it should be."
good,"Completed summer job where I managed inventory, interacted with customers, marketed different brands and created a safe and sanitized work place for Target and their customers."
good,The company help employees with people skills dealing with different area in the store that aims to help other in time of need or just happiness for birthday Christmas and many more events that bring customers to the store
good,when working at target you will always have something to do. Whether it is helping customers or keeping your area clean. This job is great for college students or high School students getting retail experience.
good,Target was very faced paced & physically enduring. It is a great opportunity for a starter job. The benefits are very acceptable and the environment is very friendly.
good,okay job they only paid $8  when I was there so its been a while. people were okay to work with bosses were alright as long as you kept out of their way.
good,All employees got a long very well. they are very accepting and work great as a team.Very fast  paced job. Team leads and HR were always nice and flexible with anything you needed help with.
good,It was hard to work your way up into management positions.  The environment was happy enough and I enjoyed the people I worked with and the work I did.
good,Fast paced with the ability to learn many departments. Good benefits while only requiring part time employment. but Full time status isn't available for non managerial rolls.
good,"Target was a great first job, it thought me a lot about retail sales and I was able to align myself under managers that wanted to see us succeed. The swing shifts and low pay was the ultimate downfall."
good,Management at some locations are better than others.  Most employees are nice. Occasionally you will get some customers that do not want help or that are in a bad mood.
good,"Needs better management."
good,management did not care for team members. we were constantly late on our work and not given any help to improve . they provided free food alot which was nice
good,"I worked here just for a few months (seasonal)  October - January. They didn't train me well,  just threw me out there..  Its way too tense,  they expect you to finish everything at a certain time which is impossible if you're doing one department by yourself..   Closing sucks.."
good,"Great training. Beautiful teamwork. Flexible hours. I was a temporary employee, so I can't say much on benefits and PTO/Vacation. Working seasonally was fun, but I wouldn't work full time. Hours can fluctuate."
good,"The only problem is unless you become ""friends"" with some of management than you wont get hours. I really feel like this job is seasonal job do to few hours you'll get."
good,"All about squeezing as much as possible out of team members for as little as possible. Availability of hours swings wildly throughout the year. The higher hourly rate is good but this is only suitable for supplemental income, not a main career for many."
good,"Target is a ok job, but target does not pay enough to support my needs and wants. Target does not pay enough for the expected work. The overall work is not hard, but the company does expect a lot."
good,This past year alone target has changed their direction of how the store should be ran three times. If it could ever become stable with leadership then it would grow but right now its a place for casual work.
good,They schedule you very little hours and then expect you to stay super late. They are constantly piling on more work when they can see you're already struggling.
good,"Typical day focuses on great guest service in a fast, fun, and friendly environment.  Most enjoyable part of job is serving the guests and incorporating new methods to compete in retail market."
good,I worked here when I was fifteen and it was a very short period of time. Because of that I don't feel confident or comfortable enough to answer these questions.
good,I was unforunately fired from Target 3 day after Christmas for not selling enough credit cards.After being fired I had to fight to obtain unemployment benefits.
good,"My experience there was very average, just what you'd imagine working at a retail chain store. My least favorite part about working there was the uniforms and how cold it was inside."
good,Very nice place to work if you are in school or have other obligations. The schedules are based on you the employee not just the company needs. Many students work for target because of those reasons
good,"honesty was a good part time job for a high school student, wasn't crazy it was pretty boring. the only thing was I was always hit on by fellow  coworkers who were grown men and it made me so uncomfortable."
good,It is a fast paced environment. You need to be well organized and understand your role. The store teams are great and very helpful in most situations.
good,I had to move away quickly because of unforseen circumstances but it was fine work and people were not as miserable but I just couldn't make it work for me
good,Good job to start off at but not a good one if you want a career. They keep you focused and ready to work but when it’s time to actually work your alone with hardly any back up.
good,"Most of the management was supportive of their direct reporters. The environment was fun and management tried to keep it that way. Even in the busy times, everyone seemed to be in good spirits."
good,It was great place to work .enjoy the people that work there. I work for cleaning company for target in the morning make sure the store was clean. But the cleaning company was great
good,"Standard retail operations, nothing special. Days are very average and there are no special standouts that are worth further explanation. Neutral work environment."
good,"you have team leaders that are good managing , their is always something to do and positions available to switch nd hours to take if you didnt have enough you previous week"
good,"Target is a fast paced growing company in an industry that is ripe with change. To keep up, Target is changing quickly to keep pace. "
good,"The first year at the job was fairly enjoyable. Days were quick and simple; met some really nice people that I would chat with during breaks. Management or at least higher ups were for the most part very friendly and willing to help with any problems or questions. "
good,"depending on the management depends on how fast your learn and grow, if you dont know who to brown nose your way into their life. you wont move from your position. and management changes so oftern evey 18m. there is a good chance you could be stuck and miserable for years."
good,"Target was not the best place to work to be honest. They did not treat employees fairly. There was so many things wrong and also a lot of favoritism. I did not feel appreciated all the time. I loved going to work for my coworkers and honestly I loved the communication and relationship with the guest I had to interact with. I feel my hardest part was not feeling confident enough in all the work I did, I didn't even feel comfortable enough to ask for help without feeling judged."
good,"Working here was great, however, they tend not to promote from the inside, and instead tend to take outside hires, making it hard to move up. If you are looking for an executive position, I would suggest doing their internship instead of applying at a starting level."
good,I've been with the company for quite a few years and every year there is less hours less help and a heavier workload. Pay isn't bad but you never get enough hours to receive a decent check
good,Target only offered part-time hours to their employees. It was difficult trying to get hours for the weeks. The company is great for individuals going to school just to make some money.
good,Working at Target as a sales associate during the summer time in between my college years was a good experience to learn what it's like in the retail world.
good,Good place to work when you need a job. Decent pay and the team members are good to work with. Easy to use systems allow for simple transition into a new job and make life easy.
good,Stocked the stores before store hours. Very detailed oriented because the items were labeled and sorted in a certain manner. Great team and great teamwork.
good,"Where I worked was great, but it was the smallest possible store in the U.S.A. I hear that it goes not so well at any other store. If you need a job right away, this is an okay place to go."
good,"This was my first retail job. Loved many aspects of it, but helping the guests find the items they wanted was the best. Target is going through many changes and their expectations were too high for the hours they scheduled employees."
good,They have flexible hours. They don’t really train you but they are really helpful and they pay you good. You put in time to request it off and they will give you it
good,"hours can vary and schedule will fit what you ask, but after a few weeks you tend to be scheduled outside of availability"
good,"Typical day at target would be, i get orders from my boss. The boss usually give me an assignment to start stocking, when i am done i would start on another assignment which would be unloading the truck of supplies the come into the store. I learned how to work under pressure. The work environment was with all different culture and different age of people. The hardest part about the job is working overnight. The most enjoyable part of the job is work in a team."
good,"Hours are never consistent, you can be hired as full time but walk in to see your schedule and see 17 hours one week. Never payed attention to requested days off. You are allowed to take shifts people can not work but you can barely take them due to the way the schedule is. Not a lot of recognition especially when you work very hard. For all the responsibilities i had with my position, i do not believe i was payed enough. The interviews that were given to be a part of my team were not clear enough, after the first few days new team members would quit or not show up due them not having the real expectations of the job."
good,"Target was the epitome of Fast, Fun, and Friendly. Training was second to none and really enjoyed sharpening core compentencies  such as mangaging execution and/or personal development."
good,The team was great to work with. I loved the people that I worked with every day was great. I was with a very seasoned team and they made sure that I felt comfortable.
good,On a day to day base i probably helped/did 2-3 peoples job. The people are nice but the way management/corporate has done things has killed the culture at the store recently. The store is going down hill all the people who have worked there for over 5 years are quitting. Its time to go.
good,Management was tough and expected way too much out of the employees. Might have been just my store but they wanted a lot out of me. Stressful work environment.
good,"target's fine. If you're used to big box retail you know what to expect. Management is generally pretty relaxed and not pushy about getting sales. A lot of Target's money comes from groceries and clothes and other things people don't need to be upsold on, so I wasn't pushed to sell extra accessories or warranties or things like that."
good,The pay was great but the management wasn't so much. The management did not really tell everything there was to know so it was a lot of asking around.
good,Working at target was amazing in the beginning I managed to grow and become a leader within less than a year. Overall it was a good yet stressful experience.
good,"Not something you want to be stuck (comfortable) in. Management depending on location is okay.. but not the best. Target is a big company to not pay enough or even have “enough” hours for cashiers and sales floor team members. With that being said the only department worth working for is AP the security team. Even then it’s not worth it. Your life is not worth people that steal for a living and threaten you with meeting you after work.."
good,"Good place to start when young and need exp.. Worked hard and I moved up quickly, then moved around the departments to get a grasp of most the store functions."
good,Had fun working there hard to keep people in the building. Had a high turnover rate but it had a lot of potential and a lot of room for growth from a lead standpoint
good,A typical day at Target was very fast paced and fun! engaging the guest and making sure your environment was clean us a big plus when working there. Target also has many other benefits besides the regular ones to help their team become better not only at work but also at home.
good,Had meetings every morning to decide who will be doing what and if you will be in a group or by your self. Hardest part was staying awake since this was my 3rd job at the time.
good,It's ok job to have  management seems to be getting better and if they up my hours I'll be happy but it's a part time job I'm looking for full time more hours
good,"People were friendly, good learning experience, pay was decent for the time. The hours became inconsistent however after the season was over, yet they were always hiring."
good,"I worked the overnight shift as a stocker.  It was okay, for the most part.  Some of the people there were pretty rude, and not in a fun, joking way.  Management was basically non-existent."
good,I enjoyed working part time for Target.  The work culture is healthy and the management is friendly.  I learned cash operations well and I'm ready for my next job.
good,Target was a laidback environment until you got comfortable. Managment was very passive aggressive. Relationships within the work environment are looked down on so much that managers will sneak around trying to destroy any relationship with a fellow co-worker. Very stressful.
good,Upper level management started micro-managing the entire store.  With the new focus on guest experience it has changed the culture from a positive experience to one that dwells on the negative.
good,"Wonderful place to work, meet amazing people, clean environment, amazing job benefits package, hours open for operation are the same everyday, family oriented"
good,"Lucrative pay, workload could be too much at times.  Required to work every other weekend, and 10-12 hour days.  High turnover rate due to company culture made it difficult to continue to develop your team."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job were the people.  The hardest part of the job was the constant changing of priorities, was hard to feel accomplished and not enough hours given to do the job to my satisfaction (full time expectations with part-time hours)."
good,management was ok at times not the worst or best either. coworkers were helpful and friendly i did my job easly and gave it 100% everyday with no issue
good,"Interesting work environment"
good,"low hours but fun shifts"
good,I would say that this would not be a job to have as a career but its not a bad option in the meantime until one finds their career and starts it. others may feel differently
good,"While the work itself was fine, the other employees were frustrating. As a hard floor sales employee, we are to help the cashiers when needed. Even with multiple hard floor employees on duty, I found myself being the only one answering the call, as everyone else would remain silent and ignore it."
good,"This job was fun, but can be very stressful at times. Corporation sends too much product to our store, which makes it difficult to get caught up on pushing freight. Loved the people I met at this job."
good,"The general community is great and very easy to get along with, but the scheduling is rarely consistent and management can be unneccessarily stressful."
good,This was just a job that I had while in high school. The pay was minimum salary back then which was around $7 or $8. ........................................
good,It is a fast paced environment.  There is never a dull moment and you are able to interact with different cultures.  Each day is never the same as the previous day so there is no boredom.  You are continually learning new invonations.
good,It was tiring standing all day and only 30 min lunches. and pressured to sell target cards to customers on a daily basis minimum 3  day or more if possible.
good,a lot of people worked here and it was a good part time job for kids who need a job at 16. It was fun at first but then became slow because of the hours so not enough pay.
good,it was fast past work I lean how to work with measurement and build and you tools manger work right with you hands on work place was slow it was on a hand full people work
good,"Gets stressful at times, not guaranteed good hours, can be difficult about availability, fun co workers, gives good Benifits, hr is very nice and understanding"
good,I don't really have much to say about Target I was only there for a Seasonal job.I had overnight shift so all we did was unloading trucks and restocking for the day
good,Fun place to work for. The management was helpful. Enjoyed stocking in the back room pulling orders for worker that would come get them to b sent out on the floor. Benefits and pay raises were not very good tho.
good,Great place to work.Was provided with good benefits.The management needs to get on the same page. no real room for advancement from the warehouse worker
good,"Offers good pay, but little chance of advancing. Management changes frequently. Management lacks job knowledge and they find reasons for you not to advance."
good,"It's no one's fault, but I am unhappy working at Target. They are fine. My hourly wage is fine, but I don't have many hours. The work I do is appreciated, but I don't like doing it."
good,Target is an ok place to work if you are content with staying in the same position for years and no opportunity for growth the best thing about it are the coworkers
good,target was a great company to work for. people were respectful and very helpful when needing assistance with job duties. it was a fast paced environment so you always had something to do.
good,"Sales floor associate, fitting room attendant,cashier. Mutliple tasks. Long hours especially during the holidays. Fast, fun and friendly atmosphere towards its customers."
good,"I was a cashier. It was a good job and I was treated well. Being part-time, there were no benefits. The job was actually boring and that is why I left. When there were no customers, I just had to stand there."
good,Working at Target has been both a good and a bad experience. I've learned how to professionally speak to guests and how to correctly handle money. One of the reasons why I personally had a bad experience was the work hours I was given.
good,"I love it, very friendly environment, very nice people to work with. Great hours and very flexible schedule. The people are great. Loved it so much!!!"
good,Would not be my first choice when I first started my pay was horrible! The yearly raises were horrific less than ten cents a year. I would go back to see if it has improved.
good,Bosses didn't tell you what you did right. Very passive aggressive. Very easy but had you do a lot of stuff that wasn't your job. If the management would of changed and my hours got better after the holidays I might of stayed. But it was very inconsistent.
good,"My experience working for Target Corp. was quite unique (maybe), but this is the most fun I've had working for a company but still can get paid below minimum wage."
good,"fast paced, friendly staff. The day always went by really fast. some times the managers were really unprofessional. but all in all it was a really good company to work for."
good,"Your responsabilities vary depending on the job role, Focused on customer service, only recoment to students who need a flexible schedule. Work place is alright; it is hard to advance within the company."
good,"Having worked for other retail chains in the past, Target was a breath of fresh air initially."
good,"When Target has hours, it is a great environment to work in. It's not a difficult job or hard but the job is mostly enjoyable when there are hours available for you to work."
good,Target is a very great place if your working to keep yourself busy ..I thought I liked it at first but coming from a company who is updated targets system is very old .. It makes it hard to take care of guest .. My target that I work with the entire management team is a joke !!!!!!!!
good,"When upper-management sucks, it's a miserable working experience that will leave you wishing you had never accepted the job offer. When management is good, however, it's a fantastic place to work and I think the company as a whole is headed in a great direction. Get employee opinion before choosing a store!"
good,I was not aware that management timed you on each pallet that you put out to the sales floor. Had a negative influence on overall performance. Workplace was ok...not alot of conversation with other employees during your shifts.
good,A job that was reliable to go to every day and know what role you had every day. only down fall was some times guests were wnot kind to team members Other than that work place was tolerable.
good,"I was provided many opportunities and training which helped me grow in my career. It was fun, fast and Friendly. Made many lifelong friends during my time."
good,"They don’t give you enough hours to work.  So sometimes you only get 12 hours by week or it could be even less than that or more, you never know and sometimes they don’t let you do overtime."
good,"These are fast hours, and decent work. Easy job to have if youre a teenager or if you need a second job. Definitely does not pay enough to support yourself on."
good,Target is a fast passed highly competitive company that required consistent results.  Hardest part of the job is maintain all senior leadership happiness on surprise visits.
good,"Working within the Target store was fun.  You meet a variety of people and get to work within your community.  Target is very big on giving back, and serving the community we worked in."
good,Target is a very good job. They provided food for every employee various times. They also are very kind and listen to everything you say the pay is very good as well
good,"It was a great job out of college, but not a career for me. I worked with good people and the people under me did a great job. Many people would say I deserve the credit for our Guest Service accomplishments, but it was everyone that worked under me. We were best in ""Red Cards"" by corporate standards because of everyone."
good,"I was hired as a seasonal worker. It was short, I had gotten sick, and had to quit. Red cards were a pain to upsale because everyone was a tourist. The workers were cool. The drive was incredibly far."
good,"Strong focus on developing young leaders, fast paced environment, opportunity for growth, but you will sacrifice work life balance to move into management positions.  Very tight payroll budgets with unreasonably high expectations to accomplish workload."
good,Everyone was trained well.  The negative side is when work is slow they will surely send you home early.  The pay was not bad if you didn`t have far to travel.
good,easy routine collect a check type job engagement typically laid back perfect job if high school or college student can cross train in multiple departments
good,Being on feet 12 hrs is hard. Lifting heavy boxes for 12 hrs is hard lots of work. Can be pulled and sent to other areas. No set work place. Running equipment.
good,the job was alright easy work to do nothing very complicated there management was alright if you don't someone hovering over your shoulder every five minutes
good,"couldn't stand it, mess all the time. Team leaders just walking around nagging at you, cleaning up 45 aisles, couldn't take it. No benefits, nothing they offer"
good,enjoyed the pricing and planogram crew. and the side benefit of knowing when everything got marked down.  AP staff is motivated by how many people they can get in trouble.
good,I'm find choosing the best job for some hard planner. To stay motived the skills. I enjoy getting a job position. my goal will learn to help a management.
good,Target's rule are a little too strict but they are proficient at managing their staff and always on time with breaks and lunch. They pay really well for what the expect.
good,"I fit best in collaborative and cultivative cultures, but terribly in control and competence cultures. Two jobs ago, I was in a competence culture and I experienced it as a daily brawl, with everyone conflicting with each other. But some of my colleagues who are still there did well in that kind of environment. Some people thrive in environments where other people don’t."
good,"Management is poor, there is no accountability.  The managers put their jobs on the team members  and get upset when you are unable to finish your work and theirs."
good,I thought that target was a fun and enjoyable place to work I just couldn't get enough hours there.  The employees and management were great to work with!
good,"they want you to go way faster than humanly possible. Pay is good and some of the people are friendly but unloading trucks with 1,000 plus boxes and stocking the shelves with the contents Fromm all the boxes in 4 hours is ridiculous."
good,"I worked here for 3 years. It was a fun place to work when I was younger. I would not recommend anyone over the age of 25 work here though, as it was more geared to hiring young. There are alot of younger employees here."
good,I would not recommend working at this company.  I can only speak to my store but management did not seem to care at all about the associates.  Too much work was given to skeleton crews just to save money.
good,Target was a good company to work for.I enjoyed it.It just didn't offer me a high wage which was causing issues in my life.The management team was great.
good,good place to start your carreer advancement and a good place to learn how to effectively build with a team. A rewarding experience when helping others
good,"Honestly, it has been a long time since I have worked there, but I do remember that being a night stocker was hard work and you were kept busy. It was a good environment to work in."
good,"worked the early shift, was nice to be done by the afternoon"
good,Target was okay but the work life balance was a little lack luster. They scheduled you even when you would ask them not to. However th emoney was decent.
good,the advancement opportunities are very slim and the drama is very high in the target corporation. i would recommend this job for younger under 25 people and first time fires.
good,"Decent workplace, not very fair pay however very much reccomended. Typical retail experience. Paid sick time, paid vacation time......................"
good,"Target wasn’t a bad place to work, I actually enjoyed it. The coworkers made you feel like part of the team and helped make the job easier in the beginning."
good,"Manager seemed very cut-throat, with little room for mistakes. I did however learn good guest engagement skills, and learned how to stock shelves. "
good,"Was offered many benefits for being a seasonal worker, and pay was definitely worth it as well. Employees are nice and easy to get along with and everyone is very collaborative."
good,I had a good time working there interacting with other people and making good times there and understanding how to work different things there. It was challenging at first but once I got it it was good
good,"Very flexible and super easy job. It's really hard to get fired from that job. All you have to do is show up on time, have a good attitude and look like you're doing something."
good,"I like target but theres not any room for advancement. I loved the work, but the management constantly contradicted each other and it ended up being extremely frustrating."
good,"Target was a great place for me to get my feet wet!  I learned so much!  I matured, I gained leadership skills, I had an amazing mentor.  I even made great money after being promoted several times.  I felt I worked for a great company with great benefits.  Which, in fact they do!  However, during this period I had a child and it felt like more of a deal with the devil.  The hours became more demanding  - and my time away from home became longer and longer.   I finally made the decision to part ways.  I still have a position view about Target, I learned some much and its apart of me.  Just be careful of what you wish for, because it has a way of sucking the life out of you."
good,Target is a good place to work if you you can only work certain hours and days.  But one bad thing is that the hours aren't consistent.  You can have 20 plus hours one week and the next week you can only work 8.  But if you need hours you can always ask to train in other departments.
good,I didn't stay long at Target because the retail stores such as Target or Walmart are not really for me. I was in really dire need of a job over the holidays which is why I applied.
good,enjoying working with the boss. I feel that we are family. Working hard everyday.learning lots of the things with different peoples that work there.the hardest things to work there was stressful.
good,Great place for a beginner to start or someone with little experience.i would highly recommend target great people and fun place to work..answering phone for your department and great customer servive
good,"A lot of changes have been happening lately. They are trying and experimenting with new things, but in my opinion, I would go in a different direction. No matter how much experience you have, they won't provide you enough working hours."
good,Work with nice people help guest put product on selfs neat organisations help other team members clean learn new things helpful great some fun things support
good,I loved working here at fist. But then as they got used to you they weren't as nice to you.I was a cashier .I'd cash customers out and give them change back. Tell customer to have a wonderful day and go on to the next customer. If wasn't busy I would straighten shelves or candy up. Was a very stressful place to work.
good,"A typical day at work would start off by me clocking in, and going into the back storage room to see what needs to be done first. I will then prioritize my list of things to do and start from there. I will jump into orders that need to be completed, as well as go help on a register if I am needed there. At Target I learned how to work together with a large staff to please all the needs of our guests. Also it is very important at Target for the guest to always have their need accommodated, and for them to get the best service at all times. I believe the hardest part of my job was to do online orders for guests within the thirty minute time frame, and help guests asking around the store at the same time. It got hectic because I would have an order of 30 or more items, but would also be receiving questions from guests. The best part of my job was getting to meet new people and having to have another work experience."
good,This was a temporary job for me but the manager was great and my co workers too. hours were flexible somewhat. about an hour of flexibility. but overall good job if your just trying to get money in the bank.
good,"For a company that makes that much money, they treat their employees poorly and there are no company events."
good,"I don't feel like I have ever been trained fully for the positions I filled, however the job is simple enough that one can typically figure it out. The pay is decent but there are benefits like discounts in store. Management is nonexistent, except for one manager who seemed very power hungry. As a student, one would think he would understand a changing schedule and appreciate notices in advance, but, I guess there is a difference in a job/working to pay for college to do something more and a career/going to college for Target."
good,"The work itself isn't difficult. This may only be at my location but the management team seemed to dangle advancement opportunities in front of team members as incentive to work harder or do more without giving any specific or tangible ideas of when these possible opportunities may arise. Overall it's a fine place to work for an early life job, but the location I worked at isn't one to try and make a career out of."
good,The employment position at target was a great experience to add to my resume. Hopefully other employees at Target will be able to feel the exact same way and it can further their employment opportunities in the future.
good,"Came into work unloaded the truck(1-2 hours), put everything in its correct departments. Then would cut open the boxes and stock shelves aisle by aisle."
good,"401k plan good. Wages needed to be better. Management okay, but could help employees more. Start early in morning, taking loads off truck, breaking down load and putting produce in area's of need."
good,"Loved working at target in the beginning, but before I quit they became very controlling of my outside life and I noticed myself leaving work every day feeling bad.  The direction the company is going has made the ETLS/STLs very unappreciative and have very high expectations with little to no help to get anything done.  I really thought I was going to stay with target long term and keep growing with the company but it became unbearable working there.  Team members/coworkers were the only reason why I was able to last so long there."
good,A decent job with a lot of fun people. Many times difficult to get hours and no benefits offered for part time employees. No option to be full time for cashiers at my location.
good,"I learned how to stop organize, stock, and develop my costumer service skills. Management was helpful and always had a goal for the embitterment of the overall store."
good,Was a pretty good place to work however at Christmas we were working long hours 6 days a week. Had to go in on Christmas and thanksgiving nights to work
good,"I feel like if you are that type of person is willing to take a chance to do something different this job is for you. From January to June it's kind of slow but once middle of July till Christmas it picks up heavy, working 6 days a week, 2 doubles at least twice a week. So be expected to work past schedule time. So pretty much in your body will get a workout."
good,You get what you'd expect working for a large retail corporation. Work experience probably varies by location. The managers and employees at my location are what make it barable but inconsistent hours and lower pay aren't great. They also don't guarantee anyone full time hours.
good,It was a great place . It was a way to met new people .  I like the way we talk about the way my hours are . Also the lunch breaks weren’t the greatest.
good,Overall this is a fun and interesting job with many great coworkers. Only down side is the management has issues within itself. Not very easy to progress and climb up the ladder in this company.
good,"Wake early mornings whether it be 4 or 6 am, and be place either on the line or start stocking items. Learning a lot like zoning and flexing lanes. Management wasn't bad, strict with rules and keep check on workers."
good,"Overall, the company does care for the well being of the individuals working in the wear-house. The start to every shift consisted of a pretty good stretch routine that would be done to make everyone limber up. The job does put a lot of strain on upper and lower back as well as legs."
good,Loved working here great environment managment was awesome hours were ok just wasnt enough but perfect place to work for anyone who wants to learn how to unload
good,"This company is good for students for their first job, I was not impressed with them since management was poor, and had preferences,  I was not really pleased ."
good,Target is a hard place to work. People are not team players and it can be very stressful. It is run like a highschool and people spend to much time trying to get into everybody's business.
good,Working seasonal was ok but was also messy at times. I only got to work a few days due to the over hiring and full time employees got their hours cut as well. Sometimes there would be me and one other person who needed to do many orders in the span of around 3 hours and that became stressful at times. By the end of my employment the ship from store area was going to be closed due to there being orders that were not completed and the lack of things we had in stock.
good,Target is great if you are looking to step into retail - or working to just line your pockets. The pay rate is decent enough - but there are times where the efficiency of management can be questionable. As with all things - especially retail - it is not for everyone.
good,"Target, the same retail experience as you would get at any other retail store. If you're looking for weekends off, then this is not the company that is right for you."
good,"Target was my first job, and it gave me a lot of opportunities to build my skills and experience. The issue I ran into was being promised promotions that should have never been promised. I worked hard to advance through the company, but Target would rather hire people who never worked in a real stressful retail environment."
good,"it was ok I would go back maybe "
good,It was a fun job fun environment friendly coworkers. Work along the Starbucks and was always able to test new drinks and associate with customers. Times went by fast.
good,"I was young and it helped me get money but it was always meant to be temporary. I enjoyed my time there however I needed something more, and wanted to advance myself."
good,"Target is very driven to guest service.  From merchandising, pricing, instocks, and quality of service.  Pay is pretty low and is hard to support a family."
good,Do your job as fast as possible. People that you work with are nice but the competitiveness makes the job harder the best part of working at target is the discount.
good,"Management executive contributing to the profitability of a 35 million dollar a year retail store and accountable for managing 200 employees"
good,Hours are inconsistent. They care more about receiving their bonuses than making sure their employees can make ends meet. “$15 an hour but here’s 13 hours a week”. There’s little to no communication between managers and to team members. Most information is learned through the grapevine.
good,A typical day at Target was a overall fun atmosphere with friendly coworkers and management willing to go above and beyond to help our customers get the assistance they desired it was tough at times because you would have to unfortunately say no occasionally but that would always be a last resort you would do anything you could first before calling over management and after you and management could not come up with a solution you would give them the Target guest relations phone number the most enjoyable part of my day was the faces of the customers after you helped them quickly with a smile I have learned how to be very patient even if the situation isn't ideal but I also learned how to make sure I can do whatever it takes to keep our customers happy and returning again
good,You get burned for being a good employee. Higher work load with shorter deadlines than anyone else . Get talked down to for the tasks not completed even though you get an unfair work load in complarison
good,"I was hired as seasonal, and barely get 20 hours a week. They also said they let you know 2 weeks in advance when they are letting you go and they don’t."
good,"There was always work to be share and working with a group of people always gets the job done. It was an okay environment, its sales. There were breaks in between, and free wifi."
good,"A typical day in the food court at target consist of setting up for the morning shift, everything from making sure food temperatures were correct, following food and sanitation guidelines.  Stocking supplies, and cleaning and restocking dining/kitchen area.  Serving customers   and ringing up customer purchases."
good,The management is really a downfall in the company and I’m not talking about the employees that make and hourly wage I’m specifically talking about the ones who get paid salary such as the ETL’s and the STL. They do not care about their employees if they are having a bad day they will take it out on their workers. They can be rude and nasty. I would recommend this job to the not so weak at heart or to people that can put up with Bs all the time.
good,"The target I work for, employees are doing minimum effort minimum results work. Management is easy on em. Not too much else to say other than that to fill up space on this review."
good,"Weekly hours varied, not a dependable source of income. Hours were available to pick up from other employees. Hardest part of the job was working understaffed and expected to maintain the same productivity levels."
good,"I enjoyed helping customers and making their visit pleasant and inviting.I always worked hard and went above and beyond.I received to the most daily points for credit cards,form the first month to the last month i worked.the hardest thing was working so hard for it not to payoff i didn't receive any raises for doing my job or for the hard work i did when others did not."
good,Competitive and fast paced environment. Many of the managers are willing to help with flexibility of your schedule but you have to work with them as well. They should work on their pay and how they treat their employees
good,"at the beginning i loved working at target, the management was okay and happy people giving you credit, now not so much.. the managemnet now needs work"
good,"Expect more out of employees with less hrs , less staff, younger management no experience very close minded to working smart and not hard. safety , less appreciation of employees culture diffently as changed in the last 10yrs, turn over is out of control"
good,I went into Target being hired as a Guest Services Assistant. Basically an assistant manager. My training wasn't the greatest and I was very stressed trying to make sure I did everything right.
good,"Target is a typical retail environment.The pay is average, the hours for non-management workers is low, and the work environment varies depending on location and current management."
good,"Backroom was the most enjoyable position, pulling and stocking items while generally undisturbed listening to music, videos, books while you worked.... recent corporate changes have made the stores new methods rather cluttered and frustrating. "
good,In the beginning of my working for the company it was a great experience and enjoyable to work there. But as the years went on it just got stressful and I wasn’t getting paid to compensate all the work that was expected of me.
good,Target is a great job. it allows you to be yourself while allows teaching you what to learn. I highly suggest that someone looking for experience apply to Target.
good,I loved the people I worked with and always had someone to go to when running into any issues. The people I worked with worked very well as a team. Can't complain too much.
good,"Okay fun place to work at and fast raises, But not enough hours. Have to know how to handle people. Customers can always be rude and forget the manners."
good,I enjoyed target even though the work force was not the best i take pride in every place i work i make it fun and enjoyable my daily tasks were fairly easy aswell as completing things before the store opened .at that time i loved the noght shift hours i worked I balanced pretty good with my current life situation. Wages were good management wasn’t the greatest but there were there when you needed it most
good,This job was very enjoyable. Pro would include the interaction with many people. Con would be the lack of hours. Overall experience was positive and have never regretted a single day working there.
good,"Great people and manageable workloads but problematic policies when it comes to wellbeing, poor systems and facilities and limited advancement opportunities."
good,"our manager was the best person I've ever met, strict but he know how to get us to understand why things work that way in a humane manner, most of all he had us understand he is also human and understands our life situations. My co workers a were very good with team work, always willing to help each other out."
good,Good place to work. Always have something to do. But sometimes they stick you on self check out everyday all week. Other than that its a great place to work. HR manager very helpful with schduling.
good,"Working for Target is stressful, and often unrewarding. There is a lot of work that is done without proper training. But for a position that is part time work for minimum wage pay, it is simple enough."
good,"It Was Fun I Just Think There Is A Lot Of Standing That You Had To Do. It Was A Nice Relaxing Job At The Self Checkouts Though I Enjoyed That Part, Just Not So Much The Standing."
good,This was a seasonal position so I worked through the holidays and I was let go some time mid January. The hours were good and my managers were flexible.
good,"The corporate stranglehold on this company reaches all the way down to the individual stores.  There is very little wiggle room allowed with task completion, which has led to a lack of flexibility and little problem solving skills.  Its easy if you just want to do as you're told, the way you're told, in the amount of time that you're told."
good,it was a great first job you get to experience a little bit of every thing and I mean everything. you also have many opportunities to transfer departments easily
good,"It certainly wasn't the worst job I've had, but there were a few managers at my target that were horrible. But thankfully, most of my days I got to work with the nice ones. The whole time I was there I had the same position, even though they promised we'd get to do cross training."
good,"This position was for the holiday season from Thanksgiving until after the first of the new year.  I accepted this position to earn extra money for Christmas. I got the flu, which turned into pneumonia and wound up in the hospital for 5 days."
good,"Very long days that include standing for the whole shift (8 hours with a break, of course) . The pay is very very low . The management is rude as well.  However, they do give you the hours that you need or want."
good,Has been several years since I worked at Target.  Target has a fun culture.  You have lots of involvement with customers/guest and have the opportunity for advancement and development.
good,would definitely recommend to work there because its fun to work there and the staff is nice and respectful and king and also helpful towards one another
good,The work is what it is and can be enjoyable or not based on how you make it. There were many good days with a few bad days. I learned new things and would have stayed but I moved out of the area.
good,"no overtime ever, same workload every night, good people to work with, management was good for overnight work, benefits were not much for stockers, easy work."
good,it was a ok place to start off working I would it's more young kids not so much a person with a family or it would be a second job but overall its a ok
good,"I like my job, I do not intend to leave anytime soon. The pay is one of the highest around for this type of work. That being said, the managers that I have (with the exception of 1 or 2 of them) are very hypocritical in terms of what not to do. Half of them spend all day in their office or another boss's. This wouldn't normally be a problem but Target's Team Leads are supposed to be right there with you on the sales floor. That is my only problem with the Target I work at, but it is a pretty big one."
good,"counting money, answering questions, dealing with problems, making sure prices are right, helping the cashiers, dealing with difficult returns, setting up dollar spot for customers"
good,"I worked as ""Inbound/SRT"" (stocker/truck unloader). A typical day at work involved showing up at the scheduled time. 4 AM for 2-truck days and 6 AM for single truck days. There were about 3 - 6 of us to unload an entire truck, sometimes more, most of the time less, and usually around 1,500 - 2,000+ products. For the most part, everyone got along fine, though sometimes it was hectic to work with the full-time or part-time people who had been there for a long time and deal with their cocky arrogant attitudes and acting like they are your boss. However, there were definitely some really nice team members there who would help you out, say hi in passing, and were just very nice to work with."
good,It is a lot better than working in fast food. The culture is of the job is great most of the people that work there are very friendly but the management can be terrible .
good,"Working at Target involves being available at all times for other team members and guests while also performing your own job duties. I learned to do my work quickly to keep up with the pace of everyday business while also being helpful to all guests. Management was somewhat, but not fully, inconsistent, as there often were individuals coming and going. The hardest part of the job was being left with different responsibilities not performed by other team members."
good,Seasonal job. Wouldn't recommend long term. Good for temporary position. They are flexible with hours and time you can work but you get low pay so it is not worth it
good,"Was not very interesting and pretty boring there. Coworkers are fun to be around but the leads In my opinion push way too much for the ""Red Card"" that they offer."
good,I helped unload the boxes from the truck and stock to the shelves. We had to be done by 8:00 and that pressure was hard to deal with.  I left because our hours were being cut and it was hard to go to work at 4AM and then get only 3 or 4 hours of work.
good,"It was a seasonal job I was working and going to school, it's about what you can expect from a part time seasonal position nothing to terrible but nothing supper great about it either"
good,Busy place. Only started there until something else with better pay and benefits came along . Most of the staff was very friendly.  Person who trained me was very nice.
good,I have to know a little bit about every job in the warehouse which made to very exciting.  I learned to spot errors before the product hit the stores.  I became a member of the GREAT TEAM.  We traveled to new DC's and trained.  Also traveled to train the trainers.
good,"the management was alright, not good nor not too bad, but definitely have room for improvement. I worked at the Starbucks in Target. It was tiring because I not only had to make coffee and drinks, when Target are lack of cashier for busy hours, they pulled us to the front lane to help them."
good,"A typical day at work would depend on how busy the store was."
good,I worked in the food court the Manger never worked she was always at Starbucks or doing something else. They never hired enough people for the food court.
good,Overall Target was not a bad place to work. The pay just was not enough for the cost of living in my area.  The 10% discount  was also a plus but it just wasn't enough.
good,I learned how to do returns at Target and how to over see the help desk and deli of Target I also learned that not every one is considered for advancement as others
good,I would not work there again it was stressful not being able to make ends meat. It would however be a great job for college students or some one who just wants to get out of the house.
good,Working in retail you have alot to deal with from customers to the employees so you just have to learn to deal with all of it when your there plus the short hours and low pay
good,"Have different  events to go to with your coworkers . Fun activitys , they provide u with free ice cream day ,in the summer time the do cookouts , have game day."
good,"Your typical retail chain, customers can be annoying sometimes but usually are fine, some bosses are a bit uptight about stuff but it's fairly relaxed and upbeat in general."
good,"the overall experience of working at target, was moderate. the management was poor, when i had questions it seems as if they just brushed me off and expected me to know everything."
good,"I liked working at Target. I started right before the holiday season. I learned how to stock the shelves, set up different displays and run the cash register."
good,Working at target was overall enjoyable and fast paced. Team work is  well implemented as well as safety. The pay is decent but the work scheduling can be all over the place.
good,"Working at Target was pretty fun, unless you talked to management. The employees were fun to be around and everyone was usually pretty helpful. Working guest service was the best part because you could help people and be relied on, but other than that, management sucks. A lot of people I know, left because of it."
good,"The day started with a task list for each day."
good,"a typical work day for cart attendant would be stressful."
good,"This was a seasonal position with options to be hired full time, however, that decision was left to the manager you were working for and if you were not one of those that seemed to be friends with your manager, you were not kept after the season.  It did not matter that I was always there, on time, and never left early."
good,"the most enjoyable part of my job was working with great people"
good,Target was a good experience management was good and fair. Made a lot of good friends. I gained a lot of experience there. It was one of my first jobs.
good,"Decent company to work for. Learned a lot. Culture is ok, worked a lot, long hours, paid decent, management is very junior. Associates are awesome to work with."
good,"ive been on and off with target for a while. its a good company overall to work with, although the management is constantly changing. sometimes people dont see quite eye to eye with one another, which of course, makes some days more difficult that others. i enjoyed my run with target until recently, i had some medical issues and i could not receive the time off that was required. it made it difficult for me to heal properly so i, unfortunately, had to begin looking elsewhere for employment, "
good,"I am glad that I had an opportunity to work at Target headquarters. My experience was challenging because it was my first job after being somewhere for over 10 years, so transitioning into the TGT culture was somewhat challenging. Generally, the people are nice."
good,"Management could have been better.  A lot could have changed in the past 3 years but benefits were decent.  If you have young kids at home, working the overnight shift was perfect"
good,"Like I said before, Target is a good place to work as an extra job. I sometimes only get scheduled 16 hrs per week and have to ask full timers if they would give me a day."
good,"This is a company that will not work with any conflicting schedules. Unless you are close friends with your boss, you will be stuck with a poor schedule and tedious, daunting work duties."
good,working at target was  experience a true test of ones self control the guest were great it was the staff they would do thing to get to u and the head of HR was the worst you could never get anything resolved
good,The work was simple but always there. The management system was setup very well. There was alot of room to grow with the company. The job was alot of walking.
good,Team leads fail to communicate to other team leads and team members. Learn new things. Helping customers is rewarding. Setting for holidays is sometimes fun.
good,"Friendly management. But slow or no advancement if you were female. Nothing obvious. But if you paid attention, you could see it. Almost as if managers were afraid of offending women by giving them more to do."
good,Most days are a rat race to get things done and as members of the Target workforce we get pulled away constantly from the tasks we're expected to complete by our own higher ups and then they angrily ask us why we didn't finish our task.
good,its a fun young place to work. make a lot of friends but it can be a hectic place to work at. they expect a lot from you which not really worth the pay. eventually have to move on.
good,"decent place to work, great benefits. retail hours are the only thing that I dont like about the job. The customers were the best part of the experience will make great friends"
good,The culture of target is fun to work in. Also their system for stocking is easy to follow and helps you find where items need to go. When I worked there stocking wasnt done overnight but in the mornings.
good,"good place to work but there is too much change going on at the same time. Overall, had a great experience. Leaders really care about your development."
good,I worked there many years ago but it was an easy job. They appreciated the staff pretty well. They're strict about your attendance. The pay was pretty good back in 2010
good,"Good job, however, be ready for things to change constantly. The benefits offered by the company have been reduced over the years. Pay is getting more competitive but way to slow compared to other companies. There is a fair share of politics involved with being successful. Retail is a rough enviornment."
good,"Was a fun, fast-paced, friendly place to work, got to meet different customers as i got to bag their items. Was a great place to get more smiles out of nice people."
good,If your looking for a good first job. The pay is okay for a teen that just needs some side money. The work is not hard to do. The hours are not very consistent but not to bad.
good,While working at Target a learned many things about customer service and making sure the customer is happy. My coworkers were nice and helpful when it came to things I needed to learn about.
good,"It is a good job if you are going to school too but not a forever job. The discounts they give you are pretty good, like the 10% off on everything and 25% off on workout clothes and veggies. not bad !"
good,"Overall, target is a good place to work, provided you are fine with stressful work, little time off your feet, and basically no job security. The pay's good though!"
good,the job was good dont get me wrong its just retail was not for me but all in all the training and received is one i will carry with me to future jobs so remember FIFO
good,"Over all, I enjoyed working at Target. We had a good group of team members. Management was fair and treated all employees with respect.They gave me the opportunity for advancement."
good,"I worked overnight here, the store was always a mess even with their cleaning crew attending during the day. The team leads were awesome but the coworkers were rude."
good,"Target had begun working on a pilot for a new operating system where the entirety of work and focus was on the customer (""guest,"" as they call them). The focus shift left the employees in the dust of the customers, as the schedules and positions where largely changed to have as many employees on the floor at the same time as the heaviest customer traffic; this made positions like stocking and presentation/planogram difficult, as they require a decent amount of space, which gets in the customers' way, as well as vice versa. The schedule changes were abrupt and impactful, with shifts like 06:00 to 14:30 (which gave parents the ability to get their children from school and spend the evening with them, as well as the ability to go to appointments) switching to 10:00 to 18:30. Switching from an early morning shift to a blocky midday shift made things difficult."
good,"Great upper management, with lots of room for advancement.  Great work life balance and company culture is what you would expect.  Compensation is better than most in industry."
good,"Wrok was crazy around the holidays, but my co-workers were friendly, and you got good deals on the products in the store. I was not at Target for to long, but i did enjoy getting to talk to new people every day."
good,Working at target is a great job for beginners and someone who who just wants to work for fun. They are a great company to work for and they treat their employees well.
good,The job was ok - The people were talented but didn't want to be challenged.  Most everyone I started with left with in the first 3 years.  A lot has changed since then.
good,"A great place to start your retail career. Very helpful managers,"
good,"Started working overnight while the store was going through a remodel and stayed after it was done. I was in the backroom and stocking shelves. Mostly clockwork, and it began to wear me down eventually. Easy job, but not challenging enough. People and management were great people and we were all treated fairly."
good,"Working for target was great the first time but the second time, it was horrible. Management kept changing so it was horrible. Hours weren't to bad but the pay was."
good,I think it was a good place to work.  I liked the fact that we got 2 rest breaks and a lunch break.  I did perform other duties like putting stock onto the floor and cleaning and arranging displays.
good,Job is pretty easy as long as everyone does there jobs. You unload the truck then everyone gets sent to their area. After that you go to your assigned area and stock the freight until you’re frieght from the truck is done. Managers pick and choose favorites so If you are on the managers favorite side you don’t have to work hard or go above and beyond because they will send the hard workers to help you finish. I know this because I get sent everywhere.
good,Not to bad of  job. They teach you how to work anywhere at the store. Hours go up and down depending on what time of the year it is. They are always changing how they want you to do things and how they run the store.
good,"As a Sales Floor Team Member in Hardlines, you are responsible for ensuring an exceptional guest experience in the areas of the store designated as Hardlines. It is your responsibility to ensure guests can find what they are looking for and that the areas maintain brand standards and are in-stock."
good,"Good place to gain work experience. fast paced, but organized work environment. Great teamwork. Fair supervisors. Pay should better reflect cost of living."
good,"Cool place to work for, can be a bit stressful during the holidays and sales promoting events. Some members of management do not need the title as manager because their work ethics suck."
good,"Overall it's not a bad place to work. Management may demand a lot out of you, but depending on where you work, you'll be on your own doing your own project, which is nice."
good,"It’s a cool place to work, but they take forever to do things. Such as cross training, or moving you to another department. They rarely move people up to higher positions unless you agree with everything they say. Then they more toy up very quickly."
good,"Working at Target was super stressful and certain accommodations that I needed were not available for me because they thought it would be ""making an unnecessary exception"" to accommodate. I disliked working at Target because certain people would be the cause of conflict within our team and H.R would not take action to resolve the issues."
good,"My day at the store was mostly zoning shelves. Making sure they were nice and neat. My department was luggage, purses, bathroom, shampoo, deodorant, paper towels, plastic ziploc bags, etc. That was about all that I did there."
good,"Target started out as a great job, but as time went on, there came a lot of office politics, higher-ups trying to take jobs from each other, etc. Started the day by unloading the truck, then sorting softlines, then stocking shelves to the end of my shift. Recently started back stocking as well."
good,Fun company to work for. Easy to make friends and management is easy to talk to. Getting time off or fixing schedule issues is not a problem. Can get stressful with customers.
good,"I am always fast fun and friendly but some of the newest are not and are all in a click and treat others poorly forgetting breaks and not even caring if you get your break, lunch or even last break I have went many shifts w/o my last break.  Karma to those who cannot be organized and give employees all breaks and lunches due to them"
good,"While working at Target is an enjoyable experience, trying to manage hours is a nightmare. Schedules either have not enough hours, or too many. Trying to take days off is a cluster, almost any request is either denied or rejected, and when trying to plead your case to get the day(s) off, you're told to find coverage yourself."
good,"Although target is easy to work for, they don’t give you proper training the more so just let you figure it out on your own. I enjoyed working there because the staff was friendly but the hours I was promised I never saw. The company as a whole is surprisingly very unorganized."
good,"For being a retail job, it's not the worst I've had. I worked in the back in the early mornings. Nice spot to work if you're not wanting front facing work. The warehouse work was busy, fast at times, but with a relaxed demeanor. The job is simple and a good way to gain experience. The working hours were the worst where you can start anywhere between 4 AM and 1 PM. The inconsistency killed me as you couldn't plan anything around such a chaotic schedule. Some did have regular schedules, so this would work if you had a second job or went to school. It was a decent job."
good,"I was hired and cross trained as an electronic sales associate and hardlines team member right off, but the pay did not reflect that in my opinion. I did not get the opportunity to experience a promotion."
good,"Overall I would have to say target is a great place to start off working. It’s a great vibe you just have to have patience,work ethic and  persuade people to sign up for the target red card and other things. You just have to be a hard worker and they will notice I would recommend this job to anyone"
good,Wonderful place to be if you're looking to get yourself ready for the workforce especially for high school students but overall i enjoyed being there for 4 years
good,"automation, customer service, packing, filling, insurance claims, assisting RPh, ordering through McKesson, worked varied shifts, stocking, compounding, etc"
good,"Store was kept clean"
good,"Depending on the time of year, this can be a slow-paced paradise or fast-paced nightmare. I worked in multiple areas and had to deal with incompetent co-workers, obsolete management and subpar pay. That being said, this company does seem to care about it's employees and offers various benefits like good employee discounts, paid time off, good working environment for all employees regardless of their position. Growth and advancement is definitely present but really congested and cutthroat, not really feasible unless education and social engineering come into play. All in all, a good, but not spectacular, place to work."
good,"Good benefits and pay, poor work life balance.  Don't pay part-time employees comparable to competitors. Stressful, heavy workload. Lack of upper management support."
good,"Generally the hours which my department worked were 6 A.M. - 2:30 P.M. Those hours are relatively nice for commuting, however we were often expected to come in earlier, roughly 4 A.M., to work certain shifts. The work itself was not particularly challenging, after a few days of training, anyone could perform the core function of my job position without any trouble. We rarely finished our workload since it was almost always too large, however the work itself can only be done so fast, and thus leaves a sense of futility."
good,"During my brief time there I had mentioned multiple times how new I was to retail and was promised understanding and flexibility if any mistakes were made (accidental of course). Unfortunately none of the upper management took this into consideration when evaluating me during my probationary period. And though the mistakes I have made were never repeated (thanks to the advice of the electronics lead), they still decided to terminate my position."
good,Make sure that the front end is not with long lines help any customer if they need to find something that they haven't found always be ready to cash out customers if not busy
good,"It is an easy job if you’re just a regular team member. If you aren’t, you are given so much responsibility with no support when needed. The management lacks leadership. They have no clue on how to manage a team or support critical areas."
good,If you have a busy life and dont really need the money or its extra money or you are a student its a great place with its hours. Care about your family life.
good,Overall I'd say that Target was a decent place to work at. The retail environment proved to be stressful at times but the employees I got to work with made up for that.
good,"My primary hours of work were from 4 AM to 10 AM. The work was tough and could be stressful, but team leads treated us fairly and always listened to our concerns and worked to fix them."
good,We came in at 6 a.m. We unloaded the truck/trucks. We stocked the shelves with the merchandise from the trucks and we left whenever the truck was done. No matter how big or small.
good,If this is your think it's good. They have a lot of good employee benefits. They really take care of people. They have partner benefits. Their cafeteria in the corporate office is delicious. This just wasn't for me.
good,manager at the target I worked at was rude I couldn't get hours to save my life only 4 hour shifts 3 times a week you cant live off that. at least I cant
good,"I love the Target company as a whole, their stance on LGBTQ Rights are amazing, along with their diverse style of going gender neutral in the toy section, but the individual stores are not ran as well as the company. My STL was promoted from HR without any backroom experience but dictated everything even if it was not the most efficient. The ETL's had their own clique and bend the knee to the STL even if in private they did not agree with the STLs choices. Now, the HR ETL was amazing. - The job itself was okay, target distribution center needs to update how they load trucks, they should put them on skids organized by section instead of just throwing all items lonely on an 18-wheeler. With budget / employee hours ratio makes every second count and unloading and sorting the truck is too time consuming. As for the hour/budget ratio it is off, as a TL you are never given enough hours to complete the job with your team. The ETL's schedule the Truck Team at 4hrs per person per shift but TL's are told to go and ask most people to stay longer. This does not allow for a good work/home life balance because you can't schedule your live away from Target accordingly.  All these issues are not universal at all Targets retail stores but this was my experience at the store i worked at. I enjoyed my job, and love the company but the management situation and the hour/budget issues are why i left."
good,Good job to start off with. Must have patients since it is a retail job. I learned how to work as a team while working there as well as how to treat guest properly.
good,"Grate place to work. Very busy grate pay. Working there was a great experience. I wish I could of went back, really miss working there very much. I am not sure what Elyse to talking abut on there."
good,The typical day at work was pretty much the same everyday and nothing extremely difficult. The helped to learn basic tasks as well as how to better deal with customers and other associates. The management seemed a bit to be desired in regards to understanding schedules and overall helpfulness.
good,Summer Job while going to school. Not much else to say. Typical day was setting up floor plans before the store opened to the public. Overnight shift was interesting.
good,they make it no shy show when it comes to making their employees feel appreciated and cared for they will buy target brand snacks to support the team throughout the week in case someone could be frugal or just left there wallet at home.
good,This company has been through so many changes that they have lost their identity as to what worked and what didn't. They still have not hit Walmart levels of issues but they are heading that way.
good,I personally wouldn't recommend Target as a company to work for unless you are planning to go into management. Target is one of those company's where you have a Bachelors degree and plan on being in Human Resources or any type of high leadership for a company.
good,open up the boxes from the truck then stock them on shelves. Always greet the customers when they come in and see if the need help with finding anything.
good,"A fast paced, retail position. I follow guides to make the store set to corporate standard. It pays off to be prepared for anything because it’s never the same day twice."
good,Target goes by saying Fast Fun friendly we take care of our guess we work efficiently we make sure I guess as well taken care of and we make sure they have a great experience shopping at Target
good,"When I first started at Target, the job was great. But over time and several management changes, it became a horrible place. Team members are usually great to work with, management can be good/bad but changes often."
good,Was ok to work there but would be nice to get more better pay and hours. They only working on Monday wednsday and Fridays by 11am. or 12pm done for each day. not much money there at all.
good,"I was usually happy and smiling to my guests daily,  I had learned so many new features of drink and seasonal drinks.  The management was okay and neat.  Workplace culture was pretty steady and diversity.  The hardest part of the job that I communicate with people because I am deaf employer.  The most enjoyable part of the job that I had a great team."
good,"Moves very fast, repetitive work but always something to do. Management willing to recognize work and allow for growth permitting the worker can excel."
good,"My job was to unload tractor trailers and picker and packer"
good,while I was there it was a fine place to work. I had plenty of co workers I could count on for help if needed.  I still go see some of them from time to time.
good,If they consistently gave 32 to 35 hours it would be better. But many times there are weeks when you get 15 hours. People who have a family find it difficult. This is a job more for students because the hours they give are perfect for them.
good,"Easy job meet different people gave me the opportunity to learn the ends and out of how to pull orders. Decent and helpful management, had decent work hours."
good,I worked there for a seasonal postition hoping they would keep me but it never happened which I can’t be mad because I kinda already figured but they pay was great
good,Worked 3 12 hour shifts work at a good pace unsupervised outbound is very stressful inbound is Ok work as a team stock select work at your own pace replacement can be fast paced
good,"Working during seasonal term means having to work shifts with breaks and lunch back to back. Schedule is scattered, does not make sense. If the company likes the employee they'll keep them, if not you are out of the job once the season is done with. Company keeps only two employees out twenty of the part time employees. Offers a 5% discount to employees."
good,I don't and won't hate working for Target. It depends on the store you're at. My Starbucks TL was amazing! But i can't say that about the others. The hours is what sucks
good,A great place to work for they make it a fun place to work for and they will move you up fast when you want to if your a good worker a growing place to work at.
good,"This job was a true definition to your first real taste of the work force. I would come in at 5 am, I would stock items in the cleaning section first, then make my way over to the toy section, then the home furniture section would be the third and final section. It would last from 5 am to 10 am. The job was fast paced and since it was my first job I worked at a slower pace than my co-workers who have had more experience in that field. But, I buckled down and tried to get better as the summer moved on. Overall it was a learning experience that showed me what fast paced jobs are really like."
good,"When I first started, it was a fast paced process where you worked hard to get the job done. The team leads overlooking the flow process were competent and clearly knew what they were doing and what improvements needed to be made."
good,"great benefits, hot in summer, cold in winter. Don't always promote from within. Enjoyed the travel. Worked with some great people, and a few not so great."
good,Target is a good first job with plenty flexibility. Everyone is super helpful and willing to train in all departments.  Many flexible hours to choose from
good,Target was a good company to work but the pay was low and hours are extremely part time. I would recommend this company as a first job opportunity or to a student.
good,This is not right. I worked there. It's just a job. It's inappropriate to talk about them here. It was a job that I needed at the time. It's not appropriate to talk about it now.
good,"While it's not my life's dream to be a Target employee, it's not the worst place to work while I search for my dream job. Target's flexible hours make it easy to be available for interviews."
good,"working within a team oriented environment. Daily operations included guest service, stocking shelves, unloading truck. build new planograms. monthly lead meetings about scheduling, sales, upcoming events,"
good,While working at Target I tried to express my experience with a manager who treated me unfairly but nothing was resolved. I would have appreciated a meeting to resolve the issue at hand.
good,a lot to do if you into corporate jobs. I was let go because my brother worked under me. I worked HR which was a great position the pay was ok the hours were good and i could get more hours if need be
good,"Was a good place to work the pay wasn’t to good for what they had you doing but a job is a job , I like more hands on and more fast pace. But over all a good place to work"
good,I would hope getting to the hiring person they would see in person the kind of employee. I would be.call me I waiting. .you would be getting the best of the best
good,"Good Place to work, nice and friendly staff, vacations paid and holidays off. Hours were OK depending on the shift that you would work. Liked all the job perks and benefits."
good,I liked working at target. They just dont have the hours. It is a good first time job for any one who is looking. You just gatta look in the right place.
good,"It's a fun work environment there is always something to do. Always making sure your keeping busy. Fun people to work with, the customers were great.."
good,"The co-workers that I did get a chance to meet were friendly. The management was ok. The workplace was friendly and casual. As a new hire, I wasn't given very many hours, so it really wasn't worth the cost of gas to travel over there."
good,great for first time job. it has set schedules that fluctuate between part time and full time. offers health insurance if full time. earn suck time and paid vacation.
good,workplace was fine employees nice. never had benefits was a great first job met a lot of people new faces good holiday job very busy I have nothing else to say
good,"Didn't work there that long so I don't have the experience to actually give a good review of the work place. Nevertheless, it is a good paying job and environment but it wasn't right for me at the time."
good,Great place to be mentored by someone close to you and develop and grow to achieve higher goals.  Teams are fun to work with and every day offers a new experience.
good,"I started here working just 16 hours per week on average. I moved positions within three months. I moved around a lot and learned a lot. I was a favorite employee of management. I won several awards for my work, and safety. However, when it came to moving into management, Target seems to favor the younger people. Fresh out of college. There were numerous promotions and turn around for management. If you are young and pretty then you have a real shot here. "
good,I wasn’t here at Target for long because  it was a seasonal position during the Holidays. I will say that it was hectic at times with such a huge rush of people but the day goes by so fast!
good,"Worked here through college, flexible hours. Its a retail job, so there is nothing too special about it. I have been there for about two years now.///"
good,"This was program offered by the goodwill"
good,"Not very organized. Leaders were leaving left and right. Corporate only gave us so many hours and management never distributed them properly. Good people, but stressful work environment. Only so much you can do in your position."
good,"a typical day at work was nice. I had a good work environment along with good team members I could rely on. I learned how to be more forward and outspoken, and I learned how to problem solve. The management was good, they were always there to help with any questions I had and always told me to provide great excellence service. The hardest part of the job for me was maybe having to tell guest that since that target I worked for is smaller that were different so the same rules didn't always apply for us. The most enjoyable part of the job was being with my coworkers and knowing they were there to help me with anything."
good,"My experiences as a cashier and guest services representative are as expected; it's not the most glamorous job but it's straightforward and manageable. The work days are just as good as the people you encounter, though I'm glad to say most problems or people I come across are easy to pacify. My favorite part about working there is the community between the coworkers. I had a house fire and my boss rallied everyone together to get me and my family some basic necessities. I was really touched by the extra mile everyone went for us. If you're just trying to boost your work experience and make a little cash then Target is an excellent place to accomplish that. If you have an open mind and exhibit kindness with the people around you then you may make some good friends and have that kindness paid back tenfold."
good,Target was a good job when I first started but once they change the manager which they finally don't have anymore things started to go down hill. Everyone hated to be there we were only there to pay our bills. It might have improve since he left but I don't even shop there anymore since I left.
good,"Friendly environment (barring some very rude people within management) but fails to acknowledge the limitations of the human body. Breaks are decent, at least."
good,i worked cashier stock i also ran food ave worked all holidays when needed done ordeing when needed and help out in many department when needed and help with managment.
good,"Typical old school corporation where productivity is always #1 but they won’t fire you for being unproductive because they would have to pay unemployment to that person (Google the unemployment laws). Productivity is based on an algorithm and not how much you do. You could work fast for a few minutes, log out of your scanner for an hour and do nothing; and your productivity will be better than someone who is working longer and harder but forgot to log out of their scanner when they are “idle” (in terms of work that can be tracked) because they are doing other work that can’t be tracked (moving inventory, looking for items, moving totes and boxes, etc) ; and also trying to pick up the slack of those who “cheat the system”. This creates a poor work environment where many people only look out for themselves. There are those who help other team members out but Target has created its own “every person for themselves” culture in more ways than one."
good,"I started working for Target as a team member and was promoted regularly over the next 5 years. The culture at Target has shifted away from fun and friendly to being far more goal oriented and does nothing to help employee satisfaction. The expectation set are somewhat unreasonable and good, workable solutions were not provided by upper management."
good,"Management was incredibly unprofessional and often talked behind coworker's backs instead of addressing the problems with said person. In my opinion, this is very unprofessional."
good,Target is a good job for a person who's in school and or a side job. Working seasonal they will give you a lot of hours due to the holidays. But the management wasn't too hot depending where you work.
good,"Target was an okay place to work, especially if you need a part-time job. Not much to truly be said about Target that you can't say about other supermarkets."
good,I had a negative experiance with Target as far as management and scheduling. I am huge on having a work/life balance and that is just something Target did not provide
good,"This place is fast paced, active and busy.  Always something to do.  There are very few minorities in supervisory/management positions.  This place could use some diversity training."
good,Produce and Meat sections are combined. Target's food standards are extremely strict. A lot of food is thrown out almost daily. Could possibly look into donating.
good,a typical day includes unloading truck pushing product back stocking product then switching to presentation to set new pogs then push the new items to the floor. pay and advancement is not the best
good,"We learn to work in all of the different area of work that the company"
good,It was a more slow paced job but the people were great and friendly. More of an at your pace job experience but still there was a lot that needed to be done.
good,"When working here, we were able to get the red card. This is something I suggest everyone get. Working with customers was beneficial to my overall growth."
good,"I don,t have much to say about target. It was a good place to work but people came and went often. Besides that its a good workplace for anyone really even as a part time job."
good,"At first it seemed like a good job, higher pay than most despite a few less hours, coworkers seemed fine. But after learning of management styles my opinion completely changed, they’re rude a"
good,"It's been 10 yrs since I worked on the Flow Team at Target. It was the early morning shift, and was a physical job. I personally enjoyed stocking shelves along with my teammates. Not getting consistent hours and the pay/benefits was the worst thing for me. If you're just looking for part time work and some extra cash I'd recommend Target."
good,While at Target I was compensated well. There was poor management and I am looking for a place to work we’re I can grow and advance my skills. My Experience as a target employee was bitter Sweet. Target helped me add a lot of work experience under my belt.
good,I wasn't trained when I started at Target. They put me on the register alone. Later I was asked if I could work the night shift.   I agreed but I was never paid for it.
good,"Enjoyed working with the public, Too much volume for one person. Enjoyed setting and displaying merchandise. Liked doing plan o grams. Complimenting  and assisting customers decisions on apparel (fitting room service)."
good,I worked there so long ago I don't really remember how it compared to other entry level positions at the time. I think now they pay their employees quite well.
good,Target is the type of store that is great to shop at but a pain to work at. If you are one of the early morning stockers that bring things out onto the floor before store opening the supervisors get onto you over every little thing. I get that the store has to look great but when you have a whole truck to unload by a certain time there will always be time to go back and fix it.
good,"I would work in Soft lines which is all the clothing, shoes, and baby stuff. Customers would constantly leave displays a mess so it would be never ending."
good,"Good starter job. You will get more hours, if you show dedication, maturity and have as flexible a schedule as possible. Also a good part time job for someone looking to supplement their full time income."
good,working for the target corporation was ok at first. then my hours started to slack and it was becoming hard for me to pay my bills. other than that i liked everyone thier.
good,nice environment to work in but does not offer full time positions. not a place for someone looking to work 40 hours a week. other than that I would recommend.
good,Productive and fun learned new skills such as management skills. A typical work day can actual be what you make it the vibe is based on you. The target team will make you feel very comfortable.
good,Target Express were bought out by City Link in 2006. City Link then found themselves in financial difficulty roughly a year later. Within 18 months of that City Link went into insolvency and subsequently closed down.
good,"It was a great place to work. Perfect job for a college student or people who need a job that works with their schedule. Also if you work in multiple areas of the store, that means you will get more hours which means more money!"
good,I was at Target for over a year and it was a cool experience. When I first started it kinda seemed hectic but it’s retail. I was almost going to quit six months in because there were be nearly any help during the weekends when it got most busy and I started to have anxiety attacks about going to work. But things got better once I talked to management. Overall it was a good job and you get to work with a lot chill and cool people and especially the fine women that came in the store everyday lol. Not the kind of job if you want real money and benefits. Would recommend this job to anyone especially if ur a college or high school student.
good,"I wasn't a big fan at working at target. feel like people would make it too personal and or cause too many problems, I feel like people who were liked there honestly got more hours then those who they talked about. I just feel like it was a problematic job."
good,"It was a ok job. I really wouldnt recommend if you are trying to save for something, or if you have a family to depending on you. It’s really not worth it."
good,"target is an okay job. You think you’ll love working there, but in reality you wouldn’t. I was part time and working full time hours. The HR MANAGER basically thought she was the store manager, and the policies their sucked. If you want a normal life outside of target then don’t apply bc you definitely will be spending your entire life there. Lunches are 30 mins as well working over 8 hrs. Oh yeah please remember to call your customers GUEST, they’ll be sure to remind u of it!!!"
good,When I first started a great place to work and many benefits.  My last years there got more stressful and the benefits were not as good anymore due to volume going up.  Other than that if you do Warehouse work great pay.
good,"During your 90 day probation period, you are watched very closely.  Taking off for a Dr appt is frowned upon. If you have to leave early for that appt, even after working 80% of your shift, you were considered absent. Only 20-25 hours available weekly."
good,"Nice place to work, but very stressful. Lot of stress put on cashiers to get redcards. Does not give enough hours. Other than that not a bad place to work."
good,"Target was an alright work place, different shift leaders every shift, inconsistency with work hours, short work days. Target was not helpful with making the schedule you never knew when you’d have to work"
good,Non traditional work hours with some shifts during the week T-FR and other shifts during the weekend S-M.  Does allow for freedom with schedule but very demanding.
good,So long as you are doing your job efficiently the management is rather casual and easy going. They are also very understanding when it comes to absences due to life events.
good,I enjoyed interacting with every customer I liked having a job that was fast-paced and being able to think quickly on my feet. Everyday there was some new challenges about the job that I enjoyed.
good,Target paid great for my area and for a production job. I didnt like the changing start times and the management proved to be shaky. Decent job but will leave you tired at the end of the day unless you drive a forklift.
good,"Managers are easy to get along with at the store level and you are empowered to run  your  area or do what is right for a customer. The schedule can be random and inconvenient, they want to be staffed when most people are shopping. Most of what I do as a leader is the same as what the people report to me do. There will be days when you are stocking shelves non stop, cashiering for hours, or getting carts. Lots of customer service so be prepared to fake being nice to people."
good,"That job was okay. Excellent co-workers, you’ll love them. Good perks and benefits. Management is a bit poor at times. Good decent hour, good pay too."
good,It was a tough place to work with long hours if you were on the closing team. I learned to have great organizational skills using one of their training matrix.
good,"okay place to work for minimum wage."
good,"Cool, job that pays a fair amount. I dont even know why I have to type a review I feel like this is just wasting my time. Target is a job and that's it"
good,Target was a overall good place to work. They give raises regularly. Their team cares about their staff. Cashiers do not get alot of hours so I worked in starbucks alongside target.
good,"Hours were odd, People I worked with were quiet rude towards me because of my age. the boss was rather rude and didnt listen to our complaints all too well."
good,Team members are not properly educated about their rights and flexibility is abused. Team members are given unrealistic time lines to meet and are held accountable for not meeting them.
good,The job itself was fun and fast paced. The management at this location was subpar. Old management was personable and cared about the employees and made it a much better work environment.  The company itself is wonderful.
good,"Grateful for the time I worked there. I wanted to change my path, people are great but with time management isn’t great as it used to. But I hope they improve."
good,"As a Target Protection Specialist, I was responsible for installing, troubleshooting, and monitoring security cameras. I was responsible for the safety of the guests, employees, as well as preventing theft. During my time at Target, I was recognized by the District's head office for leading the district in merchandise recoveries, and for filing the most known theft reports. In the short time I was lined up for promotion and was placed in a leadership position training new employees."
good,"21 years in retail. I am done!"
good,Managment can be pretty uptight. You do something different every day. Holidays can get stressful. Everyone is pretty cool off the clock. I dont recommend staying for a long time because you'll get stuck with a more responsibility with same pay and role.
good,"It's a typical starting job.  Lots of customer service and cleaning up.  Management was alright, but they liked to play favorites, which led to divisiveness."
good,"target will always have meeting to make the enviroment  better at work . and they will always make sure we always satify the customers , also target will always reward us if we come in early not miss any days ,"
good,I did not really like working there. Most of the employees were extremely lazy and were not expected to do anything but the bare minimum. And the pay was less than it should have been.
good,Okay work but definitely not my most favorable. All in all if asked to work here again I would never. Pay was okay but this job is just not for me. The way things were ran and all.
good,"Same as most places, routine.  Work may be at times physically challenging but does not require a great deal of mental effort.  The end of the workday is most enjoyable part of the day"
good,It depend of what area of the store you are sign to but there will be a communication issues due to the lack of communication you are getting form the top.
good,"This is a store where you can learn to work as a team, help others, learn many roles, but never get compensated for the work you do properly. Never forget they can always replace you with another high school kid for minimum wage. They will not care how much you do or how well you do it. Learning another position will not have you earn more but just earn the ability to work more for the same rate. ALL positions are Part-time except for the about 5 managers the store has. ALL POSITIONS. Even if you work full time hours for months you can always expect that one day you'll come in and your hours well be halved or worse."
good,"Low pay, very few benefits, scheduling is very variable and unpredictable. It is very difficult to get full time and it is hard to make a schedule in advance."
good,"I enjoyed meeting new people, I had to gather carts, some times it was hard, if you had to many, tho it was alright in the summer, once it became winter it wasn't as easy to push them on the ice and in the snow."
good,"My job at Target was my very first employment experience and when I started there everything was great, despite having a relatively small backroom team we always managed to get everything done and my main team leader was amazing and always fought and stuck his neck out for his team members, ensuring that we had the best work experience possible. However, after some management changes things went downhill and the backroom just became an inefficient and stressful work environment."
good,A typical day is dealing with Guest service and dealing with customers about their returns such as there problems they have had. I did learn a lot here at target i learned how to talk to people more professionaly and deal with problems such as problem solving for the customers. The management was not that good here its everywhere and kind of give you the run around.
good,"At the start this was a great place to work, great management and great hours but over the past year everything has just been going downhill and i need to get out."
good,Cashiering and asking if people would like to sign up for a Redcard is a typical cashier shift. Management is pretty good. Very integrated workplace. Unruly Guests. My favorite part of the job is my customers.
good,"I enjoyed my time most when i was able to work alone and get stuff done on time, but we were too understaffed and i was called way too many times to do other peoples work who should've been finished."
good,"Loved the company and people I worked with. Unfortunately the hours and pay weren't enough to pay my bills. It's a great job for high school students,  college students and  people needing extra income."
good,"Always had something to work on, learned how to navigate difficult customer service situations, worked the register with notable speed and efficiency."
good,"After working at 5 different stores in 4 different cities, you take the good with the bad. It's retail. My first 4 stores were good to great. My last store left a bad taste in my mouth, not a great environment. Definitely had to leave."
good,target is not rhe place to work if your in school or it might depend on the target but the one i worked at never wanted to work around my school schedule at all
good,"made me work a 10 hour day with only 1 30 min break, longs days, stressful, never felt apart of the team, got yelled at a lot, have little consideration for people with mental heath issues."
good,The customers and managers can be rude. It can be a friendly environment sometimes. You stand on your feet so long. Team leaders forget to give you a break sometimes.
good,You're trained on whichever department you interview for. You don't need prior experience. This isn't a job for someone who needs to pay bills and a daycare. You'll never make enough to advance. If you're a teenager with no responsibilities then this would be a perfect company for you.
good,"The never told you what you were doing well only what you did wrong. The"
good,daily duties pretty much stay the same 
good,"I overall enjoyed my time working for target but I found myself work long and hard for recognition but failed to recite it. Though I was only seasonal, I was performing on par if not better than the full time workers there."
good,"I worked at Target when the red card was first being rolled out.  Cashiers were required to push the card and were punished with reduced hours if not enough customers signed up.  Of course this was followed by the credit card spillage and customers were even more reluctant to sign up, yet I was still docked hours because of it.  Not cool."
good,"During the season work period things can get a little hectic. We all pretty much work in a team setting to get the job done and to provide great customer service. However, the pay is not sufficient."
good,"Fun experience would recommend if you are not concerned with longevity. They do not promote from within, no matter what the handbook says. Hard to get fired, just show up and don't steal."
good,but working there took the fun out of shopping there. plus i worked full time hours along with my full time job. i was so busy. it wasnt fun. at all. but i had money.
good,"If you're part-time, expect to have a 30 hour work week even if you have school. Their definition of ""part time"" is straight-up ""you're not working, you don't get paid""."
good,Nice place to work st. Enjoyed meeting and helping customers. Great coworkers. Nice environment to work in. Managers were great to work with. Enjoyed working there.
good,"Overtime is available for some positions but frowned upon heavily for others to the point of backlash, you receive decent pay and good breaks but the management is ultimately what makes you wanna stay or not and at the South Philly location they were terrible"
good,"In the back room, products always came in from trucks and things had to be organized. On days trucks didn't arrive, it was the best time to catch up on organizing the backroom and that was the importance of the job."
good,"Target is a great company to work for right out of school. "
good,"I would get materials for the press operators and move product to staging area."
good,typical day starts at sometimes 4am or 6am depending on what are workload is for that week. end times are between 230 to 3pm. Management I hardly see around. they kind of do there own thing and as for the store manager only see him maybe once or twice a week. workplace culture is good. hardest part of my job is the big workloads we get especially during holidays. lots of heavy lifting and stocking and cleaning. most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers they make the days fun.
good,Working in retail is never a walk in the park but target makes it bearable. It is not 100% for me as to why I work logistics and not sales floor. As a team lead you tend to work harder then what is advertised.
good,I only worked there for a couple months so it’s not that much I can say. & it was about 4 years ago so with that being said can’t recall too much. But from what I do remember it  was cool.
good,I like target but I know once remodel is over the hours will stop I might get 8 hours a week but other than that i like the job and would recommend it to new people or people that just need something quick
good,"If you are a business or sales-oriented person then you might love it here, but if you are expecting to rise up in the ranks you might come to despise it. Most of the time coworkers and guests are friendly, but upper store management seems to be disconnected or outright aloof to the needs of their workers. "
good,"My employment at Target was brief, but I had mixed feelings about my time there. My day was good or bad depending on what management was present, them being either nitpicky or relaxed. I even heard from one of the coworkers that a manager had verbally harassed someone, using foul language and being outright insulting of their work."
good,"Target wasn't terrible, you get the normal experience of a retail job. Though management could have been better. You never know the days you work until much later.So making plans in life outside of work was hard. It took a lot of time away from life outside of work."
good,"Target is okay for a first out of highschool job, but I would definitely not recommend it as an only career move. It tires you out too much after a while of working weeks in a row in different areas."
good,"The most difficult part of the job was balancing the company policy of being ""clean, fast, and friendly"" while at the same time repeatedly asking if they wanted a target red card."
good,"The team of individuals both in management and staff were some of the best people to work with. As always there were never enough hours of work, even when it was requested."
good,"For my first six months working at Target, it was a great job. I was paid well, I worked a ton of hours, there was great camaraderie between my fellow coworkers and I. I felt as though the communication between myself and my superiors was reasonably good, and everything from training to work shift scheduling was spelled out fairly well. "
good,"Typical day, walk in, go to the back, help scan product in or be in a receiving line by department, unload the truck, and stock shelves. If there was too much product for shelves, you took it back to the stock room."
good,I liked working there but it was very fast paced and hard to keep up. Systems were easy to learn but had many components. I would recommend it to a friend but would personally never work there again.
good,"working at target is a lot of fun if it's the right store. everyone i worked with was intelligent, capable and hard working which made the experience enjoyable"
good,"As a first job I cannot really complain. Getting to know the people I worked with was probably one of the most enjoyable things. Everyone was kind and we all helped each other out. I definitely learned quickly on the job, working the cash register and learning what to say to the customers. The manager was always super nice and willing to help. I was only a seasonal member of the team so my stay was not too long but it was enjoyable."
good,Unfair workplace no cooperation no compassion for others very rude workers in have no understanding of life they think you are they life and that is unfair situation for anyone
good,Team mates are great. Low hours make the hourly pay meaningless. Managers change often and some are not very experienced or realistic in their expectations.
good,"Overall Target is a great place to work. Typical retail environment situation, and work/life balance is abnormal and fluctuates dependent on the season."
good,"It seemed like a tidy and spacious environment. I had my own new desk, which consisted of a computer, a very comfortable chair, a stapler, lots of pens, a post tray and many other little gadgets that caught my eye. As I walked through my new workplace, I was quick to recognise, the very friendly working environment, and positive attitude of the workers employed there."
good,"Target is a nice play to work the pay is good it just that they dont give u guartneed hours, one i first started they put me in hba dept the mangers were shocked when i told them i did hba dept at walmart so this is going to be easy for me after then seen how good in fast i was the decided to put me on the unload team. I love working with my team members we work fast and smart to get the job done there are no hard parts to the job. Typical day for target is full of guest asking question, buying things, needing assistance carrying something outside its always a busy day for target."
good,"lots of stock to put on selves, helping a lot of customers, how to unload trucks and sort thru inventory, how to fill out paper work, managers where horrible, very fast pace, trying to keep up with the quota,"
good,My team was fun to work with and the people were unique and knowledgeable. The work atmosphere was always to work with a sense of urgency and to complete all tasks.
good,"If you like the busy retail environment, Target was the place to be. Clean workplace, always something do to keep busy, different job tasks for different shifts, business varied through the year depending on seasons."
good,they have good thing for all people they make them feel welcome and they are friend to whatever they want when they need something the people are nice
good,"Fast, Fun & Friendly...Sharping my team building skills;a fast pace work environment and a lot of hard work. I enjoy meeting new people, that's the best part of my job."
good,"Great location in downtown Brooklyn, and fast-paced atmosphere. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and got to meet a diverse group of people and coworkers."
good,I liked this job cause it was a fast paste job. Everyone would get along it was fun unloading the trucks was nice. And the stoking was the best cause u put the merchandise in front of line and put it in
good,"Though I worked there a very long time ago, it was a good job.  Overnight stocking was very good exercise, and the people there were great.  Management on the overnight shifts was excellent and very supportive of the team."
good,"Handled all team member concerns, payroll and reports daily. I also helped on the salesfloor pushing stock, keeping up with all team member training , time off and vacation pay"
good,"The position that I work is very difficult to really enjoy since its early morning (4 am) and the amount of work you have to do, compared to how much time you have to do it is very inconsistent and impossible to do."
good,I need a job with more experience in the field I choose to have a career in. Target is good first job for someone who needs experience but unfortunately isn’t the place if you really want to push yourself and grow or find a career working at target
good,Team lifts were not team lifts you just had to lift it a throw it on the cart to be taken to the floor. Stuff was disorganized and stocked in the wrong places. The people and management were friendly but the job was unpleasant with hours and due to stuff being in the wrong places and done wrong.
good,"I can say that at the target I work at, there is an extreme lack of communication. The management expects a lot from you but hardly ever give any recognition. The management doesn't make it a priority to fix the many problems we have had in our department."
good,It was a very boring job and the heat in the building was almost unbearable. The managers were very caring and understanding and wanted nothing but the best for you.
good,workplace culture is for the most part pleasant though has its moments where it can be strained. people communicate and work well together at times though collides are bound to occur.
good,They cut your hours till you have no choice but to find another job and management doesn’t care they just say owell and hr tells you to find something on the side
good,"Enjoyed working her, there were many hours and but with limited opportunity to advance. Raises were at a minimum which was very disappointing with the quality of work I provided."
good,Needs progress in training employees. Great customer based store..is evolving with each community...needs better communication skills from managers to employees.
good,"Target is a solid company for individuals interested in a career in retail. One of the main issues with a career here, which is common among the retail industry, is a poor work to life balance."
good,Its just the job I have to have while looking for the one I want to have.  its fun and I love the people and the work is pretty easy and repetitive and the pay is good.
good,Too many managers and not enough staff.  If they restructured their management it would be a great place to work instead of feeling like you are doing your bosses job.
good,i really do want to write a review. all work places are good because it keep people from being homeless. I do not like the fact that when we are applying for another job that the survey comes up and does not let us contine until complete that is insane
good,Target was very demanding yet lacked in the ability to fully train employees. Accommodating to students and very easy to pick up extra hours. A wasteful organisation with a struggle to keep morale up.
good,Learned mostly about logistics and how things move around. Working with guests will be the majority of day. Team environment is amendment. Most enjoyable part is the culture. Most frustrating is the lack of cohesion.
good,"Not a terrible part time job.  You were constantly on your feet and moving which was nice.  Management was inconsistent, with some being great and some being awful.  Expectations were sometimes a little wonky, like expecting the same amount and quality of work to be done whether you worked a four hour shift or a six hour shift."
good,"I have worked for Target for five years and overall I will say that it is an amazing company to work for. The benefits are great, they have been flexible with my school schedule, and the starting pay is way above minimum wage."
good,I enjoyed working for Target it was just I wasn’t obtaining hours that I submitted on my application they wanted me to come in for like 5 hours for two days
good,This was just your ordinary mundane humdrum  routine retail job of greeting shoppers. This job was not mentally or physically challenging or rewarding.
good,You have alot of work you do gain experience doing different stuff if they decide to move you to another department no advanced unless you have a college degree
good,"A typical day at Target consists of finding out what needs to be worked on such as working out product to the floor or resetting an area to bring a fresh new look to it. Other than that though, you will be working alongside other team members that you will most definitely get along with and have your own Target family. You will learn about cash registers, your daily tasks, guest service and how to deliver exceptional guest service. Daily tasks consist of straightening up, pulling product from the back as well as putting it back, and setting new areas whether that be on the sales floor or clothing area. The hardest part of the job especially in a management position is how you will be seen as the bad guy when you have to be hard on the team to get their job done or if they do get it done ask them if they could do something different and better next time. But in the end, you’ll learn a lot about retail and how to treat people well when it comes to service and the whole team will be there for each other."
good,"Alot of management changes and inconsistency, Plans change at the drop of hat and so does priority which makes it difficult to execute daily duties,depending on your work area it is hard to take timely breaks"
good,Working at Target was interesting. There were so many different job roles and I was always meeting new people. Co workers for the most part were friendly.
good,It was an easy job. Of course like any other retail store it would get crowded but it wasn't anything the crew couldn't handle. Target is filled with employees who are active and who love what they do.
good,"Hours vary. People rarely get more than 25 hours a week, unless yiu go into management. Sometimes they will schedule people for 10 hours a week. The people are very nice where I work. Not all locations are the same."
good,Sometimes gets overwhelming win people don't show up to work. When there's a full team the truck process runs very smooth. Fun environment good coworkers
good,"I come in 7am in the morning, open self checkout area, clean the area as far putting up bags making sure are is clean and products are stocked and not expired, greeting guest when they enter the store and buy  their groceries"
good,Our GM was replaced. Unfortunately new management changed the workplace vibe and it just wasn't the same place anymore. Good employees started getting fired and we were all kept under a watchful eye.
good,"I worked there during high school and into college, pay was good but never gave enough hours, only was able to work in one spot even though you ask for other areas"
good,"I would order frozen food,stock,rotate, set up end caps, plans sales in my dept and train new employees. wrote evaluations for employees. and did all my own merchandising in frozen food"
good,"Target is a well known company & because of that, they make you feel like you matter.  Individual results may vary depending on store location & department but overall, a good place to work"
good,"Hours were very inconsistent. Almost random. Granted, I was a seasonal employee but was hired with goal of 30 to 40 hrs a week.  I averaged maybe 15.  And they kept hiring even tho there were not enough hrs to make the job worth while. "
good,"At the time, this was my dream job but I'm still an indecisive young adult. The interview process was extremely complicated (it took me 4 months to get the job). For the most part it was very slow paced but during the holiday season, it gets extremely stressful. They are very greedy with hours and only give full time employment to higher up employees or their favorites that work in the backroom. I worked in the cafe and all of the equipment was always breaking and orders never arrived on time. We'd go months without having certain things. Pay was very good but not worth staying."
good,"Target was a fun, fast, and friendly place to work. I appreciate my time there and gained lots of friendships that I still cherish to this day. Target is a great retailer and I enjoyed my time there."
good,"Working everyday was different you worked all over the store which was fun to do. You learned how to do different jobs there so you could be crossed trained to help out when needed. The culture is fast paced and customer driven, the hardest part is trying to get all the work done before your scheduled time which in some cases is hard to accomplish. the enjoyable part is the friends you make while working there and  of course all the new customers you get to help"
good,I worked there as a seasonal cashier and they didn't even teach me how to ring someone up on my first day they just threw me on a register. Management was okay but not very friendly and kind of unapproachable. The place is REALLY busy during the holidays which is good because time goes by fast but if you're new and don't know anything it makes it super stressful. People from all ages worked there.
good,I worked for Target Portraits Studio so I'm not sure how the actual store was. I didn't find my salary worth anything. But the studios are gone now anyway. Take with this what you will
good,I did my best and i believe every one tried their best. Target can get busy especially  during the holidays its full voltage people  expect you to do your job you cant be late .
good,"good place for employment, good co workers with amazing personalities, but stressful place to work at, and when something goes wrong everything else follows."
good,"Can be a fun place to work, but the hours are long and right now the company is trying to figure out its direction for the future.  The job is extremely physical, as well as mental."
good,I worked for Target for 7+ plus years. I started at the entry level and worked myself up to hourly supervisor. My work experience with the company was mostly positive.
good,"This was the big boxed store I've ever worked in. I find interesting how a store that sizes runs. How all the depts are run seperately but together. "
good,"The hours were mixed around, management was very obvious with favorites. rules were only strict when corporate came around. worst job ive ever had so far."
good,"Its very busy and the food court makes it smell very good. Management were great and stayed on top of things. The hardest part about this job was keeping the clothes neat and in order due to large crowds of people, but it got done in an orderly and timely manner."
good,"Good place to work while you're in school. Management can be rough. There is place to grow into management. Managers are paid very well. Overall, good place to work."
good,"The overnight managers were overly stressed, constantly yelling and ill-tempered. I'm sure it's not representative of ever branch but I did not relish my time at the Lynnwood location."
good,"Personally I did not like the vibe of working at target. In my area I was a minority and it was very uncomfortable. In my experience, the managers didn't really want to take the time to properly train employees to do their jobs."
good,Target let's you know what they want from you and what you need to get done. It is a very straightforward work experience. Working at target is fine but the hours aren't that great.
good,"great work placed with happy team mebers an team playes , always willing to help and help you exeede at work. defielently a place id recomend to have sombody work at"
good,My work hours was 4am-12pm or 2pm.  I use to do the Cash office for the building as well as oversee the pricing team. The job wasn't hard and the people were friendly.
good,Target was an overall good company to work for. My coworkers were team players and we did what we had to do in order to get our work done. There were no problems.
good,Very few hours but for a first job it was alright.  Would recommend it for a part time job as a second job or while attending school as i did. It was Alright
good,I only did my internship at target I wasn't a employee there . I had two different managers and one was very nice and the other one was ok. I enjoyed working there and I like the methods that they did but I like the hospital setting a lot better than retail.
good,I worked at the Starbucks in Target and it was fun and maybe stressful at times if you are left alone and the line starts to get long. It was a great learning experience for customer service.
good,"I have been working at Target Store since May 2012. I started with $ 8.75 per hour, and I have become 11.99 just this month after 6 years, and if any new person would get hired today, he will get $ 12 per hour in my same position, so I am really tired of working there any more...."
good,Decent environment when I shop at Target. I have never worked at this company. Seems like a great place! great renovations at Germantown. great items.
good,Laid back job. I started at 4am and finished around 8am when the building opens. Optional to stay late and help finish stocking and helping out with the back room.
good,I started working in 2010. For the first three years it was fast fun and friendly. But as the managers change the environment changed and day by day it became stressful in unbearable. I found myself depressed and tired of the same thing over and over again. I felt like my health was in jeopardy and I just needed somewhere else to go.
good,I didn't like working for target the management was always on my back and we're getting min wage but it was ok at the time not that many hours but worked five days a week
good,The managers range from people you appreciate to those you absolutely loathe. There's either a lot of standing or walking around. You will get tired of this job sooner or later. Not for the deeply introverted. Good social skills makes the job easier because customers head straight to you every 5 minutes or so.
good,The position I had at Target was in Asset Protection. My store was a bit laid back & everyone had fun while on the clock. The 20% discount for employees came in handy around Christmas.
good,"Target is cutting hours to make up for the $15/hour minimum by 2020.  I applaud the company for paying a livable (barely) wage, but we are now having to do twice the work!  Would love to see the CEO and higher ups take a bit of a pay cut to spread the wealth, or maybe use the millions in tax cut dollars.  Just a thought...."
good,this job is perfect for a student that wants to work part time for pocket cash while going to school. A typical day at work involves ringing up and assisting guests on a register. I learned a large amount of customer service skills. The management is strict so there are no misdemeanors with other coworkers at the job. The culture varies depending on what store you work at. The hardest part of the job may have to be the manual labor some people cant handle the heavy lifting and standing for hours at a time but the enjoyable part would be helping customers and ensuring they had a positive experience in the store.
good,"There is always something to do, fellow team members are great, not always enough hours. If you are not one of their favorites don't count on a lot of hours"
good,Very busy retail store. Your day will go very fast.Walking in to the building was always a pleasure. The employees always made you feel welcome and even loved.
good,Target is ok. Very difficult to get 40hrs a week no matter how many departments you could be trained in. People that worked and shopped there were nice
good,I was a seasonal worker and during that time it was fast pace you had to work together as a team and it was fun. I had multiple managers that I worked with and they were very good with the team.
good,"Target is very highbrow but also a fun environment, things can get pretty hectic but staff was plenty so backup filled in, the only thing not to my liking was how management handled certain situations, and some employees were very infantile."
good,the great job altogether only thing about this job is that theirs a lot that goes up in the weather and it comes the direction that they try to have you complete with
good,Target have keep there employees in good care but they don’t really care about what happened to there employees when they see that they don’t want them at all no more.
good,"environment is stressful, work hours are okay would not recommend as they are very harsh and do not work well with their employees. They dont really let you rest"
good,"its a calm environment from time to time, I learned a lot from using t-40 scanners, to learning how to use a forklift. the culture is acceptable, making friends at your job is the best way to have a good time at work."
good,moving boxes and stocking shelves is exactly what it sounds like. You are expected to work quickly and it can take a couple of days to learn the codes for sorting the line but thats really the only hard part of the job.
good,"A typical day at work was setting up isles for new merchandise, and helping customers.  I learned the importance of finishing the isle I started, if I didn't the stock pushers would mess it up.  The management was nice, always pushing a work together mentality.  People got along, but don't remember  a real culture in progress.  The hardest part of planogram was getting things done fast, they didn't always give us a lot of time to finish in a day.  I liked the teamwork we had in our team, we helped each other out."
good,"It was fun and I learned a lot about pricing and people. I enjoyed management they were nice and respectful. The work place culture was diverse. the part of the job i enjoyed the most was how busy it was, i was never bored or had nothing to do."
good,This place was ok but depends on which department your in. I started out in the receiving area and wasn't to bad as long as you had a good partner in your truck. After awhile there I moved to the warehouse department and this was a horrible move as it was a constant struggle.
good,Solid place to work if you are looking for retail job. Not a ton of advancements opportunities in the location I worked. Would recommend part time work for college students
good,"More of a stepping stone job, if anything. If you work there and like the culture then you can probably stick it out and become a manager. Otherwise you're better off looking for another job while you're working there."
good,It was an okay place to work. I worked there overnights for a summer in college while balancing classes during the day. My manager was often rude and demeaning.
good,They do not care about you. They do not care about your school hours. They will question you a million times about why you couldn´t come it when sick.
good,I was a backroom team member. Did the normal backroom team member duties. No problem with management. Good workplace culture. Not a difficult occupation.
good,i was very young and needed a job. they were more focused on how fast you can get the people out of there than giving people what they wanted and needed.
good,"I didn't work there long enough to give a good review."
good,"super belle experience en tant qu'etudiant, premiere experience et l'une des meilleurs"
good,we would clock in told which aisle we were stocking that day. team work was great and atmosphere was relaxed and everyone got along pretty good for the most part.
good,"Busy al the time you were at work.."
good,"I worked as a cashier for the Christmas rush. The pace was crazy busy, lots of lights were out at the check out. They tried to give everyone their breaks but did not always have it straight."
good,Great place to work. Enviroment is wonderful and most of managment is great. Pay is great since they raised it to $11/hour. Pretty good at qorking around school schedules.
good,Target is great company to work for. You meet different people everyday. The customers are very friendly. The employees are helpful and very understanding.
good,"Target is fast, fun and friendly place that does its best at trying to engage its team. The executive leadership lacks a relatable aspect and is poor when communicating to the team."
good,Target was my first job after graduating from high school. I felt welcomed had an awesome and respectful relationship with head management. Enjoyed conversation with multi cultural people.
good,only there for a shirt time. low pay. low hours. low discounts. employees arent appreciated. managers dont communicate. last minute requests to employees and their schedules
good,"Working a Target i learned a lot. I was first hired seasonal as hardlines associate during christmas and they decided to keep me. I felt target was understaffed. I was responsible for two areas for ex a and b and doing strays and zoning. The manager offered me beauty area and i loved it. However, she hired new employee and put me back in hardlines. I had another job and she was going give me set schedule to work with my other job, but after three weeks waiting and reminding her i decide to leave cause she never give me set schedule.The pay decent $11.00 hour but hours weekly were low. They would somethings call associates to pick up extra shift, but i was working on my days off at other job.There was a lot a lot work to do, so time went by quickly. I would stayed at Target if they give a good amount hours weekly."
good,"worked sales floor helping customers. Always on feet, running around. Plenty of time to socialize with customers and coworkers. Scheduled breaks and multiple supervisors."
good,"Some of the other employees were fun to work with made it much easier. Interact with a fair amount of customers that walk in, they usually have lots of questions about the products and also where to find them."
good,Target will feel like an extended family but the store manager is only looking out for themself. The store manager plays favorites and will nit pick those who are not in the favorites club.  Overall management is decent but store manager brings down everyone else.
good,A typical work day at target is pretty busy. Makes the time go by faster. I have learned that without teamwork no plan will succeed and that I always have something I can improve on.
good,This is defiantly a retail job.  You only deal with customers for the most part and of course your co-workers too.  The life at Target is very different from day to day.
good,Good for a job while in school but it is really hard to move up they have been hiring higher paid positions outside of the company. The expectations are also a little skewed when they want a lot if work done but have no hours to give and not enough people to get their jobs done.
good,"The fun part of the day are group meetings we have, peep talks, and we show our gratitude towards one another for the work through out the day is the best part to me"
good,"The hardest part of the job was management grading you on the amount of Red Cards you signed up in your shift. If the customer said they weren't interested in the Red Card or the benefits of the Red Card management expected the cashier to keep needling them. "
good,"I loved working at target, it was fun, most of the other employees were nice, never a dull moment. Great job for someone trying to make a little extra while living with mom and dad or maybe for a retired person or stay at home mom, not so great if you have bills to pay since it's a minimum wage job (at least it was 4 years ago when I worked there) and some times you get very little hours. I did think keeping seasonal workers was stupid, especially when the people who weren't seasonal got hours cut from 30+ to 20."
good,there is just nothing to look forward to working for a place like this. you are indispensable to them. there are a million other people just like you able to fill those positions
good,Stocked all merchandise on shelves and end caps. Set up displays on advertise items. Assisted customers on their purchases. Received stock and organized stockroom
good,target was pretty ok the only complaint that I had was pay and hours but I was part time so I'm not sure how it would've been if I would've stayed long enough to actually advance there
good,"Fun work place, great company, competitive, cool workers good management. None of the hardest part everything was smooth and easy, Meeting the customers and help them."
good,The job had its pros and cons like all jobs do. For this specific job the  management would step on toes a lot and was not willing to take any form of advice even if it were to better the company.
good,working is simple fast and some what easy but don't get what i saying  wrong there days were its critical but all in all its a place where you can learn a lot about your employer
good,"I tried to ask to be moved to a cashier position, but it seems like they don't really care, so they've mostly decided to keep me as a cart attendant. Despite the fact that they said they'd make me one months ago."
good,The main reason i left is because they wanted me to start coming in at 4 am to unload trucks and there was no way i was going to do that for 9 bucks an hour.
good,"Clean work area, organize cages, be quick when items are coming down conveyor belt and place them in an orderly manner in the cages. "
good,"I have left after over 7 years with the company due to stress caused by management demands. I have high expectations of myself, but management demands are beyond the realm of what is humanly possible.  During the first few years the work was hard but management wasn't nuts like they are now. The culture has slowly deteriorated over the past couple of years. Instead of beginning our shift with recognition, it became a chew out session to us by the operational managers.  Our building was #1 in the distribution network at the time of my departure, and still we only heard about what a terrible job we were doing. Our shift had received about 10 brand new people from other shifts, who hadn't been trained. Management did not allow for any drop off in production - so two people out of 8 on a team are expected to make up for already extremely difficult expectations.  Long term, knowledgeable, and great employees are leaving, and that seems to be the goal."
good,this is a fast pace work environment. I did not feel like it was a team based experience and felt there was favoritism shown often. I enjoyed getting 10% off.
good,target isnt a bad company to work for my expierence with target has not been the best overall though its a solid company just needs better leadership on a store level
good,"It was alright but they wouldn't let to switch stores if they really liked you, I was pretty strange but I guess some stores really do like keeping those who seem like they will be the best worker bees."
good,"Management changed too frequently, policy changed nearly every other week. Nearly no merchandise protection, employees not allowed to confront theft. I loved the people I worked with, but the constant changing caused too much stress for me while working on my degree."
good,"A typical day at Target was starting work at 2 am , unloading trucks, stacking pallets to be stocked on shelves, and finally stock the shelves accordingly. The staff was friendly and helpful, for the most part in teaching me how to do my required work. The most enjoyable part, for me was actually unloading the trucks because it was fast paced and physical labor, so I got quite a workout while working. the hardest part of the job was getting shelves stocked correctly before the store opened when we had an abundance of holiday items to put on shelves as well as move to different areas regularly. All in all I did enjoy my employment there, although it did not last past the seasonal season and I had hoped to get hired full time."
good,"assist with customer service "
good,"Target is a great experience for a person venturing into the retail and customer service career. In my experience it has been a cooperative, well organized and comrade based culture. It in my mind and experience is what all retailers should model after."
good,I loved leading the front end team! Managing such a fine group of individuals is very satisfying! I learned a lot about time management. It has definitely been a great learning experience.
good,"Not enough hours or growth within the company unless you have friends. No benefits available or options to get full time. Some cross training, but again only because you make friends."
good,"I was hired as a cashier with full hours and days available. I used to get 30+ hours a week and now the cashiers are lucky to get 12 hours a week and can't find another job because of the season were in... Not many people hire after Christmas is over, so we just sort of got stuck staying at Target-- with no hours or the pay to make up for lack of hours. I used to make $500-$600+ biweekly, and now I am lucky if my paycheck exceeds $110. I wasn't hired as a temporary. I understand it isn't the holiday season, but we are very busy during the day, with only 3 cashiers scheduled. They don't schedule as many cashiers anymore since Christmas, even though we still are VERY busy. We have had multiple in-line waiting complaints, due to very long lines with only three cashiers. Instead of scheduling more cashiers, they anxiously call someone up to the registers from another department. We need more cashiers scheduled, and they should be scheduled so they can try to live off of the $11.75 with 12 hours a week... Also, the cashiering computers have many issues, as well as the self checkout. I feel like the self checkout shouldn't be there, it takes up jobs for people who could actually be cashiering..."
good,Good pay. Hard to move up in the company. Working nights for seventeen years with out the opportunity to move to days shift. Starting pay was great top pay could have been a little more.
good,unload truck boxes onto conveyor belt move empty pallets or move and sort boxes to where they needed to go to sweep and clean up area after every shift
good,"I enjoy working with the people at the establishment and public.  I enjoy creating relationships with other locations to make sure I can reach out to them when I have a question or concern about anything I may not be sure of. I enjoy building friendships with customers to ensure they continue giving us their business and recommend us to people they know. I like having to ensure our store reaches goals, sales, and high customer service scores."
good,"Fun atmosphere, but when November  and December come around it gets very tight and serious, but that is the time to get the most hours. Also RedCards are a must if you do not get enough you will not get a lot of hours."
good,The distribution center was a fun place to work. Most of the people there were very helpful in making sure all employees were fully trained and and certified.
good,"simply put i clock in look for a manager ask them what i have to do and i get it done no matter what, i keep up with my manager to make sure im doing good progress"
good,I can only speak for the target I worked at but the cashiers overall were cohesive and easy to work with but the credit goal thing was ridiculous you cant make people apply for something if they don't want it. And communication with us from management when changes o
good,Working at the target in Ontario I️ met a lot of people that I️ went to high school with that were actually really cool people. If I.t wasn’t fit working there I️ wouldn’t have a lot of the friends I️ have now
good,i LOVED IT but..... i got no pto after i requested it off for my daughters arrival into the world and got let go after the season was over.I also like it due to being fast paced
good,"I worked 12 three days a week, you walk in find out what your job function is for the day and then you get your equipment. Job is very easy but the hours suck because it is a long day."
good,"First, part-time retail the job as a clerk was a great experience! I liked the  Target in Charlotte and  people relations so  came back when school was in session"
good,"Work during summer. It was a great learning experience! I was able to work for the company over three summers and some part-time in school. I was able to learn lots about  Targets customer service and saw how managing people occurred."
good,busy atmosphere. made sure there is guest satisfaction in store. worked well with other employees and assisted when necessary when store was busy and active.
good,Unloading trucks in the morning with the crew. Working hard to make sure we got the protected on the shelves before the guest arrive in the morning. The crew had each other backs.
good,Was Hired on as part time and given 40 hours. Management was poor and unorganized. Discount was hardly worth using. Was guilt tripped every time I did not come in on my days off.
good,"Very strong retailer with strong community presence which was helpful for the overall business posture, The intangibles of cash register speed, Customer Service, and inventory replenishment will give this organization an edge,"
good,Seasonal employment isnt th way to go. The store I worked at was having multiple hr and manager problems so our scheduling was always messed up and drama in the upper management was affecting the way we were treated around the holidays. Got treated with dismissal for talking about my engagement on the clock.
good,"Normally a day as a Target employee is good, only downfall is that the hours always changed or always were outside of my available times to work. Other then that its a great store, awesome environment to be in and fellow employees were awesome people."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target, I just did not get enough hours it was suppose to be full time but it ended up being part time. The time I was working there I did enjoy it."
good,Was a pretty alright place to work. I just wish they did not require a RANDOM degree to apply for management over utilizing their oldest and most experienced workers. Though by now i would hope they have updated this flaw.
good,very easy with scheduling. great place for working moms . they have plenty of shifts to choose from. they pay is not the best and November to January is lock down months
good,"Working at Target is ok, it's not the best job in the world but in retail it's about as good as it gets short  of a small business or ma and pa operation. You are pretty much paid a low wage and treated fairly."
good,Its not bad or horrible to work for target but there are days where there is a short staff and a lot to do. Sometimes one person does the work of 2 or 3. The pay isn't all that great. For what some people do on a daily basis they should be getting paid more.
good,"I worked at the starbucks kiosk and it’s pretty fun back there most times. but if you do work in deli, produce, or anywhere regarding food, they’ll ask you to cross train and work in the pizza hut. which is a terrible place to work at. remember, you have the right to say no"
good,"Couldn't get enough hours."
good,target is a great place to work for if you are looking for a part time employment or learning how to do sales. The management are great people. I enjoy working with the customer
good,"Target allows you to work with very nice people and create friendship, however the culture of the company needs to worked on. I can not speak for every Target store but only for the one that I was employed at."
good,"There are many days where you are expeted to ""lead"" the team, but often times there is not enough payroll hours for you to lead the team. You are often times left to do the work yourself."
good,"This job is like any other retail job which means you have to deal with customers. Most customers are nice, but every once and awhile you get one that requires a manger to deal with. Managers are okay, but a few of them can be inconsiderate. The worst time of year to work here is from back-to-school season to after New Years Eve. During this time you can make more money with overtime and holiday pay but the workload and working hours can be brutal. The best part of the job were my fellow employees. They could make the hours fly by and my shift fun."
good,Target is a great company if you are upper management. If you are a part-time employee it's just ok. You don't get a lot of benefits for being part-time. It's a lot of lifting and hours can change at the last minute.
good,Was a productive and fun work place. Minus the hours and pay I worked. If that wasn't and issue I would have stayed. People were very friendly and helpful.
good,"I learned a great deal here at target, I manage to cross trained myself in nearly all of the various departments. The workplace was very diverse. However trying to move up within the company became very political."
good,I worked 11 pm to 7 am relocating merchandise as they were remodeling the store. I also help unload trailers and stock shelves. The hardest part of the job was the fast pace we had to work to to get the store ready to open at 8 am. Most enjoyable part of job was working with some of my coworkers.
good,"While I enjoyed working at Target for the most part, I found their attitude towards people's schedules troubling.  As a general rule they expect you to have open availability.  For most people this is not a realistic expectation, especially for part time work."
good,"There's always something to do and I'm always on my feet. Management respects and notices the little things you do, especially if it helps efficiency and work productivity."
good,"Good, relaxed environment and work life balance, awesome food at the cafeteria, especially, at their Brooklyn Park office location. Not a good pay master though."
good,I enjoyed working at target when I did. Met some amazing people there. Management is good overall. Had a good relationship with most of the management.
good,"Decent job for some extra money. One of the team leads doesn’t do anything, And provides no help to the team what so ever. He stands there and watches and complains about the job that people provide. When not complaining to team members that their doing a bad job, he’s usually watching tv in the break room."
good,Very poor and unaware of how to handle things at an every week rate. The management also had favorites on their shifts. The hours are also bad for my daily life.
good,"Great team leads. Awesome supervisor,  flexible with work hours. Overtime is offered if you would like to work extra hours thought the year. Awesome coworkers"
good,"Working here was a great experience especially when it came to the holidays, but the management team was very unfair when it came to working hours when it came to who they favored."
good,"When you first start at Target, you'll receive a vast amount of hours but after a while you'll find yourself scrounging to pick up shifts to beat 10 hours per week."
good,"The particular store location is small, so it doesn't ever get that busy. I worked here for about two years and was able to cross train in the back room and get experience in areas where I wasn't originally hired."
good,"I was extremely excited to work at target. Once I received a call from them asking to come in for an interview, this entire job experience started to come together. But over time the job started to become boring and management towards me changed."
good,"Learned how to work a register and deal with all types of people. Fast paced environment and always busy. Learned time management, people skills, and patience."
good,"Target is a nice place to work, everybody there is all about there job and do not procrastinate on their duties in the store . nice management and workers"
good,"Working at target is a great position for someone going to school because it's not so physically demanding that you are exhausted after you get off, and the time that you work can be fit for your schedule. The only downside to this job would be that during the ""off season"" you are lucky to get 20 hours/ week when you are available for full time. Because it's retail this is somewhat expected. However, Target will cross train you so you are able to pick up more hours in other departments, but even that gets difficult when they are continuing to hire new employees during this ""off season""."
good,Good people just terrible hours and not the best managers long day very busy i learned about fast pacing and hard work throwing the truck and the people were the best
good,"i had used target to try and get out of the restaurant industry, i worked there for a time but eventually my familial needs as well as financial changed and i had to seek other employment."
good,"Wasn't really there long enough for a fair assessment; nice enough fellow employees, management wasn't terrible. Standard customer service responsibilities, at the register or on the floor."
good,"The management was very kind and had an interest in getting to know their employees. I typically worked at a cash register, which could get very tedious and aggravating. I preferred sales floor duties, since you have the chance to walk around and you don't feel as constricted."
good,My job was interesting. Super busy at times. I learned alot. The best part of my job was definitely meeting new people. Also having a chance to meet my different shift leaders. Cause I had rotating schedule. I also had great opportunities to train new team members.
good,"Its retail so what can you expect, you help people find stuff and unload but its easy and not challenging...but that is more of a con than anything else."
good,"Fun environment to work in.  I learned a lot and I had a lot of hands on training.  I called on Blue Chip Companies and had great relationships with my clients.  Easy to get meetings.  I excelled in Digital, Social, E-Mail marketing and Programmatic."
good,Had great pay working over night and also was clear on your job and the task you needed to complete also made sure we were in the rite areas to perform the task asked of us
good,we you get to work all of the workers go to a meet and the manger will tell you how mush you will get to day.  I work at FedEx ground for eight year and it the same.  The management was good some day other day it wasn't.  The workplace culture is a fast pace on what job you do.  The hardest part of the job is keeping your pace on what you do so you don't get tired.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the break you get two fifteen and you get paid for it.
good,"Target was a good place to work.  It was fast paced and the time flew by.  I enjoyed working with Target associates and often  filled in at the service desk.  Additionally, I had the opportunity to fill in as front end supervisor.  The opportunities were good at Target for lower skilled employees (more opportunities), but not in management."
good,Usual retail environment.  Have to work evening and weekends.  Breaks are timed. Management doesn’t care about their employees.  Management had their favorites.
good,"I am thankful and enjoyed my time there but i feel my life style is not being supported by the pay and hours that i am offered. I am trying to save up and move and eight hours a week with $11 an hour was okay when i was in high school, but now i need something that is going to pay the bills."
good,Job was okay. There was good and bad about the job. Not a job I’ll go back to but not a bad job to work for. If you’re looking for a job just to grab extra hours for the week then go to target.
good,i enjoyed my job not too difficult....decent starting pay........manager of my department was the best and made work enjoyable.....hard to get any time off during holidays
good,Great place to work and great environment. Great benefits and flexible schedule. Ways to advance. Requires heavy lifting and being on your feet all day.
good,unable to work more than 30 hours per week.  not able to get benefits because of the hours.  able to learn about retail pharmacy.  unable to advance in pharmacy
good,At the time I was there ... I enjoyed working there with the people because I it was relatively not very difficult to do that much aside from being on time and doing what you needed to do while at the cashier position. Supervisors were easy to get along with and not too strict. At the time ... it was just a hassle trying to get or edndorse the signing up of the RedCard that the company had to give the customers a discout on their purchases which we had to do all the time.
good,"it was fun, laid back, on the floor while you put stuff on the shelf. but when u unload the truck you had to be quick and fast. everybody got along. most of all it was a good store to work for"
good,"It's was bad it was fine til holidays  then they started treating employees like nothing, peoples families had emergencies and they didn't care to the employees. ie- day off with family and boom called in to work on day off when told what happened and such they said ""I don't care just get here or you're fired"" so yea maybe management at that time sucked idk now but nope done with that store."
good,Working at Target for my first job was a really good experience. the environment was great and it was very beneficial for college students as a part time. The only downside to it was management wasn't the greatest and the hours could be exhaustive
good,Target is a great company to its upper management but the non salary workers have a ton of work put on them and pay doesn't reflect the work. The work atmosphere is who can blame someone else for what is wrong is lagging.
good,It was an average job with more than standard pay. The drawback is the severe cut in hours you may face. I worked one week 35 hours no problem and the next week was cut to 12 for no reason whatsoever
good,"typical big box store.... lack of communication , but depends on the leadership. Pay is good but it Depends how many Hours you put in. Highly encourage to cross train in other fields within the store so you can maximize on hours and helps create chances for advancement."
good,"I was a team member which meant I would be working in almost anywhere in the store, I could back up cashier when it got too hectic, or I would be positioned a department or helping out in the back."
good,"Earn money. Pay bills. Deal with customers. My particular environment was not very professional, but the majority of the co-workers were polite; others not so much. Overall, generic place to work."
good,My Experience with Target was nothing extravagant work was work.
good,"Alright place to work but lack of management coordination makes some of the job duties redundant or unnecessary. Ok benefits but are only offered after you""ve been there a good while."
good,For the most part things are easy going. Guests can be pretty nasty at times. However the pay is decent. Hours unfortunately fluctuate. I am not a huge fan because of this. Also scheduling is never the best.
good,"learn a lot"
good,Target was a okay place due to the people I worked with who were always awesome. But the management or store manager I would say always had this I'm in charge do what I say or else type of attitude. But none the less it was a okay company they do provide benefits and but the pay wasn't even close to what I would have liked for the amount of work they have you do.
good,"Target was a learning experience.The pay is good and being upfront  you learn a lot however like all retail stores, it can be overwhelming at times.  I enjoyed the experience and opportunity to grow just wish the ETL's managed better."
good,"It was a temporary situation while searching for a job in the field I was in before I relocated back to Georgia and because, I had worked for Target before I relocated."
good,"Treated unfairly no more that needs to be said. A lot or racial profiling, and lack of compassion for employees. They do not work with you during difficult times. All they care about are numbers."
good,I enjoyed working for target. The store i worked for was a very team based environment and the management were very easy to work with. I recommend working at target.
good,"The hardest thing about working retail in all honest, is not the customers. I know right? something that nearly everyone complains about. But when you really are behind the scenes, you see that the customers are just and independent variable in the grand scheme of working retail and unlikely to change at all. The hardest thing, like any business,  is having a competent management team."
good,"Its hard paced, but a good job if you are willing to put forth the effort. a lot of hard working people and good people to be around that will help you move forward in life."
good,"If you don't have enough payroll, you can't schedule enough employees to do the job they want you to do EFFECTIVELY. They do not pay team members enough for them to work as hard as they are expected to on the sales floor, or in the backroom. I got along well with most of my direct reports, but a pleasant personality doesn't always convince 2 people to do a job that really needs 4 to the best of their ability."
good,I didn't like working in the warehouse because they didn't have enough work to keep me busy for my liking. I was way too bored and wanted to learn how to pick but they didn't have enough people to train us all when I was there for a temporary position and I ended up quitting because the boredom drove me crazy!
good,"Typical work day was great, great people and environment."
good,"My coworkers are delightful, as well as most of management, but there are very limited hours after the winter holiday months. I was also filled into a position I did not apply to, as they were short staffed in the department I was placed in, rather than where I would have rather worked (and where I had experience)."
good,I worked at Target all throughout my time in highschool and it was good enough. The pay isn't great and they don't have very good opportunities for raises but it was ok as a student part time job. If you need anything more than that I wouldn't recommend it.
good,"Hard work, loved the exercise and early morning hours, vendors were fun, different locations provide different atmospheres.  very fast paced and management was kind."
good,"I say that it was stressful because the target I worked at didn't have things together. People were quitting left and right and I constantly had new floor managers. So it made things difficult. But when I quit (due to school) things were just starting to get organized and now the company is doing well. Being a cashier wasn't hard, just get some nice shoes so your feet don't hurt, which was my mistake. I liked the benefits target gave to its employees and everyone there was nice."
good,"Working at target was okay, completely depends on the your co-workers and your supervisors to have a good experience there or not. May have a bad experience if you don't agree with who you're working with"
good,I did not like the click mindset of many of the employees. Community building between leadership happened but not so much community building between workers happened.
good,"stock the aisles with new product and, once the store was open for the day, assist with customers and help them locate items. I was only a seasonal employee so I was not their long enough to learn anything I didn't already."
good,when i worked there i liked all the people who was there everyone was super nice. it worked with my schooling so that made life easier when going to school.
good,It was fasted paced and interaction with customers was fun. I enjoyed the associates I work with and if you enjoy retail this is a good place to start.
good,fast pace store workday consist of working one on one with customers. great people to work with they needed to pay more and have more healthcare benefits
good,Enjoy connecting with the quests.  Co-workers are all nice to work with.  Would like to have more room for advancement and pay raise.   Would enjoy the opportunity to work full time.
good,the hours I worked were very good  got out at a good time and basically had the rest of the day to do whatever.  my manager was very nice and flexible with my schedule
good,"Very flexible and can get hours to your heart’s content up to 40 hours a week. Management is fairly involved and understanding, always willing to help you improve."
good,Productive and fun work place. Was very competitive but all the workers were still friendly. Some Management was friendlier than others but all did their job well. Customers were sometimes or often rude or hard to deal with but the friendly or nice ones outweighed the unfriendly ones. I had a lot of fun during the holiday season working different special events for the company promotion.
good,everyonee was nice get great discounts. your feet does hurt if you work long hours. wear comfortable shoes. the breaks are very odd. soon as you get off one register you have to go to another one.
good,"Customer service job. Small career ladder, the hardest workers (over the top sacrifice, come into on off days) get the ""better"" hours. It's a good part time job to have while going to college."
good,"I worked late at night while unloading trucks. I would help put items away and mark them for opening tomorrow. It was long, but the job wasn't stressful."
good,i got hired on as a night stocker. i was in college and needed extra cash. I felt like I was a good worker but my manager didn't really like me because I was Black.
good,Just like you'd expect a retail environment to be like. If you enjoy that type of place than you'd enjoy a job at Target. Be prepared to offer Red cards like crazy.
good,"I met many great people for the years that I worked there , as well as not so nice ones. I enjoy working there that I got used to it and at times I felt close to my co workers."
good,Wish they let you advance here and those who worked hard were actually placed to do extra jobs for those that either didnt attend or where trying to save hours and had one person on the sales floor max two in hardlines at times to much work for a couple of peae and no recognition
good,I started as a cashier and moved to customer service/returns.  Typical retail. I really liked working with the customers.  The political atmosphere was not something I was used to working with.
good,"Manager was understanding. Friendly coworkers, I liked working the night shift. At your own pace. Opportunities for advancement. Good place to work..."
good,"You can get lucky and end up with managers who are well respected and are able to move you up in the organization, but you'll most likely be stuck in a position long term waiting for your turn for advancement. Just know you won't be promoted on merit alone."
good,"I was originally hired as a seasonal employee over the holidays, and I was kept afterward. The hands-on training was pretty good. The pay wasn't great, but it was at least above the minimum wage."
good,"I worked at Target during the holiday season, October through February. "
good,target is a big store so there are many different departments an employee can work. Target is very good with cross training their employees to maximize productivity.
good,Had to work very late at night after the store was closed. management expected perfect order of products on the shelves and all restock had to be put back on the shelves in the correct place. breaks were too short and the public can be very difficult to deal with sometimes.
good,"A typical day would be: Clock in at 4 am, unload the truck, bowl out good to proper isle, unbox and stock shelves, clean up the sales floor, then clock out at 8:15. The management is why I left. Nothing was ever in order and if anyone requested time off our manager would just ignore their request, not even deny it, just ignore it completely.  This happened more than once with more than one person. I left because my manager didn't listen to my availability and scheduled me many more hours than I had allotted."
good,"Job work life balance needs to be better, job culture could be improved. Management turn over is often, need to work on retaining talent in management."
good,"I was hired for guest services, however in the time i was there i was always on a register and I was never given any training for the position i was hired for."
good,The  best part of my job is the people that I work with and the guests that come to visit me daily. My team always has a fast fun friendly can do attitude that makes working side by side a pleasure.
good,Hard to say much about this company i was just a cashier and was not really give much to grow with in the company. The hours they could offer did not fit with my life and they would not really help me out much in that sense.
good,"I worked there during the holiday season, so it was pretty hectic while I was there. Since the job was temporary they expected you to come in whenever they called and if you can't they'd start taking away from your usual hours which was unfair because that's why you gave them your availability when they hired you."
good,"Tuesday through Friday is an awesome shift to work! The job is constant, and breaks are short. The work is not easy but the pay gives you the motivation."
good,Target is good place to work. They give you at least 30 hours a week and the managers don't mind if you stay over time. They also have good benifiys as well.
good,Long hours and very stressful place to work at. Its good to work there as a part timer but anything else is very stressful. The fitting room was most difficult part.
good,"Everyone is hired as seasonal. I was told you choose to stay full time, or they let you go if you sucked, basically. A lot of my coworkers worked hard, did well, and we were all let go. We all felt lied to. The job is good at first, easy, and pays well. The majority of coworkers are nice but the managers are a different story. Oh and don't bother talking about how you're getting double the amount of hours you wanted, because they don't care"
good,"Flexible Hours, multiple job positions. Understanding management, strong team moral, fair wages. organized time management. Fast paced, always tasks to be done."
good,Target was low and boring. Nothing happened. The work wasn't challenging and it seemed to drag on. It is a good place to work if you're looking for an easy job.
good,stressful some days 
good,"The job itself is not stressful, it’s dealing with the guest and there attitudes and people expecting you to take it because your at work. It’s a lot dealing with different personalities from different Guest and not knowing how they are going to approach you about a situation"
good,What i learned in target was about retail stuff. Specifically how things are handled. I also learned more about advertising and how to fold cloths the way retail places do it.
good,"Clock in start working, thirty minute unpaid lunch, leave."
good,"my days here where always hard because people would get upset with you , over little things and its not your fault ,also the mangers don't really get the time to get to know you and the staff there are not super nice , but it was ok for the time being ."
good,"-very friendly coworkers"
good,Working for target was horable I did not like working for them managers were very rude they do not cater to anyone or respect them honestly working here was bad.
good,It was a really nice job. It was actually a lot more work then expected but the workers and managers were really nice.  I really wish I could have worked there still.
good,"During the Recession, being able to walk down the street and apply for a position when nothing else could be found was a gratifying experience.  I am grateful."
good,"A typical day at work started at 6:30 am, I'd arrive, clock in and begin to unload a truck of over thousands of boxes that I then stocked on the store."
good,As a  cashier and customer service rep you are supposed to bring in a certain amount of red card applications. You will get talked to every day if you do not meet the quota.
good,i loved the people there they was all very nice to work for and was always willing to lhelp you out. i worked in the return so at times that was not so nice of a place to work cause the customers were difficult at times
good,Target team members is like your second family everyone works together NOBODY never let each other slack... Customers was sometimes smart with these kind jobs you have to over look that kind of behavior
good,fun company to work for there was a lot of opportunity to learn and advance in the company. The had a great work culture and focused on working together with each other .
good,"Overall, this was a temporary job for myself. After attending for the portion of time I did I felt that it was not a good fit for myself, and the work I was doing did not line up with my goals."
good,Target is a very business oriented corporation and is extremely strict with attendance. The pay was great and i met a few friends here. Many benefits offered and many opportunities to grow within this corporation.
good,My branch has had numerous changes in management which does not show any stability. Constantly having to meet new management really deteriorates the bond that members and leaders have.
good,"Target is a good place to work if this is your first job. There is little room to move up in the company, while expectations are still at unreasonable levels"
good,"When I worked at Target, it was filled with different experiences day by day. I always had to attend to customer service or the department. This taught me people skills."
good,I didnt stay long here just for the holidays but overall not a bad place to work pay is fair hours can be tricky lots of fluctuation. And they punish for to many hour's try to keep everybody to at least 20 hours
good,"a typial day at work was always unorganized or team leaders would hardly communicate and would be assigned different task from 3 different people. Lack of communication, management didn't care about there employees well being. Most enjoyable part of the job were being around nice assocites I worked with."
good,Would usually stock things from the back or find items in the back. Nothing special about this job. Hardest part of the job would be finding the items you still don't know but are expected to know.
good,Overall the company wasn't not a bad place to work despite the location. The store was always striving for better. Their was options to move around in the company.
good,"Freight management, stocking, Customer care, cash handling- cash, checks, credit/debit transactions, stocking, Guest Service- Costumer service (returns/exchanges), Customer Complaints, online pick-up, Gift Registry, Photo Lab- Processing photo orders, Target Café- Food handling, Health and Safety Standards, Presentation- Presentation of merchandise, and displays, Price Change- Quality assurance for pricing"
good,"Overall target helped me get out of my bubble and I appreciate those who helped me, but along the way those who's back i scratched never scratched mine back when in need. Majority of managers were chill."
good,Worked much harder than what was recognized. Often felt like nothing was good enough. The compensation was terrible and the culture was not a positive one.
good,"I dont have one.  I have my own opinion. "
good,"Fast paced, but was not overwhelming. I learned about the functions of target, go backs, facing items, cashier where i also was able to improve on my people and verbal skills."
good,Great place to start out at and hope to move up. High chance of making friends. typically work around your schedule. college/2nd job friendly that I notice.
good,No work life balance or growth opportunity.  Fixed mentality instead of growth mentality. Over worked under paid. No bonus structure. Alot of problems out of your control which effect your salary and raise.
good,I have learned a lot for time I have been there.  The people I work with have become my family.  I lean something new everyday. What I loved most about my job is the people that I work with.
good,"Friendly environment. Early days of the company, they really looked after the team members. As the company got larger, they lost the focus and focused mainly on profits."
good,i was a seasonal hire and it help but a little extra money in my pocket since i just finished school and was living on my own so it was okay for a cashier job.
good,"Target is a good place to work. However, the roles of managers have been stretched to the point where work/life balance is not possible if you want to be a top performer."
good,"Working at target can be a fun fast paced environment especially being a barista in their Starbucks. It can become very stressful when your the only person behind the bar and you have constant customers coming from checkout to grab a drink and food. I don’t think it’s fair to have only one barista behind the bar with such a crowed environment of guests. The staff can also be very unorganized about who’s coming in to work that day or if your even sure if your going to be leaving work at your scheduled timing. The scheduleing is also very unfair, and they do not listen to your availability, they schedule according to what they need not caring about your priorities outside of work."
good,"Target, before it was sold to CVS, did not understand the complexity of pharmacy operations or wasn't willing to spend the money willing to invest to make it great. This is why they sold out to CVS."
good,"Gets extremely fast paced closer and during holidays, which can be fun if you enjoy those types of working environments but slows down tremendously after holidays."
good,"Target is a pretty good company to work for, although in my personal experience the fellow employees are what really brought my time working there to a point of it being unenjoyable. The work and goals for the day weren't all that bad however."
good,target was my first job out of high school and was everything I expected it to be. I wasn't there long because I received another career advancement which I was thank ful for.
good,I worked for Target for 3 years total and I really loved my co-workers. The management however left nothing to be desired. The lack of knowledge and unwillingness to learn the position they lead was amazing to me and others. Lack of skilled leadership creates a stressful work enviornment.
good,"It was great for the 1st year and as our STL went on and our scores went up. The management seemed to collapse causing a terrible work environment, leaving me no choice but to search somewhere else"
good,Target is retail and I have never worked in retail before so the culture has been a change for me.  The instability of knowing what you hours are going to be week to week has been the most stressful for me.
good,I  liked  working  at  target  and  would  recommend  it to  anyone  looking  for  a  face  paced  job.  Hours were  varied.  It  can  also  be  hard  at  times.
good,"Generally it is pretty fun, the people are great to work with. Costumers understand we are there to help. It becomes difficult to focus on one task when it is busy. But it is rewarding when helping others."
good,"I was the big fish in a little pond.  "
good,fun place to work fast paced. the hours on flow team were very limited get in the the job done get out basically so 18 to 20 hours a week on average but ok place to work
good,"Target has too many bosses, and each one has a different agenda which makes it hard to work with. They are also more concerned with promoting younger managers based on interview instead of performance"
good,"You will learn money handling skills, Whether shopping in store, online or on the go, we hope to delight and inspire our guests; and have lots of fun. As a store team member, you’ll be the heart of the shopping experience. All you need is a passion for great service and teamwork. We’ll teach you the rest!"
good,There was no room for me to go anywhere. They also started to me full time and cut me back to part time because another associate decided they could work full time
good,"I don't have anything good or bad to say about this giant mega corporation, not my ideal place to work, but not the last place I would go either. Its this or Walmart I guess."
good,Very hypocritical. Failed to explain a real reason why I should be fired. Only said things I was doing wrong when I first started. Target is nothing it says it is.
good,"Work there if you want, its not bad you will just not get very many hours so there's that. the people are nice and friendly and the environment is quite"
good,"I was a stock associate, the job was fast paced but most the people there were Friendly. The wages were not great and the hours werent the best either"
good,Only thing that it lacked was management. Manager and leaders had favorites and some were unprofessional. It was really great hours though and the pay was excellent.
good,"Collect the carts from the lot and organize them according to the store layout, management was good, the hardest part of my job would have to be carrying heavy items to customers. the most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customers."
good,"- Cashier position is always a busy position"
good,"Most people think they have the most stressful job – that’s only natural. And without doubt, almost every job has unique brands of stress. But let’s face it, there are some jobs that are just way more stressful than others. But which ones are they and what makes them so?"
good,"Two 30 minuet breaks in a 12 hour shift  was not enough time for me personally you literally stand on your feet the whole shift. management was great they where really easy to talk to about anything and pretty professional, and the checks where great also"
good,Target is a fast paced environment. Working there you will encounter all walks of life from the young to the old. People from different cultures. Employee diciunts are very good too.
good,Good place for a young person to work long hours but for the most part treated people fairly lot of standing in one place however definitely worth the paycheck
good,no comment on the target company or how the run it .I don't want to comment they making me wright more then I care to wirght at this point . idk means
good,"Target is a okay place to work. Your coworkers and customers are cool, the only problem I personally had was with management."
good,A typical day at target was relaxed. You learn your job and it comes natural to do your job proficiently. In my position i worked in and out of the store working with customers making there day easier with just the little things.
good,Worked there for almost one year. Enjoyed my time there for the most part. Lack of flexibility to work around my college classes became an issue down the line. Great people to work with though.
good,A decent workplace. Very face paced; workload was somewhat tedious. Only worked there for a short period of time during the holiday season.  I would recommend an associate to work there.
good,i worked there not as long because they were cutting everybodys hours and they had alot of favortismn with management and employees and the managers at night were too lazy as well
good,I was seasonal.  It was really hard to offer red card credit cards to people at the holidays when they really didn't want a new credit card.  The hardest part of the job also was dealing with the irate customers.
good,"this company will work you so hard that if you do not have any health issues when you start, by 6 months to 1 year you will start having health issues"
good,the job at target for overnight team member is okay wish they paid everyone more money . Also starting mid January 2018 they will not have overnight job position so i requested transferring to another target store that has overnight team member and i wish i could stay at my current location but can't.
good,"What I liked about this workplace culture is that it was a great environment, lots of room to grow with a positive atmosphere.  also empowered to make decisions."
good,"they care about their employees and they are like working with family,  decent benefits and managment was ok to work with. i worked ok hours but were limited to share working hours with other employees."
good,"Enjoyed the fast pace work.  Learned much from supervisors and always changing atmosphere.  The ability to flow from one area to another was hindered most of time in the backroom, changes have been made since then which allow for more mobility to complete assigned duties."
good,Needed a job worked out well with my schedule . Have no problems would go back and work there again. Just needed more hrs and health care.Have nothing negative to say.
good,i use to work overnight and it was not a bad job. there was a few thing the was not working with me. One was the they didn't give the 40 hours. the manager were not the great. there was almost no over time and i love overtime. and it was overnight
good,A typical work day during the holidays is rushed and stressful and part timers are working at least 40 hours a week without being offered any benefits. And anyone that has been working there for 3+ years are barely getting any raises. They've been working at a wage of $10.50 and during the month of October everyone including seasonal employees have gotten $11.50. The wage that we make at target is not enough to help pay for bills especially if we don't get benefits even after working 40 hours a week for a couple months in a row and also getting paid bi weekly. Once the holidays are over with they also intend to cut hours even those that really need the money. I am currently trying to leave target because of the work conditions and the payment is not enough!
good,"It was my first real job while I was going to college and although it was a seasonal position, to which I was offered a full-time position, I was looking for more pay. I met a lot of great people there and the management was great. It is a good part-time job."
good,"My Target was good but my co-workers were very racist and the manager tend to have favoritism. It was located where there were predominant Hispanic people, so if you were not Hispanic your chances of promotion were slim."
good,A typical day at Target is fast paced and timed with just about everything. I learned the importance of inventory and customer service. The hardest part of the job sometimes came from making sure to complete all auto-fills in a timely fashion.
good,Coworkers are usually decent but management typically has poor communication skills and are slow to inform regular workers of the changes going through the company. Is slow to fill in positions that are empty and considered non critical.
good,My job while I was going through nursing school. Hours were flexible. Company as a whole has a higher pay standard than many retail companies. Working with teenagers who are working their first job was frustrating at times.
good,"I did not feel welcome when I first arrived at the job. Most people even a little bit above me provided poor treatment and condescending attitude. Most fellow employees felt the same way."
good,"the job itself isn't bad, however, not enough hours given to support any lifestyle, always working shorthanded, however, they hire people all the time.  Newer employees tend to get the most hours.  An average week is between 20-25 hours."
good,working for target is great they offer flexible hours the management is great very helpful and understanding also team members are great working with ..target is a fun place to interact with people.
good,This job was perfect when I was younger and it was at a very convenient location off of every main bus line but I eventually needed more as I got older.
good,It's a standard retail job.  If retail isn't your thing you aren't going to like it.  I enjoyed the fast paced nature of Target and thought we were paid very fairly.  Experience with management will also depend greatly on location.
good,"Target is good place for people who enjoy the fast-paced work place. Always being able to multitask and run around helping many people in many different ways whether it be a part of your department, or not. Familiarity of the store is a must. Management is helpful when brought to their attention, but not very aware of the problems in workplace otherwise. The hardest part of this job is the patience, and the most enjoyable is the coworkers and the work family."
good,Answer a lot of phone calls and questions about electronics. Clean the floors/shelves. Sort items based on department. Annoying alarm that goes off randomly. Training new-hires so that they can handle themselves. I like my coworkers and managers they make working there bearable. If it wasn't for them I would have quit a long time ago.
good,I worked here so long ago I really don't remember much about this job  I was in high school which was ten whole years ago it was fun I think I made some friends
good,"New boss came around and gave no one a chance. Very poorly run, manager never listened. Would not recommend working for his district. To hard of a boss."
good,It was an okay place to work would enjoy it more if we had better management that took the time know their employees and take time to listen to their concerns. Favoritism is a big issue.
good,When I first started it was amazing. They quickly trained me for more areas than just the front registers. When I became a supervisor that is when it fell apart. They would tell me I was doing great but then when a new position would open they would tell me I needed to improve in several areas.
good,Target was a great company when I joined them in 1976.  Culture changed in the late 90's and was not a fun place to be after that.  All this happened 20 years ago so don't know what the culture is like today.
good,"Decent job. It was always busy, which was great. There was always some to clean or stock. My favorite tasl to do was to set sales plans. I enjoys putting up the fixtures and making the shelves look presentable and neat."
good,Target is a great place to work for High school and college students and if you are retired. If you are a college student make sure you let them know what days and times you can work and make sure they know when you have major test to take and the days you need off for them .
good,"It’s a decent place to work. Pretty good pay decent team members and leaders, overall I️ enjoy it most of my time there. My team is pretty great , lots of work to do and lots of hours to pick up if you’re willing to work hard."
good,overall a pleasant place to work the training could have been more instructional employees were good people to work with.the hardest part of the job was door and parking lot patrol
good,I worked in the backroom doing overflow stock. I barely went on the floor unless it was to retrieve merchandise or go on a break. The supervisor was hardly there but its not a difficult job at all.
good,Loved working there everyone is very friendly and loved seeing all the merchandise and new things that come out at the store every season and loved the changing of the seasons there.
good,While working at Target you get the chance to learn about many different areas of the store. They did provide training for these new duties and had fair ability for advancement.
good,We all help each other get things done we try to get it all done for they day stock everything up and have it all organized not a lot of customers around to really bother you while you’re busy so work gets done fast
good,"Spend a lot of years working for this retail corporation, great opportunity for young people if they want to get promoted quickly in highly paced retail environment. Great people, good looking stores. Has a high rate among people for better quality merchandise than some other leading retailers out there in the market."
good,Fast Paced Work  provide quality service to meet the needs of the guest.  interaction with guest by telephone and face to face.  Assist team leads with their responsibilitiers
good,"poor training schedule, needed 2 weeks gave me 3 days"
good,"My eperience at target hasn’t been the greatest. I personally dread going to work some days. But that is just me I don’t like to stand in one place for hours at a time, I like to move around and talk to my co-workers bit we rarely get a chance to do that."
good,Not a bad place to work. Not the best hours but that is to be expected in retail. I thought it was a decent place to work and would work there again if given the chance.
good,its just like any other corporate. The management was not very good with the exception of some. pay is not very good if you see how much work load they have. understaffed sometimes.
good,While working for target distribution I had to work a very fast pace. Sometimes it got stressful because some orders will be very large orders and you will have a small time to get the work done but overall I liked the fast pace work
good,"backstock trainer ,locate product dealing with customers daily clean area safty always first daily meetings to make sure team on the same page i learned logistics here."
good,"is a good job for students and for a short term period, since they do not give you races or if they do it will be for cents, they don't give you hours since there don't want to pay any benefits"
good,"Better than working for Walmart. Good atmosphere blah blah blah. The Maulu'ulu is an indigenous dance performed by the Samoan people. Contemporary ma'ulu'ulu compositions and choreographies are generally performed by female dancers, although some villages have a tradition of men and women dancing together."
good,"the people I worked with were good people and friendly. I did not necessarily like the job I did but it was a temporary job just to help with paying some bills. it is a tough job working in the backroom, especially during holiday season and really should be paid more."
good,"Fast paced environment"
good,"I feel appreciated and my team and my managers are great at trying to communicate with and support me. I'm encouraged to always do the right thing for the guest, and we seem pretty successful at consistently creating a welcoming atmosphere."
good,"Learned slowly, training was slowly rolled out then would be criticized for not knowing the material before even give the training. Coworkers are enjoyable, management is decent/sub-par. Store always seems to have some sort of drama very unprofessional."
good,"A typical day involved stocking shelves and straightening items on the shelves. I further learned and enhanced my skills of time management while working at Target. Management was usually very nice and helpful and almost all of the time, fair. The hardest part of the job was learning where items went while going through a renovation, and the most enjoyable was the people I worked around."
good,"While a very large company, every store has a certain amount of departments with a certain amount of shifts which leads to a tightly structured work environment with a lot of opportunities for advancement."
good,"Target is a fun and productive workplace ,though at times it can be difficult. I’ve been working at target for almost two years now and haven’t really got the opportunity to move up in the company. It’s a great place to work though and I would recommend working there to someone else."
good,Target is a fair place to work. It can be competitive at times and sometimes it can be very fast paste but usually it is a nice and quiet place to work
good,Very cool place to work sometimes the managers get ahead of themselves but other then that a very nice place to work with good benefits and good discounts
good,The company allowed me an opportunity to grow my leadership skills.  I enjoyed working their and meet several good people that I have stayed in contact with still today
good,Working at target was a job that would not have been my first choice but they did helped me when i really needed a job.  I physical labor was fun but the pay was bare minimum $8.00 and getting extra hours was tough.
good,Decent place to work. Pay could have definitely been better. Managers were friendly. Discounts are always nice. Hours were decent too. Overall it's good for starter job.
good,"I maybe just saying this because I had a horrible experience working there so don't take my words to heart unless you want too. "
good,"always trying to catch up the backlogs, boss expects employees to over work at the both weekends, endless works in pending, a very good place to learn some new skills and experience especially to new bees."
good,"I loved working at target. i mean we get discounts,the employees as well as guest (as we didn't call them customers) were always friendly. The guest actually made me want to come to work. Management, well they have their favorites,but I hear that's at every job. Too bad i wasn't a favorite for them. Job could be a little competitive because as a cashier they push for Red Cards( you would think they would've loved me as i always got the MOST RED CARDS. Although i was rewarded with something like a free candy bar or a gift from the target Cafe,so I'm grateful. I would totally pick this as my first job,but nothing more. Thank you Target for the experience."
good,"Target is fast paced and demanding.  your work experience will be determined by the leadership staff.  some are creeps and some are great!  I was there for 8 years, working in a number of positions.  I loved it!  I might still be there if not for family medical issues, I don't know."
good,"It is a great part time job. If you don't mind working with people and stating late this could be a perfect fit for you. Very flexible with hours. You can get as many or as less as you like,"
good,repetitive and easy work just have to keep moving. you can have good days and bad days  just depends on managers and supervisors. every store is different so you may get lucky
good,Target was a good temporary job for me as I was looking for a job in my field of study. My field of study was Air Condition Technology. As I worked for Target I was seeking a HAVC job.
good,"Nice people and welcoming environment, but this should not become a long term career move for anyone with an educational background that goes beyond that of a high school graduate."
good,"Target is great place to work, it mostly just depends on who get to work with and who is your boss. It seems like everyone works differently or teaches differently. If you just stay as a team member it's fun, I decided to become a team lead and it's not worth the headache.  That's my opinion."
good,"My team leaders and my specific managers were amazing, all of the managers were helpful, as people they are all fantastic, The scheduling is up and down and varies greatly week to week so there is no consistency to your work and often there are conflicts with employees availability (i.e. unavailable for school and scheduled in the middle of class). It definitely pushes you and there is always someone to help or something to do so if you want something fast paced this would be great. The hardest part is finishing a project and turning around to see a customer has already messed up what you just cleaned. But there is a lot of satisfaction being able to help people find what they need."
good,Ibstarred wrking target After high school started off as a cashier and made my way to human resource representative in a 4 yr time frame. Was ok for the most part no issues minus pay
good,Hours only go up during specific parts of the year. Even when promised to get 40 hours a week hours will be cut down to 15 a week. Very poor place to work
good,"Its good for a temporary position, sometimes language barrier was the problem with other supervisors, but it was good, I liked it, if anybody needs a quick job, apply here."
good,"It was overall a good place to work at, the people I was working with were very high school, lots of drama but then again it is retail it kind of comes with the territory."
good,People like to mess up the store. You will be yelled at by customers for asking them to take their purchases to the front because the store is closing.
good,"Target is just a job. They try to foster a relationship with you, but you're also just a replaceable grunt to them. They force Anti-Union videos and speculation down your throat. It's a weird place at times, and Black Friday is awful. But, for a first job, you can do a lot worse."
good,Target is a fun and exciting place to come and work and show off your skills and knowledge of products and company and work your way up to the top with managers and etc..
good,"Managing in the retail environment is difficult, but one of the managers is a shining example of how to manage employees. He consistently receives high marks from his employees and runs a tight shift at the store."
good,"loss prevention is continuing to be relevant at any brick-and-mortar retail store.  Target's techniques will keep you safe and secure, and allow you good store- knowledge development time."
good,The co workers were nice. But management from team leads up are completely unorganized and don’t care about their employees best interest. Schedule has no consistency so be prepared to work every weekend and not have back to back days off.
good,"This was a fast paced steady environment, you knew the task at hand and did the job.  However, probationary periods can become extended past what was originally promised causing additional waiting for benefits to kick in, and during probation your hours can be cut in favor of those who are not in the probationary periods.  Which means that you may not get your full time hours if freight is lower than expected."
good,Pays well.  Good company culture at the hourly level.  Management roles are very demanding and job security can be fragile.  Leadership expected to work every other weekend including early mornings and closing shifts as late as 1:30 am and one night per week.    Strong ability to promote if skills and image are aligned with company expectations.
good,I was in high school and it was money.  Not a career place since they didn't like to offer full time hours unless you were and LOD or MOD.  I worked up to GSTL by 18 so its not hard
good,"It's retail--everything that retail is chocked up to being is what working at Target is like. The client base can be pretty bratty (but they can also be very sweet,) but management seems not to understand what their team members go through in a day."
good,I really enjoyed working for target. You are never bored. Especially if you are crossed trained. Everything was organized. Best part was the consistency of the tasks assigned.
good,same as stop and shop although they constantly made us push the target credit cards and surveys. but they did have contests and employee bbqs. being paid every two weeks was bad when your a single mom
good,"Its a good place to work, with many protocols. Average day is spent following guidelines and carrying out the culture of the company. Co-workers are good, and well balanced."
good,"I was a cashier at Target so basically from the time I clocked in I was standing behind a register interacting with customers and asked them about their experience in the store. This was my favorite aspect about my job, I enjoy helping others, therefore if I could be of assistance I would lend a hand. It is a good job to have wen you are starting off in the workforce, however advancement opportunities are limited."
good,The job was a fast pace job with great people to work with. Hours were good the managers there depends can be great but some not so great the pay was decent
good,"Very stressful job as a barista, constantly alone with very large tasks and big rushes of people. Not many other employees were certified to cover breaks, so sometimes I would have to cover my own. Very friendly people just wouldn't want to work in a system like that again."
good,"At this location."
good,busy all the time.  one manager would tell you to do one thing and another would tell you to do another.  schedules were never correct.  paid was short alot.
good,"If you lie retail, this is a great place to work.  I love the customer service aspect and meeting new people everyday.  The atmosphere was much nicer than other department stores."
good,"the job itself was easy, i was a barista, but i felt that there was not chances for growth.  Management at the store i wirked at seemed to have favoritism as well"
good,Management is not concerned with your personal life only getting there job done while you're there. I was a very hard and dedicated worker but did not get acknowledged for such.
good,I worked there for a few months for holiday season. It was alright but somewhat stressful because it was the seasons and it was always busy. The company wanted us to promote their debit cards for the store and hit a deadline of 5 everyday and if we didnt we were looked down upon. i believe for my experience that made the experience more complicated for myself.
good,Target has become a micro-management company. It has also become a challenge each day. Target is not a fun work environment anymore. Managers are not experienced enough to be a leader.
good,"Only did part-time here during the seasonal holiday one year. Wasn't too bad, made a few work friends, was able to move around on my feet the whole shift, which was nice despite sometimes getting tired by the end."
good,"The store was nice but messy, if you want to work here you will be under stressful situations during the holidays but other than that the LODS where nice the the store supervisors where cool at least in the front end"
good,I need a job more steady it just was not for me it's not a flexible job at all and it would help if the management was better and if it did not hurt your overall health
good,Great place to work if you are looking for a fast paced environment. I have learned so much within the business aspect and how things work together in each department. Culture is great and the work itself is not hard but time consuming. The hardest part is staying on task as you are interrupted quite frequently by guests. I enjoy the many benefits Target has to offer.
good,"When I first started working for target I loved it, and I got promoted rite away. Got a new LOD for my department and she made changes that no one enjoys and has everyone in my position job is on the line . She has poor management skills and isn't giving us the correct amount of time to change what she wants, she is not leading by example ."
good,"The work itself was defiantly worth the labor, Target has their backroom procedure, not under control, but the training to it is well taught. i learned how to work with two different pallet jacks, how to properly work aisles while filling inventory, and learned how to maintain my time, when it would come to cutting it close to not meeting my set goal."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of lifting 50 pounds or less. Also, communicating with costumers helping them find exactly what they need. During my time at Target I learned unique tactics in boosting sales drive and also patience when dealing with buyers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the feeling after successfully helping a customer find what they came for. I also enjoyed the team members I worked with. The hardest part of this job is in my opinion the consumables section."
good,"It had many requirements in order for one not to get terminated; one being able to sell one ""Red Card"" every 4 hour shift. Otherwise, again, it is grounds for termination. It is a ridiculous and idiotic requirement for the job. I feel that it is unnecessary and detrimental to the overall motivation to the job"
good,target was a great place to work. the only downside was the lack of work life balance for executives. working 50 plus hours weekly can become harsh across periods of time.
good,Great work environment with plenty of room for growth and development. The team makes the store an amazing place to work with their diversity and practices both internally and externally.
good,"Very busy, and budget orientated. However my experience was fun. I had a great time doing HR there. Too bad it closed down in Canada. But If you're new to Human Resources, its a great place to get experience and develop new skill sets."
good,"I didn't feel like this job was a long-term job. And so, I always thought that through out the years while working there. I also wasn't a fan of some of the management."
good,I definitely learned that a lot of people shop at Target everyday of every season. It also depends on the store for how things are run. Each branch seems to be independent.
good,working as a team to become a better business. the hardest part of my job was the hours. the most enjoyable part of working at target is working with upbeat co workers.
good,Typical day is coming have a shift meeting then going out on the floor and begin stocking the shelves and helping the cashiers when the store gets busy.
good,Good place to work except it's a little unorganized.There are times you get sent home due to lack of work and schedules change constantly. Good pay but learn your job and ignore the snotty oldtimers. They seen to forget they were in your shoes at one time.
good,Not a bad place to work but you do get sent home if there is a lack of work. Kinda unorganized but pay is descent.  People who been with the company for a long period of time do not welcome New employees nicely.
good,"looking forward to a better opportunity, not much room to advance they only promote who they like not who deserves promoting. typical day was pretty basic not sure why this is relevant"
good,"Target is no longer in Canada.  There is no option to select N/A to this request.  "
good,"Its a great working experience job, especially for college kids or anyone who is wanting a part time job. It can be fun and yet stressful at the same time."
good,"I loved the ability to advance myself and increase my own skills. The job was great, but if you get into a team with a manager who manages people rather than leads them, it's too much micromanagement. There's a lot of competition and you've always gotta be looking for your next step."
good,"It's been over ten years since I worked there. It isn't a current view of how Target is today."
good,"the problem at target was not having 40h by week. every week you will get a new schedule, with different hours, sometimes morning or evening or between. you can go to work only 3 hours."
good,Target has its ups and downs depending on the management in charge of the building at the time. I have seen really great leadership and direction but have also seen a lack of both. The company is making positive changes towards a CI environment just not doing a great job implementing changes.
good,Target was a good company i enjoyed meeting new people and experiencing new challenges i encountered everyday weather it was helping a guest find the product they were searching for or helping someone find their car in the parking lot.
good,Part time work. Good management. Nice co workers decent pay. Needed a full time job. Woyld have stayed at target if i got more hours. I worked in Boynton bc. Fl. Igot hired to work the holiday season. .
good,I was a contractor. The time there was good. Contract ended. The manager was pleased with my performance and the team worked as such when it counted. Overall working there was a good experience.
good,Awesome training and opportunities for growth.  Fast pace work environment.  Cut-throat style focus on the bottom line.  Easy to get burn out due to the amount of hours you typically work (50+ per week).
good,Target is a great place to work a typical day at work consisted of planning for new floor Sets. I learned the Patience of being a Manager How to balance multiple task and managing 50-60 team members at a time.The hardest part of the Job was work Life Balance.The most enjoyable part of the job Job was meeting all the great customers and amazing Team Members
good,"Good place to work with people who truly seemed to enjoy working there and with their fellow employees. Retail schedule can be difficult at times, but can also come in handy."
good,It was retail. Had it's perks and had it's downs. My management team had almost unrealistic expectations for the departments I was in. Had to get everything zoned nightly and everything put away.
good,every one there was so nice and did there job the best and safest way. never really fast pace. always helpful co workers to lend a hand at any time...
good,"I've worked here for almost a year, I started as seasonal and was hired on permanently. The job itself is great, the atmosphere is fun and the people who work here keep it entertaining. The problem comes with the scheduling. Each week there's at least one shift several people are scheduled outside of their availability, and/or their hours get cut down significantly. Management has ignored several team members requests to cross train, instead hiring new people on and cutting hours further."
good,"Protect yourself from phishing emails."
good,"Working under multiple team leads, It's quite confusing and frustrating to work every shift considering there are changes in management and team members every month. From August of 2016 to now(September 2017) current employees including myself are now having to the work of 3 employees each, with little to no pay raise. Most employees seem to have a ""work for yourself"" mentality, not working as a team like how we were taught in orientation day. overall, Target is a store where a job is something if you need money but not somewhere you can gain a full career out of."
good,You begin your day at 4:30 am in uniform. What you learn from being in this environment is customer service and the structure of the store. Workplace culture is oriented in a moderate pace to organize items before the store opens. The hardest part of the job maintain a nicely organized sort. The most enjoyable part of the job is earning your pay.
good,"On your feet constantly moving in a quick paced atmosphere. Multiple responsibilities from zoning, cashier, to restocking all in one day. Fast paced and fun"
good,"Decent place to get started, unless your going into business or have no other prospects its not somewhere i would recommend working. The coworkers were nice, and management did their job."
good,"We were scheduled a variety of hours. The schedule constantly didn't coincide with our availability. Our team lead was a bit incompetent but likeable. Team wise, Target is great! We all work well together and manage to make a fast paced work environment fun. I consider my coworkers my friends."
good,"I needed a job between life stages, and I thought Target would be a great place for that. It was, I got to excel at running my own front end with Target guidelines. However long-term in my opinion you just become a seller of toilet paper."
good,The store I worked at was very commradary. The team leaders weren't always available.  You are required to work at a fast pace and if you are cashiering you are required to sign up guest for credit cards the more the better for the cashier.i enjoyed working with fellow employees. I learned to communicate with the customers and being bi- lingual helped.
good,"This company is great for making you work extremely hard and work overtime, then cut you hours and insurance when it slows down.Most employees are nice but it really depends on managers.. I would say the best part of the job was helping customers."
good,The management is very full of themselves. Not great at communicating a job to the employee. Not much training offered on how to do the job. Micro-Management
good,i worked in the starbucks coffee area so it was sometimes hectic sometimes balanced. overall i loved the team members i worked with they were fun. just wasnt enough hours sometimes.
good,"Non-stop work, can be stressful at times especially during Black Friday weekend. Employee discount. Friendly co-workers. Volunteer events in the local community."
good,"Target was my first job. I can't believe I'm saying it after not working there for 3 years but I kinda miss it. Very flexible schedule, if you needed to switch a shift with someone, you could. Co-Workers were friendly for the most part. Overall, decent place to work. Just a lot of work for not a lot of pay."
good,Fast paced. Grabbing change for cashiers. scheduling breaks appropriately. Covering guest services breaks. Helping customers who have complaints. The hardest part of the job is making sure everyone goes to break on time. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the customers happy as well as my team members and team leads.
good,Perhaps one of the easiest jobs I have had. It was a great atmosphere to be around as well as the tasks being quite simple. Some positions were a little bit more difficult than others but non the less there was always help when you needed it.
good,Really tough to continually battle finding good people that are reliable and want to work in the retail industry.  Working nights and weekends is part of what should be expected.
good,"Greeted customers and assisted them in locating merchandise"
good,I really enjoyed working there.  Could have used more hours.  It was fun to go in early to work because it was quiet and easy to work.  You make good friends there and a lot of coworkers will help you.    You can advance if you work hard.
good,Target was a great working experience. I've learned multiple position in the store that made my job a lot more comfortable so i can be able to help guest appropriately. Upper management was fine back room team leader at that time not so much. The workplace culture no complaints.
good,Was a good experience and a fun place to work. I do not know what else to say say say. It was close to my house and the commute was really convenient.
good,I started at Target on the East coast and the Team was fantastic to work for. I moved to Arizona and the team is great but management puts way to much work load on team which makes it very stressful. Every day there was something new for a team member to do on top of what they already had to work on. Management only looks after their own backs for the year end bonuses. Target was a great place to work for but the past few years not so much.
good,"hated working here honestly, backroom attendant job sucks, i worked there for two weeks before I turned in my two weeks notice. hostile work environment and my manager didnt care about how poorly I was doing after training"
good,"I liked it a lot. Working in the pharmacy was great. You get a lot of customer interaction and that is always a plus. I also liked the discounts, nice!"
good,"Being a team player is the best ever, working together always gets the job done, I've learned it's never about me it's about the team, management supports the team in doing better and it all works out."
good,Returning customers and employees make it a pleasure to work with and help.  Always leaning and training team on new store processes and new procedures.
good,"Target is a good place to work, the only problem was work advancement is extremely lacking internally. Instead of trying to save money on new management promoting the ones who fill all requirements are being pasted over."
good,"This job was great in the fact that I worked in the morning, and was able to complete a majority of my work without customers being in the stores.  But it was a fun place to work."
good,The work was very all over the place. The hours changed pretty regularly due to sales of area. Some days were very difficult to maintain constent activity due to lack of customers and then other days seem like you couldn't stop working until break. At time of employment seem there was a lack of advancement unless you applied for management.
good,It was a great place to work. Everyone treated everyone like family. The HR department was sketchy but the management was overall great. A lot of room for advancement.
good,People compare target to walmart yes they are competiors and are simlar but different in so many ways. For me a typical day on the job is showing up to push karts all day long.
good,Was a good place to work while I was in school. Worked around my schedule. Some people work harder than others leaving the work load uneven. Was difficult to get a schedule change.
good,"I took up my very first job at a very fast paced and successful store. At first they didn't know where to put me but the last position I held lasted the majority of my time there. I was able to advance but due to my other commitments decided against it. Management was going through a lot of changes, most of them included executives that didn't know what they were doing. They also seemed to lack respect for team members. I know for sure the executive workload was not balanced ( i.e. A few select execs carried the store whilst others were carried). Fellow colleagues were always happy to help one another. Some minor-based laws were broken due to carelessness though."
good,Pretty honest retail job but definitely overworks workers. The customers were fine. The training is well done but very delayed. Even coworkers were fine to talk to.
good,"Overall a great experience, management needs to be worked on overall. Aside from that some weeks hours were very inconsistent and managers. Hardest part of the day would be having so many task to be done when everyone would call in & your left alone."
good,"Retail is retail but I love the company"
good,"Responsible for organizing and display of product. The hardest part is management changes. There is a great deal of turnover in the store, particularly upper management. Then the way you do things is changed. I like helping customers probably the best."
good,"It was a great place to have my first job. It really taught me a lot about people skills and how to manage my time schedule such as work,life,school. The people that worked there were all amazing people and were extremity friendly! I am very thankful for target to give me the experience i earned there."
good,Greet all customers. Compute and record transactions while maintaining a balanced cash drawers at the beginning and end of all shifts. Handle returns/exchanges and restocking shelves while exercising excellent customer service.
good,"Decent place to work if you like to work hard. Unload trucks, stock the sales floor and make sure its all done before store opening. Help out in other areas when its busy."
good,Cashiering sometimes customer Service with returns I often did operator-assisted management was ok they suck on breaks and time off and getting request off on time .
good,it was a good place to work its been awhile so I don't remember very much about what the job was like and such. the management was decent there though.
good,It was very stressful but it was a fast working environment. It was easier to work with the coworkers than with the customers. It was quite challenging but I did like how time flies by when there is so much to do
good,"Target is not a bad corporation to work for. However, in my particular store, Management was not exemplary. There was definitely favoritism and an unfathomable lack of protective gear for freezer working."
good,"I was hired as part of a overnight seasonal remodel crew. We emptied and replaced shelves throughout the store, stocked new shelves, set up decorations and followed aisle POG's (Plan O' Grams). Sometimes some of us stayed later to help morning crew empty the truck and stock the shelves. Was payed a fair wage of $10/hr. Management for specific job was understanding, kind, yet assertive about getting job done."
good,"I had two different experiences, my shift and the overtime shift. I did not enjoy my shift but I did enjoy working overtime because of the shift ""Operations Managers"" or boss in simple terms. While my shifts manager was a micro-manager, while overtime was relaxed. If you start here, ASK QUESTIONS! Trainers don't have a lot of time with you and cannot show you everything. Overtime, time-off, sick days, etc were not fully explained until I went out of my way to ask and find out. The hardest part of the job is getting started and getting used to the pace of the job and lifting heavy awkward boxes and objects is a daily part of the job. The most enjoyable part of working at Target is my co-workers, they were fantastic. The diversity of people that work at the DC was incredible experience."
good,"The people are what make Target. Hired on with the intent to be promoted in 12-18 months, but management is not helping make the promotion happen. Looking for better paying opportunity."
good,"Working with this company is very stressful, you're constantly pushed to make people sign up for the credit card they use, you have to get people through the line within a certain amount of time and they would actually keep track of the scores."
good,"Target was a very balanced place to work. I never felt pushed or intimated and I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent working there. I enjoyed working with my co workers, and had made many friends while there. I was honestly so torn to leave."
good,Always something to do. It was a fun environment especially during Black Friday. No major problems and the discounts were nice. Nice break room and lovely lockers
good,"Pretty easy going for the most part besides the fact that they push the whole RedCard quota on the cashiers a bit too hard. I mean it's their job but they do it in a rude manner and it gets kind of annoying."
good,"Great place to learn a lot in retail. You can definitely learn to work in other departments. example : cashier, hard line, soft line , security departments."
good,"Not enough hours and constant schedule changes, pay is good for required work, lack of communication between management and employees, overall it's a nice friendly place to work"
good,"Working with target as a cashier your faced with an opportunity to extend your career and grow within the company.All you really have to do is ask.They are willling to work with but the hours they give you depending on your position may not be that great. However co-workers are very friendly and supportive with a questions or concerns you may have, but in all just be aware and come to work with a great attitude"
good,Target is a great company. However it is very difficult if you'd like to speak to the main manager because of the line of others managers that you have to talk to first.
good,The job was ok. It's so easy to handle but hey it's kool I truly do not have much else to say about the place. Target will be what it is from then till now
good,Fairly good company. Decent benefits. At times the store can be very busy at other times the store is completely dead. For the most part the company is forever changing.
good,"Busy but a rewarding environment to work in. Management was there to help but some situations slipped through the cracks and were not resolved in a timely manner."
good,Target is a very productive place to work. It has its stressful days but the managers are more than willing to help. I learned how to better communicate with the customers who shops in the store.
good,"My team's shift was 12 hours a day for 3 days a week, but as the manager I worked 15 hours a day, and come in on multiple days during the week on my days off to conduct interviews, and for mandatory meetings."
good,"Hectic retail pharmacy. Didn't work there too long to give it a full and fair review. People were great to work with. Too many distractions and job duties, as would've preferred rotated stations."
good,Company takes their employees very much into consideration. The company also donates much back into the community that it is in. Very fun and good place to work.
good,overall good company to work for. was able to grow with the company but only so far you can go. something new everyday always learning. employees are great
good,this job wasnt for me it wasnt fun or anything there werent no music in the store or anything like any other normal store very boring and dead wasnt lively enough for me
good,"It's an interesting to work, although I didn't last longer than a month here. Some of the people working here are not the friendliest people to encounter and can be rude. There are a few who still maintain my hope of a friendly shopping environment"
good,"Target emphasizes a lot on teamwork and helping each other out, but its quite the opposite when you're on the floor. There are a lot of selfish co workers and some that don't even do anything, not to mention that a good number of managers aren't very knowledgeable of their departments therefore making things more difficult for us."
good,"If you're young and trying to make a few dollar a solid job. Good benefits however if you move up in ladder. Poor Hours so limited benefits. Also, you'll be expected to work roles that would normally pay higher for your current wage (if you choose to move up) until that job opens up."
good,sales associate. Helped get  costumers in the right direction. I learned a lot just by working their helping the costumers decide on options to what they where buying and helping them direct them in the right path.
good,Being the Cart Attendant is a strenuous job. You know by reading the job description but their's a lot to it. You're out in the hot and cold and you never know what to expect. It's great if you like being physical and moving but it gets really frustrating when you always get pulled aside for assistance and the cart attendant suffer because of it. i feel that they dont show to much appreciation  towards cart attendant. we do so much for little pay.
good,Target is what a retail store is all about. If the store is not making the numbers it effects the hourly workers. They cut hours and jobs only to make the ones they keep work harder.
good,"-Friendly staff."
good,"Target is a great place for colloge students and people who like being on the move while woking,I really love the customer service  when I'm their as a shoper the people are very professional and thoughtful."
good,There was an awesome co-workers. The AP guy was such a nice and caring guy. Made sure I got out to my car safely. They made the shift bearable. Since I was there over black friday- Christmas it gave me a glimpse of retail.
good,company didn't but unrealistic care about individual only numbers.  Many good people left to go to company that cared about employees.   Pleasant wok atmosphere  but unrealistic goals for the rank and file.  Utilized parttime to acoid pating benefits
good,"The hours were awful, but a job is a job. Was hard because it was based off of everyone's completion and success, not just my own. Wish I was better recognized as an individual who was efficient and hard working."
good,Working at  a cashier Checking guest out. Facing products and returning items to shelves. Shelves item.  Taking breaks by head cashier person. What I enjoy was working with other employees.
good,While I enjoy working there I'm also very wary of the people above me who can toss me to the deep end and leave me with no hours or way to support myself. Learning other jobs is a good way to not only be a team player but to also keep you in the game. It's just a shame that going to such lengths is necessary.
good,"Typical retail operation. Hired fresh out of school college students and made them managers. Lack of people skills, favoritism, immaturity. Management turnover too high."
good,"Very hands on, everyday, if you are not ready to roll your sleeves up and push freight, this is not the job for you.  "
good,Great place to work if you want to learn on how to be a pharmacy tech. They are willing to train and help you take all the necessary steps to become one.
good,Working for this company has taught me many things.  I was able to advance from being a cashier to being a leader in multiple areas with in the store.
good,My target experience was a good one. the hours were great only thing I did not like was that the pay was bi weekly. if you rely on public trans then the hours may be a problem because they close at 12 and most buses where I live stopped running at 11:00
good,its ok.  However it could be a lot better.  The management isn't that good and neither are the hours or benefits associated with this job.  Look around.
good,"Target demands a lot of its associates, be prepared to work hard and long hours. Monitor your body carefully while working in this fast pace environment"
good,It is a typical retail environment. Typical seasonal employment requirement is to show up for work as scheduled. No benefits as expected. Scheduled in two week increments; so always knew the schedule of work to be preformed.
good,"I worked in the backroom, so I handle mostly stock and inventory. So i worked by myself and was mostly quite. The management really didn't wok with the members that well."
good,Company is nice to work with. Most supervisors are professional and listen to others input. Some favoritism among supervisors. Will work with your schedue
good,I enjoy working for Target but I don't feel as though the company values it's team members. They will use you up if you let them. Over worked and under appreciated is the term we use. I feel like they put a lot of money into technology when some of that could be used to train and develop team members better.
good,"I enjoyed it enough, for what it was. Plenty of employees that are lazy and only show up and go through the motions. Can be fun if you have a good attitude."
good,"Long days and weekends.  Holidays are even longer.  You get a decent amount of vacation time, but barely get a chance to use it.  If one department is struggling you are looked at to pick up the slack, but no recognition for going above and beyond."
good,all all target is a great place to work but I need somewhere I can more up and make money and target isn't the place to do that. I learned so much at target I know how to do everything in the store besides Starbucks. the management isn't the best they pick favorites. The hardest thing about working there is the hours I didn't have enough of them. The most enjoyable part is all the people I worked with its like a family.
good,"Staff is Great, but it is Retail. My coworkers were what made the job worth going to, definitely not the pay for the responsibility I had.  I ran the store for $18 an hour... Didn't really make me feel invested in it's success."
good,It is a fun work place to work in and also it gives you good benefits. It has good pay and it is a good place to work at if it is tour first job ever.
good,"Target is a very large company that struggles in changing direction from time to time.  The most difficult part of working at Target is the philosophy that you need to continue to be promoted or leave the company.  Finding a position that you enjoy and are good at, was not an acceptable position."
good,"so much work for so little pay. management wasn't fair, they made some employees work harder than others. if work got done early you were sent home and didn't get your hours."
good,I was a cashier and working at guest service for about a year. I enjoyed the interaction i made with our guests and loved my front end team. All of my coworkers were nice and friendly and always looked out for you. They wanted you to feel good. They always make sure you get your breaks and lunches in. Being a softlines team member changed my mind about target. It just wasn't for me. Target has poor communication skills and training.
good,its a good place to work just be prepared to work. its busy very demanding and sometimes stressful team leaders try to work with you. Hardest part of the job is cleaning the restroom.
good,Typical retail environment and customer service was limited. Basic stock replenishment and shop presentation for the Target brand. The people were friendly and the most enjoyable part was working in the team.
good,ok place to work. this was my first job right after high school. Started as a seasonal worker and then permanent employee but work hours was cut veryyy short
good,"This company was pretty productive. If I wasn't cashing out a customer, I had to go and organize sections and clean my area. The team all worked together to get out at a reasonable time. Learned to speak out to customers"
good,I am glad to be doing something that I have never done before.  But there is a lot of confusion in the management of this store.  The employees are very nice.  I could see some improvements in the company process as far as time management and clerical processes.
good,Target is a well structured company who provides reasonable employment and opportunity.  I did learn a ton while working with them in regards to leadership and working in a team environment.  Management was well centered and focused to the tasks at hand.
good,"Unload Truck, Stock, Break, Stock, Lunch, Stock, Backstock, Leave"
good,"It's retail. Hours can be hit or miss, never consistent. Managers definitely played favoritism. Difficult to advance, will need a degree to go past second level. Overall, a great part time job for a student, or primary caregiver."
good,"i do not know i have never worked here before .  i have however worked in one of there warehouses in olympia washington , i did not have the best experience with there management , but they had good pay and great hours always had OT available"
good,"I enjoyed working at target the. the work place promoted a Fast,Fun and Friendly environment. The environment was very clean environment and place where /good effort and work was always recognized."
good,Target is great to have as a first time job. You get to build your experience and you get to meet some interesting people along the way. Depending the position you apply for you always have something to do so you are never bored.
good,The typical day for me was sending out product to different stores. I learned that  working in a hot warehouse is not good for me . The hardest thing for me was keeping my quota up in the hot warehouse.
good,My responsibilities include being a cashier and stocking shelves when necessary on my scheduled days. I have trained new staff. i really enjoy some of the upbeat managers
good,I was working as a cashier an worked my way to the floor as stock an I honestly liked it better More room to move An more things to keep me busy on the job till time for me to head home
good,Team manager was unorganized had to many workers on the floor that shouldn't have been alot of people were frustrated due tothis but other than that good company for teens to work
good,Great place for students to work. The team members are fairly consistent with work ethic. There are several people that have been there a long time and intend on retiring from Target.
good,I worked in grocery department and I would put out product on the  shelves and assist customers who needed help finding merchandise. I would be a backup cashier when needed.
good,Target is overall a good place to work but sometimes you feel unwelcome at 1068. I have been there for 2 years and feel like I should have more than 11 hours of paid vacation when I worked there full time for most of the time
good,"I worked at Target for several years in high school and liked it decently. Depending on who the Lead on Duty was at the time, given there was much turnover really differed how much I enjoyed my job. The hours being in retail can be quite difficult."
good,"was an easy atmosphare, nice people to work with. did the job as requested. had fun."
good,Target is a great place to work with good prices on products. It is one of the very few places where I received adequate recognition for the work I did. Opportunity to work overtime if required.
good,"A typical work day consist of collecting carts, emptying trash, taking salavage/reshop to the backroom, compacting trash, cleaning restrooms/foodcourt, and occasionally getting on the register."
good,You have to work the weekends and very little understanding when things happen in your real life. Great fun things to do for the employees. Fun during the holidays.
good,"Great for someone coming out of college who wants to gain management skills, etc."
good,Some of the workers werent as friendly. Never really got to go on floor to do much because was always stuck in back doing sales paper. not a great social enviorment.
good,"Like most retail jobs, tasks are simple, just provide excellent customer service and you'll be fine. Working with the public can be frustrating at times but don't let them bring you down."
good,Work culture is interesting.  I quickly found out retail is not for me.  Many options for growth and moving up in the company.  Good and flexible work schedule.
good,"Working at Target as a cashier is everything you'd see it as. You have to be on your feet for 8hours, check out customers, deal with couponers, etc. It is not a bad job, the people are really friendly and the discounts for employees is a catch!"
good,for this job you have to have a lot of knowledge of the product that you sell on a daily and know where all the products at your store are . you also need to work fast to finish all your tasks on time specially during holiday time.
good,It was an ok place to work. They tried to make it fun to work here but it was a boring job and very repetitive. I really liked some of the leaders but others were not that good.
good,Target is a nice place to work for as long as the management  is well put together. If you're young and looking for a great first job this is the place were you should apply.
good,The best thing about working Target was the customers. I really enjoyed seeing some of my regular customers on a weekly bases. I didn't like being opening on the holidays and missing out being with my family.
good,Target is high pace and always moving. it depends where you work but at blaine we had new management and they did not communicate and cooperate with each other so it made things difficult.
good,"My typical day would start out  reading my e-mails, pulling reports. I would walk the floor pad every day to see what needs to be worked on.  I learned how to pull all my reports so I woud know what Departments that I would have to work a litter harder in so I could get the sales up. "
good,there is a lot of things to be done and it is a nice place to work and meet new people and be able to assist your customers. when you are doing what you have to do there will not be any issues
good,I felt very independent working at Target and felt I was given a lot of responsibilities for having very minimal training in my department. They wages were not competitive for the duties being asked of me.
good,Target was a good experience however a great sacrifice to work on holidays/weekends is required. Great position for college students but no career growth.
good,Was hired seasonally but they kept me longer because I was a good worker. Went off to school and they said I could return to work at anytime but never returned my phone calls or got back to be so that i could continue. They also fire people after first mistakes. I have seen it first hand. Hard to get in contact with management but overall great work environment.
good,The store is just a revolving door of employees.  It seems like they have no way to hold on to the good employees.  I am not sure if it is a pay thing or a schedule issue.
good,The management needs to be more involved with the staff.  The management is tasked with too many tasks throughout the day and they rely too much on the supervisors (team leads) and captains to manage the staff.
good,Target is a well balance company to work for your schedules are  always different unless u have been there for a while your schedule wont be set the pay is ok
good,The internal structure of my store was not stable. We shuffled through management and employees like a kid through his Halloween candy. Though it isn't a fun experience. I will not work there again.
good,"face past environment with not many hours to spare, must move freight off the truck and on to the shelves in a fast and timely manner if not deal with consequences."
good,"My boss slept under her desk on Friday nights so she didn't have to commute back on on Saturday mornings.  This was not something I aspired too, so I left."
good,The hardest part is unloading the truck. Then we stage and stock all new products. The best part is always staying busy. You can work in a different area each day and learn something new. They always good at training you in new positions. The best part of the job is my co-workers. This is a very fast pace environment and requires you to pay attention to datail.
good,"A very easy job. Pay attention to detail. As starting cashier you'll love the simple task of ringing people up. As you move on, as a sales floor team member- pressure can build between October- January for the holiday season. Lots of work."
good,"When working at target, their wages were not great. The worst thing is that they would hire new employees at a higher rate than the current ones. I worked there for three years and never made it above 9.00"
good,"Target was the most unprofessional and stressful job I ever had. They only cared about the floor team members and making the store look brand. I worked as a Price Change Team Member. The team is suppose to be at least a 6 member team, there was only two on pricing. We barely could get any help."
good,lied to by higher ups many times.  many promises made but after holiday was cut to 12 hours a week after being hired on full time and promised to not cut my hours.
good,"The first day there was a lack of direction, supervisors kept changing. Managment did nit seem to notice although I asked questions. Lack of communication on which days to come in."
good,"company really cares about their workers, they would provide free lunch and snacks in the break room sometimes."
good,Help customers find certain items and ensure they have a great experience. I had to restock items and learn how to interact with managers from different departments.
good,"Typical day at work would be staying at the cashiers box the entire work shift. When there wasn't anyone checking out in the line, there would be different little tasks to do such as fixing items around me, and/or helping another cashier out with bagging. Work place was very fast paced and the hardest part for me was because of it. It was my first job and it scared me to no end when there was a lot of customers coming and having to speed up the process. Most enjoyable part was getting the experience."
good,"A typical day is I go in at 4am, unload the truck, put the boxes on the pallet, and take the merchandise onto the floor to be sold."
good,The location that I worked at is no longer open. The staff and management are no longer there. Any opinions of this store were closed when they shut the doors for the last time.
good,Had the chance to build teamwork skills by working with great people and had fun provide exceptional customer service to customers. Development of Manager-Employee relations allowed me to thrive and become a more efficient worker.
good,Not a bad company to work for if you are young and starting out in the working field.  There are some opportunities to move up in the company if you are willing to be patient.
good,I don't want to give a review but you are making me type. So I guess I will keep typing nonsense until it has enough characters for me to stop. Just a few more words...
good,"Working in logistics at target was a great stepping stone into a working environment. In the five years I was there I learned a lot about how logistics process works, and know that knowledge can be useful in other careers."
good,"Working in different fields definitely had its advantages. One is being able to pick up shifts to complete your 40 hours. Last department I worked at was Starbucks as a Barista honestly I loved it but had another job opportunity with better pay. Management was the worse, the Store manager had such anger problems. It was impossible to work in a peaceful environment"
good,The skills that I had match their qualification and I'm glad I got experience I have with Target because if it wasn't for them I would've never got the job at Home Depot.The team members their helped me through a lot.
good,Work balance was simple and they allowed us to do our job efficiently. Support was great from management. Needed more hours and wasn't able to receive that recommendation.
good,i learned how to use a pallet jack and i stocked floors with merchandise. I also did backroom stock which is locating how many quantities are in that store
good,"Target worked great for me while i was in college, flexible hours, ETC. But progression can be slow and pay seems low.  Always felt understaffed.  Great job for students!"
good,"I worked for Target in several locations and did the same type of work - I worked with back stock items, pricing products and stocking shelves. The people in my team were helpful."
good,Target was an alright place to work. i worked night shift seasonally and eventual started working an evening shift to go to school. i was part of the flow team.
good,"Even if you were going as fast as you could possibly go they would still get on you for not going fast enough."
good,this was my first job out of high school. The pay was great compared to other employers and I really enjoyed the people that I worked with. I highly recommend Targets.
good,"It was a good, no stress job while I was attending school. Nothing special. I liked my managers and they liked me. The company seems to put undue stress on upper managers. But, not having been one, it seemed like an okay job."
good,"Target is a safe place to work but, there is not much room for growth or development. There s no wat anyone can sustain a consistent lifestyle with such little money."
good,"Target is an openminded workplace that keeps up with the latest technology. They value not only guests but also their own employees. There is always room for promotion and movement within the store and on. Target allows a great balance between work and private life, it works well with school schedules and health needs."
good,"Ever changing hours it didn't seem like anybody really cared about the workers here , seeing as its such a big company it came at me as no surprise good people there though."
good,Working at Target is what you would expect from a retail store i guess. Depending on your supervisor you may have to fight for hours or you get so many hours that you have to give some away
good,"As with most box-retail settings, it's a job. Show that you are serious about investment in the company and you can go places. Have to always keep up the pace."
good,"My first job, pretty easy."
good,I would go out collect cars from the parking lot and bring them back into the store. I would also hop onto the registers when needed. also would go around the store and collect hangers access clothes etc.
good,"some days are slow and some are busy. everyday we count product in a certain area. Help with guest along with preventing theft. help assist in apprehending shoplifters. dealing with management is not bad, help them with projects and help educate/train team members."
good,"The job was ok and pretty easy to learn.. everyone was your team mate, but nobody was ever willing to help others out. Ilots of cliques. If you want to work in a place where people are super judgemental work here."
good,This job gives the chance to work a lot of hours but you will have no social life if you work the night shift. But over all target is an ok place to work.
good,"Overall, I met some nice co workers while working at Target but there are some people that were not very nice. One in particular pressured me to go faster even when I already was moving as fast as I could. Working at Target as a whole wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I thought I liked working with the clothes more but I honestly think cashiering was a better job for me. If I had to return to Target, I think I would most definitely stick to cashiering."
good,"enjoy working with people."
good,A typical day as a Logistics Team Leader is very busy. Manging 20-26 team members and getting everything off the trailer and on the floor is a challenge.
good,"Working here in the beginning was fun and friendly, there were great employees and managers, after a few years there was a change in management and all of the fun, recognition all went down the drain"
good,"Working as a Hardlines member at target can be summarized as a simple and repetitive job. "
good,"Fast pace environment but great opportunity for growth. The hours vary from week to week but overall everyone gets a fair amount of hours per week. Your have to be flexible with your schedule and resources.  Need to know the register, helps guests and maintain the sales floor full and impactful. I gained leadership and public speaking skills here. The leaders will always give you feedback based on your performance and I always learned from that."
good,"I worked seasonal for Target. It was a fun environment, with a lot of great people. ""If you have time to lean, you have time to clean."" That's their moto."
good,"Work was always different, consistently changing pace, Gratitude for helping other departments, and management assisted when needed and complaints were taken very serious."
good,The managers at my particular Target can range from awesome to work with to feeling like calling in to not be around. Its retail so you won't have weekends off and if you get the closing shifts you won't have much of a personal life either.
good,"Typical Day:"
good,"Managers think they can disrespect the workers in front of everyone. Other than that, it's a great place to work, everyone is friendly and good at what they do at work."
good,I actually enjoyed working at target. I worked as a sales associate in the beauty department. Considering that i enjoy beauty products it made going to work a tad bit easier. Once entering work however i had to deal with a horrible team lead.
good,"I rather enjoyed the hard work at target, I also learned to deal with multi-tasking problem solving and meeting quest needs. I worked over night all the better to get the job done."
good,"it was fun working there and meeting new people and helping people there is fun and challenging.we all need to be fast,fun and friendly to a;; the customers."
good,"Target is a good company for cultural and wok, People can work without pressure and the company is giving many benefits to employee who are all working target"
good,Lenient with scheduling and time off.  Great job that got me through college.  The discount pretty much made me spend my  entire check in store.  I didn't make much money but it was a good time while it lasted.
good,Management is so weak they can not manage at all. Environment is very good but no benefit does not fit for long term carrier.Payment is bad for the work team member deserve more payment.
good,The something of something and a thing to do stuff with other things does something happen with the stuff. It's great to do the things and the stuff but the stuff sometimes outweighs the things.
good,Learn how to work at a fast and steady pace... How to paperwork for the job... Decent management .... Good work atmosphere... Hard labor... Keeping busy at all times...
good,"Working at Target was a good experience and the discount was great. I really liked the stores merchandise, especially there clothing."
good,A typical day is to help guess with anything they are looking for in a graceful matter. The management is great sometimes but most of them have not work on the sales floor. The employees are great just try to keep to yourself.
good,"Great team, with a great company. During slow times of the year (Non-holiday times) hours can be cut. Short amount of time, especially during night shifts, to get everything done with an overwhelming amount to finish."
good,"Working for target was okay. Customers were often rude, and management did not care about you. I loved the people I worked with, but HR and senior management played favorites and there is a heck of a lot of drama there."
good,"In the 5 years that I have been with Target as an Assistant Manager, I have began to see the shift in focuses from brick and mortar stores, towards online retail. It is good to see that the company is aligning with the change in times, but working in stores has become increasingly difficult over the years. Payroll has often times been cut more than 10% vs LY (a trend for the last 3 years), while sales goals continue to stay the same. We have received more tools to help get the job done efficiently, and the company has been innovative with how they are developing stores, but it has been difficult to do while  receiving less man power to do so. I feel that with a few minor tweaks and expense reallocation for the company, they have a chance to continue to compete, but working in store will not continue to reap those benefits and jobs will continue to be more challenging."
good,Working the electronics department was fun and I enjoyed helping customers. If you're in electronics most likely you are also in charge of toys department which is no fun at all.
good,Mixture of laid back and strict management. Very physically demanding. Lots of bending and lifting of boxes. Sometimes heavy lifting would be required.
good,"great 4 first job, cashering is pretty easy time goes by when busy, easy paycheck but standing up on feet all day must whear good shoes cud cause potential problems"
good,was advised when hired that they MAY OCCASIONALLY force overtime. Actually they required 10-24 hours overtime per week for 20 of 24 weeks.Would not recommend to anyone.
good,"Target as a whole is good to work for, I have heard. The store I worked at had some problems: bad management. Honestly I worked there so long ago I don't remember much about it."
good,Target worked with my schedule. No real chance in moving up or transferring to another store or position that met my talents and needs. Lots of favorotism and poor etl.
good,"It's a big box store.  You know what you're getting into.  You're a number, replaceable by anyone.  No better or no worse than any other job.  If you're lucky you'll like your coworkers"
good,"Organize boxes that comes off the truck."
good,A typical work day would be making sure customers understand the product that I am selling them. Assisting customers on merchandise. Tiding my section
good,"Target used to be a fun place to work with lots of advancement opportunities, innovation, and constant change. Ever since the layoffs (3 years ago) the management team has been more obsessed with continuing to consolidate roles and send more work to India to save costs while adding more and more workload to it's current team members plates. This has significantly impacted to working culture at Target. Team members who were once happy and collaborative in the spirit of building the brand and driving sales are now mostly concerned with how their decisions will impact their own workload."
good,"Many things that went on sale never showed up on registers and neither did most of the coupons. Management is always changing, they can never retain good management. Very bad about scheduling and making sure people are available to work at those times"
good,when i first started working for target it was a family company and revolved around keeping their employees happy and they treated everyone fairly. when the company started caring more about the money then the family fact of target in my opinion went down hill people started calling out more and not even caring about how they treat the guest with disrespect and it just a cycle and that is the main reason i quit.
good,"it was fine in the beginning. but after they let the seasonal people go, somehow my hours were lessened?? I went from 32+ a week to 18. I'm not sure how that logic works."
good,"wished they would've kept me on after seasonal was over, but apparently there was no room for me on any of the teams there. The people that I worked with there taught me a lot of new, and interesting things."
good,this was a decent job. You do a lot of work for little pay but you can move up if you wok hard. and they care about their employees. that's is the best thing about working there.
good,"Overall not a bad workplace. Management is always working on ways to improve the store, however they will pick favorites. Also not too flexible on schedules"
good,ok not to bad its alright i have worked for better companies and I have also worked for worse. They do have a tendency to expect to much from their team leaders.
good,easy job good for first time job hunters. wont promote you but will try to get you do higher level things for them. hard to get morning shifts because of the people that been there for 5 plus years or older people get them and new and young people get night shift all the time
good,Easy and tedious. Not challenging or motivating. Not a lot of opportunity for growth. There is a lot of pressure to sign customers up for Target credit cards and Target debit cards.
good,"Duties may vary day to day.  "
good,"shipping and receiving, loading and unloading merchandise as well as storing the merchandise in the proper locations, pick and pack merchandise, shrink wrap and stack on pallets"
good,Target is a great place to work if you don't plan on paying any bills. When I worked there I wasn't utilized to my full potential and I took advantage of it. I prefer to be in a workplace that will fully utilize your strengths while helping develop your opportunities.
good,A good place to start your management career. They believe in leadership training and peer mentorship. I think it was a bad idea to start hiring straight for college but that's just my two cents.
good,"Mickey Mouse operations, different rules for different people. A lot of change all the time and many quotas and unreliable staff. Most staff that are trained are fun to work with but not if someone else is brought in and training is not provided"
good,Very boring job. Not as many people buy contract phones from Target as the DMs tend to believe. forced to walk around the store and annoy people about accessories they arent interested in while carrot shopping.
good,when I first started this job I worked on the sales floor and I absolutely loved it. once I decided to move to working as a cashier I began to dislike my job. there was a new shift lead hired that was very rude and I could no longer work with him.
good,"Target was fun. Learned cash register experience and customer service. Not very flexible with schedules, or they would be very upset if you ask time off."
good,"I worked over night so my review can only go so far.."
good,i don't remember i was 18 when i worked there i do remember it was fun the people were cool i left cause i moved i do not remember a whole lot about there policies and procedures
good,Working at target is a great place to learn a lot of entry level skills. The location i worked at like to micromanage their teams but overall coworkers and customers were friendly.
good,Sell the red card's otherwise you're fired. Otherwise it was a pretty chill place. Typical Cashier/Retail job. Extremely similar to Walmart. although Walmart's cash register's are better.
good,"My typical day at Target was standing and checking out 'guests' as they were ready to leave the store. It was nice to meet and greet new people each day. I had one little boy who found my aisle to check him out each time he visited the store. I found that cute, and I looked forward to his visits. "
good,If you can survive the elements and working at a fast pace this job is not that difficult t all. the shifts are not short that is probably the most challenging aspect
good,Full of big company politics. Work is not hard but gets old fast. Many of the associates are unhappy but have no other options for work. If you are lucky to get in to a leadership position the job is much better.
good,Some Leaders on Duty make their feelings known towards one working here. Have high expectations on sales associates having guests open target cards and if not one gets talked to by a team lead.
good,"I was always there early and on time, so I would not be late. I would always give my best to work hard for the hours I earned. Due to the lack of hours that I getting now, I am looking for a more stable working environment."
good,The job was good. It kept you on toes the entire time very fast pace job. You work alot of hours aND they would force you to work more hours. Management was always switched up.
good,"A typical day at work consist of unloading the "
good,Target in national city is very diverse. The hardest thing about the job was waking up at 3am to get to work by 4am. the typical day at work means unloading trailors and stocking merchandise.
good,All you do is cashier. It can get really busy and you are the only one open. Guests that use coupons can take advantage of you if you are new. Most managers are friendly.
good,just a place to work. not a life choice i would recommend to anyone. chill part time but dont get invested in this place unless you wanna stay in retail.
good,"At times the job can be very busy, enjoyable and fun place to work at. Met some nice people who were willing to help out when needed. Always busy sometimes never had a break."
good,"I was hired at target as a sales associate, but because of my open availability I was moved to an early morning (3am-11am) team that unloaded a couple of semis full of product, confirmed its arrival in the system, sorted and organized them into what departments, and spent the rest of the day putting them on the sales floor and pricing/merchandising. Unloading the semis was intense and pretty physical, though it woke me up and got my blood flowing. Stocking and pricing can be frustrating but once you get a hang of the system and do it repetitively for weeks it becomes second nature. Best parts of the job were the customer interaction and you would be paid a dollar or two more for every hour you work before 9. So the majority of my day i received $2 more an hour."
good,"As a cashier, you are the face of Target. Your interaction with the guests will further better their experience at Target. Sadly there is a quota in the sense that they will push for the Target Credit Card, but in all honestly, regardless of that, the place is a good place to get a decent generic job."
good,Company is great with benefits. The leadership from upper management is literally...here are you hours make it work...Guess what. Lots of things will get left undone because they cannot allocate proper hours to their stores.
good,For working there just as a seasonal employee I thought it was a good place to work. The management staff seemed to really care about each individual employee even if they were only holiday help
good,"Good atmosphere, coworkers are very helpful, management isnt to bad when you have managers with work experience.Overall a good place to start your job"
good,I learned a lot in a very short amount of time. I worked at target during the Holiday Season. I feel that I was treated fairly and with respect. I met a lot of nice people.
good,great part time job super targets are great because they are open later so you can go to school and still get in 30+ hours of work a week. When I work nothing was terribly hard just a lot of tedious work but there is a fair amount of walking in a normal 6-8 hour day id walk anywhere from 6 to 9 miles in a day so good cardio
good,Being a seasonal member here was fun. they treated you like you were a normal employee. I would work here again if i had to. Fun times during the holidays.
good,"Close to plenty of food places which is a plus. Team Members get a great discount for items in the store and Target always has tons of different items so you can get some seriously nice discounts. However, training can be rigorous, so be sure to take good notes and pay attention to policy."
good,The Buyer job is changing and its future is currently unclear.  The company is trying to find its way in a digital landscape.  A typical day is made of 60 - 70% CFT/vendor meetings and 30-40% desk time.  Busy days but work life balance is good. Travel is manageable. Leadership is constantly changing.
good,A very large and fun workplace. Management is very good and I learned great social skills and fast customer service. A typical day at work consists of helping plenty customers and checking people out of the store.
good,"I did not really learn anything exciting at Target besides learning how to just stand there while a customer yells at you and calls you stupid. The people that would come into target sometimes would be terrible and have a tendency to treat you like you're nothing. Otherwise, working at Target is actually not bad. I enjoy working at Target or should I say working with the people that I work with. Target is like a big family. Everyone will be your therapist there. It really is a supportive and friendly environment."
good,They help you out and you get breaks. They help you understand what needs to be done and when it needs to be done.  Great work hours sometimes you just have to stay later then what you expect
good,"Its a great first job as long as you don't stay for too long. Working for a corporation so large, your position doesn't matter much and you can be easily mistreated. However, it is great for learning how to use  cash register and basic customer service experience."
good,"Job was okay out of high school. No real chances to move up. The job moved hours a lot and was mostly over night, or early in the AM. Management was good, but no much to make a living off of."
good,Everyday is a different day at work. It is fun and it has its ups and downs. I have learned customer service skills and how to talk to people and my other co workers.
good,Flow Team was not bad good people and fun environment the only thing is limited hours hard to get 40 hours a week with out picking up someone else's shift
good,"Was previously a pharmacy technician to Target Pharmacy before it was bought out by CVS. CVS's computer systems are generally faster in that their load times are slower. Processing prescriptions, however, is not at all faster. With lots of stops and questions the system in place makes you go through many hoops which adds roughly 10 minutes per prescription over Target's systems. CVS management and CEOs also do not care about personal schedules which include college classes and personal family events and will require you skip these events to attend training sessions (which are basically things you would already know or something that did not need to have a training session). They also do not give out raises as well as Target did and have cut the hours across the board for technicians, part-time pharmacists, and floater pharmacy personnel. CVS Pharmacy often feels like you are working for a company that truly does not know what they are doing but happens to have the money to run the business."
good,its a good company. its a good place to advance your career in. the hardest part of the job is black Friday.  the best part about working here is that you get to meet a lot of interesting people.
good,Human resources cash office backroom pricing truck customer service. Schedulling payroll district trainer helpung customers find item s and doing instocks
good,"Great employee Discounts and benefits.  employee discount, C-9 discount.  Employee discounts for travel, movies, hotels.  Pretty good health insurance."
good,"It didn't take long to get hired on as a full team member.  Then it took forever for them to give me a raise when it took others a day or two.  This is a great place for brown noses.  Great people, management isn't that great.  You wont be treated with respect unless you buddy up with a manger."
good,"Physically tiring but the pay was decent enough ($11 an hour) for a seasonal job. The shifts were only 6 hours a night though, so really only works as a 2nd job or part-time job. I only got to work 2 weeks before they let us go because most of the sales moved online."
good,"Target fosters a great customer service environment. Lots of opportunities to build relationships with guest. Poor management follow-up for staffing needs constantly left us short handed, lack of ability to manage talent left us over-staffed after seasonal busy times, leading to low hours for permanent full time employees."
good,The people I worked with as a cashier were really nice and I always got the hours I needed but I was never allowed an opportunity to cross-train or advance beyond cashiering.
good,Did not get paid what I felt was deserved.  Did not receive enough hours.  I loved the people I worked with and the atmosphere that was created from that.
good,Always cut hours or have us leave a couple minutes early. Low pay for being multiple task. Fun team members get a long feels like a family. being able to learn other parts of the stores.
good,"Target just wasn't the right place for me to work, I was under a lot of stress and went into work very anxious every day. Working as a cashier was easy, and the staff was incredibly friendly as well. It just wasn't the right job for me."
good,"It's been years since I worked at Target. I remember enjoying working there for the short time I did. It kept me busy and when there was nothing to do, my supervisors found something for me when we were slow. I got a mix of great customers and bad customers, but you'll find those everywhere."
good,Every day is a new day with new experiences and new skills to learn. That being said lot of projects to work on with a minimal payroll. When we do not make sales you do not get hours.
good,"Good job, decent benefits but hard to raise a family on the wages I currently make. New hires are making close to what I'm currently making, and I have been working there over 10 years."
good,"I thought the experience working at target was very eye opening. Ive heard horror stories about working retail but didn't experience too much of it. Though i will say the customers can be intolerable, i was just lucky. My bosses were strict but fair. I never thought they were out of line with any request or going too easy on me. Overall was a great experience and def would recommend it if someone is trying to get into the work scene."
good,the job environment was fun but was really bad as far as giving hours to their employees. they expected a lot out the cashiers to sell there credit cards.
good,"If you have never worked in retail, everyone should have the experience. Nothing makes you less of a jerk when shopping when you've been on the other side of the cash register."
good,"driving forklift and loading/unloading "
good,"Everywhere you work, there are people you are going to dislike. The managers do try their hardest, but for some managers you wonder how they got promoted. The hardest part is being a team member working for a Team Lead that doesn't respect you or know what they are doing. Favoritism definitely happens, and that could make it harder for you to get promoted or even heard when you have a problem."
good,"It's just another retail job. Scheduling sucks, some co-workers are rude, and the work day is stressful. you're pretty much on your own, nothing much to say about it."
good,It is a good highschool job. Worked well with team and sports schedules. But unless you are a die hard target employee you won't advance far. It must become your life.
good,"Target is a fun place to work at times. However it makes you sacrifice alot naturally because its retail. You spend alot of time away from family, if you value family on the holidays this is not the place for you"
good,"Sort and push clothes"
good,"While the staff consisted of very professional and helpful people, while working as a cashier at Target, standing for hours as at the cash register with the same script for every customer would become quite tiresome."
good,It was a fairly standard retail position. Part time employee with part time benefits working near minimum wage. But no real drama or undue stress. Just your basic retail experience.
good,"I was part time, seasonal at Target, so I do not really know what they are like as a full time Employer, but they made sure that there was always peanut butter and jelly in the break room during the Season."
good,"My friend had suggested that I should try the enchiladas here with the wet green sauce, a traditional Salsa Verde. I was not disappointed; the salsa and enchiladas tasted great! You can taste the freshness and fresh citrus flavor a in the green Salsa Verde. The corn tortillas used had a great corn texture and tasted fresh. The cheese and white sauce on top was the right amount in combination with the shredded grilled chicken breast, as the Salsa Verde took center stage."
good,They were great they love care about your opinion towards the company and respect you when I came to your schedule they will make you feel like if you were at home and if you were a family
good,Target was a nice place to work. y department only had a few workers. We set the store plan o gram shelves and stocked the shelves with the products of the displays that we set up.
good,You cannot trust the open door policy. Management cannot keep issues to themselves. Pay was ok. Just like any other employer doctor notes were a joke and not accepted.
good,I loved working in the stockroom.  We had a team atmosphere and worked together to get goals accomplished.  Focus was always on customer service which is not how most retailers are.
good,"Target is a great place to work, and the people are great to work with. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Target for the time that I did. Throughout the bad times, I enjoyed the experience and grew from learning from my coworkers. It is well recommended for a first-time job."
good,target is fast paced. very busy environment yet friendly place to work. easy to learn multitasking skills there because of the business. being a cashier was a nice experience.
good,Decently flexible hours but some of the higher up staff members had really bad attitudes towards the employees under them. Overall pretty easy work keeping to yourself stocking at night.
good,"Most days at work are laid back and pretty self-explanatory. I learned so much about customer service, quality care, and how to multi-task in a timely manner. Management was good for the most part, but I didn't appreciate the deception I experienced after being hired. I also noticed favoritism among team leads. Most coworkers were super casual, friendly, and often helpful. The hardest part of the job would be staying on top of the daily goal in other departments if there is a sudden peak in cashier lanes. The most enjoyable part of the store is the front end. Greeting and conversing with guests, as well as going over products."
good,"i mainly did closing shifts. So on top of having to take care of guests we also had to clean all the slices, the fryer, the dishes, the dishwasher, the counters, sinks, and windows. Just getting all of that done can be hard on a given night. Then we got a new team lead and now on top of all of that with only 2 people for the night. We also need to slice alot of extra meat to out in our presliced and take out another cart of product to restock the front. Doesnt sound that bad until you factor that one or both people for the night have a half hours break and a 15 minute break. Which all are taken between 4pm and 9pm. It was fine back when both closers came in at 4 and only had a 15 to take. Corporate likes to cut hours to a point where we can barely operate. Then makes it harder to get equipment like walkie talkies and our mydevices. Then i have coworkers who think they're the boss when our manager isnt there. This causes alot of drama and talking behind backs. Hardest part of this job is just keeping up with all of the stuff we have to do. Most enjoyable part is being able to was all the dishes and stuff in the back for awhile you're alone and its quiet"
good,that was a fun job except for getting onto people about redcards. I had a lot of opportunity to advance further into management and felt like I was doing something important.
good,Need comfortable shoes. I realized my back started aching after only working a few weeks. I had really late shifts and it was hard to get the hours I wanted.
good,"Target is OK. I was not at my best mentally when I worked there so I can't give a proper review. They were very understanding however, so that is a plus."
good,Bad it's just not the ki nd of place you want to e pro in bad energy bad moods from the store manager bad everything it's not a very good place too be
good,"Would say that they have a good retainl management system, but just like in any retail environment, you have to be on your toes a lot and get tired easily."
good,the typical work day was pretty easy to handle after the first couple days. Management don't really care about low level employees for the most part. My coworkers really stuck together and made the job fun.
good,"Worked as a cashier and found it really enjoyable to be able to help customers as they check out and it was easy to get along with coworkers but unfortunately for me, my supervisor and i did not see eye to eye on most things and I was convinced that it was because my race was different from hers."
good,"i learned a lot from this job. I was at high volume store so it was always busy, made things go by fast."
good,"Great place to work early in your career. With so many different departments, you can always learn something new. There's so many ways to grow your skills and earn job experience."
good,"Great place to develop ones skill as a leader.  There are many opportunities to practice performance management, interviewing, hiring and training.   Good learning experience."
good,Flow team was very routine. Early hours unloading a truck in order to fulfill the shelves before the store opened. People were great to work with. HR and Management were not so pleasant.
good,reggae party will be his folding clothes counting money usually customer talking to a lot of people . My management was OK could've been a lot better days this hard holding wasn't good for me
good,"It's a retail job, there's not much else to say. I go in, stock some shelves and make the store look nice. It's boring, but easy. Coworkers can be frustrating, but that's any place."
good,"great place to work for flexibility and pay"
good,"I was a cashier and overall it was an alright job, you almost always have a customer. I only worked there temporarily around Christmas time so it was very busy."
good,Target is a nice place to work. I only work there for a short period. the hardest part of the job is staying after work and putting the items back in place.
good,"Good place to work, clean place, and lots of safety.fast learning place, friendly enviroment, extra work over time.  lots to learn, big place to work, everything is organised, machinary."
good,Good company to work for but many unhappy employees working here due to the workload. They give good raises and move people up quickly but if you are stuck in same position it gets boring quick.
good,"Empresa con buen ambiente, no dan tiempo de comida el trabajo es de medio tiempo"
good,A great place to hone leadership skills and interpersonal skills as you deal with individual needs on a day to day basis....good starter pay and good training.
good,"A typical day at work: Helping customers out and as well bring merchandise from the backroom to stock on to shelves. As well cashiering when needed, answering phone calls with customer questions and requests. What  I have learned, is to do the job good each day and improve everyday. As well getting good at learning the merchandise at the other end of the store and knowing what the other items are used for everyday living. Management are nice and easy to talk to about anything. Workplace culture, busy at times and always moving. The hardest part of the job I would say is, telling a customer that we don't have that product that they are looking for in the store, cannot sell the display if the product is not on the shelf or we don't have it in the backroom, I always ask the customer if I should look at a different Target or online. As well when I am cashiering if the customer hands me a coupon and it is already expire I tell them that it has expired already. The most enjoyable part of the job would be to make the customers day when we have the product that they are looking for on the shelf and as well in the backroom, making them happy to shop for there items."
good,I liked working here a lot because of the other workers. They were around my age and we talked a lot . The managers were also young so they were cool people to talk to .
good,Target is an average job. Depending on where you live you may get hours but If you stay in a small town and there is competition like Walmart and K-mart you may get decent hours especially during the holidays but after the holidays your hours are subject to be cut drastically depends on the weekly sales. I would advise to get another job on the side just in case your hours are cut. If you are hired as a seasonal team member this job will last approximately 2-3 months if that. If you miss more than 3 days you wont be on the schedule your will be automatically terminated and no Dr notes will be accepted no exceptions overall I worked in the grocery Department I enjoyed it hated the freezer but it was a good job hard work but it was fun.
good,I like how I could go outside cause I was a cart pusher. I like how there was a lot of hours you could get and swapping with somebody else with shifts.
good,"They will move you around through positions, depending on what is short-staffed."
good,"I've learned that my working place has a new management, one with a lot of experience and the second none at all. But the second boss acts like she has experience by copying the process of the experienced boss. They always call for help on the sales floor, but barely helps our side when we need. Its more on a take then, take and receive kind of thing you receive in a fun and great workplace. They do there process backwards."
good,"working here was ok. Wish it was more flexible with hours and paid more. They don't tell you that you do your job plus the job for others. Overall it was a pretty good experience,"
good,"This job is much like your typical sales position. It was a great place to get a step up to another position."
good,"The day was very long at times. Being the front end, cashier team members are not allowed to road as much as sales floor people are able to roam. The days were long at times."
good,The store has a lot of tourist so it gets very busy. Pay is good and they give you good hours with the opportunity to get extra hours. There is always something to do so your always busy which makes the day go fast.
good,"Great Work Life Balance for Women"
good,Making sure that i get the job done at appropriate timing. I learned that working together with coworkers makes good job efforts. they will help you with any questions that you have so that you can be on task. you deal with a lot of good heart people. Getting things done in the appropriate time frame. knowing that you can talk to management if you have any questions without hesitation!
good,"Target is not great and its not bad, dont go in having high expectations. The coworkers their can be really awful to some of the younger employees, but its still a lot better than working at McDonald's."
good,"Maybe it was just the store I worked at, but I enjoyed my job and loved what I did, but the management staff, especially most of the Team Leads were clueless.  The upper management staff wasn't much better, with a few exceptions."
good,"Overnight shifts are hard. You lose all social life you have, and your schedule is hardly ever stable. The shifts are very long, and tiring. It's a hard job, getting used to the hours, and amount of physical labor you do. Unloading the truck is difficult, but fun. You tend to walk 10+ miles a night, and most likely will work 10+ hour shifts daily. Management wasn't the greatest. Night shift gets shafted on a lot of things, especially lunch."
good,"Great working conditions.professional staff.I like helping people,creating a great shopping experience. My job keeps me very busy alot of mutitasking.I really like working."
good,it was an ok job pay was not that great. if you want a job to get you by this is that job. you just have to deal with angry customers a lot around the holidays.
good,The managers didnt help nor did they try to help out when they werent doing anything. They had poor scheduling. They needed more people when they scheduled on the weekends and less on the weekdays
good,Not a bad place to work at just hard hours. Very short breaks and working almost EVERY holiday. Pretty nice jos just bad with holiday working. Early shifts are better than evening shifts
good,Poorly managed facility that places timed tasks onto your workload without any notification. Constantly changing work experience with little training offered.
good,"Target is a great job for students in college, this job is flexable to your needs, there are many things that you can do when you work at target they have different departments that you can try out. Overall the team members are great to work with, everyone is helpful and friendly."
good,"Management was brutal, employees are underpaid, mostly immature high school students. Good first job, don't expect to be treated as an adult if you work with mostly teens."
good,"This job is good for students, part time workers, etc.  If you go to work and do your job you will not be hassled.  Only thing is that your supervisor will change depending who is on the floor."
good,Expect you to know how to do everything once you start working. Do not always focus on training new employees. Work many days out of the week. Co-workers are very friendly though.
good,"busy days, but learned to be fast and efficient. Most managers were inviting and nice but some were pretty unfair. Black friday was horrible and retail places dont care about employees family. I almost got written up for taking off because of a funeral. Co workers very nice and understanding, very helpful."
good,Day at work was quite enjoyable since the customers were always happy and enjoyed our store. I love the fast pace and the hours even tho it was only a seasonal position I love the experience.
good,Good starter job if your going to school very easy to learn new skills. There are some issues with management they don't take the time show new employees what to do. I had to to run around and try and figure out how to use the cash register. All in all good place to work but needs improvement
good,Management was pretty hard on employees. I was pregnant during the time and I was worked pretty hard. The benefits and job itself are pretty great though.
good,"This job was okay. Hours were mandatory. Photographing children is not easy and with just one studio and 15 minute appointment scheduling, and a 45 minute customer experience we were consistently back up. Customers react off of you."
good,"Run of the mill retail/distribution jobs. Pay is average, benefits are pretty good, they really do care about employees. Location specific details depends on who is in charge"
good,I Really Enjoy Target Because Of How Nice Everyone Is. We All Take The Time Out To Help One Another And Give Eachother Positive Feed Back . It's Just An Great Environment.
good,Target has very poor management and even worst employees. There is a great deal of tension and a lot of favoritism. The work place does not have a positive energy.
good,I love Target as a company and i liked working for the company i just really disliked management at the store location that i was working at it felt like high school a lot of the LODs would always be in a bad mood and take it out on the team members it was just a childish environment
good,"Working for Target was like working with family, some days; you got to know people on your team fairly well and establish cooperative relationships. The work can be stressful, if done properly, and time management can be an issue. However, the higher ups are usually understanding of hurdles and encourage you to do your best."
good,"Required high-paced movement to meet quota"
good,"Target as first when I started working here was a very enjoyable job, up until I started working there more. I felt the managers (some of the managers) were not very nice. The pace for me was a little overwhelming as well, but everything else in my mind was okay. If I has the chance to work there again I would chose to pass on the opportunity but that's only because I am one that cannot keep up with the pace and because the store is a little too big for me. I still somewhat enjoyed working their my co-workers were awesome, enjoyed working with them."
good,"Great for flexibility, management may be hard to communicate with. There is a massive amount of workload as a sales floor employee, not only its an overload of work duties. There is also not enough hours in the day to finish projects."
good,"I can't speak to how the warehouse is now but at the time it was a great place to work.  Great pay, good benefits, great hours and safety was top notch.  Only down side is they seemed to go through management very quickly.  They couldn't seem to keep any one as a department manager for longer than a few years."
good,"They are very intriguing individuals, but everyone is nice and easy to get along with for the most part in my opinion. Stay focused on what you have to do and get done."
good,Lower volume stores with a focus on non pharmacy related daily tasks. Tried to develop own propriatary software and failed. Had to go back to PDX to contiune to operate.
good,"I worked with lots of friendly team members and kept up with fast-paced and efficient job demands. Both employees and customers were kind. I worked on register, and on soft and hard lines of the store."
good,"Front lanes associate: cleaned bathrooms, pushed carts, cover breaks at register, food service, and customer service. Not bad if there were more than one person for the position. When I started, 3 of us were present from open to close. Later, it became 2 people a few ours after opening but still to close. "
good,"Target is a company that puts a lot of ideals and culture on working as a team and helping one another. Theses ideas are wonderful but are rarely followed through and when you finally get comfortable within the company and you wonder if your efforts matters and you think your special the phrase they use to explain the importance of work that team members do is ""Everyone is replaceable"" This is one of my worst cases, but if you get a good manager you can excel and be driven to succeed. Target is not for everyone."
good,I enjoy working Target and some of the great benefits they offer I really enjoy going to work everyday with I can do attitude and being a team player and helping out my other team members when I can (ex team member calls for someone to come outside and help with shopping carts and i get on the radio if we are not busy on the cash register and help push carts in) I also enjoy meeting new guest everday and providing them with the best experience
good,"The team was great, it's what kept me going through the years. It is certainly a demanding work environment and the work-life balance isn't always there. Direction as of late isn't the greatest."
good,Target offers guests a unique experience with lower prices but clean stores and nice variety. Very team oriented environment and there is advancement opportunity. Target likes to promote within.
good,It was a nice place to work. friendly workers. I worked nights so I didn't deal with customers. it was only a part time position so I was only there a couple months
good,I worked here a long time ago but it wasnt a bad place to work for. I was responsible for unloading stock trucks and putting products where they belong.
good,Every person should have to work a retail job at least once to learn respect for their fellow human beings. Many opportunities to learn new skills to use later in better careers.
good,"It's was an ok place to work but after working there for over a year I was still only part time, but other then that it was fine. Interesting place to work."
good,I requested days off for drill and other personal events and they denied everyone i requested but i thought that it was fun none the less but i wish i could have stayed but they didn't accommodate me
good,"came in, started counting inventory and placing them in the right locations in the back storage room. Learned how valuable organization is to be successful. Management team was alright, the Human resource manager was amazing! But majority of others are okay, not the best. Not very motivational at all. Hardest part is that they expect one person to do a job of 4 or 5 majority of the time. Nothing really ever felt like it got done because of no team work in the backroom. Also expect you to carry boxes that need two people or three people to carry, to carry on your own. most enjoyable part was playing ping pong in the break room."
good,"I thought they did a great job expressing what they wanted from me and coworkers. It was very fun working with other team members and assisting customers. I liked a few managers, but I wouldn't say that they were the most enjoyable people to talk to. In particular, I'd say people in the same department as me were the most amicable towards my position, so as you would expect, workers were somewhat separate from each other based on work area. Unclear activity time management (Didn't feel as if they expected a certain amount of work done in a shift)"
good,solid job especially for young people trying to work and go school at the same time.  fast paced environment since target has a good amount of customers.  Long days during holidays and on a weekends.
good,Good place to earn extra money. The management is pretty strict on small things and too easy going when it matters. The crew was very fun and easy to work with.
good,Start the day off by reviewing are performance for the day before.Then fill out safety data check list grab equipment verify every thing that's on safety check list.
good,"Friendly, Ability to work with others,  learn new things, Fulfillment, Self motivated, Guest services, Flexibility, clean, Organization, Customer support, Answer Phone, Online returns."
good,"Very good learning platform. But really bad management. Growth is on the basis of politics and favoritism. Work Life balance is good, Work Culture is really good. Not a good place for South Indian to work in. Dominated by North Indians"
good,Its a very fast in cool job to have if you're young nice people in a friendly enthusiasts work environment. The only downpart is they want you to work 3 days a week six hours a day in half the time you finish two hours before your  shift is up in they  want you to leave.
good,I thought it was a good experience to start employment. I was 17 when I started working at target and I thought it was a welcoming environment that supports and helps for the inside.
good,It was hard work unloading the truck and stocking a full store in a night. Was a great job experience though. I did love how fast paced it was and how quickly the shifts would go by
good,"Overall a good job , just not always constant work . It is also far so you have to leave 30-40 minutes on top of the 15-20 minutes that you have to be early ."
good,"It was great to work thre. Long hours if you wanted them. However, the wages of pay were very minimal. Due to that, I had to find work elsewhere. Still a fun job to say the least"
good,"Working at Target was something I did for a part time, after school gig. I was young and just interested in making a small paycheck. It lasted a year, and I liked the time I spent there."
good,Target has helped me grow in person. It taught me things that didn't know how to do. I helped Target out by giving out Red cards to customers that want it
good,"I was promoted twice within my first three years with Target, but was capped on advancement by that time. Pay is minimal and work is concentrated in hourly, department level leadership. ZERO opportunity for salaried positions without a bachelor's degree or higher. Many 10+ year employees capped out for pay raises with no incentive for further growth."
good,I actually loved my job and most of my coworkers along with the customers. Went to work part time/temporary at this moment. Looking for permanent full time/part time. Even thinking on going back to Target part time. I would prefer to find an office position.
good,"Provide outstanding guest service offer red card, keep work area clean as much as possible. Make sure guest find the items they want and is happy with the service they have received before leaving the store."
good,a great working environment just have to stay busy whole shift.  learned how to be a friendly employee.  love the appreciation they give u on a day to day basis
good,Every day that i would come in to work i would get my equipment ready and i would make my way to the back and i would start my workload. Every one there would pull there weight and would make work very effective and fun
good,I worked as a hardlines worker and it was impossible to climb the team lead ladder. Management was never active with their team and just expected you to do their job along with your own. They didn't care about their employees. I was a team trainer and managed my team more than the actual managers themselves.
good,"A typical night included unloading freight from a truck, distributing product on the sales floor, and tidying up our work areas. We have a pretty close knit group on our overnight team, we have no problems having fun and getting the job done."
good,Es una empresa que leda muy pocas oportunidades a los empleados a postular a un cargo diferente.
good,The employees weren't the nicest people. They changed the hours and wouldn't call and let you know that we changed the schedule and you work today. So it made people late and just not show up to work.
good,"The work is not bad, however the management should really consider getting off of the uppers and toning it down a notch to be received by their associates."
good,Target is a great place to shop. they are stressful and dont treat their employees right. they write you up for missing work 1 time and it was for a funeral. they just try to find any little thing to fire you on.
good,"-Hours are okay if you're just part time."
good,I have been working at Target full-time for nearly 20 years. Alot has changed. There have been good bosses and bad ones. There have been many changes in the past 5 years that make it more difficult to work as a salaried employee than when I started with the company.
good,In and out of trailers all day long loading boxes some heavy some not.Got promoted to a trainer and went several places to train
good,"The shift I worked was great, but when a new manager in he cut hours. Hours that were needed to provide for my family and new baby. The benfits were the best and I loved working for target before that manager came in, he was what made me find a new job."
good,"Meet interesting people, management is understanding, easy to make friends, you get to learn a lot about retail. Gets exciting around the holidays. nice discount given to employees."
good,I had a good experience working as a team leader at target.  I was part of the team that opened up a new store and fresh out of school this was a great opportunity to see new things.
good,"Not the worst place to work, but I've worked at better places, too. As a member of the Flow Team, the hours were minimal except during the holiday season, and the team members varied in friendliness."
good,"It was a good job just wished they gave me more hours Greeted customers in a welcoming and friendly manner. Provided excellent customer service to a diverse group of individuals. Stocked and organized shelves and displays exactly to company's merchandising guidelines as well as used creative and innovative ways to merchandise and display stock. Operated computerized cash register and accurately processed cash, check, credit and debit card"
good,"I enjoyed working for Target, the management were kind and accommodating. It was a busy place which is what I enjoyed most. There was always something to do. It got hectic during the holidays."
good,"Its a good place to work. Unfortunately, the hours that are given are not what i need. I need a full time job. Also, i understand to sell the ""red card"" is apaet of our job description, but why are we being penalized because people say no."
good,"A typical day is usually standing by the door while someone is on the camera. I learned that other coworkers get special exclusions..they can sit in the office while I have to stand by the door. Management could be improved, they fire people without coaching them beforehand what they messed up on."
good,I was hired as seasonal  it was fun work I loved my coworkers and my bosses.  everyone worked as a team and things got done on time.  I would work at target again.
good,Work days are busy and hard on the body. Have a variety of different cultures. I have learned to use a scan gun and work at a fast pace.
good,"loved the environment just not the hours, management is good, target is a workplace that you have to work fast paste but also neatly,"
good,Its a work place you got to interact with many diffrent people. Dealing with customer all day is easy for me but i do enjoy working at target.
good,I never had a problem working for Traget. They were very flexible with schedules. I got several raises in the times I was there. Management was great as well.
good,"The company is rolling downhill in regards to it's requirements for management. In order to be salaried, you need to have a bachelor's degree. There were people who were ridiculously misplaced as managers at a retail establishment. They had never worked retail, and do not get their hands dirty. Its a ridiculous show you have to put on to keep your job. Suck up to your management team, its a popularity contest. "
good,Lots of ater breaks and cool fellow employees large workload with decent pay. However the seasonal employees are almost never hired permanently
good,"I come in I start closing down the production table where we make all of our foods. Clean the cutting boards sanatize the area. I start with frying my last batch of food while making rotis chickens. When they are done you want to temp them and then write it in the log book. Next i would put them out to sell and then go on to finishing the dishes in between I would stop and help the guest because they always come FIRST! It would get crazy sometimes you would get just one guest and then you  end up with a line and it can throw you off your time and schedule. After I go and finish the dishes and then head over and start shutting down the fryers and cleaning that area. When the chickens are done you temp them write them down and then put them out for guest to grab them. If you didnt have the chickens out at 4pm then your supposed to give the guest a coupon for free chickens but you want to make sure you dont always have to do that because they are the main sellers. Sometimes I would have to make 4 batches of chickens in a night sometimes I only had to make 1 just depends. Next you want qmos and that is throwing out the dates that go out the next day you want to make sure to check everything because you dont want anyone to get sick. After that you go and take trash come back put the garbage bags in. Help a couple more guests usually slows down around 7:30pm. After I sweep the production area and around the fryers and mop. The time I have left if im not busy I like to stock whatever we have in the deli cooler from the truck that day and make sure everything is zone and filled, After"
good,"The job was pretty easy, the team was quite supportive and the hours were fair in terms of how much I worked and how much I was given in  compensation. Sadly they went out of business and I lost this job."
good,"While my time being there,it was fun at first, then gets boring after like 3 months.It's retail. Dont be a cashier management hover over your register to make sure that you are asking every guest for a red card."
good,i found them absolutely horrible wont give you your full hours rude management unorganized staff if overstaffed will get sent home which interferes with your pay.
good,Overall it is a good place to work. Although there was little room for advancement. There is also little desire by management to train you to advance. We were quite understaffed for the most part which made the job quite difficult at times. Difficult to meet time goals. Fun was had on a daily basis but at the same time was met with frustration with the lack of equipment to properly do your job in a timely manner.
good,"-young corporate culture."
good,"Target stands for expect more and payless.   Mainly responsible for supervising and helping with stock replenishment & supporting the weekly ad.  "
good,"Target can be a good place to start off at, but as the hours cut back after the holidays it can make paying bills difficult. Luckily the hours pick back up around summer."
good,"Working together as a group to get the job done. Unload the truck, place items on a pallet, then would place them on the shelves. We enjoyed work on seasonal projects. Like setting up for Christmas, Thanksgiving, the fourth of July."
good,You have to have a routine to make your job easier and I learned how to handle customer complaints.  The hardest part of the job was staying focused because helping other customers could distract you from your primary assignment.
good,Target is a good company to work with while you're in college or without a degree to save money. Usually very good about hours given but there will be some bad times like after holidays but it makes up eventually.
good,"Very positive environment, and everyone is respectful. A typical work day is very busy, even on weekdays. In the mornings it gets very boring, you just stand and wait for people."
good,"fun job but the scheduling does not allow for long term planning or family life. Best jobs are those not on front line. Management is all about Red Cards and even if you are a great worker, if you fail to sell enough Red Cards, you are taken aside and spoken to"
good,"I enjoyed my brief time at target mobile, although others might be put off by the sales pressure i experienced. It has been several years since I have worked with Target mobile, and im sure things have changed. But if your a young person and enjoy talking with potential customers, this job is for you."
good,Target was not accommodating when it came to availability changes. The management did not listen to the employees needs. The workplace culture was very difficult to deal with. Teamwork was not prominent and it felt that it was every employee for themselves.
good,it was fun but the store closed and that was a bummer!! cashier and customer service was easy and the co workers were extremely nice
good,This is not target but the third party Target Mobile. It was nice working here it was just low income and not to much room to move up in that company.
good,"A day at Target 2188 was always face paced and never a dull moment. I've learned how to manage other departments such as softlines (clothes) and market which was my favorite. The way those two departments were zoned was different than the department I worked in, hardlines. Management was always around when you needed them and willing to help in any difficult situations. I can say that the most enjoyable part of that job was the atmosphere. I loved the people!"
good,very good starter job especially if you have other commitments. they are very flexible with the schedule and care about the employees. unfortunately there are a few team leaders that should diffidently be trained better.
good,"•Provided friendly advice to a diverse clientele, providing a great customer oriented image"
good,It's a good place to work their teach you a lot very good leder ship I enjoyed working for this company their treat you like family
good,They take care of their employees. They always make sure their stores are in top shape which can sometimes be a hard task. But even during the holidays they do an amazing job.
good,"Lack of hours, pay was ok,  benefit management was OK , I only work 4-6 hours a day only 3 days a week, very busy place, just didn't like the part time hours"
good,"A great environment with very respectful managers and leaders. I enjoyed my time working for them. I appreciate their dedication for their guests, as they always emphasized them as a priority."
good,"I loved working at Target but due to unfortunate plans, i had to move out of state. The employees at Target were outgoing, helpful and understanding. They were a lot of fun."
good,I learned a lot about retail working here. Easy job hours were scarce so I looked elsewhere. Great people and the environment is what you make it.
good,"Target is a great place to work, they really care about there workers and they do everything in there power to make your working experience there is the best."
good,Because this was a job to have after I graduated high school it was something to do. Not a lot of room to move up and hours are horrible. helps you to control temper.
good,Working at this company was a hard working and rewarding experience and would like to be able to do it all over again at any Target in my local areas.
good,"Depending on where you work there will be work to do. I've learned a lot of leadership skills and just biting the bullet. Managers here are okay, but when it becomes a concern they don't want to deal with the issue so you have to go to HR. Co-workers make the job easy sometimes if you're a people's person."
good,It's a job that is pretty fun and the people are very welcoming. I love people so I thought it was very fun seeing new faces every day as well as the normal customers.
good,"Daily routine was that of a store associate"
good,"The environment here was very friendly and very laid back,. Happens to be one of my favorite stores, so I was super excited to work here. If you like retail i suggest this job."
good,Awesome human resources department. Fast paste so your days seemed to go by very fast. learned a lot about face to face customer services.
good,"I was not altogether unhappy there. Sadly, Target wasn't prepared for the challenges of the Canadian market. Nevertheless, there was something very special about being involved in a new company from the very beginning. There were challenges and there were conflicts, but initially, at least, there was a good group of people working toward a common goal.... Overall a good experience."
good,It is a very ideal place to learn when you just graduate because the boss is very friendly and helpful. He is willing to teach you everything you need to know in all aspects of career. Young and dynamic team members make you feel like home.
good,Check my numbers for the day daily goals get with other team leaders and start out meeting with the team to tell them about what expectation are for the day.
good,This is also another job where it doesn't really pertain to the medical field at all because all I was doing was ringing items out. I didn't really enjoy this job that much later on having real jobs in the medical field.
good,"I would go to the backroom and every hour on the hour we would pull items to be pushed to the floor."
good,"they'd offer you a raise or tell you that you're going to move up in the company, and then once you're doing a harder job that offered more pay they wouldn't give you the bump in $$$"
good,i enjoyed working for target distro center. we have a good inbound a-1 team.i hate leaving the job but my family is growing and i want to be closer to my family
good,The shift hours varies. The pay does not correlate with the job activities. More work and less pay. The executive team leader are rude to their coworkers and favor the opinion of the customers over the cashier during analyzing conflicts of interest.
good,Store management is not all that present. It sometimes feels cliquey as they are all superior to you. I've learned that having this job in high school provided me with the insight to want more for myself then a just a team member.
good,lavoro dinamico e avendo lavorato in ambinti pubblici mi sono trovato bene è stata un esperienza divertente
good,"Come in to work, have a list waiting for you to complete before your daily work. Stop what you are doing to help out at registers. I enjoyed working here but it wasn't for me. I wanted to move up and I saw no way of that happening. Asked to be cross trained in other areas and they stated they would get back with me, or had to work there for a year before they would. Asked to train in other areas than what I was hired for and never got a response."
good,"Depending on how you feel about sales, its an okay job. I did not began to enjoy Target until I became an Asset Protection team member. I hated the Sales Floor Team Member experience."
good,I learned good team working skills there and everyone was very helpful with anything. Working with target actually helped me be a better team player..
good,"I would mostly be at the  cash register for most of the day"
good,"Its easy enough work but to progress is another story. Not a bad job for beginners but not for the experienced. If you can, avoid this job. Nothing but heart ache."
good,can get crazy on the schedule sometimes but you can pick up shifts if you want more hours. selling red cards is not a must but should be done.  great co workers.
good,"Target had a great, friendly atmosphere. I enjoyed getting to be a part of their friendly customer service team, especially around the holidays. I loved getting to interact with customers."
good,"A typical day can be either very hectic or very slow. The pay is minimum wage, and the raises are by a few cents. Management changes to often, which can leave employees slightly confused."
good,"I loved working for target , the staff was friendly and helpful. Everyday was exciting and even though it was seasonal I loved the experience."
good,Its a good company it has a good pay but i dont like that we stand 12 hrs without siting hopefully that changes in the future but other then that its a good company
good,"A typical work night includes unloading of the truck, merchandising freight and back stocking overstock. Staff is friendly, turnover is high and a abundance of hours are required."
good,"Working at target "
good,"As a SalesFloor Team Member: "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and helping them around the store. Also the great feedback from the customers was very enjoyable.
good,It was your typical store   hours where good fast pass heavy lifting of on floor. Got over time when needed help was always there. Target was I different environment if you like long hours crazy day it will be perfect
good,I worked at the Starbucks inside of a Target. I loved the job. It was very exciting and I LOVE COFFEE. This was a perfect fit.
good,"As a cashier, it was the same thing every day. I prefer to move while I work and work with my hands. I got ""cabin fever"" during my 8 hour shifts. There was little diversity in dealing with the register duties as well."
good,"The people at the Target DC is really nice to each other and tries to help each other out when needed, but when it comes to work pace it is very fast."
good,"I worked for Target for six years. By the time I took my leave, I had been cross-trained in every area of the store, learned how to close down registers, and cover manager's shifts when they couldn't come in. I enjoyed my time there and it had its ups and downs as any job might. My only regret was that there was little opportunity to move up while working there. I was given the blessing of knowledge and learned many skills that were not easy to obtain, however though I was trained to cover manager shifts and close the store, I would never see myself promoted. It is because of this I had decided to leave and chose to focus my work into school instead."
good,Some good coworkers good management friendly customers. Didnt like I had to work outside in a blizzard but overall it was a good work environment. Glad I had the opportunity to work there.
good,"Responsible for unloading 150-200 boxes off of a truck using a RC lift and receiving them using a RF scanner. Most of my co-workers in inbound were very cooperative as well as some of the supervisors, however there are a few supervisors there that do not respect some of the warehouse workers and treat them unfairly. The hardest part of my job was doing all that I could and giving my work 110% of everything that I have in me for the day and not being appreciated for it, but instead told by one of those supervisors that I was not meeting Target's standards. The most enjoyable part of the job however, was getting to work with a diverse set of co-workers in my department who work just as hard as I did and were very cooperative and had very friendly and helpful attitudes. Most of them also did not get treated fairly or respectfully."
good,"The culture at Target is one of the best and makes it a fun place to mingle with co-workers off and on the clock.  The only disappointment is that Target management picks and chooses who they want to advance.  You can be an excellent worker but if you don't kiss someone's feet, good luck advancing."
good,"I won't lie, the company is a great company to work for for a large handful of people. But the underlying message an culture of business there is just not right. There is so much money going around being wasted and not paid to the people who work there. It's a shame."
good,Fast paced and friendly environment. Don't have to worry about customers being in your way and you have 8 hours to finish what you start.
good,"Is a great place to work to supplement income . . . culture is okay yet very corporate, if that's what you are in to. Twenty words."
good,Target is a ok company to work friendly employees. Not hard to unloading trucks and stocking. The scheduling was easy to follow gave me days off when I needed them off.
good,Good environment fun good hours good lunch break good people quiet just do your job and go home always show up on time bring your own lunch and drinks
good,"Very hot, very cold, doesn't matter. You'll be outside! I've learned patience and cooperation and how to deal with irate customers. The management was very homely but professional. My co-workers did their job correctly but seemed less intuitive. Hardest part is having enough water in my system. If you like to work outdoors on the hot blacktop!"
good,"Smaller brand owned and operated by Luxottica, which was a little less stressful. While the pricing was better than at Lenscrafters, the options for customers were limited."
good,"Typical retail job. Long holiday hours and little pay. Target is not as bad as other retail stores. They do promote a positive work environment but at the end of the day, its a numbers game. How the store does the prior week will depend on how many hours are to come. No one can survive on 32 hour one week and 8 the following."
good,"Target is a pretty good place to work in general, it really depends on the Management of the store and how employees are treated. I have worked at a few different stores and some really treat their employees great."
good,"Holidays are not observed appropriately.  Black Friday should happen on Friday, not Thanksgiving day.  Employees should be able to spend Thanksgiving with their families.  Is Target really so greedy, that they will do anything to make more money, even if it is at the expense of their employees.  Have some respect."
good,"É uma boa empresa para quem está começando e precisa adquirir experiência, possui bons profissionais, mas não tem espaço para crescimento."
good,"The environment was fun and friendly and management was always kind and willing to help. Unfortunately, opportunities for advancement and benefits were only available to full-time employees, and pay didn't align with my needs."
good,"typical day involves stocking shelves, ringing customers at the register, and organizing every aisle before closing every night"
good,"workers were pleasant and fun to work with , management was not. The hours were early mornings . they kept changing your work duties and were always short workers thus expecting more out of those who showed up for work."
good,I worked at Target while attending college. I was able to have flexible hours and shifts. They worked great with my school schedule. It was a good job to have and paid well for being an entry level position. I gained great  customer service experience.
good,Overall I enjoyed working here. Yes it was a hard job but employees are pretty awesome but they had unbelievably high rates
good,"A typical day at work is a manager or supervisor greeting you at the door before clocking in. After clocking in i walk to the back of the house where there is a truck waiting to be unloaded."
good,"Target in Albany,GA is a great place to work but the bad thing is the hours suck. You work with a great bunch of people and they are friendly and willing to help in any way. They do provide food for team members every now and then and also they have fun activities to participate in at work or off the clock."
good,"It is a great job if you are just starting out. The base pay is great. The managers may not be the best, but they are not as terrible as some I have dealt with."
good,"Management went bad. "
good,Its a great place for advancement if youre willing to do a lot of work and kiss a lot of tail. The problem is that most internal hires don't make as much as new people who are hired for management roles. This is common with most companies though.
good,Used to schedule me unreasonable hours. I am a single mom and full time student. I do not need to be rushing from school straight to work and working until closing at that
good,"night shift is always good to people who like to sleep in'"
good,The job really doesnt proved any hours to workers. You have to really be  a favorite or something and they do not want to transfer you when you ask to be transferred. Overall if you dont have to work for them then dont
good,"It was an ok place to work. Hours were early mornings, so if you don't like to work overnight I wouldn't take that position. Leadership was cool, but not very helpful."
good,"Work environment is fast paced & friendly but management is something to be desired. Higher-ups tend to make decisions based on favoritism & have at times been unprofessional to team members. Management can be unreliable & all HR issues are redirected to online. Hours tend to be cut for regulars when a new round of hiring happens. Pay is not as ""competitive"" as it could be. Team members are trained and asked to do multiple jobs, sometimes simultaneously, but will not be compensated for the extra effort; even if you perform job duties above your pay grade."
good,I had lots to learn at Target. First was to learn how to use a PDA. A PDA was our device to complete our workload. I use to ticket and stock merchandise on the floor to be ready for guess to buy.
good,"The HR manager wasn't very respectful or understanding towards any of the team members. Besides that, I would love to return to the company as long as the HR manager is to be replaced."
good,Friendly co-workers. Opportunities to learn different areas of the company within the warehouse. Every day you do something a little different within your department so it's not so monotonous.
good,Target is an alright place to work. You'll meet nice co workers and get to enjoy new faces. Every now and then you will get the pleasure of meeting rude guests that thinks they know the returning policy. Other than that I enjoyed myself working security for target
good,The job always kept me busy and that was a good thing because it made the day go by faster but it was always cold in the back room and the gloves they gave us really didn't  help but all and all it was a good job with great hours.
good,Hard work but well compensated. The job was challenging and some of the managers were not easy to work with but has good compensation and benefits.
good,"The merchandising department had a terrible culture.  Homogenous work staff, and extremely political environment.  High school like cliques rule this Target department."
good,"It was a very fun environment a lot of great employees as well, as long as everyone does there job its very basic and easy. A typical work day is unloading trucks and keeping back stock down."
good,"This job was my first job out of high school. I started working at Target the end of my Senior year of high school as a seasonal employee during summer and winter breaks from college. I never had a job before, and this job was a great stepping off point for a green 18 year old. The responsibilities were not difficult: fold clothes, keep the store looking good, help out the guests. The people I worked with were very easy to talk to and work with. The hours were long. I worked closing shifts, and even though the store closes at 11pm, many times we would not be out of the store until midnight. Being on your feet for 10 hours with little breaks takes a toll. It got to a point where it wasn't worth it to me anymore."
good,"It's a good job if you enjoy a fast pace, lots of change, interacting with different kinds of people, and working on holidays."
good,It was okay I had a nice experience the manager was very nice and was willing to take out time with employers if needed. It was kinda a different because we had the mcdonalds play land so I was able to interact with different kids from all ages....
good,"Worked for 4 years as a contractor. 3 years without a raise. No benefits, no pto, no 401k. Nothing. Im very concerned contractors can be kept on for so long legally without opportunity for full advancement."
good,I worked there for 7 years. I loved it for the first couple years then new management came in and made working there a living nightmare. They care more about getting the product out than about the safety of their employees.
good,Delivered excellent customer service. I scanned items that were out of stock. Also worked on the register and helps customers at check-out. helped customers locate items on the sales floor.
good,"everybody on time,since of urgency pumping thru our vains,I love working with others,the hardest part was picking up others slack"
good,"I was the cart attendant most days which meant I was the go to person for any and every odd job. I was exhausted by the end of a shift.  As cart attendant you have your on responsibilities/deadlines that must be taken care of  and met whether you've had to stay on cash register for 2 hrs as backup.  Managers would blame you for not having things done even when you've been helping them the entire shift.  That being said, most days ran somewhat smoothly."
good,"Target was a great place to work, Too bad they closed down. You got great hours and could pick up shifts whenever you wanted. I enjoyed working at Target."
good,"job duties include stocking shelves, maintaining a clean work environment ,assisting in sales, and performing cashier responsibilities, in some cases."
good,not enough hours.they dont give most people over 20 a week.people are friendly though.they do help out there staff if they have a problem.most people are nice.
good,"This is a fast paced position. You must know how to calculate fast in your mind, especially when a cashier asks for change. Along with being a cashier, I also had to cover the return desk."
good,"Great benifits working at target such as, time and a half, holiday pay, sick hours, and great flexibillity with hours. Overall I loved the job I just hate the constant pressure to promote red cards and the scolding for not receiving as many applications as other workers. Too much drama and not enough pay, no recognition or incentives for getting red cards. Overall Target is a great company just horrible management at my store location."
good,"A typical day at work in management as a team leader or higher is pretty hectic. You would have to constantly have sales planners up every week, run the ad takedown and setup, and provide A+ customer service while ensuring entire store is operating properly."
good,Target was a descent place to work. I got waking with everybody managers were nice windy very helpful during the shift. Got a lot of good hours early every week. If I could I would go back there again.
good,A typical day at target was just stocking boxes and zoning. i learned how to use a forklift there. My manager was very nice & professional. MY co-workers was great they got the job done as well as me. It really was not hard to me. The best part of the job was the team members stuck together to get the job done.
good,A typical day at target begins with great customer service being on time. My co workers are excellent we all work together as a team.
good,work hours varied. They didn't really let you do to much over about 30 a week . No real room for improvement. also not much raise wise. They also teach some people more stuff and others none.
good,A typical day at work entails all the employees getting stretched thin. No guaranteed amount of hours. I love working with my team and I love the guests that come in. Mangagement has a high turn over rate. Mangagement not effective communicators.
good,"Overall I think that management needs to be reevaluated because there was a lot of harassment and management didn't do anything. The Co-workers were very nice to be around, I learned a lot about the company. The hardest part about working at target was talking to managers that don't want to hear about what's going on or do anything about it."
good,"They run a tight ship at Target. There are quotas to meet, and everything is run on a pretty tight timeframe, as most of the work needed to be done before the store opened. We unloaded the truck onto pallets, which were then brought to the sales floor. We moved the product from the pallets to the shelves, everyone working in predetermined locations throughout the store. My issue was the schedule writers disregarded my schedule limitations frequently. It was very important that I got off work at a certain time because I had a second job (which I had been at for much, much longer) that I had to get to after my shift at Target ended. They also scheduled my for Sundays several times, even though I requested not to work then in my initial paperwork. Also there's no medical, dental, or vision coverage for part-time hourly workers, and almost no one gets hired full-time except management. They just keep hiring a bunch of part-time workers to get the work done without having to provide insurance benefits. That's speculation, but I'm 98% sure."
good,"A typical day at work would normally start off me assigning each of my employees a task. Once they are assigned there task I go into the office and collect time work and acquire for absent employees. Than I head out on the filled going to different stations depending on where my employees where assigned."
good,it was always fun working with others and satisfying customers. the hardest part of the job was dealing with different people. the most enjoyable part of the job was working with friendly people.
good,"Target was great with working around my school schedule and the job paid great! Management on the other hand was not all that great. Between having hours cut and being talked to very rudely, many employees have left. Besides the bad management, I loved working there. I got along with each and every one of my co-workers!"
good,"I worked here for 2 years and there where good times and bad times. As a cart attendant they expected you to work by yourself, while they had the other cart attendants do nothing."
good,Interacting with guests is fun. I'm always helping out and it makes me feel accomplished. As a smaller department in the store I have few direct co-workers but all of them are great. The hardest part of the job is having to tell guests when we can't make their order.
good,I enjoyed working with target i learned many new skill with the cashier and softlines. I was able to work with a nice pace and friendly team that helped get the jobs done
good,"Its a typical day at work with good co-workers. "
good,the management was great and the co- workers were very helpful and friendly. sometimes there were moments where there were lack of teamwork due to management. target is really fast pace job if u slack you can fall behind in your work quickly.
good,"Good for a retail job. It is retail hours, with long holiday and summer nights. This Target seem to work well together. This is a great place for college kids."
good,"- Fast paced environment with a need for leaders who are adaptable and open minded. "
good,"Always push you to achieve the next level, but sometimes push too hard. Management tends towards favoritism"
good,Working at target was a great experience. I got hired around the holidays and loved the whole energy of the place. Met cool people and help plenty families find everything they were looking for when i could. Making sure the sales floor stayed stocked.
good,"Work is flexible but they tend to not schedule you for a lot of hours. The pay is also pretty low and with hours being cut, it makes it hard to survive."
good,"I learnt how to organize many things."
good,"I enjoyed working at target because they would give you a set amount of hours depending on your availability. However, the management was under par and team effort was scarce. It was hard working with coworkers that didn't want to do anything over their normal duties. Things such as helping another coworker with product searching and carry outs which are mandatory of all employees. The hours were great but it was hard getting certain days off that were necessary for my health."
good,"Target is a very fast paced Big Box retailer. A typical day involves stocking the floor, ordering supplies, merchandising your area, register audits, training new hires and peer mentoring."
good,"There was never much to do, i always just organized clothes and shoes. occasionally would get called to the register, but it was rare."
good,its a alright place to work if you want a realy physical job. The management is fair to there employees. The hardest part if the job is getting used to all the physical work.
good,Customer Service is my days motivation. Cashiering gives me the opportunity to quickly help people with there grocery trip and provide a happy smile and a how are you today question.  I have learned that being in a good state of mind will reflex on the customer two most of the time. management is has always been ready to help out with question or concerns with myself and customers needs. my co-workers I feel are also there to provide a good shopping experience. The hardest part of the job is seeing customer have to wait in line to pay and leave when it has long lines.  My most enjoyable part of this job is socializing with customers and there families.
good,Target has always been willing to work with my different school schedules even when I got promoted. My current store has a high turnover rate.
good,"You can never advance in this job, but it is a good first job for college students and kids in high school. The pay isn't the best but it's okay for starting out."
good,"This was my First job and it taught and challenged me alot, which helped with my development.You get what you put in. so if you want to gain serious skills work your but off. Not a place for everyone! it may be a temporary job or a place for you to grow within the Company."
good,A fast fun and Friendly environment to work at. Work as a team to get through a productive day of work. Ensuring the Logistics process is 100% on a daily basis.
good,A Typical Day At Work Is Managers Always Down Your Neck Asking About Red Cards. I Learned That Not Many People Want Red Cards Which Ate Credit Cards.My Co workers was Nice And Quit. The Hardest Part Was Getting The Red Cards The Most Enjoyable Part was The Three Breaks You Recieve Each Shift.
good,"I started this job in highschool as my first job. At the time I started it was a fun, enviroment. Then as management changed things started to get different. Instead of caring about helping guests it turned into a competition on who could get the most red cards and sell the most things. Managers would talk to you if you did not push the red cards on people. They would favorite the people who got lots of red cards, and they would get praise. There was literally amost no chance of getting promoted at my Target, only one sales floor member ever became a Team Lead. Another problem I found was that most managers would watch people and tell them what to do, but it would be way over what someone could do with the time they had. While they did that, the managers just watched and didn't help. I am so glad to get out of this job, and many of my co-workers are leaving as well."
good,This was my first job and the pay was actually well for me to be 16. If you are under 16 then you have to be off work no later than 9 (company policy)
good,I love working for this company.They has great customer service and health benefits. I love my pay checks
good,Working at Target was a good experience. I learned a lot in my role in Customer Service. As a cashier and working in Guest Service you will be BUSY on the weekend!
good,shipping and receiving and put labels on product so it can be sent to stores or for storage some loading of products so it can be delivered to the stores
good,"I felt a lack of leadership from my team leads and store manager. There was no opportunity for me to grow within the company. My fellow team members were also dissatisfied with the work environment overall. I appreciate the growth I have had as an individual in my time with the company, however my experience could have been much better."
good,Target is not a bad place to work but they don't pay well. I was happy working there because that gave me a lot of experience.
good,"Target is a good company pay could be better, as well they can help their employees, if you do not have a full time position at target, they will work you to death no consistenceny with schedule or hours."
good,I had an amazing experience working at Target. Luckily I had the opportunity to work with an amazing team.  Very sad the company wasn't succeeding in Canada I would definitely work with the same group if I could. I recommend Target to everyone !! Amazing deals and great collections.
good,"Worked ten hour days "
good,"high expectations, low hours, leadership was not friendly. Met great people.met a few famous people that were shopping."
good,"While working for Target, I loved working with customers and helping them look for their everyday needs. There were times where I just wanted to quit because it could be so stressful."
good,It was easy work but the management  lacked communication skills. The co-workers were cool people and i enjoyed that it was fairly easy work.
good,"I learn how to use the price guns for stocking, the managers they were ok, my co workers were some nice people, they were no hard part about this job, I enjoy working in retail."
good,"I enjoy working for Target while I was a pharmacy intern.  When I became a pharmacist manager, I was given a lot of responsibility.  I definitely learned through that experience"
good,I am very busy every day. I have learned the Customer Service Desk. The people are nice to work with. The hardest part of the job would be the standing.  The most enjoyable is talking with the customers as they check out.
good,"kept me busy which i loved, great store, great people. i loved what i did there, great discounts and deals working there. always on good terms and everyone communicates"
good,"good work life balance good people horrible hours, not enough employees. at times, they would keep staff there for hours after closing to finish joining up the store"
good,you have to be built for overnight stock.the people are ok and you need to be able to meet time and follow directions..fast paced and you need the team work mentality
good,"its an okay job not a career"
good,The workload and basic day to day operations were simple enough to learn but how this store was facilitated and operated was below average.
good,"Very demanding work schedule and a lot is put on your shoulders, even if you cant control it. Great pay and benefits but it might not be worth the stress you endure."
good,Very fun part time job. Started a long time ago and am still doing it but full time now. Would recommend to college student.
good,My typical day at work was unloading truck in the morning. When coming off truck we would sort thru the boxes and take them where the belong in the store.
good,"The management is ok as long as you aren't against their policy. An easy job, an great started job. The company has great option to advance. Managers always change."
good,Target was a good first position that allowed me the opportunity to learn and grow. In the end there is no work/life balance and Target does not think of their employees first.
good,Havent had any issues. I arrive to work on time clock in do my shift greet customers kept it professional and friendly.  I learned to be more patient and learning to use the register more efficiently. The managers were very nice. My co - workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job is knowing the difference between being to friendly and not knowing people are manipulating you to get their way also people who like to agrue tend to make your job alot harder. The most enjoyable part of the job is actually keeping busy and meeting new friendly faces.
good,Friendly work environment with engaging coworkers. The management turn over rate is so high; every month we had to follow all new rules and priorities.
good,"Typical day at work is very busy during seasonal and dealing with customers is not that bad. I learned that good co-workers make the enviornment much more bare able and makes you work better. Our store manager was excellent. Verry helpful,welcoming and was a team player. Hardest of the job was managing mult. sections by myself and being ran all over the place understaffed a time.Most enoyable part was being with my friends/co-workers. They made working there easy and fun."
good,"A typical day at work consists of answering guest questions and concerns, problem solving. making sure the guests are happy and will come back and shop at target. If there are any price concerns i am the one who helps the guest out with making sure the price is what they saw it for. i am a leader and my cashiers have alot of respect for me."
good,Target is a company with permanent hours. The employees are treated as family and the discount was a good deduction. I enjoyed stocking because its time consuming and the is work is always available its fast paced and time goes by.
good,"Target is a diverse company to work for.  They are an expect more, pay less driver.  They ensure everyone gets breaks. They are big on teamwork."
good,Orgnized and friendly company to work for you get to know everyone there and become a big family. The do parties at the end of the month for every birthday and feed you lunch on thnakgiving for blacxk friday
good,"i had a few issues with scheduling that had come up and gave me trouble to getting to work for opens because of bus scheduling, and they didnt really wanna hear any of that."
good,I've learned how to work together as a team under very poor management.  The work was very strenuous however I felt unappreciated as a hard working employee.
good,"There was always a strong sense of leadership on any given day."
good,"very loud and productive I learned better customer service skills , I would say the management wasn't the best, but my coworkers were very awesome I loved them, the hardest part of the job was the drive thru, and the most enjoyable was serving the customer"
good,"Not a challenging job, high management turnover, demotivated workers not showing much ownership for the position they hold."
good,working in electronics is decent. you must know product information but if you dont it is okay to use phone and double check if you are unsure.
good,Good binefits but was not the place for me to work for. Staff was easy to get along with but I really didnt like the managers. They would give you complents but then they would judge you on your performance. I felt that they really never saw my true patential there so I just decied to leave.
good,"This job was okay, just be prepared to handle working in all of the elements (especially if you live up north). But I cant say much about the job since I only worked there briefly."
good,"Opportunities for growth are present, Learn a lot in regards to retail management and cutting payroll and driving sales. Thinking strategically in regards to prioritizing workload for present day."
good,Target can be a good place to like the motto fast fun and friendly coworkers are awesome juts management can make a big difference whether its going to be a good day or a bad day
good,"When Target first opened, everyone was excited to work there. Hours were plentiful, the management jubilant and my coworkers were fantastic. After a year, though, much of the spirit was gone and much of the old staff was replaced or left, and the store took on a more dreary tone. By the time I left, cashiers would have to forego breaks since we did not have enough people working to cover for us."
good,People are nice and everything but the workload is a lot for the little pay. the hardest thing of the job is to finish on time because usually one person does the job of 3 and the supervision lacks all the time.
good,Relaxed workplace that allows you to work at your own pace. The specialist role can have a glass ceiling as there is no real movement.  Your skills as not considered as much as how much as you can network.
good,A typical day at work is very busy and hectic at times. I have learned a lot by being in this positon. My co-workers are great to work with.
good,"Typical day at work consist of clocking in running the register and keeping the customers happy. The hardest part of the job was keeping your register times down. We would have to ring up items in a certain amount of time to keep it from going into the red if it was red majority of the time you would get a warning the written up and so forth. Sometimes you couldn't control the times due to the system running slow or slower customers. "
good,"Although I love Target and working for the company, my store in particular is taking a turn and going downhill. The management doesn't pay too much attention to the needs of their employees and they do whatever is best for them even if it is an extreme inconvenience to the employee."
good,"Even though it was a part-time job at a retail store I appreciated the introduction into corporate work experience. As a human resources team member, I had quite a few responsibilities, which were mostly to tend to the many different needs of my fellow team members. I liked having so many different tasks because I was being challenged and it made the shifts go by a lot faster."
good,"Good company to work for, very fast paced work, great benefits and co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is productivity numbers and long hours."
good,"I enjoyed some aspects of this job, but the scheduling drove me crazy. I was going to school full time and they would schedule me upwards of 30 hours a week. Very frustrating at times."
good,"You work, sometimes you're appreciated, sometimes you're not. Mostly the latter. Cool people though. Six more words to complete this."
good,"I've had good management and bad management at Target, it can be a heavy stressful workload if your management is unsure of what they are doing and a very rewarding job if the management and their team feel competent."
good,target was my very first real job. This job taught me to be independent and how to manage my time. I worked in all departments and job duties were to provided fast friendly service.
good,"I worked here fulltime as a college student. I was always slammed with work, promotional things and huge lists of tasks to complete. it was a big tasks for trying to maintain a nursing degree."
good,"Slow days , i learned to stock , my supervisor were good . co-wokers were excellent. The hardest part of the job stocking things 50 "" in the air"
good,Working with lots of people on a daily bases. Lots of problem solving and fast thinking. Good people and always something different every day.
good,Enjoyed working with coworkers and running cashier and pushing carts. Had some issues getting final pay check after leaving for college.
good,"A typical day at work was a fast, fun, and friendly environment where customers and associates got along and worked together to achieve weekly goals. What I learned at the job is, how to please the customer with fast efficient accuracy on the cash register and after asking is there anything else I can help you with, the hardest part of the job was organizing and sorting out cards in the card center. The most enjoyable part of the job was being greeted by well known customers with a smile."
good,"There's always something to be done, of course, but with the duties as a GSTL, you're always multitasking, serving the guests while trying to maintain store brand/cleanliness. You're always on your feet.  Never stop moving or resolving issues. Constantly solving issues."
good,"Definitely a job just to help get through college. It's a decent place for a first job but difficult to make any advancement beyond associate or specialist, at least in my experience having worked there 5 years. Management never seems to promote from within."
good,"a typical day consisted of evaluating grocery freshness and stocking in demand items. management is flexible with individual needs of each team member. requested time off is always granted if requested in reasonable time. fellow team members are always friendly and open to assisting one another in times of need. the most enjoyable moments at target include rewards for goals met, enticing each team member to ultimately strive for the same goal."
good,"Target can be a fairly enjoyable place to work. It is a very good starter job and will definitely work with your school schedule so you can go to work and go to school and not have any conflicts. One complaint is that those who are hired on as managers don't necessarily have any experience on the floor, which can create conflict between management and staff."
good,"réception d'appel, inbound"
good,My day at work is very short. It always depends on how large the truck is on how many hours I work. The most enjoyable part of the job is that once a month we have a pot luck. I enjoy my co-workers. Even though I'm disabled they never treated me differently.
good,they work you like crazy. the employees were fun to work with and I wouldn't mind going back if they increased the pay. Targets also has a lot of great discounts and promotions for their employees.
good,a normal work day as usual.Testing navigation systems for ford.managment is great they make sure you get the better understanding of what you're doing before you can move forward.I've gotten alone with most all my co-worker and became closer to each other within a week.Hardest part about the job was scanning the product into the system to make sure that they work properly.working in my own station was fun
good,This was my first job. This job helped me understand the value of hard work. I learned to be a disciplined student and worker through employment here.
good,"Never a still moment, always work to be done. I enjoyed the repetitive system of filing and calling in, especially starting off with that, then building into the more creative side. I would have loved to stay there indefinitely, but it is a small shop and run phenomenally single handedly by one person, and she needs hands on for Holidays, but not much else. I could have stuck around long term as an on call team member but there was much unknown, too few hours."
good,"the job taught me how to cash handling as well as operate plenty of machinery, I also learned customer service, had the pleasure OF MARKETING CUSTOMERS AND THERE REQUEST"
good,A typical work day requires you to pretty much do everyone else's job including your own and getting a list of things to do throughout the day as you work on it you get more added to it. There is so many different bosses they they don't even know what's going on with each other. They also expect you to be in multiple places at once. A job at Target requires you to be a magical fairy and you lose your sanity. It makes you feel like you're back in high school dealing with what you have to do. The only good thing that comes out of the job is some of the people you meet that actually want to do their job and want to help.
good,"nice place to work. management provides the help and training you need and also good benefits. Fun atmosphere, friendly co workers and nice location."
good,"making sure customers question and problems are solved ,provided information on policies and procedures , dealing with ending and beginning cash ."
good,see other notes re: same as any other warehouse job clock in and out and nothing  too unusual. Seasonal only so if it wasn't I'd still be there
good,Pharmacy ran effectively and efficiently with the primary focus on guest service. Customer service and guest interaction could be a primary focus of the pharmacy.
good,"I only work five hours a day three days a week and hope to find a part time job to fill the rest of my hours. I have been with them many years and like the environment and benefits so I want to continue with them. I have changed positions seven times and enjoy the change."
good,i learned how to be faster in my workplace.  my co-workers were helpful and diligent.  the hardest part of the job was getting through the first week.
good,"A typical day at work is purely productive as there is always something to do. During peak season it can be demanding at times but with the right leadership the team is more than capable of enduring. Working for this company allows you to learn many things. Among those skills the most important being communication. All day communication is required whether you're connecting with guest or your team and as a result improves your interactive skills. One thing the company lacks however is accountability when it comes to attendance. When one or two team members are unaccounted for, the whole team can collapse due to lack of helpful hands on deck. A big upside to working for this company is the environment. When you are part of a team, making connections are almost unavoidable and that's the beauty of it."
good,Target valued their guest and would do anything to fulfill their needs. I love the people I work with and the hours that I work.
good,"The compensation is better than most if not all other retailers.  The work life balance is good in terms of the schedule (every other weekend) but it is nearly impossible to work only 50 hours per week and get everything done.  An average week is usually about 60 hours per week.  There are definitely some politics involved, and a ridiculous culture around visits from senior leaders that requires everyone to put in extra hours leading up to their arrival."
good,"Some of the most engaging leaders I've ever worked with. The pressure to achieve exceptional results can be overwhelming! The hardest part of the job is feeling like you're never off. You always have to be available, even on days off or vacation."
good,I was seasonal so didn't last long. they hired lots of seasonal workers but didn't keep anyone. Long hours of standing at register
good,"hustle to unload the truck on time each morning, management was a bit off, co workers fun to work with, hardest part was making sure everything went out in time for store opening, enjoyable part was working with your friends"
good,I reviewed the target in place of home depot. wasn't working there long enough.  meeting people and helping them daily was fun.
good,I did pretty much everything I answered phones called doctors and insurance companies I did customer service I filled prescriptions got coupons and discounts for high copay medications handled the ordering
good,Target is a large company with numerous employees that has alot to offer to its customers and alot to offer to employees as well. A good company to work for and experience growth in.
good,I've been with the company for 5 years went from 7.50-10.50 no room for advancing unless you kiss alot of butt. The team is fun though and I admit I liked my time here. They push us on the rec card selling so much I HATE asking people.
good,The foremost thing to consider with this job is that the company will go out of its way to assure that most of its employees do not obtain full time status. It is not for somebody who needs more than thirty hours a week. The work is fast-paced which makes for a quick work day.
good,Has a good team environment with competitive pay. Usually a fast pace time from start to end with  a lot of work to do. Managers are great and really helpful.
good,"its fine, people are nice, its a job, decent pay, not a lot of complaints or compliments to this place. I don't know what else to say."
good,Target does a great job of hiring a fun team of people to work with. Leadership always strives to maintain a positive atmosphere and puts a large focus on recognizing the team.
good,I had never worked for a warehouse before but enjoyed working with the team I did. It was long hours (10) but seemed to go by pretty quickly.
good,I enjoyed working up front the most because I was able to be around people and that is where I feel that I thrive. Sometimes I felt that it was more important to get our guests to sign up for the red card rather than our interactions and experiences with them.
good,n/a I learned how to deal with people in high stress situations in a large companies. I am excited to see what I in store in the future
good,"Being the 1st serious job I kept I enjoy the staff the most, very positive from management to hr! Great benefits and acknowledgment!"
good,"You come into work and do it all over again. Use store equipment to restock shelves neatly and appropriately. Co-workers and managers are always together, so there is really never a problem."
good,I worked as a cashier and as a Barista at starbucks. Everyone was friendly and usually came in with energy. Store was always kept clean and up to great standards
good,"A typical day in the life of working retail is you clock in, you give amazing guest service, do your required tasks for the day, and you clock out."
good,"Target is an okay place to work. The days are busy so you aren't bored. They don't staff very well and you don't get many hours, and they keep hiring."
good,"The day you have working as a cashier depends on the Target guests that come through your line. Sometimes you had great interactions with the guests other times, the guest made you want to clock out early for the day."
good,"Target is a great company to work for.  After a certain amount of time, all team members are required to train New Team Members, and doing so makes for a team that sticks together and all work toward a goal of making Target become The Best Company Ever."
good,Target was a neat job to work at very organized very polite people the most enjoyable part of my job was helping the elderly with their bags
good,"its a fast fun and friendly environment. the co workers are nice, we are a team and work well together.ive learned everything about the store from cashier, guest service, softlines to hardlines, to operator as well as backroom."
good,Co-workers are the most enjoyable part of the job.  Target's strength lies in it's people. Peers are easy to work with and management is typically supportive in helping you achieve your professional goals.
good,"Target HQ is a great place to develop your skills on interesting projects and partnerships.  The culture is very focused on development and connections, which is great but also leads to an overly social environment.  Retail is notoriously short-term in its thinking, and Target is no exception - if it can't be executed in the next 3-6 months, it probably won't be greenlit.  There is often difficulty in making strong, strategic choices in what to move forward , leading to slow decision making and then a rush to execute."
good,"Learned a lot how Target does freight, Cashiering. They have a great and well organised to put freight out in a short period of time."
good,"weekdays are generally well paced, weekends are another story. but it also depends on the area. there isn't much to be learned unless you're team lead or at a management lever position. Every store is different, we had our share of both good and bad LODs. Some will constantly be on the floor with you others stay at the front or in clerical throughout the day. The guests are probably the best part, the bad outnumber the good 10/1 . Watch out for couponers finding loopholes in company policy and printing duplicates. Throughout the day you will find the merch you got for them back in your foreign basket two hours later. id say the best part of the job would probably be the other team mates. odds are the majority will come to realize working the target sales floor was a mistake and you'll all come to the agreement that you need to get out."
good,"People there are amazing and kind, learned a lot, especially how to communicate with the guest and drive sales. The stores gets very hectic and messy, it was always my job to clean it up and make it look amazing. I am very tired at the end of my closing shifts which are always 12am shifts!"
good,Decent job for a first job. Great work environment with nice Team Leaders and HR. Scheduling wasn't as flexible as they make it out to be but it still isn't bad. You get trained in multiple departments which prepares you for almost any other job. The coworkers were kind of frustrating because other people would frequently leave their work half done and start something else which leaves the work they left behind for the closers. That was probably the most difficult part because we were pressed for time. The most enjoyable part of the job I would say is the break room!
good,"no hay una buena linea de comunicacion ya que no son locales , no se creo grupo con el personal operativo ."
good,"-Can be stressful around the holidays"
good,"everyone there is friendly, a bit childish at times. Management doesnt honor employees lives outside of the job. Very great place to work if you have a passion for home improvements"
good,I felt that the production quota was not always obtainable. I learned that a little bit of encouragement goes a long way. I feel that if management wants their employees to do a job at least know what the job entails. The most enjoyable part of the job was my pay check.
good,"I was hired as a Seasonal Cashier, and that could be employment from a day to 90 days (after which you can go from temporary to permanent).  The training was adequate, though not professional."
good,working at target overnight was a nice experience cause i learned about how inventory works in a job cause it was my first job
good,"Had the pleasure of working with a GREAT, close knit team for many of years. In my 31 years of services I have met a lot of good people."
good,HR is its own little kingdom that answers to no one.  It is like the East German Secret Police where everyone spies on everyone with HR keeping files of everything said / done so they can get rid of you whenever they feel like it/
good,I felt that because I did not work there long the management did not want to take the time to get to know the seasonal staff they hired.
good,I learn about logistics and how to effectively restock shelves. I worked overnight so I had no day job at that time. My coworkers were friendly.
good,"Great work environment. My co-workers were pleasant, and enjoyable to work with. Reliable, and friendly. The hardest part of the job was not always having enough time to complete the assigned tasks."
good,"I liked organizing the carts, it was a good way for me to help the store provide fast service to the customers.  The supervisor always complimented me for my promptness."
good,"A typical day of as an ETL-AP consists of identify process opportunities and identify any fraudulent transaction. The leader would then communicate the findings with the Target Protection Specialist and the ETL of Guest Service. I then would run reports that identify any internal theft via register. I would then conduct video review and video surveillance on team members and guests to find any thefts or unusual behaviors. I will then have the TPS run a report where he will count 50 items that are high-theft items or trend items around our market. "
good,Team Leads don't really take the time out to check on their employees to make sure that they are satisfied. Target does not like when you have other jobs or other obligations
good,"There's not a lot to say. Expect to work freakishly long hours, with impossible demands and subpar associates. Pay can be decent, but only if you impress the right people. Very bureaucratic. Great training program prior to being expected to slave away."
good,terrible place to work no one wants to deal with that kind of environment. A lot of gossip that goes around a bunch of older men that don't know how to just be respectful to everyone.
good,Good company to work for.  Lots of measurable metrics to be evaluated on. Would like to see a new bonus structure introduced for leaders and team members.
good,"worked there for over 17 years, enjoyed most of it. good place to start out if wanting to excel in retail."
good,Typical day at target would consist of keeping customers happy. going above and beyond for customers need. Learned how to work well with others most enjoyable part off job was the  ability to put a smile on a customer face.
good,"A typical day at work i would say its okay, i help people find things, i also cash people out . i learn how to handle people different ways also how to interact with different attitude , im very friendly toward my guest no matter what is the situation , the hardest i would say about my job right now is nothing because i usually catch on to everything quickly , the co workers that i work with i get along very well and i also enjoy meeting new people everyday thats the best part of working in a retail job."
good,At the beginning of my term at Target it was a very fun and exciting workplace. Towards the middle of my term there was a management shift and it became very hard for me to enjoy the work I was doing due to poor leadership and negativity.
good,"Rang up customers, determined if items were eligible for discount.  Asked each customer if they were interested in signing up for Target Red Card (Debit or Credit).  Signed up customers that were interested.  Co-workers and Team Leaders were pleasant."
good,"Very repetitive and busy, constantly working with different people. Lots of work to get done daily but also relaxing when helping customers. Co-workers are friendly and management was very helpful."
good,"Management is horrible, they show a lot of favoritism. Change the rules randomly at any moment. I have been at target 3 years and anytime I try to move to different departments or move up I get shut down and ignored. Overworked and underpaid."
good,target casing out customers stocking shelves when not busy. not enough work hours given management was ok co workers were always nice. Clean work environment
good,"4 to 6 hour shifts, 3 or 4 days a week. Busy during holidays then not many hours after the holidays. This is a good job if you like early morning work."
good,You would think that high end retailers would spend on LP technology but leave it to the off brand retailer Target to put the best LP tech in play.  If you can get beyond being micromanaged in a position where YOU are supposed to be managing your own team you'll be fine.  Be prepared to have any and all judgements you make as a team leader to be called into question.
good,I have not worked for this company for a long time . Not sure how there business is run .  Management is not friendly .  Great job .
good,"I worked overnight as a member of Target for three years. In the end I left because they were not providing enough hours for my needs. Working two days one week then five the next. The decline in hours came from a new system they had made that scheduled the Team members automatically. I raised my concern several times and the response was ""We'll look into it"". Nothing was ever done about it."
good,"Discount on everything"
good,Being a cashier was an average job wasn't hard at all. Fun at times and time went by fast working there. The managers were nice and very friendly
good,"It was my first time working retail, the training I received was extremely helpful. The other cashiers I worked with were nice, and it was easy for me to make friends. I was receiving a lot of hours here, it was during the holidays, so we were always extremely busy. "
good,It was a good job other then having to push their Red cards. Customers would get upset at being ask over and over. Target is also known to have had their system hacked and people had money taken from their banking account linked to the card.
good,"Typical day was COLD, and very interactive with guest. Co-workers were friendly and very helpful. I just didn't like the cold setting of the meat department."
good,"A typical day at target was alright. Everyone was laid back unless something serious happened (as in people trying to steal)."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of greeting customers, I developed good communication and social skills. I learned how to get things done in a certain time frame."
good,"Helped guests and kept the sales floor tidy and presentable."
good,"If you like standing for long periods of time behind a register, then that's what you will be doing. You will see hundreds of people daily and will be expected to make sure they are happy and satisfied with your service."
good,People were really friendly. Learned how to stock and put items in the right positions. People were willing to learn sign language. Communication was effective.
good,It has been a growing and learning experience woring at Target. Co-workers are great we all share a common goal. Hardest part of the job is just adjusting to last minute changes.
good,"A day at Target starts between 4am-5:30am and, in my position, consists of pulling product within an hour generally so that it can be distributed to the floor before the store opens."
good,"Some people love their jobs, others not so much.  I enjoyed some of my co-workers but I knew this was not a permanent place for me."
good,Never stressed as the bosses made it easy to get through a day with great communication. Work was good and kept you busy good atmosphere with fellow employees
good,"The work on my end was relatively simple, and was only complicated by either how big the truck was or other people. One person not finishing their area in a timely manner would cause other people to come to your aid when they could be elsewhere. But as long as you got along with the people around you, the extra work doesn't seem as bad. But that applies to wherever you work."
good,"backroom team member, i pull items from the back room and restock shelves. also assist guest in finding items they need. I also worked in the produce section, looking for out of dates and replacing them with fresh items."
good,"Generally a good place to start working, they help you along the way to get the tasks finished and you are expected to perform optimally. If working with others is hard then it might not be a great place to start. Management is usually very friendly if you're able to do what they ask and keep an enjoyable attitude towards your work."
good,"A typical day at Target was full of hard work. I learned how to work a cash register. The management wasn't the best, but you could still deal with it. My co-workers were great team members and taught me life lessons. The hardest part about the job was pushing carts in a lot of traffic and when the weather doesn't permit. The most enjoyable part of working at target was meeting new people."
good,Excellent work place and staff. Very safe and clean environment with lots of friendly employees and supervisors. great organization within the company.
good,I learned to use different equipment. I also learned how to work fast and multi task. The women that I worked with were friendly and helped me out a lot while I was working at Target.
good,"When I began here I was unaware of what to expect. Not only was I new to this job, I also was new to this environment of southern hospitality. The team members there welcomed with open arms and taught all the steps I needed to learn to grow in the company. The hardest part about this job was time. Everything is time-based and its difficult to get use at first. I learned how to manage my time to complete the task that needed to be done each day while also learning to balance work and fun. My most enjoyable time is when I get to hang out with the other team members. My managers always left room for us to do things ourselves and fix our own mistakes."
good,"my typical day is coffee at starbucks then backroom stock work.ranging from replenishing the sales floor customer service requests. reverse logistics, bales of cardboard,running powerjacks .learned and got certicates in operating equipment I never did. management wasn't that great when I was employed a lot of them were fired. my co workers were great and kind. hardest part of that job was leaving a person by they self with a shipment of tasks that's impossible for one man or woman to get done. the fun part was winning prizes game events and recognizing your work in team huddles"
good,"I worked as a team member on the sales floor and honestly it was just plain boring. People I worked with were fine, Management was fine, all that was fine. The job itself is even fine but the mundane tasks of constantly opening boxes and stocking shelves was just way too boring and didn't demand that much. It's an easy job that I enjoyed for a while but it just got to be too much."
good,"When I was there (it has come out later) there was a corporate directive for supervisors to mark at least one person as a bottom performer and to performance manage them out the door. Even if you had a team full of good employees, you were expected to pick one and find things to performance manage them out the door for ""the betterment of the team"". Things have changed since getting the new corporate leaders, but at the time, it became pretty ridiculous."
good,"I had a good time working at Target. Despite getting a good amount of Red Card Applications, and Being one of the fastest cashier, I was let go. It was very unprofessional how they let me go. No warning. I was still on the schedule. However I was still let go."
good,"As I stated previously, I enjoyed the team there at Target. It was great coming in and having a team that wanted to work for you and appreciated you as their leader. I did not agree with the lack of work life balance from Target."
good,"Overall Job satisfaction is not good."
good,There is definite room for promotion within the company and the compensation is very nice but the terrible work/life balance is hard to get over. Resources aren't given to complete the amount of tasks needed to be completed so you look incompetent.
good,"I love staying busy.  However, with it being the holiday season, my work load has quadrupled and upper management refuses to bring in any extra help.  My position in particular is understaffed with very little gratification."
good,I ONLY WORKED THERE SEASONAL at the location on HWY280 it was not ran at its best if you ask me... They were very short staffed an they worked the few people thy had to the max!
good,"target was a good experience to begin with it taught me a lot of skills such as time management and dependability. Most days were slow not very busy. i enjoyed most about the job was helping customers, i enjoyed making other co workers day with my bright personality. I very much enjoyed being apart of the target team sadly it took bankruptcy and when out of business."
good,Coming from a front end retail environment it was a great experience to gain knowledge in logistics from a talented Exec Team. By choosing a logistics position in retail it allowed me to get an overall perspective of the working gears of a retail environment and help develop me into an effective leader.
good,Got the boxes from the back room and stocked them on the shelves for the customers to purchase. Then tore down the boxes.That was about it.
good,"I enjoyed everything about working at Target except for the early morning hours. The work was good and the pay was decent, but managing taking classes in the morning right after getting off an 8 hour shift caused me to lose too much focus and having to eventually move on."
good,"They weren't willing to work with me in terms of scheduling. I had to take the bus at the time, and they kept scheduling me to work before i could catch the bus. There were other employees that had to take the bus as well. So it made sense that I would be given the same understanding."
good,I got along with all coworkers and we all seem to have a good work ethic . The expectation was high but most of everyone were on the same page .
good,Target was where I worked for a year. during this time I learned a lot about the company and I enjoyed my time working for them. at times my hours were very crazy. but there is always work if you do the job good.
good,It's a great place to work. Not a hostile work environment at all. Great for college students! Management lacks people skills.
good,"Is driven on team work. However, leaders do not feel they need to be part of the team. Fun and great place deliver great customer service under what Target stands for."
good,The perfect first job for any student. Lots of fun and gives you experience in the retail world. Flexible with schedule and hours but it is hard to get 40 hour work weeks and they do not offer a lot of over time.
good,"It's a little tough to advance without job shadowing other positions.  Also, the current changes being made under new management make it a bit stressful of a workplace."
good,great place to be with great co workers. big variety of party supplies throughout the whole . tables and margarita machines for rent. also have a delivery service
good,this is basically your average starter job. minimum wage job. i was a seasonal worker. i will say there is a lot of favoritism in this type of job.
good,"I learned how to merchandise in depth.  Typically, I straighten up my department with is clothing, shoes, accessories, and some baby items as well as cover cashiers when needed to help guest check out flow.  When my work is complete, I assist other departments in completing their tasks before the night is out.  Management there is pretty friendly, professional and helpful as well as my fellow co-workers.  To me the hardest part of the job is incoming shipment and the most enjoyable part is helping wherever help is needed."
good,"Had a great time working there and wish I never left, but had some unresolved problems with someone that wasn't take care of so I left. Great company to work for tho."
good,"Target has very clear, measurable job specifications/requirements that every employee is rated and reviewed against. You have to appreciate a company with black/white expectations."
good,"Fun work place with great co workers, most of the time everybody is in harmony working as a team. Target expanded my communication skills and helped me grow to where I am today. The inactive I took because my job demanded it helped me grow as a person. My direct manager was great he treated you with the up most respect, some of the other management team however I cant say the same about. I knew it was a big company when I started but the limitation to grow within the company is a huge flaw from within."
good,I was young so it was quite boring to me. Kind of lonely. I dont like lonely. However i did make friends and was able to stick it out for as long as i did. I do not see my future in retail.
good,"Deliver a great-looking, fully-stocked sales floor. Offer a fast, fun and friendly guest experience. Maintain a clean, clutter-free work area. Quickly respond to all team member requests. Lift 40 pounds repetitively and assist with heavy merchandise lifts. Move merchandise safely using the proper equipment. Use technology to read instructions and enter information. Work independently."
good,"fun fast and friendly place to work, like working with guest and helping them with their orders, convenient place to shop and everyone is helpful"
good,"Was a great place to work, but was being penalized for asking to have my schedule made around my multiple doctors appointments"
good,"As a Guest Service Team Leader we were in charge of running everything from Customer Service to the Cashiers and even Food Service. My job was to make sure that my front end team had everything that they need and also to be available to answer any customer questions and or concerns. "

good,great people to work with and being a part of an awesome team and being able to help guests with whatever they may need! I really do enjoy seeing regular customers coming back and being able to keep up to date with what may be going on in their lives
good,Fun place to work.  Managers are nice and most of the rest of the staff is supportive.  Very good at teaching you what you need to do before expecting you to be able to do it.  Pay may not be the best out of all retail jobs but with your employee discount Target ends up being your favorite place to shop when you're not working.
good,"I love working at Target. Target was very organized, I was  able to gain access to leadership opportunities. I had really supportive co-workers. Working at target was a growing oppotunity. The hardest part of this job was multi-tasking and learning really good customer service skills."
good,"Target has a great advancement opportunity. It is not family friendly...With the direction they are taking with opening on holidays, it makes it hard to have a work life balance..especially when you have kids. The expectations that they have are ridiculous. I have been at stores where the atmosphere and employees are awesome, but it still doesn't compensate for the work that is expected."
good,It is nice place to start if you are pursuing career in retail. You will have the opportunity to advance if you show excellent progress. Organized store and well maintained by the management.
good,"When i worked there pay was awful. It was a Radio Shack kiosk inside of target. The branch went under now, so there is not a whole lot more to say about target mobile."
good,Some of the coworkers I met up to five years ago are still my friends and we still keep in contact.  Working each day with people you can relate to was one of the best parts of the job.
good,This place is a good first job for teenagers or a good paced job for younger and older adults. Though there is not much upward mobility in terms of promotions and bettering yourself. Overall it is a good place of business that will treat you fairly.
good,"A very great place to work during college years or just for a part time job. Very fast, fun and friendly work environment."
good,I love how they treat ther associates but they don't pay you much so its ither work here for little and have a nice clean environment or work for more and not be treated as good elsewhere
good,"Target is a fast, fun and friendly environment with a fast paced work flow and a fun and friendly atmosphere! My coworkers are always willing to help me out in a bind. Some of the processes can be a little unconventional but prove successful."
good,This review summary does not provide any review content due to my current job status with Target Corporation.  Thank-you.
good,"The working conditions were great, the people were friendly. Management was helpful but training was insufficient. The salary was very low and I never had a set schedule."
good,"The job was not what they initially claimed it would be. When I was taken on in the position at the largest store in the state with loss prevention I was told I was going to have a large team. Within a month I had become the only person in my department with ""goals"" still set to those when we had a four man team."
good,"Have to work more on Employee's Salary and Benefits."
good,"Loved Target. "
good,"I have worked as a pharmacy technician before in the past at CVS pharmacy and this is no easy task .. you must be able to multi task as well as you do for a medical assistant job.. I just find that when you go into a doctors office vs. a pharmacy the clientele is a little different.. The clients that come into the pharmacy try to be patient but I feel as though they look at the pharmacy like a fast food place, they want to be in and out. I don't mind it because it keeps me busy and the day goes by faster. I left because I went back to school around this time and began to freelance as a Makeup Artist for Mac Cosmetics."
good,Learned how to work in a very fast paced environment. Made sure that shelves were stocked. Customers needs were met daily.
good,"na empresa era super bom trabalhar,a unica coisa que era mais complicado era ter que passar o dia inteiro de pé,mas nada que se entreter com os colegas as vezes e sempre dar o meu melhor para os clientes não resolvia,ver o sorriso de satisfação no rosto deles já alegrava meu dia ,meus colegas eram ótimos e meus patroes também,um horário flexível e bom de trabalhar,tudo era bom."
good,"There was always something to do at Target, and the coworkers all relied on each other to complete our duties and keep the customers happy."
good,A typical day working at Target consists of helping guests find what they need. While doing this you have to cashier when needed and organize the store while working alone or with other team members.
good,Good place to work but doesn't have much ability to move up in the company.I went as far as I could with the company and due to a move I was unable to stay with the company.
good,"revolving door of leaders and higher then normal expectations.  Front end supervisors give conflicting messages, been coached for doing two different tasks by two different leaders."
good,I helped clients with their purchasing requests and assisted with cashing their items when they were finished shopping
good,Learned what it takes to become a great leader with Target.  They do a good job of challenging you to become a better leader.
good,Great place to feel safe and fun while working but the effort that you do does not even equal the small amount of the salary.
good,"It's a fast fun and friendly environment. Management is willing to work with your schedule, They offer great medical, dental, Vision care benefits."
good,Very supportive peers and management staff. Good benefits and schedule flexibility. Fun work place with slight room for advancements.
good,On a normal day at target i was responsible for standing at the front to detour theft by maintaining an aggressive posture as well as checking for the accountability of high theft items around the store.
good,"everyday was a typical day. and i didn't mind it.i got to work,clocked on and went to work."
good,"Target is a great second job. Very flexible and the management will work with you. They don't offer a lot of hours, but if you cross train, you may be able to get up to that 40/wk. Pay isn't that great, but what do you expect for Target. Id recommend Target for a job for kids just starting out in the workforce to get their feet wet."
good,"Barely any worklife and personal life balance, hours are not good but the people are great. Most people are unsatisfied with the pay"
good,"I loved working at Target.  The employees were great and I enjoyed interacting with the customers. When we worked during the holidays, they would have meals catered in.  We worked hard, but management made sure to let us know they appreciated our work."
good,The work environment is very good but it's one of the workplaces where I tell you once and you have to catch on fast and move a fast and steady pace. A lot is demanded of you working in Logistics. I learned how to search throughout the store database to log in an store information pertaining to inventory as well as locating information for a customer to satisfy their needs. I stock the backroom with store merchandise as well as pull merchandise to be put on the store floor. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing a area of stocking merchandise correctly in the stock room because you get the feeling that you've done your job and it shows by the neatness of the backroom with merchandise put up.
good,Fun work place with supportive management. clean stores and great team players (co-workers). nice environment to work in.
good,"Typical day at work is scanning items all day long. You are a cashier and that is all you do. If someone drops a juice or anything you are to clean after that so you can prevent anyone from falling or slipping. It is a fairly easy job, part-time, common customer service experiences."
good,The atmosphere and employee moral at Target is probably the best I have experienced.  The pay is minimal and the raises are very small and slow to be handed out.  If Target paid more they would be the perfect employer.
good,"I loved Target, I was there for over 3 years. They are not so flexible with the schedule you want, which unfortunatly is why I had to leave but there is many different departments to work in, and the pay is not bad. I worked as Cashier and as a barista at Starbucks. Every Target is different, I loved some of our managers and I've hated some, it just depends on your location."
good,The environment overall is a great place to work and has a lot of opportunities within the business. I like how the company has really great deals
good,Its an overall good company to work for. Its very flexible with hours and vacation time. It could use a bit of help with communication between team members and team leaders as well as ETLs.
good,"My day usually starts with my going into work and going to huddle. We will zone an area and the I will go to the fitting room and start sorting and answering calls. I have learned a lot that I will keep, but a lot that I will not keep. One thing I would keep is being open to talk to people and guest and show them new things. I do not want to be shy again."
good,It was a great job to have while going to high school full time. I was able to start earning money to support myself. It was a great work place with fun coworkers and managers.
good,"Great entry level job for recent graduates or those trying to earn an extra income. Pay is okay, above the minimum wage. Room for advancement to management positions."
good,"Depending on the store management it can be a fun place to work. I recommend as something temporary, to grow and learn. Great for college students. Requires flexibility in schedule."
good,"They have a very friendly vibe and there is always someone there to help you out, I work on the sales floor and there is always something to do. It may get a little boring sometimes because you mostly work by yourself so you become a bit independent."
good,"Very fast work place,"
good,"I have really bad asthma and the managers at Target were very willing to work with me and my illness. However, they did not ask me to stay past seasonal."
good,"Well when I was working for target I learned a lot more skills that I did not know before I worked there. I learned how to unload the truck and set the merchandise in the right area, also I learned how to work more as a team rather then by yourself. The hardest part of the job was just staying up because it was overnight. the most enjoyable part of the job was when we just put everything on the shelves it was so simple. The management was pretty good everybody was nice and worked as a team."
good,"I had fun working their I just needed A new start and a better job position so i decided to resign, But all together enjoyed my time their"
good,Great people but lean organization and at times difficult to do your job as you are pulled in so many directions. Can be very long hours with minimal work life balance
good,"Team-members, wrote reviews, being over several departments, Guest-service, Food Ave, Consumblers, Sales-floor, Electronics"
good,"Typical day includes reshopping clothes and helping guests in the store.  Also, working on the register when it gets backed up."
good,"I didn't enjoy working at Target mainly because I closed all the time. I would be there until 12:30AM sometimes. I worked very weird hours and it just wasn't for me. I understand retail isn't the industry to work in if you want a 9-5 Monday-Friday, but once I realized that, I let Target go. I also had a very bad experience with some of management. I definitely was not having that making $8 an hour."
good,It was great  job to start off with. the management team wasn't very supportive of your interest in growing and there were also limitations to growing.
good,Hard to be a security officer in a place where they only care about their next red card. The hard guidelines of stopping customers from stealing is near to impossible.
good,This company is good for those wishing to have employment but also primarily focusing on schooling or other endeavors. employees are taken care of and team work is pushed.
good,"Nice, friendly environment. Being a cashier was sort of fun. Everyone is really helpful. Management is approachable and honest. Get used to being a team player."
good,"working here is not so bad but, you don't get enough hours during off season to pay your bills. This job does come with great benefits. The workload could go overboard sometimes."
good,target is a company to gain customer experience and gain opportunity for anyone. great hours and always motivated to help customers and gain knowledge on products.
good,"•	Cashier (operating the cash register, pleasantly"
good,Exciting day to work with different aspects of people. learning different task and working with co-workers to achieve tasks.
good,"Over night Logistics work at Target involves a lot of heavy lifting and multi-tasking. Very challenging work environment. Lot of opportunity to grow and learn so much more then just retail customer service."
good,Great workplace. All around great atmosphere. And great coworkers. Management staff are very welcoming and helpful.
good,"This has been a great company to work for.  In a Typical Day, I make a huge impact on Target's business partners and vendors.  Management has been supportive.  The team I currently work with have been wonderful."
good,Great Comradely. The managers were great and willing to work with you if you had any issues. They showed appreciation for workers through morning and afternoon meetings. They requisitioned food for holidays especially thanksgiving. It really feels like family especially for those who do not have a family. Great place to work well at least my location was.
good,"Working with your co-workers everyday, meeting different people, helping out the guest, ringing up the merchandise, got along with my supervisors and never a dull moment."
good,the managers on duty would not work. manager would scream and demand work to be done before sunrise everyone was tired and the hardest part about the job was the hours
good,It can be fun at times and stressful at others. If you don't have tough skin you will not last too long. Management is all over the place.
good,"The leader teams gets to train us everything in the store such as cashier, price accurary, hardline and softline and its great to experience everything !!! The enjoyable part of the job is coworkers are so friendly and we get along pretty well! We were a team!! the hardest part of the job that it wasnt successful in Canada and it has to go back to the USA.."
good,"You have to live by those three words to work there. It is a fast, and challenging job. You will make friends fast. it is retail, so there is a lot of work and late nights. Don't expect to be promoted if you do not fit the Fast Fun and Friendly motto."
good,"In a typical day I'm in charge of answering customer questions, resolving any concerns or problems about merchandise or sales. I really care about and genuinely love my co- workers. The management however needs work. The hardest part of my job is dealing with customers with a bad attitudes while maintaining my professionalism."
good,For coming right out of high school working at target was alright. Its organized chaos because everyone is doing what they want and people really aren't working to the best of their ability.
good,Target was ok to work at.  The structure and hours and lack of being promoted made me look to other employment.  There was a lcak of clear leadership when I worked there.
good,"It is a great place to work, meet a lot of great people and when it is busy the work day passes pretty fast. Guests are what make the job fun."
good,"Target overall is a good place to work, with a management team that is willing to help you advance. My only reason for looking for another job is that I require more hours than are currently available."
good,"Working for Target is a very fast paced environment, however, working with a helpful team can make your day!! Target was a fun employment place until I finished college and started my career."
good,It was an okay job. I didn't mind going. I had fun with the different people I met everyday. There was nothing that I didn't like about working there.
good,"Target has a great work culture for the most part. Management is trained to micromanage, which can be exhausting. The most enjoyable part of working at Target was certainly interacting with guests and fellow employees."
good,"my typical day at work would be to come in and clock in and then gather with employees for morning huddle. Then i would start my job by scanning items in the store for in stocks. During this time period i would help customers in between, take a fifteen minute break then finish my job and go home. I learned a lot from this job as far as how to use a personal scanner, answer department phone calls, and grab items from the backroom if needed for customers. The management team at target is wonderful they all are super nice with a positive and upbeat attitude and you can go to them for help about anything. My co workers are super friendly and nice we all help each other out if we have an issue we have excellent teamwork. The hardest part of my job would be to not to try and make a customer upset by telling them we don't have the item in stock anymore. Some times online it will say we have an item at the store but we don't actually have it on hand. Usually the customer will get upset but i try my very best to handle the situation professionally. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with all different types of people."
good,Great place to work; they do care for their employees. They listen to you and take into consideration what you say. They are always trying to help their employees with advancement.
good,"Focused way too much on customer focused program. Need to be more well rounded and be able to focus on a full shelve concept, employee relationship, and customer focus program. Compensation could be better for the amount of work that you do."
good,"Clock in and grab your gear"
good,"Pharmacy was a cool place to work, pharmacists were nice.  The key is get in with a good staff.  They also aid in obtaining pharmacy tech license"
good,"You learn an overall friendly attitude. Great Management, Team enviornment. Moving up in the company is easy and great.You can never have a bad day if you work for them."
good,Target is very diverse with friendly staff and colleagues.  They celebrate individuality and diversity.  It has an independent feel and is a good place to work.
good,Working at Target is okay. The amount of hard physical work for the very little pay didn't balance out. Management was great. The opportunity to advance was very slim.
good,"Working in retail, especially in Georgia's busiest Target, you are given a chance to interact with many different people. And because we are encouraged as employees to encourage the guest to apply for the store card, you have to learn to communicate effectively persuade  them. As an employee, you are also faced with dealing with guest that are irrate or unfriendly. You learn to descalate situations and deal with the guest in a tolerable fashion."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was that I got to work the weekends and have my weekdays to enjoy or finish a project. Although working 12 hours can be a bit tiring but I managed.
good,Target has taught me how to develop familiarity with team recognition and collaboration. I enjoyed working for a company who puts recognition and guest loyalty in front of daily tasks.
good,"I enjoyed working here but I didn't really agree with management. I would do my job, get great guest reviews, but would constantly get the blame whenever something would go wrong in our area. Every time management would talk to me, they would tell me that they loved me as a team member but would also list what I did wrong one one time when I noticed other team members do the same thing. I would go above and beyond to help team members when they needed help with their work area when done with mine, but would always get told by management not to. If a work area did not get finished, management would ask why I did not offer to help when I always did. Maybe it was just this specific store, but I did enjoy working here other than a few people in management."
good,"not much to say here. hard to give an accurate review when working part time. seems we were on the bottom of pecking order. it seems the chain of command was a bit off at times. Had to be donethe ""Target way"" when better ways were possible"
good,"Started off as a cashier, within a year I was able to move up in the store. Working with customers can be difficult, but with the right attitude it is possible."
good,As an Executive Intern at Target a typical day included learning how to run a store. Target really strives on their leadership.
good,"Work was fast paced, and very early, but overall a fine experience. If you did your work, and were friendly with your co-workers that had been there a long time, and patient with the new employees, then the environment was fairly pleasant."
good,"I didn't hate going to work every day at this place, but the hours  are lackluster when it's not the busy season aka Christmas"
good,I have encountered some good days and bad but I feel that its an isolated situation dealing with me and can not actually voice the experience that maybe encounter for every and all individuals that get hired. They are very cut throat about letting people go and that's even from honest mistakes. I pride myself on my duties and especially coming from a management background and can honestly say its a bit ridiculous. My first few weeks saw individuals within management get fired or quit. Great paying but security isn't the best.
good,"A typical day at work easily involves over 25,000 steps. It is constant, fast moving, always helping co-workers or guests, and always running into new situations. I learned how to manage small and large size teams and how to handle difficult situations. Management is good, however progressively narrowing over the past 9 years I have worked for the company creating more weight on the shoulders of myself and other managers. The hardest part of the job is picking and choosing your battles. On rare occasion will I accomplish everything I want to do in one day so prioritizing what needs to be completed is crucial. What I enjoy most about the job is the people I get to work with and that I am an hourly manager which allows for a better work/life balance."
good,"the staff I worked with were great. managers and team leads were supportive, and made the job interesting. my direct supervisor was firm but fair. and made the job easy to do and enjoyable"
good,Payless is a job which allows for many Human resources infractions due to not having an onsite human resources manager. Numbers are based of customer counts and transactions. Not based on your abilities. Very stressful .
good,The managers always tried to show who held more power instead of trying to complete the various task we had to complete. Target pays well
good,"I loved all my managers very fun environment, but the company as a whole could do more to improve the workplace for it's employees."
good,Nice place but things always change and not for the better. Leaders pick and choose when to lead. Co-workers and nice and easy to get along with.
good,This job was really fun. People were great but the only downside of it is that pay isn't great and hours can really drop off if the store is slow. you can go from 40 one week to 15 the next. Can't live like that
good,"Target is a ideal place to be employed if you're currently in High School or college . However , your typical day will vary depending on your position ."
good,I enjoyed working with electronics.I liked working with customers everyday. I also enjoyed working the the pharmaceutical department occasionally.
good,Stressful job with little benefits. They do not work very well with school scheduling and often leave you to figure out their mistakes on your own. Make you work holidays which you've been told you do not have to work (example: Christmas AND Thanksgiving Day).. Will often work you bad shift hours (closing until after midnight then back before 8am)
good,"I recommend young energetic people to work there. The co-workers are very polite. The hardest part of the job, is the more you know, it would sometimes work against you. The people who don't know a-lot would get the most hours, and you will be stuck doing a 4 man job alone. It taught me a-lot about planning. The most enjoyable part of the job is Co-workers. Management is basically the same everywhere."
good,"Target was a good first job type of place or a place for students who need a flexible schedule. team members and management, were very motivated and enthusiastic ."
good,Target gave me the incredible opportunity to assist in management duties. It was an educational experience and I got to use my organizational and team lead skills daily. I was not a fan of the compensation for work and though we can move up or salary's did not move with us. They wanted more for less.
good,"Target is a great company to work for if you're in college. They work well around your schedule and give you the amount of hours you request. However, it is hard to advance as they only choose their favorites to move up in the company."
good,"I worked in the back stockroom of the Target on S. Independence during the holiday season, which spared me the massive crowds most of the time. "
good,"This job taught me great costumer service, how to work at a fast pace while still treating the consumers with respect. It had a lively atmosphere."
good,"Encouragement, Good work Environment. Great place for women Employes. Feasible Management, Quiet Often Lay offs. Good Fast Friendly Fun Environment"
good,I had a fantastic manager and a great team. I was able to learn a lot about customer service as well as management while employed with Target.
good,"I enjoy it and respect and get along with everyone it is just not a good fit for me at this location. For some reason theyre not to concerned of the team members attitudes towards the company, nor the team members opinions of the establishment."
good,it is a stable job but not giving enough hours per week. no overtime was a problem. the benefits were not the best but overall it is an alright job.
good,"Reviewing any company is very subjective.  What works well for me is not necessarily a perfect match for anyone else.  The retail industry has it's up's and downs in hours available, staffing and options at work."
good,"My seven plus years with Target has been a very "
good,this is the same company iv been with for 9 years. i feel the same way as i stated before. it was a great learing experience working for psch
good,"unloading the truck,pushing the stock in a timely manner, teamlead helps with all aspects of the job,all teammembers work independently all over the store, it is retail and hours are few in parts of the year, most enjoyable is the people I work with"
good,"In retail, there are no two days that are the same.  It is very challenging work and very interesting.  I enjoy working with the team at Largo, the hardest part of my job is when I have to deny a customer something that they believe they are entitled to.  The most enjoyable part is when someone compliments something that I have said or did."
good,It was a interesting job you had very short breaks and worked very strange hours to were you could not schedule anything that you wanted to do.
good,I didn't like working here because the management wouldn't help the employees that wanted to advance get the training they needed to do so.
good,A typical day begins with preparing the money for that days registers. processing previous days personal checks and coupons. Balancing the safe funds with the previous days funds. Counting the money that was collected from registers used the previous sales day. Preparing next days cash and deposit. Balancing the cash taken in
good,"Work at the register your scheduled time. Learned rules about liquor selling."
good,I love working for the company but don't expect to be promoted if you work there for more than a year. They choose to hire people with no retail experience in lieu of someone who already knows what they are doing.
good,"It's an alright company, but definitely not a place to build a career. Store-level employees are made to feel generally unimportant by upper management."
good,"My day consists of maintaining my many departments, while utilizing the available resources I have to create an positive and inviting atmosphere for our guests.  I partner with my peers and executives to  problem solve and maintain brand throughout the store.  The hardest part of my job is maintaining my multiple departments throughout the day as time and lack of resources tend to leave me to decide what is more important which could leave certain projects to not be completed on time."
good,"Productive work environment, fast paced but manageable. Day to day work is usually based around the same regimen each night. co-workers and managers are friendly."
good,They do not like anybody else's idea and they don't mind being rude about telling you so. They treat everyone really badly I am not sure about the other Targets but I will not work at the NE one in Cedar Rapids ever again.
good,"Target has great people, its why people love working there and why they stay so long. There is a large company transformation underway which has lead to some volatility in non-technical roles."
good,target mobile hires a company market source to fill sales positoin within the mobile kiosk. expected to act like a target team member but really not. no store discount.
good,"Typical day at work was fast paced and required seamless multitasking. "
good,Working at target you will see alot of different cultural people and have fun working here. The coworkers are friendly and easy to get alone with.
good,"The hours were long and draining, but overall it was character building experience. I wish they gave me a chance at management."
good,"Pros: "
good,"we would unload the freight truck and then stock the shelves. I learned how to use a scanner for locating and putting away merchandise. Management was good and tried to work with you. Hard to keep up with all the co-workers since the company had a pretty fast turnover, but for the most part I got along with everyone. I think the hardest part of the job was getting up at 2 in the morning to be there by 3 but after a while you get used to the hours. it was never boring"
good,"At the time management was not very good, their wasn't a since of organization and the ability to lead. Hours were never accurate and stable."
good,"My typical day at work was to count previous sales date to location and balance safe and make deposits or change orders.. Keep office clean and neat. To provide fast fun and friendly environment."
good,i enjoyed this job. I was a packed/picked for orders for stores. Very fast passe work environment. The company pays great but does make you feel like a untrusted employe. Very hard to achieve full time due to only wanting to hire seasonally and avoid paying benefits
good,"A typical week at work includes work related job responsibilities, several GTKY's (get to know you's) - your preference, development statuses with my manager and an occasional froyo run in the afternoon"
good,"Working at Target was a lot of fun, your co-workers can become like a family. Depending on the hours you work you could be doing a lot of restocking or a lot of add set. Overall most of the customers are very friendly, management in the store was good, however sometimes it's hard to be heard. I think the hardest part of the job was having a customer who was unwilling to understand that you were doing the best you could to help them. Sometimes there is only so much one low level employee can do."
good,"Productive and my co-worker is so nice. I learned the different job ,  to interact with other people . My work as a flow team if when e unload the product from the truck you must be fast and carried heavy things. but in end of shift its so fun you work as a team."
good,"I mostly spent time filling in for cashiers and keeping the clothing folded, as well as stocking new inventory and altering the sale signs."
good,When i first started i was beyond excited because i enjoyed shopping there you could always find what you needed no matter what it was for
good,"A good company not too many bad days at work. i learned how to use different machine such as the wave,crown and scanning gun."
good,"I enjoyed the job except during holidays. Great culture, and employees are made to feel appreciated. Management was decent."
good,Really terrible experience working with Target as an ETL. The learning curve is non existent even for a 22 year old coming straight out of college.
good,"Fun atmosphere, good work environment, good sales training, hardest part about the job is the long hours, most enjoyable part is the promotion aspect of the job"
good,"My typical day at  work is very busy on a daily basis I learn new information on how business is to function under new guidelines"
good,Great place to work during college.  They are always looking to hire internally and there are usually always opportunities to advance.  Part-time team members tend to have low moral and unpredictable schedules.
good,Was utilized in many different roles and assignments each day. I learned of the overall management required to effectively utilize materials everyday.
good,"i would start my shift by punching in. then i would head to my cashier, make sure my space was ready and clean for customers. I would then interact with many different customers. Bag their groceries and usually have small talk during the process."
good,I enjoyed helping guests and other employees. Good benefits package. They work with you on scheduling and help you with personal issues if needed.  There is a team mentality along with giving you space to work alone.  I worked well with most of my co-workers.  I learned how to be a leader and mentor to several employees.
good,"we would do a 10 min exercise."
good,Some upside some downside depends what position you work in. Fairly easy job. Management is not bad. Liked my Co-workers.
good,"Overall, the environment is fast pace if you work at a high volume store. Which means, a busier and bigger store in the district. This means you're always occupied doing something and making sure your tasks for the day are completed in a timely manner. It teaches you time management skills, as well as, working together well as a team- something Target is big on."
good,great friends and supervisor. different encounters everyday and face to face contact involved sales pitch and cash handling
good,Stocking the backroom according to lots and PDA's was the main thing we did in the back.  Coworkers were friendly and easy to get along with.
good,"Come in at 4 a.m. and usually 12:30 p.m."
good,work as a cashier and target café.it was a job didn't really enjoy it.there was a lot of internal drama that I didn't like.And management were pretty mean also.
good,"A typical day at work would include engaging guests in new promotions,productions,and any other help they needed. Team work with our managements ensuring the store was clean and ""in ready mode"". Daily huddles to keep everyone up to speed."
good,Teaches you time management about customer service. Not very flexible with scheduling. But over all the experience was appreciated. I worked in soft lines and hard lines.
good,Target in Aventura is a great place to learn from your peers. There are some growth opportunities in some work centers but very little in the HR department.
good,I like Target. Didn't work for this company long but enjoyed the time I did. Rather shop here than work. Worked with different managers everyday.
good,It was fun to work there but I can't take the frozen food isle anymore because I kept getting sick when I was working there.
good,"The best thing that I took away from this seasonal position was this: providing great customer service to all guests.  As a cashier there were good days and bad days in terms of the guests that bought from the store.  Some were receptive to the service provided, while others were difficult to satisfy.  The everyday stress such as standing for extended periods of time and lifting heavier objects were to be expected, no problem there.  Overall it is a good job to have as a first job or working as seasonal help.  However depending on hours, pay, and life situations there are better alternatives."
good,"audit sales record, learned how to stock and audit in store inventory, , worked well with co workers, the hardest part was discrimination, the most enjoyable was being able to handle situations well under pressure."
good,"good starting job with fun people. "
good,"Depending on the managers on staff at the moment, it can be a fun place to work, albeit strict.  Very demanding compared to the pay.  Be prepared to be on your feet all day."
good,"while working at target i worked with very friendly people that made the job fun. it was a very easy task, unpack items and arrange them in there section."
good,I loved my job and my co workers.  The office environment was very friendly and gave room for growth.  Hours were good.  Always training to become a better employee. Hardest part was the turnover of bosses.
good,"There was team work and team effort. The managers were easy to talk to and fun to work with. When it was crunch time everyone did what they had to, to make sure our store was approachable."
good,Great job while going to school. I needed flexible hours and target provided that. Benefits were good. Target teaches team work and how to work with the public which helped me move forward in my career.
good,"love seeing new faces everyday, loved the discount plus all the clearance love working with my employees and the parties they would do for us"
good,I'm currently attending school and they didn't seem to like how I chose my school over them. The breaks were pretty short for the amount of time you worked.
good,"manage two teams both pricing and presentation teams. Delegate to multiple team members their job descriptions, set up new transitions through out the store weekly and multi task daily."
good,"can be a fun work enviorment, but more stressful than enjoyable, have to work most holidays don't get to spend time with family, but its a great place to get work experience."
good,at the beginning of target it was a fun fast paced experience being my first time  in retail.  I especially liked how they made you feel as a employee valued and appreciated.  As time went on though the idea that you where valued became less and less apparent; as sales dipped the interactions between employee and management became bitter for those who did majority of the stock and unload posses. Hours that use to consist of almost full time came down to barely getting by and most of the original employees either found second jobs or left target entirely.  I for one took the second job option but still tried to keep pushing my involvement in the company.  the feeling of favoritism set in while I was continuing to work long hours at both jobs to get by; seeing many team members be able to change there hours of ability to fit around there other jobs and personally being denied the chance on quite a few occasions.  going into the second year the conditions improved but it was really the team members and not the management that made the employment enjoyable.  I personally would not change my decision on employment at target because of the people that I met and am still in contact with.
good,Definitely not a career. Just a job to have a little change in your pocket. They worked well with my school schedule. I would go back as a second job
good,"A typical day at work would be unloading the truck and putting out freight and helping guests when needed."
good,"As an Executive Team Leader at Target, your day is full of movement, decision making and adapting to any obstacles.  You are a leader in the building and give direction to the team with the ultimate goal of driving sales and prioritizing based on the needs of the store for that day.  "
good,"At the time I was employed with Target, my fellow co-workers provided for ourselves and the customers a pleasant and enjoyable environment through out the store. I was hired as the Signing Specialist then later promoted to Softlines Team Lead."
good,"I was working part time usually in the afternoons because I attend school during the day. My day would usually consist of me and another target member sitting at a customer service desk near the front of the store assisting customers with any of there needs which included returning items, searching for items."
good,"Working at Target was an indifferent experience. It was just a job to go to. I worked Logistics-Flow, so I dealt with stocking and arranging floor designs. The hardest part of the job was just getting up early to get to work, but that was counteracted by the amazing environment set the the employees."
good,A few select supervisors were rude to customers and employees which made for an uncomfortable environment.  Was not happy by which some customers as well as employees were treated.
good,this place is alright to work at there supervisors are not so great though. hours are not flexible and i feel they would be a little racist.
good,come in to work. go in to the meeting to find what the work load is for the day. the management usually come to see how you doing. the team member get the work order and go start the day off.
good,Management was fairly nice. The only problem i had working there was not gettin enough hours on almost a weekly basis. I have children and the hourly rate was enough.
good,"When I first started here the hours were 6-2:30PM Monday through Friday. The work was challenging and my input was used to directly produce change within my department. This has since changed to 6-6PM 12 hour days, 3 / 4 day rotation which means working every other Saturday and every Sunday when on the front half of the week. The half of the week changes every 7 weeks. "
good,"This was a fast paced fun and team oriented job.  Everyone from the entire district was helpful and played a key role in every specialists development.  My management staff was helpful and recognized me well for my performance.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with unhappy/disruptive guests, while the most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that you have ensured the safety and security of the store's assets, your guests, as well as the staff."
good,"Each day can be challenging. I enjoy challenging myself to stay sharp and stay in good physical shape. Members of management try to make it a fun and exciting work environment for everyone and they keep all the employees informed day to day. The hardest part of the job is the physical aspect part, but I enjoy pushing my body and staying in shape. The most enjoyable part of the job is the atmosphere. When I do eventually leave I am going to miss a lot of my co-workers. I've made several friends there that I will continue to keep in touch with."
good,"I was a cashier so just about all my days were the same, I learned a lot of people stress over the little things and take it out on other people. I didn't enjoy my management (it was like high school all over again with cliques) only people they liked would get extra perks and longer lunches and never get into trouble. The hardest part of my job was going into work knowing i wasnt happy with my position. The easiest part were my short days i worked in a different department."
good,"I actually liked my job, just felt like I was dealing with high school all over again. Cashiering was always an easy job for me."
good,Great for a starting leadership position out of college. Competitive pay but is often overshadowed by very long hours and unreasonable performance expectations.
good,Very clean and relaxing work place. i would recommended to others as a beginner job. Scheduling was done on your availability. management was sometimes rude. employees were exchanged biweekly.
good,"Working as a pharmacist can be very demanding but at the same time can be very rewarding. My day usually involves a lot of multitasking and patience. There are times when things can become overwhelming but in those times you have to learn to take control of the situation and find a way to work through any problems. I believe that it is important to be able to work well with all co-workers, even if there are any disagreements or tensions. Being professional comes before anything else.The most enjoyable part of my job is interacting with patients and actually being able to realize that your advice may have made a difference in someones life and health."
good,"Very interesting, Great people a fun workplace. very great customers and staff. Good hours, and always learning new things and experiences."
good,"I learned from Target that responsibility comes a long way in  this world, My Co-workers were hard working and very diligent"
good,Its a fast paced working place.Kind of feels like your  getting your cardio done there because your working fast but overall its a good start of a job you get to meet people
good,"The past 3.9 years at Target were the best time of my life. It was an honor to work with Target. Everyone is willing to partner up with you to help on your development at Target. Friendly and laid back environment. On a typical day at Target consist of vendor and store relationship. We do item setup and maintenance, ordering samples for item imaging, maintain costing and retail, and effectively handle store/vendor inquiries. I work closely with my BA and buyer to achieve financial goals within the department. The most enjoyable part of the job are the people that you work with. I especially enjoyed my team that I worked with. It definitely makes your day go by super quickly."
good,My day consisted of zoning (Neatly organizing different areas of the store) I didn't agree with everything that the managers treated certain situations. I didn't like how long the store stayed open especially during holidays.
good,"A typical day at work would involved setting up the new fashions for the departments."
good,A typical day was 8 hours and about half the time on a computer and half the time on your feet. I learned how Target's logistics operations function and how we could improve it. I enjoyed the location and management. Hardest part was the accountability. It was often harsh.
good,A typical day included pulling the orders the entire sales floor would  need when the orders dropped. Then all the backstock that wasnt needed up front was returned to the us in the backroom to be restocked. My favorite part of the job was the laid back atmosphere of the backroom. They also worked with me completely on my school schedule. The hardest part of the job was climbing the tall ladder with a heavy box to put on the top shelf.
good,My fellow sales floor team members are great to work with. I don't care for the management and how they treat us. We are generally not respected and are subject to impossible expectations. They do give us food frequently in our break room which helps most of us make it through a difficult day/night.I don't mind the work in itself but when I am held accountable for more two peoples worth of work it is difficult to keep morale. I have learned how to push through tough times and keep on working even though it seems impossible. My co-workers support and help me and I help them. That is probably the best part of this job. Most of the people I work with have become some of my closest friends.
good,"Worked at Target for 15 months.  This was a part time position.  The hours and shifts varied each day.  I enjoyed scanning groceries for the guests and being able to converse with them.  This position also included other job duties as zoning, sell Redcards, and restock abandoned items and returns.  I have developed friendships with fellow cashiers which I enjoy."
good,I would clock in and immediately have every one with any sort of leadership position tryin gto get me to do jobs for them so they didnt have to work despite having work that i needed to do.
good,"I fold clothing and put it away, I help guests with any questions they have or help them locate items. Some of my co-workers are friendly, others don't really speak to me. The hardest part for me is trying to keep up with re-shop (the clothes that need pushed out) and being the fitting room operator."
good,Productive and Busy work environment is going in the company. The management tries new ideas for the improvement in quality of service. The co-workers are cooperative and very heplful.
good,Was easy to get extra hours. The management was hard to get along with. Short breaks and some were overworked. Did not provide many chances for people to work in other departments.
good,"A typical day at work was pretty normal: clock in, talk to a supervisor to figure out if I would either be on a register or at guest services. Once that was decided would determine what I responsibilities I would have to take care of. I learned how to do returns and exchanges, how the registers functioned, how to sign guests up for Red Cards, where products and items could be found in the store, look up items, check if we still had items in stock, process online orders. The management is pretty standard, making sure that the policy is being followed and help guests and employees if necessary. The hardest part of the job was trying to please every customer that came to the store, there were some customers that were mad and rude and was very difficult to please. The best part of the job was talking to the customers and knowing how they enjoyed their experience thanks to me."
good,"It was alright working there, if a little hectic. Most of the time we were tripping over ourselves trying to be fast. I myself received very little training and was expected to learn on the go, which was frustrating."
good,"Overall good place to work and the enviroment was always neat and clean. There was good communication between the employees. When an issue arised, manangement was very helpful."
good,Unloading trucks with forklifts and building pallets to be ready for staging.  Enjoyed working with my employees and co-workers.
good,"Target was fun, with meeting new people everyday. The hours were decent, and holidays can get a little hectic. But overall it was a interesting job."
good,"You have the ability to drive change and impact consumers lives and shopping experiences on a daily basis, all while working with great team members."
good,The team members were fun and friendly to work with. Everyone was always will to help each other out and the customers. They are a great company to work for.
good,"Target is an interesting place to work. It's a Minnesota company which is very apparent in the culture. Decisions are made by consensus, and you can't get 10 people in a room to make a decision; instead you have to meet with them individually. Decisions also take a very long time to be made, which results in Target being slow to catch up with the rest of the retail environment. The culture is big on what they call collaboration, but is really socializing. The norm is to multiple 30 minute ""coffee statuses"" with people and most of the time you aren't talking about work. Extroverts and those who are popular are rewarded with promotions and many high-level positions are filled with people who don't deliver results, but they are well liked. To counter balance the amount of time people spent doing other things, Target overstaffed. With the new CEO, he's moving the company to be more data-driven, make decisions faster and focus on productivity. Hiring a CEO from outside Target was a step in the right direction but they have a way to go to change their corporate culture. Also there is a lot of talk of diversity and inclusion, but that isn't reflected in their employee base. Many employees of color find the culture not inclusive and leave after only after 1-2 years."
good,"Not a hard job at all. Sometime it can seem to be understaffed at times. It is your typical sales job and as long as you do your job and perform to the best of your abilities everything falls right into place. One of the downsides is being push to sell red cards (the the target credit/debit card) many of the customers sometimes get angry about you asking them, but not always. if team member call out it definitely effects those who are already working. depending on your department it can be a good thing or a bad thing. My time at target i got promoted twice within a year and also received a raise two months after for the yearly review."
good,"With hard work and determination, I started stocking shelves and worked by way up to a manager of three different departments.  I enjoyed working with my team and had a good rapport with them and my fellow managers and executives.  The customers were our guests and we treated them as such."
good,"The executive team leader role is an entry level manager.  An ETL will come into a target store and run one area of the store like logistics, apparel, guest services, human resources, security, Food guest service or general merchandise."
good,"The Culture of the Target Workplace. is a general caring atmosphere."
good,"Provide fast, fun and friendly service.Maintain a clean, great-looking store.Train new team members.Deliver accurate product placement, pricing and labels."
good,"I enjoyed learning the responsibilities of a pharmacist from Target pharmacist. The store I worked at was moderately busy compared to some competitor retail stores I have worked for. I felt that the technicians that were hired were well trained and easy to work with. The hardest part if felt that Target pharmacist have to deal with is the outdated software, the extra work for assembling prescription bottles and labeling bottles, and that the direct manager is not a pharmacist."
good,"excellent place to work great managers and co workers,  i like the team work the most enjoyable part take care of customers"
good,"My time at Target has been well spent; after just a year I have been promoted twice and have been working on the next. After promoting however I have seen the true colors of others that work there specifically on the management level. I think that this is an awesome place to work a first job and throughout college but anything beyond that it seems to turn people into bitter and angry people...at least from those that I have seen and worked with. I will be looking for another place to look for an actual career but absolutely have loved the time before promoting. "
good,I liked working at target. I just didn't how you get enough training. They just send you out there and expect you to know how to do something. Overall great place
good,"Target has a neat, clean environment consisting of supervision and management with upbeat attitudes towards the employees.  I check out guests, handle money, sell debit/credit cards,and assist in Customer Service.  The company encourages their employees to cross train in other department within the store.  Although there are many positive aspects to the job, the pay is insufficient."
good,"Many different job tasks available, plenty of opportunities to move areas and promotions in the past.  Downsizing now, uncertain future."
good,A typical day is about 1500 prescriptions and I have a team of 10 technicians. I have learned how to coach and lead a large team of technicians.
good,"A typical day at work consists of mostly greeting guests and assisting them in any way I can."
good,"Like most retail stores, the team functions well depending on the new hires and upper management support in training. This company was great for gaining leadership experience and understanding logistics and workflow."
good,"Over the past 10 years, Target has been a great place to work.  I've been able to learn new skills, grow both personally and professionally, and meet a lot of great/highly talented people.  Until recently, I had nothing but good things to say about Target.  However, with recent changes (driven by a third party consulting firm) I feel the company is now heading into rough waters."
good,Target is a great place to work! They drive for continuous improve both from a productivity and culture stand point. Target truly cares about their employees and strives to be the best. They are development focused and believe in real-time feedback.
good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with.  The training was good.  I have learned a lot about how to be successful in retail.  Company is moving in the right digital direction.
good,"Typical day would be assisting shoppers with product selection and support front end cashiers as needed. Other time is stocking, assembling bikes, and maintaining appearance of store. "
good,"Its a good job at first but after a while you get warn down and just want to get out of there, Underpaid and under appreciated"
good,The pay was good for this job but it could have been a bit higher for the type of work that is required. you get paid every week.
good,Good place to work for if you are going to school or college.  On the downside there is not enough hours and low pay make it difficult to survive on if this is your main source of income.
good,"Target was like my home, it can take up your entire life. But I love my coworkers and Managers who were all professional and kind to me"
good,Easy job to work while going to  school. They Work with your schedule and have flexible hours to pick from. Everyone I worked with was fun and nice.
good,Target’s stores are one of the largest retail stores. They have great schedules for students and for people that are looking to fill in a 40 hour work week. They also have a great community initiative. I really  enjoyed working for them.
good,"As a Sales Floor Team Member, my duties were to provide help to guests coming into the store, restocking and organizing shelves to company standards, and general clean-up if there was a mess. The company provided training on such topics as Hazardous Materials clean-up and working safely."
good,"Working for Target at the store level is a wild ride. There is never the same day twice, which is both exciting and challenging. A typical day starts with a walk of my store to see any opportunities relating to stock issues or incoming product that could be displayed based on seasonality, holidays, or upcoming local events. I then meet with the four team leaders under my alignment to pass any communication I have received from headquarters or our distribution center. I additionally will get a general idea for what their team's workload will look like and ask for adjustments to be made if I see a need. If I'm the acting store manager for the day, my duties will become running the whole store. If not, I'll spend time with the teams under my alignment to build relationships, develop and train, and recognize good performance. This time is also spent looking for logistics metrics for my store as well as sales performance to see where the biggest wins and opportunities are. I will then spend time auditing my process in areas that need improvement to ensure we are on best practice and adjustments are being made to improve performance."
good,"I did not like working at Target whatsoever; my direct report was completely useless, leaving me to figure out things for myself if I needed an answer to a problem or put in a help request at head office, which sometimes went unanswered. They did try to make it a nice place for the staff to work though."
good,"sale and activate contract phones "
good,"Love the overnight co-worker but long term the pay is not worth it."
good,"fast fun and friendly is the working environment at target."
good,"customer service,help straighten store. work together as a team."
good,"Get to work find out what register your going to be on and begin to ring up customers that enter into your lane."
good,Very close knit team environment that works hard everyday. Resources (payroll & equipment) are cut every year that stress the team.
good,I thoroughly enjoy working with our guests and my co-workers. I appreciate the opportunity to be back up to Team Leader and Head Cashier.
good,Typical day for outbound is loading trailer and throwing boxes all day. Loading pipe-o and non-con. Keeping up with rate and a bad hand off from previous shift are the hardest parts of the job.
good,the job was a great place t learn about guest inquiries and how to handle complaints. i learned how to stock shelves and do re-shop.
good,"I did at once love working here, I love people and being in sales . But I quit after two years the raises suck, and the hours were horrible at times. I was lucky enough to be on the higher end due to my red card sales"
good,It was a big experience for me to work a well-known retail company. My biggest challenge for working for Target was I worked a lot of hours in over time.
good,worked with some really great people. It was fast paced and that is what I enjoyed. Your days were always different and that is what keep my going. Learned how to stay calm under pressure during busy holiday seasons.
good,"Good, nothing extraordinary or horrible about being there for the duration of my contract. Co-workers were very friendly."
good,"Upper management makes a lot of false promises, and rarely if ever delivers. "
good,"1. Total work environment is really healthy"
good,The most enjoyable part of working at the Clinton store was the people I worked with. Most of us had been together so long that we were like family.
good,"training was great all higher authority was very kind, and friendly."
good,I don't remember much about the job other than staying up all night and stocking product in the store. The hardest thing was having to work all night after a full day.
good,"Overall Target was an okay place of employment. I think its a wonderful place for a teenager looking to find their first job. I worked on the Sales Floor at the two locations I worked and it was always fast paced. I enjoyed it because on average I walked 6 miles a day. I learned to not take what guests say to you to heart, some guests can be rude and mean about anything, just have to turn the other cheek. I would say the hardest part of the job would have to be keeping up with how fast paced the job can be. Obviously based on the location of the store you are hired at. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be having the opportunity to cross train in different areas. It helps a lot if hours are slow at some point to be able to pick up more hours because you are trained in more than one area in the store, also makes coming to work more enjoyable, knowing you don't have to do the same thing every time you go into work. TIP: Work hard and you can and will get acknowledged, you will get more hours (even OVERTIME if its needed), offered to get cross trained in other areas within store, and much more!"
good,"In my experience with retail (limited though it was), I found that there were a degree of things that were as rewarding as equally frustrating. Retail can be worked by anyone, but if one wishes to display personality or a certain nature to their vocation, this is not a place for it. General retail work is focused upon stocking and securing shipments, not overly communicating with customers or other staff members save on occasion. Others may be selected for tasks you may be better suited for, often with no explanation given for this change. It's a good place to start, but it's certainly not a career unless you wish to pursue general/upper managerial status."
good,Was barely there for 3 months before they pulled the plug and decided to exit from Canada. Was on bench most of the time there.
good,"Target DC was not a friendly work environment, there was alot of employees who did not get along and it effected the workplace."
good,"A normal day of work consisted of me answering phones, checking people in to the fitting rooms and sorting clothes. I learned the fastest way to fold shirts and still fold that way to this day. The management that was right above me was awesome and normally very understanding. My co-workers were great, most were students and just there for extra money. The hardest part of my job was dealing with dishonest people who were trying to shoplift. The best part of the job was watching someone's face light up when they found the perfect outfit."
good,"Customer service requires patience.  Typically, it was very hard to meet store requirements and meet customer's needs."
good,"I consider working for Target as a ""just out of high school"" or ""not a forever job"" type of job. Promotions are based on favoritism and not working hard."
good,"It is a ok job out of high school working during college or even a high school job, although it reminded me alot of high school there. but at the end of the day i enjoyed thie stepping stome in my life and met some pretty cool people,"
good,Target is a great place to work if you have high energy and drive for results. You do not spend time at a desk but out on the floor impacting sales and guest experience.
good,"Target.com through Doherty Top Talent 	2014 - 2015"
good,"I definitely received tools to be able to lead a team. I learned how to interact with a team while still gaining respect. There's really no challenge, just routines. The co workers are very bonding."
good,"Long days, co workers were always fun to work with. Not at all what I want out of a career, but learned a lot while working at Target."
good,"I thought working at target was going to be a lot better than it actually was. The hours are not that great, low pay and some team leaders are not the best and some do not even know how to preform the duties that are needed for their department"
good,"Target's aggressive plan to open 124 stores and 3 distribution centers within 2.5 years of inking a deal with HBC gave leadership little time to plan, and even less time to execute.  The company's constrained supply chain and immature technology made execution difficult.  The company opened stores despite having empty shelves, and the brand suffered as a result.  "
good,target can be a fun place to work as long as there is hours and you don't get caught up in the politics of the job. at a certain point the hours will dry up so its best to have another job to go with this.
good,"typical corporate job. under paid, under appreaciated. under average benefits, nearly impossible to get on full time to get benefits"
good,"People were great, team members were great too. Management had a bit of a hard time working together but for the most part the store ran with great ease. Team members made you feel at home."
good,I hate the facts that u have to wait for every sales member to finish re shopping or zoning before You can leave to go home. Management wasn't the best people quit every day.
good,"I started with Target previous to any stores being open, freight flowing and any trailers being in the yards of our DC's. "
good,"Target started out as a great place to work, but shortly after become very unfeeling. Other teams members were great to work with because pretty much everyone gets along, however the team leaders and executive team leaders were not very friendly or helpful.  Pretty much anyone that got promoted was because the store team leader was their friend or they brown nosed a lot."
good,"Target is a wonderful company. They treat their employees great, you get benefits, they do a lot for communities."
good,"stocking merchandise on the shelves"
good,"its a great job for working students, anything after that I would not recommend. "
good,"A very challenging company to start with and to end with. Always a variety of challenges on a daily basis as it was a new and growing company in Canada so it had numerous growing pains.  It was very challenging as I took on numerous tasks as I was one of the first Team Members at the HQ, so the opportunities were numerous."
good,An organized organization and dedicated to take care of our guests.
good,Unfortunately I really did not enjoy working there. It was a typical cashiers position. I was hired to work only during the winter season. I did not learn anything new and my co-workers were not very helpful. The hardest part was going everyday. the most enjoyable part was the customers. The management was just ok.
good,"There were good breaks, productive management, room for growth and advancement within the company as well the hardest part of the job was not to starve"
good,target is a very good company to work for it offers alot of products and very good customer care
good,"I enjoy my co-workers. However, I feel there are too many levels of management at the store level. An example is that there are moments where the right and left hand are not the same. I like that you are constantly working as the task at hand is demanding. As a result one is not bored at work.I joined Target on a part-time basis and am over qualified for my job description. Unfortunately, the pay structure is not what I could be earning working in another industry. I have learned many things about retail during the past year I have worked there."
good,"Moments of tedium and frustration mixed in with plenty of exercise, fun co-workers, and new skills learned."
good,My typical day working retail was organizing merchandise and help customers find their desired product.
good,"The experiences that I received from Target, were mostly well balanced and organized. It just were small malfunctions within the Store. I learned  how to calm my guests down during any situation.by providing a smile , stating useful information,  being very apologetic and providing great service. My co-workers and I, were all different. Of course, we all had separate jobs to complete ,with several different routes of completing them. The hardest part of the job, was getting extra hours, We all were guaranteed a certain amount of hours, and my hours were short. Which prevented my pay to enlarge.  I encountered several great people and learned a lot of new things, but the most enjoyable part was just being a part Target Employee Team"
good,worked night stock people were great put up stock went out to gather cats.
good,"pay was excellent management was poor."
good,"Assisted in the preparation and maintenance of records pertaining to mental health care treatment planning and daily contact notes; supervised routine activities of daily living; hygiene, eating, recreation, informal education, etc. Transported clients to specified appointments utilizing a 15-passenger van; excellent verbal and written communication skills, worked in a group environment."
good,"A typical day at work could be busy or slow depending on the season. On may job i have learned to express myself more. The managment is ok there are just certain people you talk to and certain people you can't.  There is no hard part to my job, it's only hard if you make it that way.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the employees and meeting and greeting the customers."
good,I would be most of the day collecting carts from outside the store and bringing them back in. Learned to always be on time and ready to work. The managers treated me with respect and deliagents. Hardest part of the job was working on the weekends since it was usually the busiest from the shoppers. Fun part about the job was being on break when no one bothered me.
good,If you are a young and in need of a starting job great place to be.
good,"Working at Target provides a flexible work environment with flexible interchangeable schedules. Once working a position is secure but advancement is not a guarantee. There are store discount benefits available as well as direct deposit offered. There is a friendly, productive work environment that makes all the difference."
good,"•	Responsible for driving sales, delivering service and strategically enhancing profitability; oversee execution of multiple retail touch-points including visual merchandising, marketing, product assortments, human resources, operations and loss prevention"
good,"I worked at Target for 7 years and saw myself growing with the company, however, they are more worried about liabilities then results."
good,Management say they're all about their team. But when I started there they were never around. Some of the management barely knew what they're doing. I felt as if I was thrown on a register with little to no training at all.
good,it was my fist job so it was OK. a lot of pressure and little compensation.
good,"a cool place to work, meet great customers you have hours breaks are cool"
good,"I have a lot of fun working at Target. I get to work hard, and the people I work with are pretty cool. However, I would never recommend it to anyone. The discount is 10% but only if you have the store card, and the breaks are extremely short. If someone is just planing on working through college then I would say do it, but if you plan on making it a career then good luck to you."
good,"Of course there is a high turnover rate at the Northland Target. A friendly store to a certain point, definitely favoritism taking place."
good,"A day at work usually consists of a fun eight hours of interacting with customers, coworkers and management. Guests, as I have been taught, always come first and I love working in an environment where I get to interact with them throughout my day. It is my job to not only assist the guests with whatever their needs may be, whether it be finding an object on the sales floor or finding a missing child, but to also communicate with management and my coworkers. It is my responsibility to ensure that all problems such as price discrepancies are fixed as swiftly as possible as well as keeping the management aware of all problems that arise. I am also in charge of scheduling and coordinating the breaks of all employees. The hardest part of the job when I am being called with several different problems that need to be fixed with different people all at once. I always get worried that if I can't fix the problem fast enough I might upset the customers. Usually, as long as I keep smiling and talking with them through the situation they are understanding and leave the store happy."
good,The stress factor was high and the job environment wasn't suitable to everyone. The management was alright and they didn't take care of their workers. They typically took care of the customers and then the management and then finally the workers. The hardest part of the job was the early morning attendance.
good,"hours were not great, but the management was and the people that worked there made it a great place to work."
good,fun and friendly but poor ability to accept that you have full time job and cant work past certain hours
good,Stressful job due to ungrateful guests and useless managers.
good,"nice place to work. discount was okay. not a lot, basic retail job."
good,"Standing, counting money. scanning items. good management, standing all day was the hardest. met good people along the way"
good,"I started here to rejoin the workforce after my husband passed, it was a great starting point to getting back into the swing of dealing with customers and having a stable work schedule."
good,"My typical day at work would consist of making my area Brand and checking in all the vendors and helping other team members with items that need to be defected or sent out.Every day is different as to job tasks.  I have learned how to tend to my area as if I owned it. I take pride that Receiving is my area and I keep it in tip top shape. I love working with most of my co workers they bring my day my smiles.... My Vendors and drivers are a big part of my day too so they help me get through my day as well."
good,First job after closing family business. Good staff. Corporate could be difficult to deal with
good,"Excellent environment, schedule was good, and interacting with customers as well"
good,"Target products are excellent.  However, they are weak in employee pay, motivation and advancement opportunities. Therefore, the caliber of their staff from lowest to highest levels is not as strong as other retail chains such as The Container Store or Costco.  A typical day includes managing all floor personnel/HR issues, handling customer problems, inventory management and generating sales.  I've learned alot about retail management, achieving retail sales goals and employee management and motivation.  My co-workers are good people who for the most part have good attitudes.  The hardest part of my job is seeing great opportunities to improve employee hiring and retention but being restricted by limited budgets.  The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting or exceeding sales and profitability goals while at the same time having happy and productive employees."
good,I was there for seasonal employment so there is not much to say about it. customer service job providing great service and products to customers. good place to work and keep yourself busy. Good program for getting employees started and a fantastic system to keep things organized.
good,"Standing for long periods of time helping customers and keep the sales floor stocked and neat.i learned how to a lot of different things like reception, pharmacist. Ienjoyed helping people the most"
good,Very short and easy job. You just come in and do the work for a few and go home.
good,Good Corporate culture and leadership development initiatives.
good,"I enjoyed being on the softlines team at my store because my team is amazing but, the management and wasn't very pleasant at times. i would typically handle customer service: helping guest and handling money."
good,a lot expected from you for what they are willing to pay. lots expected in short time
good,"Nice staff, decent hours to work people are nice and the food is great little discount"
good,ok place.better pay.not enough hrs. lack communication skills
good,First couple of years were good up until new management arrive and slowly started making mistake after mistake with scheduling and terrible communication. Never were enough hours to go around but they would constantly hire more and more people even though they couldn't pay them.
good,"Working at Target, is really about promoting a great guest experience. Checkouts are pretty fast. Keep isles straight and promote merchandise."
good,"This company was good money. You had to be very knowledgeable in all of the phones, carriers, plans, technology, and new things coming out within the carriers. There was a very good commission program with the company. Management was bad, if you tried to ask a question all they did is refer you to a training manual. They didn't care much for each individual person and the training plan was very broken."
good,"this was a seasonal position so it has very busy, i only had one position (cashier), so it wasn't as exciting. i did get to meet some nice people while working there."
good,"Very quick training, good fun people. Too much pressure to sell Target Credit/Debit. Announcements over walkie talkie made customers uncomfortable."
good,I've learned how to work the cash register. My co-workers are very friendly. The hardest part of the job is on the holidays.When you have to work at a very fast paste.The most enjoyable part of the job is the communication with the customers and employee's.I really never had any typical day at work everyday was a good day even when i was having a bad day. Going to work kinda cheered me up.
good,"Work was fine here not to hard. Easily paced, all about sales."
good,"Target was a place that was good to work for the people you worked with. A day at work started with the unload. Then the stocking of the shelves. I learned about first in and first out. Freshness of the product, My co-workers were great we all got together good. Management was a little lack in that they weren't hands on. But, other then that they were good people. The hardest part of the job was the expectation of pushing products so fast. Juust in the reward of seeing a good job done."
good,"Overall, Target is a good place to work, as long as you don't run into a manager who just comes out of college is and trying to prove themselves... In most stores there is a great culture where it begins to feel as though you are part of a dysfunctional (in a good way) family.  As long as you focus on your own job and don't get involved in drama you have the opportunity to move up from within.. but remember - no degree means no advancement beyond Sr. TL!  So get that degree!"
good,"greeting customers as they walk in the store, checking customers out, stocking and unloading"
good,"If you are a college graduate, Target is a great place to get experience that will make you very marketable to other employers."
good,"Cashier, guest relations, target cafe', and operator.Typical day at work I mainly worked in clothing departments: zoning area or kept area neat, and  answering customer questions. Hardest part of job was the long work hours, I would be scheduled to get off at 10pm, but wouldn't be able to leave until 2am because of the condition of the store."
good,I would go in and read all emails sent to me for information needed to be able to do my job effectively or any important information that was needed to be completed that day or in the near future. I would print up all paperwork for tasks for my teams for the day. I would review the schedule and assign team members to what they would be assigned to do for that day. I would then help and supervise the tasks for the day to insure that they were properly completed in a timely manner. Upper management was constantly changing so that made it hard to build strong relationships. My co-workers were great to work with. I did learn how to manage a large amount of people and oversaw teams that were ranked in the top 5% of the company.
good,I worked as a cashier which gave me a chance to help out and get to know people . The co workers I had were nice and funny an willing to help out. The hardest part about this job was the short breaks and long shifts .
good,"Each day, there are different goals to meet while we also keep our focus on the guests.  Everything we do, we do to benefit our guests because without them, we wouldn't be here.  We put out new products, keep our shelves stocked, search for out of stock items, and provide fast service at checkout."
good,"I would push out any necessary merchandise for the day, do back up for cashier, and work out in the sales floor. Hardest part of the job was doing different jobs that you weren't really trained in. The enjoyable part was the team work."
good,Management was fair and the work environment was fun. Good balance of hour. Can get hectic during holiday season.
good,how to problem solve and educate myself on all job functions.
good,"While working at target i learned alot and tho i will miss it, i wont miss how i was treated. and i dont believe that anyone should be treated in such a manner that i was."
good,Working at Target was a good experience as far as working with others at a fast pace and having to complete assignments by a deadline.
good,"working part time "
good,"did overnight stocking "
good,"On a typical day at work I am a cashier but, find my job more enjoyable when performing other tasks such as pushing inventory, covering guest service and supervisor breaks, pricing candy, and many more. Many team members are wonderful co-workers. To be honest the worst part of my job is when there are no other tasks to be completed and I must cashier for my entire shift, not because I do not enjoy interacting with guests but, because I get restless staying in one spot. The most enjoyable part of my job is the great crew I work with daily, we know how to make the day fun and exciting while still completing all jobs in a timely manner."
good,"Provide fast, fun and friendly service."
good,I worked the cash register and stocked store. The co workers were awesome to work with.
good,"if you want a first job, it's pretty fair. If you want to advance further into the company, prepare to make friends or else."
good,"Its a love/hate relationship with the employee's, they tell you we are all as one team and then they separate us to work counter productively. I enjoyed helping customers but was told by managers that they weren't a priority."
good,Gain great knowledge of management and operation of business
good,"A typical day at work I'll usually interact with guests and make sure their needs are being met. I'll also restock the shelves and ill end caps so it'll be easier for the guests to find exactly what they were looking for. I've learned a range of things, from thinking on the spot to zoning to planogram."
good,"management is horrible and never trust anyone, easiest part of the job is transporting items to the correct location and toughest part is unloading truck with time running against you"
good,Very tired because of the time frame i had to go in but other than that the workplace was pretty good so as the managers and co-workers
good,"a typical day meant restocking and replacing items, ensuring that every guest in my area was helped and found what they needed. i learned how to work as a team,my co-workers were helpful and hardworking. most rewarding part of the job is helping people and knowing how appreciative they are after i have helped them find something they have eagerly looked for."
good,The hardest part about the job is trying to convince customers to apply for a Target Card. The job is okay if you like to stand in one spot for your whole shift.
good,"A typical day at work includes making a guests experience at my store fast, fun and friendly."
good,"a typical day at work is standing at the cashlane wishing there was something to do, as cashiers are not allowed to leave their cashlane for long periods of time their is only a limited amount we can do to keep ourselves busy. Depending on the amount of cashiers working we are usually looking for things to do whether it is going through isles to make sure they are tidy or putting the re-shop away a days work as a cashier at target can feel like a life time of doing nothing. many of my co-workers are great to work with they make the days work entertaining. the hardest part of the job for me is to promote the red card this is a ""required"" job cashiers are forced to do, it is a difficult job because after asking over a dozen people if they would like to apply for the card you end up feeling as though you are harassing them into applying for something they dont actually want. the most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers they are fun to talk to and work with."
good,Target is a nice place to work. I enjoy the guests and management is very understanding.
good,work start at midnight unloading truck than pulling items learned how to use a rf gun and ele pallet jack
good,It was a place with a high set goal to give great customer service
good,I enjoy working at Target. I work with great co-workers and have great management.
good,"large box retail, with a broad base of shoppers.  Learned how to manage time to balance all work centers."
good,When I worked at target I loved it there. the people I worked with was great!!!
good,"Pay and benefits are very good for a job with little qualifications.  Workload is tough and fastpaced, but doable."
good,"At Target I always have to be prepared for anything the day could bring me. Every day is different and the unexpected happens all the time so being mentally prepared is important. The past four years have taught me about the way a business is run, ways to improve that business and mostly about people. How people live their lives, how they operate, how they handle certain situations and how I have made myself a better person from seeing all these. I see thousands of people every day and not only do I say hi to them because I have to as part of my job description I also want to. Saying “hi” is something I do when I go for a walk. I don't understand how two people could walk past each other in a park and not say hi. Target has made me a better person. A more outgoing person and I will never forget that. However it comes to a time when you start keeping ideas to yourself because what you think are good ones end up in the trash can almost before they are considered. Target is set in their ways and everything I thought was a good idea never mattered. I want to be mattered. I deserve it. I am a very hard worker yet I make my job fun because its where you spend most of your time in life. I would like to be able to experience more outside of work as well. It is hard to do so when you work so hard yet do not get paid nearly what you deserve. My coworkers have kept me at Target for the past 4 years and when I leave I will miss them terribly. Yet it is time to move on to something better that I am proud of. A company I can write home about and tell them how much I love my career and brag"
good,The highlight of the experience was the culture.  Very open-minded attitude with emphasis on developing courage to push the business forward.
good,"A typical day at work for me is very exciting because in this position I 'am always busy and I love helping my employees."
good,"I spent about 2 years working at Target, it was a good place to begin but I definitely didn't see myself staying here too long. I was in it to get my feet on the ground. The work environment can be hectic at times, the managers can be pricks, and the customers as well. I learned a lot and yes I will use some of them in the future. Would I go back, I personally don't think so."
good,"For a typical day in the food department, it was always pretty busy with little downtime. The people were nice there, but the amount you get paid for the amount of work you do is not nearly enough. The hardest part was trying to get everything done on truck days. On those days, it was a balancing act to get the truck pushed, order for the next truck, and all the daily tasks you have to get done on time."
good,"I greatly enjoy the work I do and who I work with. Target is a great company that demands employees to grow as they face new challenges. My only complaint is internal promotions, or more so the lack of."
good,"It is a fast and friendly work place.Great co-workers, learned about the setting up of a store, inventory management, how to provide exceptional guest service.  A typical day would be providing guest satifaction to each and every guest, reshop, and zoning the allotted work areas to keep the store tidy, and stocking merchandise.The hours you get to work is  fluctuating which makes it difficult to budget your finances is a hard part of the job. Also the job is physically demanding. I love the fact that the management appreciates and acknowledges hardwork. It is good to interact with people and it feels good to help the guests especially seniors .We have fun activities/ food organised by HR atleast twice a week which is something I enjoy with other teammembers"
good,I enjoyed my 9 years at Target and really enjoyed working loss prevention. The employees were always friendly and Target was always great with guest experience. Target has made a lot of changes in the last year that has really brought the morale down among the team including me.
good,"o	Unloaded the early morning merchandise truck."
good,Doesn't pay well but flexible hours perfect for students or anyone just starting out.
good,A typical day at Target was getting to my cash register and being there all day. I worked as a seasonal cashier so it stayed busy around the holiday.
good,"•	Stocked shelves (per sales/department needs) maintaining a clean work environment, assisting in sales, and performing cashier responsibilities.  "
good,"Target is okay but the pay isn't the team member attitudes are positive its an positive environment."
good,"each day is one in which you have opportunity to continually develop your leadership skills. Must be flexible and quick to make decisions. Good positive attitudes are rewarded with recognition and feedback among peers/management are key to your development. "
good,"I been working for Target for the past 3 years, my job challenges me and keeps me motivated. The hardest part would be recruiting new team members and the most enjoyable time would be scheduling weekly schedules."
good,Enjoy co-workers but like another company there are some team leads or ETL's who have power issues.  Will not work with you if you have another job even if they are only giving you 15 hours a week.  Good for students or people who do not have to financially support themselves.
good,"Enjoyed working for the Target Corporation, however, was seeking a full-time position with benefits."
good,"very unprofessional, the managers talk to you any kind of way, there racist, they act like immature human beings and they don't do there job right. they make you work 10 hours shifts with only a 30 min break."
good,"I've been with Target almost 3 years. If you're willing to work, it won't go unnoticed."
good,"Met some cool people, office environment real laid back. I would go back and work for them."
good,"Great part-time job to gain experience "
good,Great people with excellent customer service. Employees treats guess with respect and help achieve their every need
good,"Great compensation along with great workload.  "
good,cashier and helped people with the purchases. people where nice and manager helped me when i had a problem.
good,"A typical day at Target was fun. Management was there to make sure everything was getting done, not very personal with you.  Co-workers are great always helpful. The hardest part of the job was during the holidays and it being so busy.  the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to satify all the guests."
good,Always a different challenge each day and never boring! Can be a difficult schedule but you get compensated for it.
good,Empty trucks on certain days and put it out in the store and also do cash as well and help out customers
good,"Noting special about this job, unload the truck, stock the shelves then leave."
good,It was an ok job. great co-workers though. But it was just a regular job.
good,Target was a great place to work and became my second home. I truly appreciate the time and knowledge that I cquired.
good,"Enjoyed working for Target. Typical day included coaching and developing employees, identifying process shortfalls for areas of improvement and evaluating overall programming effectiveness."
good,This was a. Very productive store in my time there.  So I got to see how it was really done.  Hardest part was of course holidays beings in the seasonal section.  But otherwise enjoyed being part of a winning team.
good,"Worked during college, poor management, not enough hours............................"
good,"Hardest Part is the long hours, possible commute, and dealing with employees with no work ethic and upset guests. "
good,A typical day at work was unorganized but I learned how to contol stock.
good,My team members complained a lot about Communication issues
good,Great place to work if you love being busy all the time. There is always something to do and high expectations.
good,The hours aren't enough. The Management is ok. The co-workers are good people to work with and get the job done.
good,"Target was very flexible with our school schedules, however we were offered very little hours.  The work environment was very pleasant and every coworker was very friendly.  Management had their views set in concrete and never offered to help an entry level employee grow.  As in every retail job rude customers were probably the down side of the job on a typical day.  On the other hand working in teamwork with ones friends was the best part of the job."
good,It was ok but oiveright isnt everyone's cup of tea. it was a cool company to work for
good,I worked in the softlines area at Target as a brand specialist. As soon as I would hit the sales floor I'd be busy. There was always plenty for me to do. I was very hands on as far as the visual aspect of the job. I usually had a team of between four and six individuals to delegate tasks to and help with the zoning. I always had assitance and support from the upper management team. At times it could be challenging to balance out fullfilling tasks while providing the highest level of guest service possible. The most enjoyable part about it was the team! Everybody was supportive of each other. There was never a dull moment.
good,"Its a very chill place but working in the early morning shift can be a drag. I learned about DPC codes, how to stock correctly and not overflow and also how to adjust the seasonal items."
good,"-Work in various departments. "
good,Upper management does not  partake in daily workloads. Lack of hours for more team members to help with guest needs and work loads. Not much support from upper management.
good,Interacting with many customers and never a dull moment. Sales associate and cashier you learn a lot about people and the place of employment.
good,There is never a typical day at Target.  There is always something new to learn.  I have learned a lot about managing a department in a big box store.  The most enjoyable part of my is working with the team.
good,"Unloading and loading merchandise, picking and packing merchandise, stocking and pulling old merchandise to the front, while maintaining a clean and safe environment for shoppers and employees"
good,to know target is to love target! Target believes in making sure that their customers are satisfied.
good,"Fast paced environment where the only thing keeping you there is your co-workers (friends), and lack of other skills. "
good,"This company always has room for growth you could really grow with this company if you wanted to. I loved starting from the bottom and making it to the top, but I did start school and had to give my two weeks."
good,"- collègues très sociables"
good,The work place was nice but didn't offer enough hours as time was being cut back.
good,"I am a very fast learner, especially when there are a variety of things to learn. I enjoy helping others and am quite customer-oriented. I am able to effectively communicate and I believe that I would be a superb asset to this company."
good,"The pay is low, but the management is more upbeat and engaging and appreciative than any managers I've had in the last ten years."
good,i really like my job when i worked there never was bored loved my coworkers
good,"started working as a clerk right out of high school"
good,A typical day at work was just keeping the store presentable and up to standards. Helping shoppers fins what they are looking for.
good,you get a chance to learn new things and meet new people everyday
good,Got the experience of working third shift. It was a rewarding job nonetheless.
good,There are many things that make this company very technologically advanced.  The one thing I am not used to is it is a distribution center that is strictly based on numbers per hour. I have never worked in a company like this before.
good,"unloaded trucks organized inventory an stocked shelves"
good,The staff was great and easy to get along with. I have learned how to work as a team.The job was not very hard
good,Working at Target has helped me build my customer service experience and has made me very comfortable in being able to to break out of my comfort zone and bein
good,"When I first interviewed at Target I was told I would get a call in 2 days with a yay or a nay. 3 days later I called because I had not heard from them and was told that I had been hired and that training started the next day, glad I didn't have plans..."
good,"Great place to work, will depend on who you work with. But for the most part learned a lot of trades"
good,Only able to move up so far without a degree. Unable to work as management and go to school full time.
good,"Easy job, at the time I was pregnant. They had a great staff when I was there. Paid close to minimum wage and gave great hours. So if you want a job that will give you hours this would be the place."
good,"The first thing they teach you is their motto...Fast, Fun and Friendly"
good,"Recently (last 2 years) the culture has changed as the business dynamics have changed. "
good,"The staff is rude, low pay and no hours. I suggest this job to students"
good,Target is a good company with the highest standards.  Breaks were always taken and given with no problems.  A variety of friendly people to work with.  The problem I have is that it seemed that the company always expected more even when it the logistics weren't there.  Therefore it seemed rigid to accepting new ideas.  Open door policy did not address concerns.
good,"With the knowledge of people helping me to move along, I am thankful for those who advance me."
good,"All the stuff you hear.  Kind of like high school, fashion contest, high turnover, nobody works hard, lots of coffee breaks."
good,Love the team and how the company cares about its employees. Result driven but great team!
good,Challenging. Many and varied duties throughout the day to keep you busy.
good,The working culture is good with great people but there are too much bureaucracy as expected from every large-sized organization. If you're good with navigating bureaucracy you'd be good at this place.
good,"closer"
good,"I didn't mind going to work every day. The job was pretty easy, but seemed boring at times. I think I liked cashiering most because I was constantly busy. Everybody there was nice. I didn't have incidents with any peers or management."
good,I was a cashier at target for awhile and it was interesting. Always wanted to learn how to cashier. Great experience.
good,Its a good company if you want to get a job fast. nothing else to say about it
good,I enjoy working in an upbeat atmosphere where I receive the support of team members and team leads to better myself and move forward in my career and desires.
good,"Typical day at work : Unloaded truck"
good,Decent amount of work and decent amount of pay. They go through the employees and have a lot of churn
good,Target is not a bad place to work however the day is very repetitive. Every day you go to work and watch the same process and all its flaws happen over and over again. You will learn how to handle the personalities of hundreds of people and you will also grow your leadership somewhat. The best part of the job is the work life balance as you will get three days or 4 days off in a row every week depending on your schedule.
good,"I never got many hours at Target i came in as a seasonal worker so they barely needed my assistance at times so i would only work 2 3 days a week maybe even one day at times. I would also only work 5 hour shifts sometimes 4 and half depending on what aisle they needed my assistance in i also spent a lot of time working in the foods department. I would come into work go to the back work the sorting line, they would put boxes onto a roller once the boxes got to you then you would put them on a pallet that they belong on. After you where finish with the back room we would get are first break then come back from break and take the boxes we just loaded on to the pallet then pull them out the aisle that they go in and begin stocking i only worked there for the time they needed me there for and that was for 90 days."
good,"OK first job or for someone who needs a second job. Hours can vary greatly from week to week. Very little work life balance here be prepared to work Fri - Sun or perhaps work 11 consecutive days like I did!! "
good,"Friendly fast paced, and family oriented.  this was a company that had room for development"
good,a typical day working for target is giving great customer service. fast fun and friendly
good,Target has allowed me to advance as a leader as well as given me challenging roles. I enjoyed my typical days and the fast pace of the company. The team members were amazing and being able to train and see their accomplishments was a great part of being a leader.
good,Needs improvement. I liked interacting with the customers and the operator part of the job.
good,I worked overnight unpacking the trucks and it was bad. I would be so tired stocking items. I would sleep all day and wouldnt be able to do anything. Co-workers were super nice though.
good,"Everyday is busy, every week we have a work load(pogs, visual adjacency's zone, go-backs ect,,) to complete so it's my job to organize, delegate, and own what needs to be done on top of scheduling, hiring, coaching, and just over all hear my team out and just plain look over them make sure the store doesn't look messy and go-backs are not getting to heavy. "
good,"Managers are nice and well trained, have a good understanding of their goals and how to get there. Stores are generally well run. If you want a job in retail, I would look here first."
good,"Nice meeting new people, and getting to know the regulars customers."
good,"* department manager of multiple soft lines (clothing) departments"
good,the work is really difficult. I worked with them for 6 years.
good,"I did instocks loved the job but hated the management."
good,"when I come in I find out what section of the store I am in. I would first check the reshop for my section of the store. put everything back on the store shelves. if I was in market I would go to the four different coolers and bring the food out to the sales floor that were pulled for me to take out. after all the reshop is back on the shelves I go through my section and make sure everything is straightened and organized. check the reshop periodically, and help guests find what they need. get heavy things off the shelves for our guests."
good,The position wasn't great. Get to work at 4am and unload trucks and stock shelves. Not the greatest but the people I worked with made it fun. Working at Target is tough because you can never get full time hours where I worked. The best week I had in the 2 and 1/2 years I worked there was 38 hours. I saw no chance for upward mobility.
good,It was a nice job but did not offer much room for advancement. It was nice to help customers and learn about the retail environment.
good,"•	Interact with customers to provide them with information to address inquiries regarding products and services"
good,"My shifts usually start at 5:30am with the unloading of the company's truck for a about a hour and a half. Afterwards we begin to to ""push"" which basically means stock the products the shelves"
good,"unloaded merchandise , kept merchandise organized and accessible"
good,Had to reach a goal of 2500 cartons per quarter. I would on most days reach my own goal of 3000 cartons per quarter.
good,friendly customers laid back environment easy job good flexibility
good,"Responsibilities "
good,Great training possibilities and amazing work/life balance. Typical day is working collaboratively with planning and costing teams to ensure product ordered is up to quality standards and delivered on time.
good,"Company met expectations however management did not.  Nothing personal, just my opinion."
good,I enjoy working with guests and I really like all of the team members that I work with daily.  I have been in the restaurant/retail business for approximately 10 years and this has been one of my favorite places to work.  We do fun activities and really feel like a family through the close relationships I have developed.  The worst part of the job is having to work on weekends and holidays.
good,"Large company provides an abundance of career opportunities and has a strong focus on career development, mentor roles, and continued learning."
good,This is a great flexible position with a lot of opportunity to advance in multiple work centers. I love coffee and the experiences that I go through at Starbucks are like no other job experiences.
good,"You learn a couple good things from the job, the location I was at had dropped in management when the previous Store Manager left. I learned how to operate a stand up forklift, work inventory and improve my customer service skills. Co-workers are great all around. It is an easy job."
good,"Safety was always a number one concern. I learned how teamwork and communication can highly contribute to getting the job done. Management was easily accessed because of an open door policy. We had a motto of ""one team one fight"" which was really rewarding. The hardest part of the job was the sometimes demanding workload. The most enjoyable part of the job was the unity of the team."
good,You are dealing with alot of different people daily.  You learn alot of different skills to do your job.
good,Great company to work for but pay was terrible.  Management was great and work environment was fun and less stressful.
good,"As a manager at Target, you receive a salary...meaning that you put in long hrs and get nothing to show for it. Very cut-throat and everyone is looking out for themselves. As a manager, you are looked upon to always have the answer and went you don't, you are frowned upon even though it is completely out of your control."
good,Being able to stand on your feet for hours. Ringing up and returning customers goods and items.
good,"Stocking shelves, logistics, planogram set-ups.  I learned that the brand was expanding. Management oft times had no leniency for employee personal issues.  Very little flexibility."
good,"Typical day includes moving and restocking electronic items on the sales floor, along with assisting guests with technical and entertainment needs. Management was for the most part effective, though there was a confusing, sometimes arbitrary chain of command along with communication errors. Co-workers were very welcoming and helpful, fun to work with. Hardest part of the job is handling irate customers or feeling like an internal issue was not being handled properly or at all."
good,A very nice place to work. They provided the training necessary to be successful.
good,"Worked 6-8 hours each day either cashiering for guests or gathering carts for guests as a cart attendant. Co workers were consistent and we always worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was probably dealing with the moods of some of the store managers every so often, the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with guests who frequent the store often and providing them with great guest service."
good,It was my first time cashiering so I did learn something new.
good,Decent place to work. Pretty easy work. Work well with flexible scheduling.
good,"A typical day at work is changing prices throughout the store and helping guests."
good,"I've learned great customer service and how to deal with aggressive customers ""guests"". I learned how to deal with other employees, especially those that have are aggressive or hostile also. I learned patience and how to deal with people in a calm manner working for Target. The management at the particular Target I worked at could use some improvement. There have been countless complaints from almost all of the employees under the executive team leads and team leads. The hardest part of my job was getting hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to meet so many people and becoming friends with many people."
good,"My day as a supervisor would start out by making sure all pricing in my area's was correct, and making sure that all shelves and pegs were fully stocked. Of course during my daily routine I would always be expected to help a guest with any questions or assistance in attaining an item. I would also relieve a fellow employee who would be working in another department while they were on lunch or break, and the same would be done for me when it was my turn. I also had to make sure that all associates on the floor were doing their assigned tasks as well. For the most part everyone working in the store got a long really well with one another, it was almost like a family. The hardest thing about this job was having to call around to bring someone in when another called in sick, to make sure we were covered during that shift. All in all the best part about this job was working with the people that I got to work with, and meeting and helping the customers who needed help."
good,"I get to work, make sure i know what department im in whether its electronics or backroom and get right to work! I unload any trucks that come in and write down the inventory of the merchandise. I help the guests find what they need if i am working on the floor. Before i leave i dont just clock out i ask everyone if they are all set or need help! I enjoy the people i work with and get along with everyone."
good,Not a bad place to work. Learned new skills and bettered others.
good,"a fun place to work, good people to work with. Can learn a lot."
good,Job that had flexible hours needed to work with my family needs
good,"I currently work in Produce, but I started as a cashier. Cashiering at Target can be stressful depending on how busy it is/if its a holiday/how many people called in that day just like in any retail job. Also need to be able to handle having upset/crabby/rude customers. Never seen as many bad customers anywhere other than target. I asked for 40 hours, and I was given that amount. There were more than enough extra shifts to pick up if needed. I had the opportunity to apply for a GSA position, but after being encouraged to apply, they only interviewed two people. They knew who they were going to promote ahead of time so they didn't consider anyone else. I would have liked to interview for the position for at least the experience. Being promoted does not depend on seniority - it depends on how well you do. People do report others for the tiniest things to get a good rapport with the supervisors. You can get a raise every year after the annual employee review if you do well. I get a little over $8. If you take initiative and are dependable, you will do well here. "
good,"Well working with Target was a typical M-F job. I learned mostly everything at the time of being hired by myself or with minimal training. Management was typical paperwork and hide behind the scenes. Many co-workers were a joy to work with including friends made throughout the years. I like doing what I do and do it well, so I've grown comfortable and confident in knowing my work."
good,"they can treat there employer better because they got a lot hard work in there some of there work don't miss no day don' "
good,"very policy oriented"
good,"Responsible for making sure the product of jewelry and clothing were presented properly on the sales floor. Handled money as a cashier, and provided exceptional customer service by fulfilling the customer’s expectations."
good,memorable guest. diverse environment. fun games being played with co workers. nice sales and discounts
good,Target was a great opportunity to lead a store and the team members.  The most enjoyable part was staffing for 4th quarter and training the new team members.
good,"Work was a little hectic and management was always shifting, but the workplace was very fun and friendly.  Workloads were sometimes seemingly large for allotted time."
good,"At Target I was able to observe many different ways to manage a business.  Both positive and negative ways to manage employees, time management, and  prioritization of things that need to be completed.  Also I was able to learn and practice good customer service skills."
good,A great place to work. Everyone works as a team to complete task.
good,"In a typical day, I would go to my designated area: women's clothing, toys, sporting goods, etc. I then would check to see what the night team didn't get to finish, go backs. I would finish the go backs and then continue on with the zone: pulling things forward or folding clothes and putting them on hangers, depending on where i was located. I then would go around my department looking for things that did not belong there and would return them to Guest Service where I would put the items in designated boxes for others to pick up. I would also go around my department looking for guests and asking ""Can I help you find something?"" keeping up the Target culture. I also looked for items in the back-room to fill the floor so it wouldn't be empty and for guests who wanted the item. Throughout the whole day, I would do just that. Going back and forth with the zone, going to get go backs, helping guests, etc. When it would get really busy, I would have to go to the front check-lanes and help with cashiering to make the guest happy with a quick checkout. "
good,I go into work and I get told what needs to be done and I work on the tasks that need to be completed.
good,A typical day was busy on weekends and slow during the week. Unloading shipment during the week and helping customers with pickups on weekends.
good,you work hard for 10 hours a day. you unload freight by hand onto a pallet.
good,Interesting place to work  Unique work culture. What else do you want me to say?
good,"It was like any other job. They are a friendly staff, and do what they can while still remaining the integrity of the Target brand."
good,"Traget is a great place to work if you don't have a family. The scheduling during 4th quarter is the most difficult, you can work 9 days in a row: open, close, mids, overnight. After awhile it wears on your body. And difficult to manage children with the long hours."
good,"Depends on the area you work in, but can lead to a very rewarding career."
good,It was a great team work base job very fast paced and great members
good,Job to stay at for comfort but pay never really increases and the ETL's are power hungry but do no actual work. Dealing with them is like talking to children who think they know everything but actually do not.
good,It really was no big thing about this job. The co worker was nice and some of the management
good,Fun job while I was younger but did not offer room to grow.  I enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,Management can be short sighted at times which can cause a frustrating work environment and a loss in productivity. The people that I worked with were great and always hard working just didn't have the right leadership to accomplish what was needed.
good,You are driven by the rush of customers walking by.  Keeping a watchful eye to get the sale.
good,Local store atmosphere was great did parties and wanted everyone to fell good. Store Management really helped out when needed on the floor.
good,its a easy job and people treat you good. but like I say was promised 30 or more hours a week but only getting 14-23 hours a week. cant live on that being by my self.
good,"Mostly zoning aisles, helping guests find products, and occasionally cashiering. There were some moments when my work schedule clashed with my school schedule."
good,"In the time that I worked for Target it was Christmas season and it was always very busy. I learned different scanning systems and point of service systems, and several departments as well. The management was very scattered considering it is a big store but our managers on duty would always be around to help. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customer service and the cross training. I learned from working for Target that there is a lot of diversity in the work place and Target specifically targets having a diverse work force. The hardest part of my job was working the long holiday hours and seeing other coworkers getting more breaks when they didnt work nearly as many hours as me."
good,"typical day would include stocking shelves fixing labels, helping customers, and drive profitable sales."
good,"First job. Great atmosphere. Managers were cool, co workers were friendly."
good,"great place to work, fun people, connecting with people, okay management, flexible schedules"
good,"I worked for Target for a short time and I cannot say it was good or bad. There were things I liked and didn't like but they were just personal things. All in all, I think Target is a great company for someone to work at, it just wasn't for me."
good,"Target cut the hours and pay of the position I was in. Though I loved it, I could not afford to stay"
good,"When my shift started, I go to my register make sure my area was clean and organized. I learned a lot of different things. I learned the food court, photo, and guest service, and a little of pricing. It was all very exciting for me to be able to learn. Management was nice and helpful. All the co-workers were very nice. we all helped one another, if we were not sure how tho do something we know we can ask if another cashier could show us. For me the hardest part of the job was unhappy guest, but I was always patient with them and never had an out burst The most enjoyable part of it was the staff and all the people you interact with."
good,It was a very hard place to work. My co-workers were very amazing but getting ahead in target is very hard to accomplish.
good,"During a typical day, I would assist Target guests with finding items within the Target store. My main goal was to sell cellphones within Target. I really enjoyed working with the electronics team members. I have learned how to manage a kiosk and have a productive sales environment. The hardest part of my job was trying to convert Target guests into thinking about cellphones. Since Target Mobile is a separate company within a Target store, the Target management didn't really want anything to do with us Target Mobile representatives, which makes the long term affect of the job more difficult. I personally enjoyed working with guests and the Target team members."
good,I didn't enjoy working at target the supervisors talk down to the staff and the whole social atmosphere is very much like high school.
good,"My typical day at work consists of for the most part setting Plan O Grams, Customer Service, Answering cash calls walk outs etc."
good,You will be underpaid and worked pretty hard. Job is worth having as temporary work or as a first time job.
good,"As a front end supervisor I managed 10+ team members ensuring their compliance with specific core roles and objectives. Simple task like scheduling their breaks and lunches following a strict policy. I was there when each team member needed help or had a question as well as for the guest that came in to the store.  Cash handling was one of my more important roles; I opened and closed the registers as well as filled registers during my shift as needed.  I was in charge of maintaining cleanliness of the entire front end which included Starbucks ad Target Cafe.  I also supervised our guest service department which dealt directly with guest and guest issues.  Answered calls, made appointments, signed vendors in and out. Along with many other specific duties, us as a front end team served as the last impression our guest had of the store as they left.  We represented Target's motto of a Fast, Fun & Friendly vibe which was essential to the success of that specific store."
good,"I worked primarily as a fitting room operator. My primary responsibilities were organizing the merchandise at the fitting room, taking care of damaged merchandise, answering incoming store phone calls, assisting customers, and preventing theft in the fitting room. The most enjoyable part of the job was organizing all of the merchandise and preparing it to be set up on the floor. The hardest part was getting everything done before leaving at night - we often had to break a sweat getting everything done before closing."
good,"Target is a very fast paced work environment. There are a ton of responsibilities that employees have. A typical day includes stocking shelver, cleaning aisles, organizing aisles, returning items that were previously bought but returned back to the shelves, assisting guests, answering telephones, and the possibility of being called to back up cashiers."
good,"Make sure you have what you need to have a productive day, service all guest you come across and keep product in the floor"
good,A typical day at target revolved around providing great customer service along with going above and beyond at all cost.
good,"Reported to work at 6am, placed merchandise in its appropriate areas placed remaining items on cart for back stock. I learned how to train my body to wake up early.  I guess one of the benefits about this job was every working day at around 8am we would have a ""huddle' in which we would discuss the previous days sales and what our future goals were and we would give recognition to certain individuals; however I perceived that only those who were well liked with management received recognition.  I prefer to work for a place that treats everyone fairly, one should be recognized for his job performance, attendance and attitude rather than his butt-kissing skills."
good,Guest service to all customers. Good leadership training.
good,"I enjoyed working with my employees. It was more than work, it was also fun"
good,"4 am start time, varying hours, younger age employees, day is not over until all work is completed"
good,"For the most part everyone there is positive, managers and hr department are super. On the downside the pay and hours are bad. You wind up having to work 6 or seven days just to accumulate hrs to have a check you can survive on for two weeks. No benefits for part time, which mostly everyone is. No chance of ever getting a raise or being promoted, I know people who have been there 5 years and are only making two dollars more than me. A good job for a college kid or someone who lives at home who doesn't have a lot of bills to pay."
good,"You show up and you will be told where you are needed for that shift.  Normally you are assigned a work area, however, you often are pulled to work in different departments if you show a willingness to learn.  "
good,"This job was very physical which I love... just not at 3 am. however, you accomplished a lot by noon."
good,"Best in retail. When they say ""fast, fun, and friendly"" they really mean it. My coworkers were awesome and most Target guests are very pleasant. I had never worked retail so the entire experience was new to me. Learned a lot of what it means to be a part of a team while working on my own behind a register."
good,"Although it is only a Part time job, I enjoy the time i have spent working for Target. The company is constantly improving to make it a great place to shop and management heads are great leaders."
good,"A typical day would be helping guests who come into the store, find the product they are looking for or to assist them in anyway. I also clean up the store after guests decided they don't want the product they picked up. I have learned to be patient with people and not let things get to me."
good,Cashiering and customer service throughout the busy holiday season.  Assist customers with orders and finding items throughout store
good,"using the cash register, helping customers of any of their question on their purchases, greeting the customers,"
good,"Nice people, but not a lot of help is given in the pharmacy. Many times, the pharmacist is there alone. Not sure about the legality of having a restroom in the pharmacy and the laws surrounding having no one there when the pharmacist has to ""go""."
good,enjoyed working and meeting different people had a present experience
good,Its ok. My coworkers are fun to work with. The hardest part of my job is trying to make all guests happy.
good,"Very friendly work place. Easy to settle in with the flow of the store. Management is friendly and willing to teach you everything you need to know about your job. They always cross-train you in other departments if you show effort to learn."
good,"The typical day included stocking, inventory, cleaning, cashiering, setting up displays..... I learned how to work a cash register, and how to take inventory of items. The management there is not the best, and they never promote someone from within the workplace to management. My coworkers were amazing and was the biggest factor for staying at the job as long as i did."
good,Overall this is a good company to work for. I was able to learn new things  that I will be able to take along with me in a different career.
good,it was usually relaxed except during huge sales. my co-workers were nice.
good,"I help guests find products to enhance their entertainment experience by answering any questions they may have on an product in the store. I help maintain the visual presentation of the store by setting sales planners, stocking and organizing products in the store. I have gained a vast amount of customer service experience from working here. Management is easy to approach with any concerns you may have. The hardest part of the job is balancing customer service with tasking which can be time consuming. The most enjoyable part of the job is special social interactions you may encounter during your shift."
good,A good work enviornment with little drama.A very good company
good,"pros: great coworkers and managment."
good,"I found my experience at Target ok, some staff were good other were not"
good,A typical Friday at Target can be a pretty hectic day so we like to have food for the team in the break room. We start the morning off with a brand list to take care of any issues that may need to be dealt with before we get our rush. Once the brand list are taken care of we have the team start working on pulls and reshop that go back on the floor and by that time we are starting to get busy with guests. We have many back ups at the front lanes. As the teams are getting ready for breaks and lunches they will be happily surprised with a snack which is different every Friday. I have learned that the team gets tired and works hard but they do feel appreciated when we do things like putting drinks or food in the break room for them to enjoy.
good,A good place to start if you are thinking about a career as a pharmacy technician
good,"As a cashier at a Target located in the heart of Portland, you're going to encounter people from every walk of life imaginable. Cashiering there was pretty straight forward - we've all interacted with a cashier. The management was often times a little shady, but they did their best given the wide variety of people they were willing to hire. My co workers were great, but we were all under-compensated and had our hours cut constantly."
good,"i enjoyed working there. I felt important , respected, & needed"
good,"Great Organizational Culture"
good,I really didn't like working at target but at the end of the day it got my bills paid.I was a good worker and they took advantage of me all the time because they new i would do the work no matter what it was.
good,"•	Inventory, Pricing / Re pricing the items on the shelves"
good,A very good experience in working with the public.  I learned how to be more empathetic when dealing with questions and concerns of customers.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep negative customers happy and content while maintaining a positive attitude.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and conversing with many different and diverse people and personalities.
good,Just like Babies R Us east to work for and quick to hire. A typical retail store.
good,"for the most part smooth and productive sometimes slow, I learned smiling and giving customer great satisfaction can change their day, managers weren't as organized as they should've been with dividing up breaks, other associates were pretty friendly and productive, hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that wanted to use out dated coupons and trying to force the issue, most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know other people and most of all coming to the end of the shift."
good,I enjoyed working for this company for several years. Being here has provided me with great professionalism and customer service skills to carry on. Along with the sales floor I also worked for the logistics side of the company which was extremely helpful in my development of interpersonal skills.
good,"Target was a decent company to work for.  A typical day was very stressful, but was expected in retail.  Management was typical at any job.  The hardest part of the job for me was working overnight with my kids.  The most enjoyable part would be just seeing my accomplishments and work being seen by others and getting rewarded for all the hard work."
good,A typical day at work will include checking guest out of store
good,"Working with guests to assist and ensure a great shopping experience.  Setting planograms, zoning, putting away returns and cashiering while managing a team under payroll constrictions.  Ensuring the team accomplishes tasks and reaches goals including sales goals and survey results.  Re-merchandising product to be full and impactful.  Collaborating with peers and superiors to communicate processes to the team.  Managing talent through coaching sessions, developmental conversations and interviewing to build a strong team."
good,"On a regular day to day basis at target I attend to guest as a cashier/sales associate."
good,"Poor management, Inflexible schedule, low pay. Despite having a job title and description, you are expected to jump in elsewhere at a moments notice. If some one calls out or doesn't do their job; you are expected to do both."
good,I love what I do however the compensation is no longer covering my basic needs.
good,very good environment to meet new people. Co-workers always gave recognizion to each other
good,A typical day at work was enjoyable if I kept busy.  I learned a lot about managing displays and organization of the store.
good,"Great place to start a retail management job out of college. They are good with training and developing, and have some of the best equipment in the industry."
good,"Everyone got along and worked hard to maintain sales up. Our guests were very friendly and us , as cashiers, tried to make their visit as pleasant as possible."
good,"Poor Management structure and behavior, Wonderful co workers and provides good days work."
good,"Typical work day consists of pulling and pushing product to the sales floor so shelves are stocked, back stocking extra product and making sure backroom stays clean, and helping guests as needed. I learned how retail can be different from many warehouses I have been in. Management was amazing and very helpful in all areas. I also enjoyed working with all my co-worker, they were all very helpful at all times. One of the hardest parts of the job was learning to help guests that where frustrated in some way. Most enjoyable part of the job would have to be my early morning schedule."
good,"Coworkers eager to move up and develop "
good,"It was ok, It was my first job. I loved my manager.The hardest part was lifting heavy equipment."
good,"Fast paced, always changing retail operations."
good,Was an okay job. was grateful for it but pay wasn't that great.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to interact with the interesting people i meet and grow friendships with. Some of the people I can sit with and talk to for hours as their lives simply amaze me. I love most of my co-workers.
good,I had a positive outlook on the company. I received higher wages at another job so I chose to leave Target.
good,Funding for analytic tools is never in question.  This being said the business objectives do not align with implementing statistical analysis.
good,"good hours but they wouldn't work with my school schedule "
good,Target is a fun place to work at. It can be stressful at times but it makes things interesting. I enjoy my co-workers and get along with all of them. The hardest part of the job is when they do not schedule enough people and expect one person to get through four workers jobs in a very short amount of time. The most enjoyable part is getting to interact with the public and help guest finds the items they need and making them happy.
good,"I am usually either guest service or salesfloor. Guest service entails dealing with returns, price matching items, guest complaints, and in store pickups. I have definitely learned how to deal with angry guests during my time asx guest service, all with a smile on my face! And as a salesfloor team member, I'm just picking up after guests, help them find what they're looking for, and driving sales. Management is always good except for the Target interns. The interns are hired from outside Target, meaning they have no experience at Target at all, and they come in and become everyone's bosses. Doesn't really make sense to me having a boss that doesn't know what's going on, but they're quick learners (usually). Loved my co-workers, you always have to get along with your co-workers working retail, it just makes things easier. Hardest part of the job would be angry guests; it only happens once in a blue moon, but they can be very agressive/hostile. The most enjoyable part is when you actually get recognized for your work. It's nice when your boss knows how hard you're working."
good,"Target is a good starter job, they however don't allow over time and, as with any retail job, expect you to perform miracles. Management was always positive and gave staff snacks/drinks but they always promote the wrong people."
good,a typical day starts as soon as i walk in the door i walk straight into the truck and unload the merchandise. average truck size would have to be 2000 pieces. as soon as the trucks unloaded go to the sales floor and start the stocking part of the job until the whole store was finished. my coworkers really help with making the day go by smooth a quick definitely the most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers i work with. i would have to say the hardest part about the job is nothing actually.
good,"At Target being creative is very important as my briefs are.. well, very brief, no more than 10-20 words, which is fine as it comes as second nature to me creating and designing new products, brands and identities. "
good,"A typical day can consist of doing anywhere from ten to twenty different responsibilities depending on what day of the week it is. As receiver I am kept quite busy between vendors, paperwork, truck loading, and hazardous material handling. I've learned a lot about how the logistics of a large business works and communicate well with my fellow team members to insure all of the logistics area is kept clean while maintaining a safe work environment. Lack of communcation by managment"
good,"target is a great place to work for and to learn new skills. by working in the food area, ive grown to be a cashier, sales floor, operator, and fitting room. the most wonderful part about my job is the people, i love my guest. hard work i know it and i show it. just give me a chance to prove the same thing to you. thatnks for taking the time out to review my resume, have a bless day"
good,"I would assist team members and guests with items and questions and one of the things I have learned is that you have to be patient with more than just the guests. The hardest part of the job is (in a non exaggerative sense) getting 3-5 things done at once without getting reprimanded. the most enjoyable part of the job, is assisting someone, whether they be a guest or co-worker, and helping them get what the need and also interacting with my co-workers is fun also."
good,"Bon collègues de travail"
good,Making sure people find things and then tender them out. helping carry things out to the cars
good,"A little unorganized, at least in the department I worked in, but the employees were easy to work with."
good,"My overall look of working at target was just a well good learning experience especially that being my first job, a typical day was going to work and clocking and checking what department I would be working in them seeing my department leader and being told what task had to be done. My co-workers were nice and outgoing and definietly focused on getting the tasks completed done for the day, I enjoyed near the end of the day when there weren't customers in the store when I can focus on cleaning and putting back returned items in the department. The hardest part of my job was when I had to leave my deaprtment and assist at the registers becuase there would be so many customers and it was around the holiday season but I became use to it and became a little easier."
good,The duties of an Asset Protection Specialist at Target vary from theft trending to camera review. We had our routines to complete but we were expected to act as a regular employee. That including being on cash doing carryouts and helping guests find the products that they were looking for. I personally enjoyed helping customers and interacting with them. The only negative that really hit home was the manager of the store would call me the other security guards name and vice versa. There was only two of us and we are there everyday.
good,Deal with a great amount of workload but all in a friendly and fast paced environment.
good,Target is a good place to work for students. They are flexible around scheduling for the purposes of school. I have also met some very nice people while working there. The TM (team members) are truly a TEAM.
good,This job was a seasonal position so i did not really enjoy that much but the pay was okay.
good,"It was a great leaning opportunity ."
good,Executed cash transactions Quickly and accurately. Greeted all customer. Checked out customers and bagged items Quickly.
good,I have been there for a number of years and depending on management it has been better than others. Overall culture can be fake and intense. Meetings are overkill. Micro-management seems to be a norm.
good,"A typical day starts out with checking my email. Then checking and logging team member's hours for the previous and prepping for payroll. Around 10 am, the phones really start to pick up and on top of  assisting guests with questions and concerns, a list of reports have to printed out for the day. Throughout the day, managers form other departments may assign mini projects for me to work on and because at my particular Target, the HR team is in charge of sign preparations for the new week and have to be done by Saturday night before the store closes because Sundays is the start of the new week."
good,Its nice friendly people that shop there. theres alot going on when theres sales and specials in the store.
good,"Overall, this was a good place to work.It definitely depends on what department you work in. If you work in logistics, be ready to work some fun overnight or early morning hours."
good,It is an okay place to work when you are starting your career.  Work/Life balance is a challenge due to the amount of conversions and turnovers.
good,It was a fun fast paced job. I liked the thrill of having so much to do with a small window of time. We came in 4 hours before the store opened to restock. The hardest part was waking up that early. I enjoyed getting off early though.
good,"This job was fun, and easy, though they were not school friendly, During the holidays they would keep you there until three am fixing shelfs even if you had to be at class at 8 am, only paid min wage. Managers were crude and didnt care about the employees"
good,"I was able to learn alot of different areas in the store, made me more of a people person."
good,"Working at target was very comfortable. Everyone around me was friendly no drama, great work site but hours were bad. I learned how customer service works and how to cashier really good. I enjoyed talking to the customers about target products and how they were going to use them at home."
good,working here helped me to better understand the true meaning of team work.
good,"Morning shifts consist of Suspect Date Audits which means scanning frozen, dairy, produce and meat merchandise to see if it has expired. Pulling Fulliment Orders which are online orders which was ordered by guest. Back stock coolers and stock side of warehouse and receiving side."
good,"I've learned a lot of patience as well as good working ethics. "
good,Its a good place to start a job when you get out from High school the co-workers are really nice and helpful too
good,"Awful management but decent pay, easy enough job, early hours not fun and not all that flexible when they say they would be, cut hours quickly even if good worker"
good,"Not as crazy as things are at say Walmart, but they have their moments. Management tries its best to be understanding of your situation. Sometimes they just fall flat. For instance, had a surgical procedure done that required a few weeks of rest off and they were not willing to accommodate that, so I had to quit."
good,Overall it was a good company to work for but it was retail so when the season changes so does employment.
good,I had a lot of fun working at Target. The managers were really great leaders and motivators.
good,Not to bad for highschool kids and post grads looking for some easy cash
good,Typical day at Target was usually busy especially at thee Starbucks. I learned to have good customer service. Management was he best and so were my co workers.
good,not so good for advancement..they look for certain people only to move up
good,"Easily enjoyable and exciting place to work, i learned a lot about retail and how markets effect retail as well as how important customer satisfaction is, all of my co-workers were very friendly and helpful during my training process."
good,"Pretty good place to work. A typical day for me consisted of making the store presentable for our guest, this included putting merchandise on the floor to maintain proper floor stocking levels. Also, making sure to give amazing guest service to each and every guest."
good,Slow to make decisions. Focus on relationship building more than results.
good,"I was a seasonal employee in the outbound department of a distribution center. Basically, I loaded trucks from 6am-6pm 3 times a week plus scheduled overtime. They pay very well, and you are by yourself for most of the day. The job is very fast paced, and can be overwhelming at times. The best part was that the time goes by surprisingly fast. I had hopes of staying as a full time team member, but was laid off at the end of the seasonal period."
good,I like Walmart because of the discounts and also the associates were nice people to get along with.
good,Not a mentally taxing job but a very physically challenging job.
good,targets is relatively easy to work at but shifts are short and you are rushed to remove merchandise from truck
good,"My typical day at work would to keep overall cleanliness of the store, stock shelves, cashier, and inventory. I enjoyed working there while I was in high school."
good,managers and team leads are unprofessional. but overall good job experience.
good,"•	RESPONSIBILITIES include designing, drafting & updating Lighting, Power, Access control, Perimeter security and Fire Alarm Drawings for Target stores & distribution centers coordinating with the Architecture, Structural Mechanical & store planning teams for space constraints and other coordination issues. "
good,"A typical day at work consist of standing behind a register and helping guest with their purchases. "
good,"Good place, good people."
good,"I worked at target for over 4 years and looking back on it, it was good for what is was but definitely not a career I am interested in."
good,"I was hired as a cashier, helped customers find what they needed and made sure they saved their money."
good,I tranfered to the Golden Valley Target store. I was rediculed & wrongly written up 2 time in one month. I have never been written up until I got to that Target location.
good,"Though, it was a seasonal job, it was beneficial to provides excellent service to the company, co workers, and most important provides assistance to customers."
good,"Tough company to work for. They have great pay which really hold you in place and as long as your in a green store you have the chance for advancing quickly. But get into a red store that is having trouble with turn-around... you'll be stuck there until it's green, you quit, or get fired."
good,steady work low pay no upward growth for an extended period of time
good,"Come to work early, put any thing that needs to go back in its location, put anything that is needed to go out in the electronic section, and help customer when needed that has to with the store in general or electronics in particular.  I have refined my skills with customer experience, and dealing with vendors that come to the store.  Management is very nice and caring, and is always willing to listen if you have any problems.  I work with other teams members on the floor to bring a better overall customer experience that they can appreciate.  Tedious work that is not Intellectually Stimulating.  The over all working environment and providing a excellent work experience."
good,"The people at Target are very friendly and good to work with, however depending on your position within the company can make them not care for you based on numbers. Usually when I go in I talk to guests about the products in the electronics department and organize that area of the store. I enjoy the communication aspect of the job the most because I get to meet a lot of new people. The hardest part of my job involves the numbers I mentioned above. If i don't sell so many accessories or warranties with products regardless of the guest telling me they don't want anything even with a manager standing there listening they will tell me I didn't push the products enough. I have learned how to multitask a lot better as well as a lot of information about new and upcoming technology."
good,"Helping guest can be a great experience because they will remember your kindness, so if you're thinking of working retail and on the sales floor, please keep that in mind. And don't forget to smile."
good,was good job but at this particular store was bad management
good,A typical day at work involved customer service for various shoppers at Target.
good,got entire organizational buy in to philosophy to drive sales
good,learned alot about many products and the business aspect of target and how they treat there customers
good,"Very fast tempo. Lots of co-workers, never really got close to any. Entry level job."
good,No day was the same and there was endless work to be done. Zoning the soft lines sales floor and working as cashier and fitting room attendant.
good,"As a Cashier, you have to go in with a different mind set at all times. You will meet all kinds of guests, and its a good way to experience customer service."
good,unfortunately the upper management wasn't qualified for the positions they held
good,"The company gives importance to FFF(Fast,Fun&Friendly) work culture."
good,Always learning something new calm environment. Handled prescriptions and dealt with different types of people
good,The management was really good.I could learn many new things from this company.But there were even many typical situations faced during my work.
good,was ok to work at loaded trucks by hand and forklift at times supervisors were irresponsible and. did not know their jobs and put things on the employees to finish their work
good,Managing Vendors and ensuring building is ready for another business day.
good,A typical day at work usually begins with putting away an order of various medications.  Afterwards it is all filling prescriptions and ensuring walk up guests get the correct medications.  Management at Target is very involved and makes sure that team members are happy and have everything they need.  Co-workers really make the job enjoyable.
good,"Opening, closing store. Customer service. Commission based sales."
good,Restocking shelves and learning how to use different machines in the back room of the store. Management was very fun to work with and get good advice from. My coworkers were also excellent to work with. The hardest part of the job was restocking and zoning the arreas in the store. The most enjoyable part was working around different cultures and customers
good,My time there was short. Had fun meeting different people. Learned a different side to retail.
good,"a normative day at work was quite the toss up. Because I could be working in the backroom at the store or I was working at the warehouse another day. I never seen my manager at the Target store but my manager at the warehouse was pretty strict and always there. My co-workers, most have worked there for 5 plus years and was pretty prideful about things getting done which I admired. I learned to feel a sense of accomplishment with every chore you complete on shift. The hardest part was keeping up with my own schedule to see when I was working because they switched days up on me so much. The most enjoyable part was being a apart of a team that took a lot of joy in a job that they were actually happy to have."
good,The company is a good company to work for. There were a lot of benefits and HR was really great.
good,Just the people that I worked with was fun. And the early morning hours getting out of work early. We also worked the hardest out of everyone else well other dept doesn't get their work done but we do.
good,"The hardest part of the job is when the person that is training you is not there and the company expects you to know how to close Food Avenue by yourself."
good,a great great company but its reatil and with that comes over worked not really underpaid just get burnt out super fast
good,A typical day i would get my computer logged on and get ready to assist customers with returning and locating company products .
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with but the management had there own objective instead of the company
good,Target is a fast paced retail atmosphere.  Not one day is the same as the previous.
good,Decent job - filler for the season. I needed a job for a winter season between summer seasons at the Sunset Grille. It worked out great.
good,"-Target is great with keeping you busy."
good,In my department we have flexibility on when we will start our day. We just have to make sure to complete all of our work in our 40 hour work week. There is a divide within Target of exempt (salaried) and non-exempt employees. I have been able to further my education on how a Fortune 500 company works and also have learned more about all of the Microsoft products. I have gained a wealth of knowledge from mentors within the corporation. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I get to do what I love everyday - working in the pharmaceutical industry and learning more about it every day.
good,I only worked there for about one month. Nothing bad to say. I liked working there.
good,I enjoy what i do looking for better income to support my family
good,"-Run the day to day operations"
good,"cashier, not that fun of a place to work at and the management was good. depending on who was working"
good,"In my limited time at Target, I did not have an overly good experience. I was paid well for the job I was doing, but the job was always very early in the day. I was responsible for pulling product from the warehouse to replenish the sales floor, as well as receiving new product and organizing it in the warehouse. The job was generally enjoyable, but the team I was on was continually asked to be more and more productive or faster on a daily basis, even with fewer and fewer employees during my time there."
good,"NO HOURS  - Shipment Unloading, Forklift Operation and Stock Distribution"
good,"Work Was Ok , learned a lot Everything was easy on to the next level."
good,Very busy from the time it opens to closing. Friendly team but everything circled around the scores and numbers. The team worked hard everyday. One pharmacist on duty for 12hrs and that was definitely not enough. Easy to get time off. The hardest part of the job was not enough down time to do the little things. Almost always guest at the counter.
good,Working as a cashier was a fast paced job.  The job needed to be completed at a timely pace.  Often times management would just assign a cashier and forget about you until later.  There really wasn't to much time to socialize with other co-workers.
good,I have work for Target for more than 10 years in multiple positions. Overall I have really enjoyed my time with the company. In the last 6 months to a year is when I have found myself most unhappy. The company today is not the same company I started with. I feel like the upper management is compromising the company values and requiring some unrealistic workload from leaders and team members at the store level.
good,"ive been crossed trained, i dont always get all the amount of training there"
good,Target is a great place to work.  Every day you get to come in and interact with a variety of guest.  Every day is like working with friends and family.  Targets development of their team members is above any other retailer out there.  They set you up for whatever lives little challenges has for you.
good,"•	Processed merchandise and maintained stock levels for high-end merchandise."
good,"I was hired during the back to school rush, so I was never properly trained. I shadowed people on the sales floor and learned through observation, but never was trained by a trainer. I asked questions and tried to learn, but many people expected me to already know how to do certain tasks, even though I had no previous retail experience. I brought up the training issue to several managers, but they always brushed it off, saying they'd talk to me at a later time about it. Eventually, I just gave up asking and did the best I could. I had an ""early performance review"" and my direct manager basically told me she didn't like my face. (Even though whenever I had contact with a customer, I was always smiling, friendly, and polite.)"
good,"- basic 8 hour shift"
good,you spend most of you day out side walking back and forth through the parking lot.
good,"Worked there for a little over 2 years. Experienced two yearly raises, but had one raise taken away, as well as every other employee, due to a minimum wage raise. Huge turnover rate, and not too many of my former coworkers were happy working there. There were many employees that worked for many years without what seemed like any hope of job advancement."
good,-Typical work day was to work with customer service and restock merchandise
good,wonderful friendly and upbeat place to work with a lot of growing experience.
good,"I enjoy my days as an employee with this company. I got along with everybody. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers, unhappy customers. The most enjoyable of this job was working in different departments."
good,Target is a very people oriented company. They really try to educate and train their employees.
good,plenty of opportunities to gain experience and stretch professional skill sets.
good,"Clocking into work and calling the (LOD) Leader on Duty and getting your plans for the normal work day."
good,"I had extensive experience working as a backroom associate, you learn something new everyday."
good,"It was ok.  I didnt like that we couldn't if we had all the cloths put back, until the entire store had all of there merchandise put back."
good,worked nightshift...stocked all night long...learned to use pda...co-workers are team player...hardest part was to stay awake!!
good,Worked part time for a few years a lax enviroment but management can be picky at times
good,My typical day at work consist of dealing with a lot of guest good and bad. Im also in charge of returns so I do tend to get yelled at alot since im am the manger if the guest is not satified with the return policy. Im learned to be very patient. I am able to multi task with paper work and managing a team of 7 under me. I have develpoed many team mebers to potential Team Leads. My co workers are very nice and fun and they work really hard to make sure we have each others back . The hardest part of my job would probably be giving constuctive criticizism to the team members im developing. Its for the good of them so they can improve but sometimes they probably dont want to here it. The most enjoyabkle part is our fun even calenders we do something fun like milk and cookies day or ice cream day on weekends. We also have BBQ's we we meet our safety goals or depending on the department your wroking when ou achieve that goal.
good,"I learned from the best. I acquired many qualities while working under hectic schedules. I accomplished leadership, team-work, planning, organizing, time-management, customer service and various other skills."
good,"I was hired so late into the season did not have much time"
good,They only offer benefits if you work 32 hours or more a week.It is an ideal job for a student but for a career you need additional education.
good,great place to work. Loved going to work everyday and interacting with my peers.
good,"Maintained sales quota, some cash register work, withheld great customer services"
good,Learned self management. Developed organizational skills and attention to details. Develop communicational skills with employers and co-workers. Created a professional relationship with customers. The most enjoyable aspect of the position was contributing to the company development. The hardest part of the position was being subject to company policies on scheduling and pay. Employees could not have control over their hours for the week and did not have enough opportunities for promotions.
good,"Its a good place to work at, I like the people and regular customers but they don't give enough hours and they don't pay by experience"
good,Target is a good company to work for. it is not union because they offer everything a job with a union does.
good,"Target was my first retail job and that itself was interesting. Retail is much different then food service. Target is where I experienced my first ""Black Friday"" and that too was experience in itself. I really liked working at Target. I worked in different areas of the store, I got decent amount of hours per week, there were good people at Target. It was fun."
good,"É bem puxado porem é o que eu gosto de fazer."
good,"I was just a temp there, contracted through AppleOne. But it paid decently and the supervisors were nice though no-nonsense / strictly business. Effort is rewarded."
good,It was a nice environment and my co workers were nice people.
good,Decent pay moving company my day consists of stocking and back stocking store items from the truck.
good,"Very busy "
good,"Sales Floor Trainer							April 2011 – February 2012"
good,"1.at work, starts with TBT meeting then going to site for the given job for the day."
good,I had an big time learning from supervisors on how to run and store area. Working and helping with different people was an great experience.
good,"Not my favorite place to work. This company had it's ups and downs, and getting hours can be a pain sometimes when they decide to save money and cut back."
good,"Here, I was an overnight stocker and I truly felt that I was being paid to get fit. This job was physically challenging; however, the pay was acceptable and I enjoyed it."
good,"I am responible for all planograms and sales plans to be present and set on the floor in the appropriate time frame. "
good,pay scale is very low. job is fun and people are great. I would return to Target as a part time worker only.
good,a typical day is not working at Target any little thing can happen and usually does working with the public the unknown is the fun part.
good,"A typical day started with a morning meeting where all managers at the store would take turns reading us the daily projections to us before going back to the area we were responsible for. We were often out of things that were advertised or just out of things and guests did not much care for this nor did we. Overall Target is a good company that has the right idea, they just need to work on their inventory system and delineating the hierarchy and responsibilities of the many various managers, team leads, and trainers in the store. It was pleasant enough to work for them for eleven months but i also knew that i needed to focus on school and make sure to move up and move on."
good,"work in stocking area, cashier counting down your register before shift over."
good,"I love working with people and although it is extremely stressful to work in retail, it is also fun. Seeing the people come in and shop many times they joke with you and knowing, is really rewarding you can make their day better just by smiling or helping them with something."
good,Work days were fast paced. I learned to multitask while maintaining a happy spirit. It was fun seeing many faces and smiles. Supervisors were very focused on guest services. No leniency was given on health needs. Standing with no breaks was hard. My love for children made my job most enjoyable. Seeing and talking to guests helped me get through my days.
good,"Cashier, and help keep store clean. IT was good to talk to people from all around the world."
good,I have nothing bad to say about this company. I worked there for a little while and the time I spent I learned more there then any other job.
good,Work days were well managed. Coworkers were friendly and informative.
good,its ok by the book no room for expressing opinion thats all i have to say
good,"Good employer, good benefits, great place for customers.  Good culture and co-workers were nice."
good,"Verify all vendors bringing merchandise in the store. Organizing and logging files for items shipped to store through UPS/FEDEX used software for shipping. Loaded truck for returns to the Distribution Center."
good,A good part of your week is keeping multiple levels of management updated on the status of projects.  The company is becoming management heavy with a lot of time spent trying to achieve consensus of multiple departments which causes significant delays in making progress on things with a short timeline.  A high level of talent works for Target but to get anywhere you need to play political games.
good,"Very fast paced. Always something to do. Back up cashier, interviews, making the schedule, floor sets, pushing clearance, instocks. Partnering with pricing, instocks,logistics and plano teams."
good,"A typical day  at this particular company involved greeting guests, assisting them with proper locations of items, assisting with stocked merchandise in backroom, placing new merchandise out on salesfloor, stocking and organizing items in each department.  Coworkers were pretty easy to get along with, not all managers cooperated in a fashionable manner but my work experience there was acceptional"
good,A typical day consisted mainly of stocking the store. Management was a little unfair but okay. They chose favorites. The co-workers were pretty fun & the environment was okay. The hardest part of the job was trying to stock quickly on a time limit which is a minute per box. The most enjoyable part of the job was fun Friday's where we got treated for our hard work.
good,Loved learning more about Indian culture and international experience.
good,I enjoyed working for this company and enjoyed working with the Pricing Team.
good,"Graded and sorted products according to factors such as color, species, width, appearance, feel, smell, and quality to ensure correct processing and usage."
good,Very long hours lay offs all the time not equal opportunity wages were pretty descent but work wasn't consistant.
good,"My job consisted of running a department in the store. I liked the actual work, though I didn't see eye to eye with management. My direct boss was my mentor, though I did not for a lot of close relationships with coworkers. I worked cash registers, filled shelves, fixed pricing, set up end caps and displays, and supervised my teams."
good,"Productive and a good work place, and work culture is best among other retail stores"
good,"A typical day at work started at 4am and as soon as you get in the door be ready to be fun, fast and friendly. This company taught me how to multi task at a fast pace. My co-workers all worked together to get the truck down at a timely manner. The hardest part of the job was getting up early but once your up and stretch your happy to go into work. The most enjoyable part was knowing at the end of your shift how much work you can accomplish in a matter of 4 hrs."
good,"Being a Pharmacy Tech at Target, I was given the opportunity to work with a variety of pharmacists, filling prescriptions as well as building relationships with day-to-day customers. This largely impacted my ability to be charismatic with a large array of people. Target provided an environment that made it easy for myself adjust and perform day-to-day duties as a member of their Pharmaceutical team."
good,productive and exciting work place; retail industry experience; best brand to w0rk with
good,"always follow  the rule on safety, clean,and awareness to all guest, serve with smile, friendly and sale more target red cards. "
good,"Working with Target has helped me become more personable as an employee. When I am at work, I am there to service the guests that enter the store and help them find exactly what they are looking for, if not more. Communicating with customers has become an enjoyable experience for me, and it pleases me (and the company) when they leave satisfied with their Target experience."
good,"	Proactively handled shipments, loading, and unloading merchandise."
good,had the job during college don't really remember much. more concerned with shirts being tucked in then helping customers.
good,"Could do better with Diversity Recruiting. There are not many African American, Asian American, or Hispanic American Team Members within the company."
good,A nice workplace to start to help pay for college. I learn how to talk and satisfy customers needs. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the guest thats hard to satify.
good,Typical days are busy. I learned how to multi task really well. Management is helpful. Co-workers are great. It was hard to be in so many places at one time. I enjoyed my coworkers.
good,For many years the work was rewarding.  The job changed and the work became unbearable.
good,Good place to work and grow. Co-workers are usually higher grade than walmart and more customer based
good,Good place to work.  Management could spend more time developing their non-exempt employees.
good,A typical day at work was very interesting with all the different customers that come in. I learned a lot about how to open a store up and how to lead coworkers. Everyone was brand new there and we were all coming together to open a store so management was a little stressed but always empathetic and helpful. My coworkers were awesome we are all actually still friends and in the work place we took care of business while still enjoying ourselves. The hardest part of this job i would have to say is getting everyone trained and up to required standards to make beverages. The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely the customers that would come in everyday and getting to know a little bit about each one.
good,"Executive Team Leader - Hardlines"
good,At Target it was always considered temporary/part time job so you hardly worked 35 hours a week. Sometimes you might 16 hours and sometimes 24 hours a week. I would have liked to work a little more that that.
good,"the hours made it difficult to have a set schedule for the most part, most of the workers were friendly. Customers were quite irritated with their life most of the time, but overall there were nice people every once in a while. I learned a tremendous amount about Coffee working as a Starbucks Barista."
good,"Job Duties included pushing out merchandise to be stocked before store opening. Stock backroom, putting things into proper location, and logging information in using pda‘s. Unload truck full of freight."
good,"Usually i would clock in, do my work, go on my breaks and clock out. I didn't really learn anything new except how to use a PDA for inventory and placing. Management was pretty cool, I always saw them around and they always said hello and used my name which i liked. My coworkers seemed like pretty nice people, not that i spoke to them enough to really get to know them. The hardest part of the job was constantly cleaning up after customers but that was the job so i just dealt with it and just kept thinking, i am getting paid to do this which helped. The part of the job i most enjoyed was helping customers with their problems and seeing them go on their way with a smile."
good,Experienced the importance of supply chain management while being able to assist our guests.
good,A typical day was organizing the store.  I have learned to pay attention to little details.  Management wanted miracles.  Co-workers were great.  The hardest part were the challenges the job would bring.  The enjoyable part was the great results at the end.
good,very good work atmoshere and management was excellent. I would work for them again.
good,Work at cash register recording sales and collecting payments. Short-term assignment at jewelry counter.
good,"As a third shift employee, the only typical thing was there were few people around. Many of the co-workers came and went because 3rd shift is not a favorite. The work was not hard but I felt management could be more attuned to employees needs and more than once there was not enough work force to accomplish the job at hand and the team was held responsible for it."
good,Holidays are the best part because the hours go up. Hectic but worth it.
good,It was okay to wrok there but the workers or to serious and the managers want perfection but not at their expense but at the employees beneath them
good,Always a million peolple to help keeps you on your toes at all times.
good,"We would be there early morning to unload a truck. The hardest part was the stocking when things ever changed locations. Management was effective at pushing us to get the job done as fast as possible, albeit at times it was difficult to do so."
good,Interact with the customers for a great shopping experience. Unload trucks and stock merchandise
good,"Supportive management when i was still there, not am not sure."
good,A typical days work was making guest feel welcomed and making sure that every guest is satisfied with their products. I learned a lot about the retail business as far as the first impression counts in every situation given its very important to make everything look nice at all time throughout the days work.
good,"I like that fact that it was always something to do, stayed busy, enjoyed helping customers..."
good,"I helped customers find items, stocked shelves, worked the cash registers, collected carts, and worked the electronics section of the store."
good,"I really enjoyed working with the customers, I didnt care for the hours late at night"
good,"My typical work day was I came in punched in got ready and stood by the front doors to greet guests. I learned all my lost prevention skills such as using cameras to follow shoplifters, apprehend shoplifters with handcuffs. Management started out good after a change in management there was a lot of favoritism, people got in trouble about things that other people did not. My co-workers were very good people very fun to be around and work with. The hardest part of the my job was not being able to be in the camera room to look for shoplifters. The most enjoyable part was working as a team to stop and apprehend shoplifters."
good,"My typical day at work consist of clocking in, touching base with the team member that I'm working along with for my shift, sorting foreign objects and putting away products that belong in my department. I've learned that only my best is good enough. For the most part, I got along with the team members in my department not so much other co-workers. The most enjoyable part of my job was when the managers would reward the team for something good that they did."
good,My fellow cashiers are the best.  The hardest part is explaining to an upset guest that what they're upset about is not my fault.
good,I mostly helped customers and straightened up the dept I was assigned to. I also helped any other associates the needed help.
good,"The higher up the totem pole, the less labor. Prepare to make minimum wages as a sales associate. There is a lot of labor required for sales associates."
good,Target has provided me with the experience to develop as a communicator with peers and in front of groups of people as well. It has taught me the skills needed to be a successful leader and has provided me with tools and resources to help better manage people.
good,Working for Target was a challenging yet very rewarding experience. Company standards are very high but as long as you have self-discipline and great work ethic you can succeed. The most enjoyable part of the job was developing others and watching them get excited about learning new things.
good,"A typical day at work includes ringing up a transaction and closing out a sale by asking if a customer is interested in applying for a Target credit card.  One thing I learned was learning how to be a team player and like Wal-Mart, learning how to be patient and calm when things get a little too tense and difficult to handle.  The management there was very respectful and understanding, but like Wal-Mart, not always available and ready to assist cashiers and customers when they really need help.  The coworkers are also very nice as well, and always invites you to join in their fast, fun and friendly environment, even during tense and peak times when things get very hectic.  The hardest part of the job was learning how to be patient when waiting for a member of management to assist in a situation, especially since they take a pretty long time to come.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with your fellow coworkers during downtime and like Wal-Mart, making time go by more quickly by keeping busy all day long with customers."
good,Development based company good to start your career at but can be difficult to move up if you are in a non-exempt position or unable to network. TIP: NETWORK!
good,"This was a simple job, nothing too crazy. The schedule was great and everyone who worked there was very nice."
good,"I learned how to ensure that the customer was always happy, and different ways to meet deadlines when it came to getting work done ."
good,At times Target can be stressful based on the high volume of guest that enters the establishment each day. Sometimes there is not enough team members to accommodate all of the guest. The upside to that is that your able to learn to multitask and transition throughout different areas of the store; which is a plus!!. Management is ok
good,Kmart was a nice place to work when I was younger but the times have changed and so has the values and outlook.
good,Good company to work for the staff is amazing and everyone are team players
good,"A typical day at work would include me providing customers with great customers services while shopping at walmart. Maintaining a clean, and neat work-place"
good,Great company to improve skills in peer development and collaboration.
good,"Target Corporation is a good company but they let too many people call-off of work and get away with it. I have only called-off once. That was due the fact that I was with my Sister in law and she went into labor, so I stayed with her naturally. I know, I am a pretty loyal worker. I feel like it is never noticed. I'm ready to work at a place were I get at least a little noticed for my good work and a place where I enjoy it."
good,A typical day at work for me was basically unloading merchandise from semi-trucks and pallets for 12 hours. I learned how to label merchandise and scan merchandise to be put into inventory. I enjoyed working with my co-workers because they are very competitive and hardworking. The hardest part of the job was deciding what to do with non-con merchandise and how to sort them out. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to operate the machines.
good,"I really enjoyed my time there"
good,The people at Target are wonderful to work with. If you dont mind working weekends or closing I would say this is an amazing retail company to work for. I felt that they had a great company culture and values.
good,Not bad company to work for but not the best either. Employee discount is not that great
good,Normal pay ranges to comparable companies. No bad overall. Lack of appreciation as far as possibility of advancement goes but staff is relatively nice.
good,"A typical day was the same from first minute to last. I did learn that this work doesn't suit me. I don't even like to shop for clothes, jewelry or makeup."
good,"Generally a good place to work.  Retail environment is high stress, not much corporate support for pharmacy business."
good,It was ok. I busted my butt all the time but overnights are very draining
good,"Working in retail is what people tell you it is, the customer, or guest in this case, is always right. It certainly has its ups and downs, but at the end of the day - it's a job. With a large roster of employees, Target is a good place for a first job, or even seasonal work. Most of the managers are friendly, and fun to be around. To cut this short, overall - working at Target gets 3/5 stars."
good,target corp is an ok place to work. moving from one place  to the next.
good,"Being a part-time cashier in a retail environment isn't the best job in the world, but it's certainly not the worst either."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is working so closely with people.
good,Overall being a manager wasn't the easiest job in the world but Target was a fun place to work. The downside of retail is most of the associates aren't looking for a career which leads to laziness and unreliability.
good,"I had a lot of fun working for target, because of fellow coworkers and the very clean and organized work environment."
good,"Fast, Fun and Friendly. Co Workers and Managers were fun to work with. Most customers were friendly. This Company is easy to work for."
good,"It's everything you could hope for, while working for target. "
good,"Depending on the day a typical day at work for me will consist of first unloading all the freight on the truck. After that you push the store in sections; on non-truck days I go in and scan in the low and out of stock merchandise, check dates on the food, and assist guests on the sales floor."
good,"fun place ,great staff ,40 hrs a wk  ,overtime optional ,learning experience in warehousing"
good,Had great experiences with my management teams.  They were knowledgeable and experienced.
good,A typical day would be given a list of things to do and while doing those having to go to the front to be a cashier. It was understaffed so everyone was trying to carry a load for 10 people.
good,"•Compute sales prices, total purchases and receive and process cash or credit payment."
good,"Target is an amazing store, to shop at, not to work at. I helped out in every section of the store that needed help and didn't get a single thank you from anyone."
good,"unloaded trucks and stocked the store and night, was not the job for me."
good,Good Learning Skills Loading and Unloading products for the company.
good,"I learned something new everyday.  I learned how to be an effective, appreciated, and respected manager.  I had to resolve customer issues everyday. I loved my team members. The hardest part of my job was not being able to satisfy the customer every time.  I enjoyed interacting with the customers and making them feel like I was really working for them when they needed me."
good,A typical day at Target is that we would come in early before the store is open and stock up and order stuff that we have in the backroom or sold out. 
good,"The work environment is busy most of the day, especially on the weekends. I have learned that being a part of a huge company is a lot of hard work and responsibility. Co-workers general are very kind one another. Hardest part would be communication when the store is backed up, and when guests give us a hard time. Most enjoyable part is when the company treats the employees to snacks on long and busy days, or when they compliment us on our hard work."
good,Target is a big box company but their management needs improvement. The employees need better hours or more hours.
good,"I learned great social skills, as well as customer service skills and how to work with a team."
good,"good environment and work station while apart of team. Manage to balance for awhile,but overall would like to be apart of their company again"
good,"Three times a week, my store would receive fresh grocery goods that would be pushed out to the floor and then properly backstocked. This normally takes an entire morning shift to finish and leaves very little room for other tasks that need to be finished."
good,At this job I learned to deal with unhappy guest. The co-workers were friendly. Management was not very effective and available which made the job a little hard. I would say the co-workers mad e the job enjoyable
good,Working at target was a good job to have if your out of high school
good,Very good management. Good dependable co workers. Job structure and security. Opportunities for advancement.
good,If retail is your thing Target offers decent compensation and work hours.
good,"I had to do it in all weathers from a young age, although it gave me early experience I didn't enjoy the task."
good,"I work at the front end in guest service. My typical day includes me interacting with just about every guest that needs assistance with returns, locating and item in the store and making sure the guests leave satisfied. "
good,"Target is a very collaborative culture, so much so that one must get input from a lot of people before any decisions or changes can be made.  The environment is very ""Minnesota nice"" with a heavy emphasis on seeking feedback and professional development.  Opportunities for advancement abound if you're willing to work hard and play by the rules.  "
good,There are certain people that are ideal employees for working at Target.  They do a good job of trying to find those people and integrating them into the culture.

good,"Packaging boxes, stocking tables & boxes, loading & unloading trucks, cleaning walls, sweeping & mopping floors, throwing out the trash"

good,I worked at Target full-time for more than a year over night and went to school.
good,"Low pay rate."
good,I enjoyed working for Target. I disliked that it was seasonal. 
good,"A typical day includes pulling and back stocking product. Through this daily process you learn time management and how to be efficient. With the help of your co-workers it is much easier to complete tasks. Working and communicating together ensures that work gets done. The hardest part of the job is trying to get it all done. At times, it can become slightly hectic when many things happen at once and that is when we have to prioritize. The most enjoyable part is working with a bunch of great people.  "
good,"friendly team, made lots of friends - pay way too low and benefits are crummy unless you get a lead position, then they're OK"
good,"Target was a great place to work for the past 16 plus years, but at a point you will max out pay wise and advancement. You do get to be cross trained in all departments , and help out where ever you are needed."
good,It is a very productive place but the management is terrible. No one listens to you  and doesn't care what you have to say. 
good,This gave me exposure to helping clients and working as a team! 
good,"I usually go in and just do cashier. All the People that I worked with were really nice. The management was okay not that bad, they were nice at times and sometimes not but usually nice. The hardest part about my job was that no one really talked to me as much so i was kind of scared and lonely. The enjoyable part of my job was that I was actually very happy to see that my customers were satisfy once I checked them out of the store."
good,I learned quite a lot from working at this Target location including how to deal with unhappy customers and handling many tasks at one time.
good,"Target prides itself on having an amazing shopping experience for its guests. The company is very demanding on its managerial staff and is high pressure to perform your job at an exceedingly high rate. The training and development of an individuals leadership skills are great! Most of the team members are wonderful individuals who work hard and engage our guests. The hardest part of a store executives job is feeling appreciated and valued for their accomplishments and hard work. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with people, both guests and my team members."
good,Target is a ok place to work people a nice and will help when asked
good,Kept me busy and attentive. Loved being a cashier there. Enjoyed the atmosphere.
good,Company met my selling needs. Was an abundance of face to face selling that let me continue to grow in the commissioned sales atmosphere. 
good,"Get to work and to help clients for me it was a joy. I learn a lot of things, working in different s departments. My co-workers help each others all the time. I enjoy learn about others departments.   "
good,Training could have been better. Management was cold and unpersonal. 
good,I helped people all day and made sure the store was clean. Also would be a cashier when we were busy.
good,A typical work day included serving customers. Learned to use cash registers to assist customers in taking payment for merchandise using different types of currency and credit cards. Management was flexible. Co-workers were team players. The most enjoyable part of the job was at the end of the day when you knew that customers were satisfied and you knew that they would be coming back to shop. 
good,"It's a retail job. You can't get anymore frustrating than that!  The supervisors could have had a little more sympathy, but the coworkers were amazing people!"
good,refused to transfer me to new state.  Left me with bad taste in mouth and I am not ready to talk of Target.
good,Loved interacting with the customes made day go faster. Favorite part was working in the clothes department
good,"Fun."
good,This job was okay. Learned how to operate a cash register for the first time. Great time working with my coworkers.
good,"Good place to work because they are supportive with personal life and are concerned with well-being of employees. However, there is always someone willing to replace you and the scheduling is not really conducive to having a family. Also, the most frustrating part is dealing with some of the unrealistic expectations concerning hours scheduled to work that can be completed during that time."
good,"I worked as a cart attendant.  Human relationship is the utmost important thing, I think.  Management is good, coworkers were nice.  I was too busy to perform all the duties of mine.  I enjoyed the friendship with my coworker."
good,i learned a lot and i would go back just not overnight that was my first overnight job it was a new experience for me. The hardest part really wasn't none once you did training it was easy.My co-workers was ok didn't really try to make new friends.
good,There are always opportunities to advance and learn new things. 
good,it was ok its our shift leaders kept changing and our scheudle kept changing also
good,"The work days were long, envolved hard physical labor, but co-workers and day go by fast."
good,"Taking incoming calls within the store. Learned how to transfer calls to different departments, page managers and departments for incoming calls. opening and closing scripts. Management always available. Co-workers are team players. The hardest part was redistributing items to each departments but just had to find a system. Assisting customers. "
good,"hardest part of the job was the inconsistent schedule"
good,i would rate my experience with Target a 10. very good benefits long hours but good pay
good,"Same day processing meant several set deadlines that had to be met.  I learned everything about systems testing, software and hardware testing, installs and upgrades.  The hardest part was not being able to take any time off when I absolutely needed to the last year I was there.  Also, I had no idea if I was going to work 10 or 14 hours on any given day.  The best part was my team members.  They came from a variety of countries and backgrounds, which I really enjoyed being able to learn about."
good,"""We set high standards for your Target experience—where you shop with us and in our company halls. We aim to be a place where guests and team members will always find more than they expect. Our mission and values set the stage, and day-to-day innovation, teamwork and community partnerships reflect who we are."""
good,"-Enjoy organizational aspects"
good,"I did not like working for target for all of those years. The main reason i quit was because the managers fired one of my best friends who is gay, for being gay. "
good,Its a job but they dont give you great breaks and my hours got cut to the point where i didnt havea any hours anymore.
good,Lots of room to move around if your willing to and if managment will allow you to. Great co-workers to make the day go fast as possible. 
good,Almost all night shifts where you zone your area. Need to ask for days off several months in advance if its a weekend.
good,Nice and fun place to work. People are nice and make you feel valued.
good,"The job in itself is not difficult and it's my co-workers that make the job better. "
good,"typical retail environment, you were constantly pushed to sell consumers Target credit cards. "
good,"Typical days was to pull orders, receive or load truck. Learned how to operate a lot of machinery, computer skills and how to be fast and do the job right. Hardest part of my job was to keep inventory of our products. "
good,"Every job they can give you is easy. However, the management at my store needs improvement. One in particular tends to place blame on whoever he feels could have been the one responsible for something without ever even trying to investigate."
good,"This was a great company to work for, the management just needed a change . Overall , I'd work for target again, just at a different location."
good,"You were constantly stocking or pulling items from shelves, some you needed a ladder to get to. Since i was the only worker in high school in the stockroom, i worked until the store closed and was often by myself."
good,As an overnight team member at target i was responsible for unloading the truck loads every night. Unloading gave me insight as to how long it would take for the employees to stock the store. Most of my co workes were very experienced and helped make my job easier. The hardest part of the job was finding more work to do. Work with a group of hard workers for me was the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"At this store it was hard work in the Starbucks kiosk. Working full 8 hour shifts by yourself, only getting breaks covered."
good,"Manage team schedules and checkout traffic, act quickly to resolve guest concerns, lead a fast, fun and friendly checkout team, and maintain a clean, great looking store"
good,"ends to a means     "
good,This job kept me very busy with helping customers find certain products & checking them out.
good,"It's a neat and organized environment which is what drew me to it. I worked in logistics which is a good place to work if you like starting work while it's still dark. Target seems to pay higher than other retail jobs too and the benefits, if you're eligible, are great. As with any job, management makes or breaks the job. However, it seems like all you need to be in management there is a nice smile, a great body and a brown nose."
good,"A typical day at work is putting back the merchandise back on the shelves and organizing the section I'm assigned to that day. I learned how to make signs, set planograms, handle difficult situations, and how to become a trainer for new team members. Management is often open and willing to hear your questions and concerns. My co-workers are very nice and make the workplace a fun place. The hardest part about my job is the amount of workload and over expectations management wants. However, the most enjoyable part of my job is meeting new people everyday and being able to help them and leave them smiling and happy."
good,it's an ok place to work if you wanted to get treated badly...It was a great place to work in the beginning. The people that you work with are great but the people that come in and shop and the bosses are rude and not understanding. 
good,Team player and result oriented. Fun and friendly and accountable for my actions.
good,"There were no hard parts with this line of work. "
good,"I was hired on as a seasonal worker and despite having been promised a full time position it never went through. Pay was decent but did not attribute for the amount of work I was putting in. The culture of Target is wonderful and one of my favorite things about working there. The fact that we were all team members and we worked as a team helped further that. The management was both good and bad. The good were the managers who were out on the floor pushing guest service, the bad are the managers pushing their own agendas for their departments to help them look better."
good,Okay place to work if you like working nights. good place for a night person
good,the management is strict but fun. There are a lot of big personalities and everyone is working hard to keep the store brand.
good,"A typical day a work includes projects, customer service, and keeping the shelves full of merchandise. I learned to work with other team members and what goes into daily decision in an everyday organization. Management is a role that requires some attention and strategy. There must be a routine planned for different situations that occur during a normal day. Employees are different and managers must plan to accommodate their working conditions and keep a positve environment that workers want to be a associated with. The hardest part of the job are the peak business hours and having no support to help customers in a timely fashion. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting recognized for hard work and a sense of know that I put out my best effort."
good,Average job if you prefer staying up working all night rather than working the average 9-5.
good,No chance to move up with out a college education. Great team work.
good,It's an OK company to work for if you need a part time job.
good,You will learn merchandising. You will have an opportunity for holiday overtime.
good,"This was my first job that I had, and I would say it is a good place to start. It didn't pay that much, just above minimum wage, but as a teenager that didn't matter. It gave me experience which I have built upon."
good,It was easy to catch on the work. Worked as a cashier and also help get the carts from the parking lot.
good,This was my first job experience in the Human Resources industry. It was a great opportunity however at times I did feel very overwhelmed as I didn't feel like I had the support of the other managers at my store.
good,"Very hard work, long hours. Schedule varies based on business need."
good,I had an okay experience at target.
good,"A typical day at work- I greet guest when they are ready to check out. I make myself always easy to be found for guest that have questions. Some days I do cash office, where I balance the money from the registeries from the pervious day. I make sure that the checklanes are Target Brand. I makes sure that each guest is aware of the Target Card(s). I make sure that the Cashiers know the benefits of the Target Card. I start the photo lab up, and produce orders. At the end of the day I close the registeries, and place the money where they belong."
good,I liked helping the customers and working with people. It was nice working on displays for the products in the store
good,Target pays well. Lots of locations in which to work. Team members are great people.
good,"The Target in Forestville is a very,laborious job. It has its good moments but its mostly a job where you are given large tasks to do with minimal staff. There's always at least two extra jobs you have to do on top of your own. The pay is minimal and does NOT fit the amount of work you have to complete.But there's cereal in the break room..."
good,• Solved over $1M in inventory issues
good,it was nice similar to my job at walmart. Everyone was nice I worked hard and got everything done
good,"The work environment was enjoyable. Unfortunately the mobile kiosk management is very poor, irresponsible and dishonest."
good,manage a team of 100 staff to open and run a store.
good,"Very demanding job. A driving sales company, very strict on numbers. The people I work with namely my manager and the other guy who has been there the longest really know their stuff and I have learned more about electronics in 2 months than I did in about 5 years prior to this! My co-workers are a diverse group - we all come from different backgrounds and each have our strong and weak points. I love working with all of them for the most part, My manager is an excellent one in my opinion. I understand exactly where he's coming from most of the time and he's not scared to let you know how he really feels about things around the store or about upper management. If something needs to be done as far as sales go, he'll be sure to let you know exactly where you should be and he'll even help you to get there with his insight. I did not like the fact they would not work around my school schdule."
good,I used to get around 20-30hours a week. somedays used to be really good and some really boring
good,A regular day at work is us gettin the truck unloaded and restocking the shelvs.
good,unload truckes.
good,"Come early to work, start at 6:00 AM. Do exercise 5m. Go to trailer and start loading. you have 6 to 7 trailers. you do this all day."
good,Work start at 9:55 and then you go to the backroom to push the line. Throughout the whole night your busy and doing work. You are either working with clothes or food. I learned that working overnight is a lot but it takes a team to get it all done. Management is very good and helpful they are apart of the team effort also. My co-workers are what makes the team and also who helps get through the night. The hardest part of the job is working overnight. The most enjoyable is everybody working as team.
good,Working overnight at target was okay and unimpressive. Some of your co-workers were there to outwork everyone else and others just wanted to stay below the radar. The benefits were okay but there was hardly any room for advancement. So seldom was the experience of learning anything other than repetitive actions. The hardest part of the job was the disappointment that no matter how hard you work you will not get any further than your current position unless you are willing to settle for minimal compensation for a few years.
good,the management was not the best but i went to work with a smile.
good,"typical day consisted off preforming what I was told to do, such as stocking, assisting guest, keeping parking lot clean"
good,Worked closely with managers and other team leaders to keep front end running smoothly.
good,The soft team was the best place to work. The ladies there worked really hard.
good,A typical day for me at work is doing my job very good givin customers what they want and doing wat management says. sometims it can get roudy but i look past that and just keep worken hard i love worken i always have.
good,"Assisted in the filing of claims, informed customers of the arrival of their funds, issued checks with proper identification from the customers."
good,"direct cars to proper lane, greet customers and sell the 3 different car washes"
good,"great time working there, fast paced,co workers were friendly"
good,"Decent company to work for, would recommend to others. Management was a bit shaky"
good,"Very first job, worked with a lot of fun people, even the managers and owner were friendly and very easy to talk to. Worked drive thru could get very busy at times"
good,"A good first job, but a lot of hard work. Nice employees, fun to get shifted to different areas of store to get different experience."
good,The company work day vary according to the company need.(from monday to sundy)
good,overnight stocker. unloaded the truck and stock the shelves.
good,"A typical day at work for me is working behind the service desk and being responsible for many tasks. I take returns from guests which requires strong people skills, especially with difficult situations. I am responsible for ensuring that the bathrooms are clean and well maintained. I am also responsible for helping out other team members in need. There are multiple responsibilities when working guest service that the team member is required to complete each shift. The hardest part of the job is staying on top of each responsibility, especially when it gets busy. The most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with the guests, and giving them a good experience when having to deal with returns."
good,"hard work, long hours, pressure to do well, challenging, busy. Positive atmosphere and extremely team-oriented. Sometimes it was a struggle to get different teams to work together (staff on the floor to come to the check-out lanes), but overall everyone was helpful."
good,Very busy place and if you like to be to yourself then overnight is the place for you but very fast paced
good,Its a fast pace envirionment. Everyone works as a team at all times.
good,My first time interacting with customers because I had to made me a little nervous but after a while it all came so natural. People loved my personality and I enjoyed what I was doing. Changed different departments all the time because they would need to fill in at times and I always adapted so quickly.
good,"busy days of work which is good, flexible hours, management wasnt so fair,"
good,"My Target location is usually busy so I always have something to do. There really are not any chances for sales floor team members to advance in our store. A typical day would be a four hour shift, sorting and folding clothes and taking calls from guests. The best part about Target are the relationships I've made with my coworkers. The hardest part would be the lack of hours."
good,"Spent two years in under the manager of a food service area in target, because the hardest working employee with the most expertise in the area. Was passed over for advancement in favor of someone with a 4 year degree but no relevant experience."
good,Good Work/ Life Balance. good work environment. Great Company to work
good,Gave me great supervisor experience good people to work with and very fast paced work enviorment and clean as well
good,"You are expected to upsale warranties and additional products to every customer, so some sales experience is good to have."
good,This is a good first job as far as advancement its a little slow. The enviroment is good and managment is always there to help out with anything.
good,our in stock team walks around daily looking for empty shelves to scan and eventually fill them up for the guest to have a variety to select from
good,"Was my first job, I don't remember much but all memories are good ones. Very helpful workplace."
good,"i was nervous about working there at first,untill i got to know the job , and what i was two do, because sometimes my job would chang up, they would have me doing some thing diflerent at first, untill i finsh that, then they would have me go back to my general work."
good,"The people made it a fun place to work. A typical day would include a check of all areas of the facility for problems, creation of work orders to deal with major problem, management of vendors in to do repairs. Also responsible for PM maintenance on all equipment. Has to be a self starter since Facilities upper management only visited on an as needed basis."
good,"The co-workers were nice, but some management were mostly concerned with getting high output from employees with little reward/incentive."
good,"Good customer service, great team work, and the work never gets old."
good,I would start work. Check email. Evaluate the assignment for the day and other tasks that needed to be accomplished during my eight hour shift. Learned how to communicate better as well as strategize about new solutions. The hardest part of my job is having the resources to successfully complete it. The most enjoyable part is working with my peers that don't mind the physical aspect of getting the job done.
good,clock in go to a huddle clean shelves and zone merchandise. learned to backstock print price tags and pogs. store had great management when opened. Co-workers like to gossip and slack very few were hard workers. Hardest part was picking up extra heavy tvs and running electronics alone on busy days. Loved to help my guest in everything they wanted and needed and having them give me good feed back.
good,"I loved working at Target. I started as just a seasonal worker and then was hired on for part-time. However, the schedules were never consistant and they would try to schedule employees out of their availablity times. I would have one week with 15 hours the next week would have 35, the week after that could have 20. Being a mother, I couldn't keep switching my schedule up and not know exactly how much every pay check would be. I loved getting to work with the people I worked with and being able to cross-train. Planogram Team with the most fun, I think I liked it more because it could be a little challenging at times."
good,typical retail job
good,"A typical day of work would start off with cleaning the restrooms right when i got there, a spill or two a day to clean up, retrieving carts quickly and efficiently, helping guests out to their cars, and cashiering for back up. I learned how to deal with many different types of people, how to run a cash register, provide great customer service, that work comes before fun, and to have a smile on my face with anything i do. There were different managers for different days and one was very power hungry and another was judgemental but most managers worked well with all different employees. I never had a problem with any of my co-workers, but there was a lot of gossip around the store and rumours about everyone. Most of the job did not have really any hard or difficult tasks or duties, but listening to the drama of the store was never fun. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people, providing guests with the service they desired and seeing them happy as they left the store."
good,"Being a Team Lead at Target can be exciting, fun, and somewhat rewarding if you have the right management above you. You will have to move at break neck speed to be successful, but even then you will generally feel like you have minimal impact on the bottom line. I learned quite a bit from a technical standpoint, i.e. scheduling, hiring/reporting practices, assets protection, etc."
good,fun to being with but the managers think they are better than employees and show that and the dont think the cashiers are important at all
good,Things changed with attitudes. I liked when I first started working but latly work enviroment became very stressful.
good,a typical day at work loads of items coming in to be stocked working non stop with barely any breaks. I've learned that no work isn't easy but long as you stay focused and remain positive with a steady pace of work you will have an good outcome. The management their is great. My co-workers were nice and friendly even when they didn't want to be there they always manage to keep a smile on. The hardest part of my job is working by yourself when you have a lot of pallets to be done at a certain time. The most enjoyable part about target is working with people who enjoy doing the same thing you like to do
good,"At first, bosses there were great and work with you. now, they just tend not to be flexible with hours or barely give you any."
good,"Working at target was a great job like everyone was like your friend, the management was wonderful everyone knew what they had to do , there was always something to do you were always busy but we still managed to work as a team and get things done. But the hardest part of the job was having to stop working and go into a meeting at random because you would be so much into your work and be like oh great stop dead in your tracks cause its a meeting but it wasnt all that bad really. The best part was no drama even one was very friendly and it was easy to get along with the co-workres even the leadres and bosses too."
good,"I felt safe in and on the side of the building because it it located in a safe area. The parking lot is well lit and there are cameras watching the parking lot. Inside the store the atmosphere was positive, most of the team members were helpful and the store was clean and neat. This job require you to stand for your whole shift. There is some heavy lifting, climbing ladders and pushing flats, tubs and carts when need. Also you must help with carry outs and loading. This job requires open availability to work weekends and nights. Also the availability to come in when there is a call out."
good,A typical day is translating spanish to english and fast paced work.
good,"as an emploey we get a few benfits such as discounts on food,clothing and other store items."
good,"A typical day on the work, talked with the supervisor, see what is the plan for the day ,maybe merchandise or work on the floor putting on place what was left the day before."
good,"Low wages, low raises, no improvement within company and 10 managers all with their own ideas on how to get things done. No continuity."
good,"Worked as a cashier so I got to meet alot of people, communicated with alot of people which helped me with my communication problem i used to have. nothing really hard about the job pretty easy job for the most part."
good,i had a good time working here. The environment takes some time getting use to. Its fast paced at times and you spend lots of time on your feet.
good,"It was a fun place to work. Enjoyed talking to the guest, helping fit them into a cell phone that would suit their needs"
good,I learned patience and order. My first time in a retail settings such as working on cashier i learned pretty fast with next to no help. My surroundings was pleasant. I enjoyed the holiday season it challenged me with being fast and accurate.
good,"Target has a fast, fun, and friendly culture with high values and standards. However, for salaried managers the work/life balance is not the best especially when you are having to work nights/weekends and 50 plus hours a week. Nonetheless, building relationships with team members and vendors is very exciting; and also developing the team members is always fun!"
good,"Did returns and exchanges and refunds. I learned alot about customers, employees and management. Mangement was ok and I meet alot of coworkers their that I am still in contact with. The hardest part was dealing with the many times they chaned management and the most enjoyable part was the customers that I came to know"
good,This job was very helpful during my ttransitioning days. There are times you have to work alot and then there are time you dont have to work at all. Meeting alot of new people for me was a great experience.
good,"Its a pretty energetic environment. Pretty busy during the season, which is a good thing. Overall a good place to work."
good,It is not a bad company just a bad economy which it had to deal with.
good,"Typical day includes standing at the register, able to talk to different people with different cultures, values, etc. Co-workers are some of the nicest people super friendly,"
good,"Target is a good fit for me because i stay very busy. I am able to handle every issue that any customer may confront me about and strive to satisfy the customer. I am a front end supervisor over guest services, cashiers, cart attendents, and the stores cafe. I also count all of the stores revenue and order more funds. Overall i enjoy work most days, but i have more financial responsibility to endure outside of work."
good,"Depending on the truck size, start working at 4:00 am or 2:00 am to start unloading and stocking and backstocking. Management for the unload team could be better."
good,Typical retail job. A great place to get into and work your way into supervisory positions.
good,Upper management offers little support. Team work among peers is of the highest level. Good team culture but team members are treated very unfairly in regards to pay and expectations.
good,When you get to work there are always people there that have a smile on their face and are ready to greet you even early in the morning. I make coffee for them and interact with them all day and keep my work space clean. I learned that not eveyone is the going to have a good attitude you just need to have a good attitude to them and maybe you can make their day. Management wasn't the greatest with Target. They would move you around to places you have never been and make you learn the things that you wanted. Sometimes they would even schedule you days that you can't work and that you put in for time off and it was your problem to try and find someone. i loved my co-workers we all worked together as a team and got what we needed done. They were really nice. The hardest part was the busy days. You had to have everything done at a certain time and have all the coffee made for the people that were waiting. The most enjoyable part was getting to know the people that come in all the time or the regulars and knowing their coffee before they walk in the door.
good,"Promoted from Cashier to Guest Services Attendant within 1 month. Provided guest service expertise by responding promptly to guest and team members, offering appropriate options to assist each guest situation, and availability to welcome and train new team members."
good,"pretty routine, not hard to get the hang of, management is fine, co-workers are fun, hardest part of the day is starting off, most enjoyable is the general keeping of the flow"
good,"I worked as a cashier, guest service representative, and as a cook in the Target Cafe."
good,responsible for keeping the store in constant operation by replenishing the goods on a daily or weekly basis.
good,"A typical day at work is trying to finish a very large workload in nowhere near enough time. The job does teach interpersonal skills and how to interact with a diverse customer base. You can learn more about new technology if you work in electronics, as I do. My co-workers are great, but the management can become overbearing as they are expected to get results no matter what the cost. The hardest part of the job is trying to survive off of the pitiful wages, and the most enjoyable part of the job is the people you get to meet."
good,A typical day at work could vary from day to day. Being retail it could be very busy one minute and then very slow the next. The job of being a cashier wasn't very challenging. Majority of my co-workers were amazingly nice. But didn't really talk to many of them. The hours were terrible which made me decide to not stay with Target.
good,Management is extremely lenient and cared for their employees.
good,"I loved working where I can help people everyday, meet and greet new people was a plus given I am a peoples person and I loved the challenges that come with retail"
good,"Not the ideal place to work, but depending on the employees they'll make it a welcoming, and friendly environment."
good,A day at Target was really fun. I enjoyed everyone that i worked with and i also got to work with customers face to face. Ive learned that a smile can change a persons entire mood.
good,unload trucks and stocking the shelves was awesome and the pay and totally loved my hours
good,"You get to help out guests who need to know about an item before then buy it. Some technical things to do like setting up planograms, but mainly it's good, old-fashioned selling."
good,I it is a place were u can enjoy your holiday shopping for friends family and more. The hardest days of work are normally on the holidays or the weekends due to multiple customers and duties from management. My co-workers were great and easy to work with.
good,Assiansting people with purchasing and returning items such as clothing and toys and tvs. most enjoyable part of the day was seeing the customers walk out with a simile
good,good work place to work never any trouble with the job. good co workers
good,Great leadership team with focused vision and transparent in letting TMs know of any great initiatives.
good,While employed with Target Greatland I learned how it was important to work as a team member. I was also able to meet different people and enjoyed getting to know about there cultures.
good,great company to work for. help customers. co workers are team players.
good,Kind of a bad experience working here . Hard work but bad hours and I did not feel fully compensated for my work.
good,A typical day at work would be unloading the truck and stocking the shelves from 4am-8am.
good,Very busy store meaning it was a stressful job. Have learned a lot in the guest service area.
good,"Had the overnight schedule and it suit me perfectly, good manager and co workers."
good,"it was ok, not enough opportunities for advancement.Average retail job."
good,Target is a good place to work you can move up the ranks fast if you apply yourself. As a whole I would give target 3.5 out of 5 stars as with all jobs there will be things you dont't completely like about the job but for the most part you will love it.
good,"Monitor, maintain stock, cleanliness, and organization of zone assignments; assist customers with product information and direction; end of shift duties, including restocking all reusable goods."
good,Not very flexible with hours. Good staff but management is very pushy.
good,clock in and go straight to work. I learned how to use PDA its a hand held scanner. Management lacked communication skills with team members. my co-workers were always fun to work with and i had no confrontation problems. i don't feel there was any hard jobs I enjoyed my job. The most enjoyable part was completing my tasks in a neat and timely manner.
good,a typical day in khaki and red.
good,I liked working for this company everyone was very nice. The communication among management is not so good. There was no room for advancement or talk of being able to advance.
good,I would check people out and be a cashier. I learned how to deal with customers. Management was good. My co-workers were easy going although I didn't get to know them that well. The hardest part of the job was nothing really just when the line backed up and I'd have to hurry through the customers and give great customer service.
good,"Cashier, price checking, stocking, restocking, go backs, answering phones, fitting room attendant, hanging, folding, and repackaging clothes, guest services including returns and exchanges."
good,It was a good place to work the people was nice. We had good team work. It also was a steady paycheck.
good,"Target is a fantastic learning opportunity for young people who haven't had a first ""real job."" Learning is possible but can be difficult or feel like an uphill battle at times simply because of the fact that you have to search for the learning opportunities; but Target has made great strides to improve so of these issues. Day-to-day work varies but can include a wide variety of tasks. As a Target Team Leader this can include providing direction for hourly team members, using inventory management software to main stock of merchandise, or ""branding"" to provide a company centric standard of how a department should look. Time management is key here simply because of the fact that payroll can be tight depending on store volume and sales floor coverage. If you cannot buckle down and focus on day-to-day tasks then you will not do well. Management varies widely by store and all depends on the direction of the store's manager. Executive management can have a tendency to push off additional work onto hourly team members which can add to the day-to-day workload. Reputation of hourly hiring in the past has been slightly lackluster but Target has made strides in its hiring process of hourly team members to find and develop people who want to work and want to advance within the company. The hardest part of this job can be managing daily work and planning. It can be hard to delegate the amount of work because of Target's do more with less initiative which has limited the amount of sales floor employees in the past several years. The most enjoyable part of this job can be the fact that you"
good,"providing hair cuts and colours for clients waxing as well. Regis provides all classes for haircutting, colours, and waxing."
good,On a typical day at Target I am usually setting tables and adjancies in soft lines. Working at the operator station answering guest calls for the whole store. When not doing that I am zoning and straighting shoes and tables. I have learned to be flexable in any area of the store that i work. My co-workers are very valuable to me because we work as a team to accomplish our goals for the week. The hardest part of the job is sometimes getting everybody on the same page of what needs to be done first. Not with my team members but with store management sometimes they see things different. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with the public. Most of the people that you get to meet are the nicest and the most enjoyable people to be around.
good,Enjoyed meeting several different people on a daily basis.
good,Was my first job. Provided me with the means to acquire an automobile to apply for and access other job opportunities.
good,Unload trucks then stock store with friendly co workers we are all like family
good,"Its a nice place to work if you like interacting with people. Nice people to work with,"
good,A district of 10 stores but had wonderful team to work with; lots of travel that spanned up to 250 miles/day;
good,My brief tenure at Target was somewhat enjoyable. The management staff was about business most of the time and the coworkers seemed withdrawn and was basically there to get a paycheck. The hardest part o the job was waking at 3am to unload the truck and process stock before the store opened. A typical day at what work is me unloading the truck and processing the stock in shopping buggies and pushing them to the different locations to be processed. After processing the stock and putting overstock in the back room to be stored we would leave or stay and provide customer service to customers.
good,This was my first job so I was expecting a little more than to be standing in one spot behind the cash register. The involvement with guests was enjoyable but once I started waitressing I learned how passionate I am for customer service.
good,nice place to work when u are going to school and a look place to meet new people
good,I typical work day for me is folding clothes and picking up/fixing merchandise on the floor. Running up for additional cashier help and helping guest with their every need. Management will come to the sales floor to help but only if its very busy. The most thing I like about my job is being able to go that extra mile for a guest.
good,had a great time working their everyone was awsome
good,Unload trucks put materials on pallet go stock store. Long quite nights stock dog food
good,Very repetitive job. Didn't pay as well as I needed because lack of hours. Went from 40 hours to 25....
good,"A typical day at work for me is opening the kiosk, reading emails, taking inventory, and begin engaging with customers."
good,"It's a pretty simple job, you may from time to time push stuff out to the dollar spot. Your job is to help people out or at least try. You never call the people who shop there ""customers"", they are called ""guest""."
good,"A great company to be employed by. The management, staff and store is great. Customers are nice and well taken care of."
good,Target is a very large corporation and have a lot of benefits for there employees. The management staff changed often along with the hourly employees. The atmosphere was harsh and difficult to work in at times.
good,"Target was a good place to work, but it seems they don't care"
good,"Fast, Fun, and Friendly is Target's motto. This is something that Target can embody."
good,"they were ok, they tried, they usually fell short, there was alot of turnover"
good,"Target has allowed me to become one of their top performers by offering me the training of several departments such as: Cashier,Photo, Cash office/Safe Room, Price Accuracy, Store Operator, Clearical, Starbucks, Cashier and Photo Supervisor, Sales Floor and Back room team member. Target give friendly events several times a month from games to catered lunches. I am given an average of 25 hours per week but I am offered up to 40 by working in other departments"
good,I thought that it was fun to work for target and they would always have some sort of employee apreciation event happening
good,Target is a company focused on team and culture. I worked with some amazing leaders and people. The hardest part of the job was being able to run your business versus just executing a plan. The most enjoyable part of my job was the fact that each day was always different.
good,"Help guess thoughtout the store, have an assign department clean and organized. Help with cashier when needed and help with spill on the store when needed."
good,your typical cashier job. provided a good salary for a starting position and decent hours.
good,"Not so nice working enviroment, but nice customers and a few nice employees"
good,"A typical day in the world changing Target environment would be constant lines and customers (smile). I learned how to work with a team and to be a encouraging leader from a wonderful management team, I also learned how to catogorize shoes to baby food. There was always something to learn. I learned how to markdown, customer service and merchandising/signage. My co-workers I visit them quite often and say hello. The hardest part was knowing what to spend my check on (toothpaste or shoes). The most enjoyable part was experiencing Target."
good,Went to work and looked at my list of duties for each night. I checked off the duties as they were completed and then checked out with the supervisor at the end of the shift.
good,"I assisted guests, stocked and organized merchandise, handled guest transactions, and maintained a fast, fun, and friendly workplace."
good,A typical day at Target started with the review of applications and solving the problems of the business with the staff incoming and outgoing and finding the Right person for the Job.
good,Learned the inner workings of a large department store.
good,"A typical day at work would include making sure the sales floor is clean and organized, restocking items from the inventory, and communicating with customers from time to time"
good,A typical day is unloading a 1500 piece trailer. I learned many skills to get the job done in a fast manner.
good,this job was ok to work for a while. Then it starts getting a little tedious. However in the location that i worked at has people that heve been happily working there for 15 years.
good,They will easily work with school schedules. A great starter job.
good,Was a voluntary project. Worked with a team to develop a branding strategy for a small business. Created ideas on how to effectively market high end fashion to a new location. Learned how to incorporate community functions and culture into market plan. Management was enthusiastic and very receptive to ideas and change. Team members were also enthusiastic and supportive. The hardest part of the job was that it was short term and unpaid. The best part of the job was that we effectively helped a small business gain market share and profit.
good,"I did not enjoy the work schedule, not very practical for a women and/or someone with a family. Didn't feel there was much room for growth."
good,Working in retail is basicly for people who do not have bad feet or do not mind standing all day.
good,Target would rather recruit from college graduates then to promote within. I have a degree and they won't promote me.
good,GOOD COMPANY TO WORK FOR.Everybody works as a team.Low pay but good benefits
good,A great company if your a student and/or looking for FT work.
good,"My days were usually jam packed of things to do. I was never just sitting around doing nothing. A normal day consisted of decorating cake back-ups, filling the cake cases and tables, taking cake orders, helping out other team members and cleaning my area. Management could have been a little bit more understanding that cakes just don't decorate themselves and that some cakes take more time than others. My co-workers were actually very fun to work with and we all got along for the most part."
good,"Great company, lots of corporate politics. It was not a very good place to work if you wanted a work/life balance."
good,"a good company for teens,a good first job but not something i could fall back on..benefits were terrible and hourly salary was as well."
good,"My day starts at 4am right away I start ripping down aisles to be reset. This usually lasts the entire day unless we have a light work load then I do other tasks in the meantime. I learned how this store operates during the day, I started off working overnights then I was kept and now I work partially into the open day hours. There is a lot of management with different titles, so thats always confusing, but people are helpful when needed. The hardest part of the job is getting up at 2:30 in the morning. I have been doing it for a while now and it still gets to me. I enjoy doing the planograms and merchandising."
good,"Fast paced, productive and fun,fun,fun. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the interaction with the consumers."
good,"Usually, I come to work and help carry boxes of merchandise to their correct shelf location in a specific section of the store. Then, I spend the rest of the time helping to stock the store in different areas. Management is good and I really enjoy my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is lifting the boxes. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to think while I perform my duties, and also interacting with my co-workers. Plus, it helps me keep in shape."
good,Large chain retailer with a new grocery section to help one stop shopping.
good,not much to say only worked seasonally. liked it for the short time i was employed
good,"When I was there, I was taught how to take different coupons in one transaction."
good,Great management and great team members the work was easy to complete in the time frame given
good,"I worked here as a teenager and i must say I enjoyed it. I had the chance to meet new people whom I'm still friends with till this day. Although it's a fun and friendly place to work, the pay is not good for someone with a family."
good,Good company for students who need to go back and forth to attend college.
good,"High turnover. Lack of visibility on a corporate level. Working in retail, you are expected to work hard, but none of the work is THAT hard, overall. I was only there for around six months and I would meet new coworkers every week I was there. Never tried to advance as the compensation is rather weak."
good,"A typical day at work, i would clock in, meet up with the team and my management would tell me what to do. I learn alot about freight, and how to build and take down a asle. Management was ok, not to good, not to bad. Some co-workers were fine and some were very slow. The hardest part of the job was when we had to tear down a asle and read the planogram and rebuild it back up. The most enjoyable part of this job was the conversation held between the team and the times we joke around with management."
good,"Learned how to cashier, I enjoyed all parts of this job. Managent was good, co-workers were fun, do not know the hardest part of the job, everything was enjoyable."
good,Most of the time at this position I was left alone to do my job. However; if you become injured and get bronchitis at the same time don't expect the staff to be reasonable about it. Overall experience at this job was do my job get paid wait to get fired. Cut-throat even at low level positions.
good,a typical day at work what you learned management your co-workers the hardest part of the job the most enjoyable part of the job
good,unloading and restocking the store working pretty hard to finish in a timely fashion but worth it.Learned alot of skills and made a difference in my job and towards my company
good,The job I was hired for wasn;t full time hours so I had to do two different jobs to get full time hours.
good,"Unloading daily truck, sort merdchantdise, place merchantdise on the selfs"
good,In the begining it was a good place to work. Then it became a place that always is wanting better numbers and people that have degrees.
good,"Cart Attendant are at the bottom of the food chain here. But then again isn't it like that at any job with carts. This position has you not only doing carts...but ALL of the on floor and parking lot grunt work. Even when the custodian isn't their...it's your job to clean up ""harmless"" spills and the restrooms. It's honestly not worth the pay and is degrading to anyone that isn't in High School honestly."
good,"Requires a hight amount of physical labor every day. High standards placed on how quick the work needs to be finished. Some help from management, but not a high amount. Not ver mentally challenging"
good,"A typical day would be me greeting guest and cash handling. I'm usually multitasking with helping out up at guest service, assisting other cashiers if they need help or have question. I cover breaks for the team lead (not the supervisor classified to handle escalated issues), guest service, and food ave. I've worked in all areas of the store from working on pulls with items coming into the store to sales floor which your assisting guest while they shop. The hardest part would be dealing with changes the whenever we get new management every 18 months and the personality, but you adjust and prevail. I enjoy working with my co-workers."
good,Assist customers to the correct location in the store when searching for a product.
good,"Its a fast fun friendly place to work, however your job position and chances for advancement are not secure. Compensation is less than par but the benefits can be reasonable."
good,Stocking and Helping people find what they where looking for..
good,it was a stressful job. Alot of people would call in an that would make it harder for me to do my area an try to do another one.target is a busy store daily.i would be running around everywhere to help a customer or just to help a team member.sometimes i would have to do more than two areas
good,Target was my first job. While working there i learned how to manage long hours being on my feet and still being able provide good customer service.
good,well get to work a little early to check in to see if there would be something new i could learn and to give ideas of different ways to make the store look nicer to catch the customers atten. and i work well with my co workers and there really wasnt nothing that was to hard to and what i enjoyed about my job meeting people and being able to help the customers and seeing them leave with a smile knowing i was able to help them .
good,"Really great benefits, good people. Short on payroll, upper management gives little directions, yet will watch over shoulder and over analize as you work."
good,Target can be a fun place to work but be prepared for a lot of corporate politics.
good,Normal work day started at 6:00 am and ended at 2:30 pm. I was highloy experienced because of my logistics background. All of management at the store that I worked at was much younger than me. My co-workers were also younger than me. I learned that tmere is no longer loyalty for workers and that most large retail companys are only worried about porfit.
good,"I was a seasonal employee, expected to greet every customer that walked in our door, spend time keeping up store presentation, and bring product from backroom to store floor, occasionally working only in the backroom. During my time there the store was changed from Calvin Klein to Calvin Klein Men's store, and the last few weeks of my job included moving product to the new CK women's store across the way."
good,The hardest working job I ever worked at .Lots of work for a person looking to be slaved . Making close to minimum wages.Really if not management or collage student or in last year of high school dont do it..
good,Working there was a good experience however management and how they operated the store was bad. I wont get into detail however we all know how managers can get. the customers and co-workers were amazing. My hardest part was really trying to deal with the managers and the enjoyable part was just being ale to work without out no problems. I learned a lot there thanks to the co-workers.
good,- A typical day would consist of building or tearing down end caps with product.
good,Fun and friendly workplace. Good mix of team and alone work.
good,I did not like that how management did not make you feel like part of the team. I also did not like having to get customers to sign up for the Target credit card. I liked dealing with the customers and I liked my co workers.
good,"Great company to work for, peronally no contact with customer dealing with my position and hours."
good,"A very interesting position with tough, daily challenges. The hours can be long and the stress to produce results can be very high. In this position you are in charge for keeping shortage (lost $$ from merchandise) at a low. You are in charge of reducing and catching theft and the security of the building. While doing this you often work LOD (leader on duty) shifts that take away time from your core roles."
good,"Crazy busy! You have to be fast paced, energetic and have a caring personality. This job gets very hectic so if you have a short fuse this is NOT the job for you. Management needs A LOT of work!"
good,Was pretty good not the worse and definently not the best Started at 4 a.m until 9 a.m or later some of the supervisors are great just have to be on top of everything because your job is never safe the co-workers are wonderful most of them anyway job really was a piece of cake they just expect too much at times
good,"i loved the job but the enviorment from some manners just made it hard to enjoy your job, i loved having an assighnment where i coyuld work on my own, but the management tried to find reasons to get rid of ppl, made the associates just feel used."
good,"Typical day counting money, bagging items ,ringing up items"
good,A nice place to work but I lack advancement for managment.
good,I was on my mom's insurance till getting the job at Target. After working here for 12 years my progress went down. Now I am getting 16 hours a week. You need at least 20 to get health insurance.
good,"I was a trainer in the development of new employees on how to process cash transactions such as checks, wires and money movers. I was the leader on the reconciling various clients balances and cash recs."
good,"Busy environment, challenging team to lead, growing culture"
good,Working at Target can challenge anyones ability to work hard as it.did mine. I started off as a kid straight out of highschool and this place whipped me into shape and taught me teamwork and how to work hard. And they gave me the opportunity to learn new fields in clerical to help me move on past the work part and into the mental and business aspect of a company.
good,"My day consisted of walking the salesfloor, correcting issues like building new endcaps, setting pog, remerchandising product, customer service, cashiering, conducting interviews on potential candidates. I had fantastic co-workers and a great team. My management career taught me how to be patient, listen to to thers concerns, organizational skills, and to have a objective opinion. The hardest part of the job was the staffing, we had alot of seasonal hires. It was challenging keeping all of the shifts full and running but I did it. The most enjoyable part is all of the people you meet and the never ending supply of knowledge and learning you experience."
good,"Guest service was number one priority at all times, while also maintaining store presentation. I had a reasonable level of job autonomy and enjoyed most of my co-workers. Management was productive and hard working, however they tended to not treat workers as individuals. I learned how to manage departments, take on and complete multiple daily and long term tasks, the importance of logistics and guest services. The hardest part of my job pressure from multiple sources of management on how to prioritize my task lists. The most enjoyable part was getting rewarded for my hard work and helping our guests."
good,"My co- workers are very helpful, the most enjoyable part of my job is making a customer smile and feel confident"
good,"This company benefits from a part time work force. Advancement opportunities are small without a degree. The management fails to take an interest in employees due to the fact that they are only part time or seasonal. The atmosphere is fun and friendly. The skills you aquire are very basic, but important to any job involving customer service."
good,On regular days they're mostly understaffed with a average - heavy workload. Your duties are consistent and straightforward and so are your hours (for the most part). I've learned a lot of different positions in a short amount of time which is good because it makes you a more universal employee. The management is extremely young and is just as immature as the employees. They are mostly under the age of 35 including the GM and don't have good strategy skills to get through situations as most managers in retail do. The hardest part of the job is taking on an extremely heavy amount of work in a short period of time due to lack of co-workers (whether by call-offs or lack of new hires). The most enjoyable part of the job is the store events that are planned each month for co-workers.
good,"I love working here. The people are nice, but there are not enough hours to keep people."
good,Challenging workload. extreme in phone quality. good work environment
good,I would go to work and get the food court ready for the day start cooking pizzas for people to eat. I would bake cookies make coffee and hot dogs. The management was good and they handled everything with efficiency.
good,learned how to answer phones and deal with customers polite as possible while doin over and beyond what my job requires me to do
good,"The management training/internship program is a valuable program. However, there is no work life balance what so ever even though they preach it. 10 hours a day standard and no time off is allowed from black Friday until the end of January."
good,I start work at 4am in the morning and we would unload the truck and push the products on to the floor after doing that we would open the packages up and start stocking the shelves.
good,I learned a lot at this job and met a lot of great people! The job and co- workers made it to were you want to come into work everyday! To bad it was only seasonal!
good,"This was a job I needed just to have steady income, but I wouldn't pursue it as a career."
good,"My day consisted of breaking down aisles including shelves,backing paper,label holders, etc. Then resetting the aisles so they match the planogram (aisle layout diagram). I enjoyed working closely with the management, they were very informative and made sure that everyone kept working as a team. I would say the hardest part of the job was going to work at 11:30 at night. I enjoyed meeting new people and gaining valuable experience."
good,I really cant say it taught me anything more then what I knew before I started but it made me realize that I do want to leave the retail field and work more in an office environment.
good,Standard season job during the holidays. Fast paced. Toy section could be annoying to deal with. Management never let me know if I was staying on after the holidays. I was simply left off the schedule and figured it out myself.
good,"A normal day at Target is first, working with great team members who go out the way not only for our store guest, but also their peers. And usually the day includes product pulling first and then back stocking until work is complete. The most enjoyable part of the job is the break room chats."
good,on a normal day I do alot of things at Target that expands my skills i learned how to have awsome customer servie I have learne how to assist people with there needs and I have also gave ideas to help better my team
good,I worked a lot on the sales floor organizing and stocking. I had great managers and coworkers
good,"it was an interesting place to work ,when i worked i had fun working"
good,Great place to work if you are interested in being promoted based on performance.
good,Target is a great place to work. You deal with people all the time and everyone is willing to help you when you need help.
good,Friendly environment. Advancement hard to obtain. Scheduling can be a upgrade. Rotating shift aren't always available. Basic task are given during a day at Target.
good,I work with stuffs related to boxes being stocked and pulls. The people are cool and nice. The hardest park of the job is trying to keep up with many things at once but i can do it. The most fun part at work is to social with people.
good,"I am expected to run around various departments as needed. But as I walk away from one (not being replaced), the responsibility of the previous follows me and I end up doing everything by myself with very little help from management. I understand it's a position based pay but raise increased should reflect my skill set acquired. My co-workers are mostly friendly but not very helpful to my particular job. My department does not interact with management at all in a typical work day, however, I value the responsibility of being left alone to make costumer service decisions as this gives me the chance to develop and grow."
good,great place to work and fun people to work with.great working conditions.
good,My department was the only department that did their own ordering. The crew that worked with me was a good crew.
good,I was under paid and over worked. i worked for a great staff though and learned customer service skills
good,"Managers and supervisors were nice. When working there it was just something you had to take one day at a time. Everything began to be doing the same thing over and over again, and that was the only thing that I didn't like. But as far as every thing else, it was good work experience."
good,* Typical day at work-unloading shipment truck and stocking floor shelves
good,Very predictable work enviornment! Great teamwork.
good,helping customers
good,I loved working in the deli and being part of a team. my fellow co workers were really helpful and we worked together well!
good,I was able to get experience in manr area of my life with this job in learning how to deal with people and interact with the public.
good,The things that i learned working at target was that working with customers having a great attitude. the management was good whenever you needed help they will help you in any way possible. and the hardest part of the job was keeping busy when the store wasnt busy.
good,"Part-time job, interacted with customers every minute of my work day. Enjoyed working with my co-workers."
good,unloading trucks and preparing the merchandise for the sales floor and maintain a quick but safe pace.
good,Very poor management. They expect a lot to get done without help from management. They will push all work off on their associates. I would not recommend anyone work here. Plus they have started cutting hours for everyone while still hiring more people.
good,the managers and coworkers were really nice. the hardest part of the job was making sure you take your breaks on time its been plenty of nights where they know you need a luch and get upset when you do not take it before 6 hours.
good,Repetitive work load
good,Great company to work for! Lots of room for advancement. Endless opportunities to explore different aspects of the retail industry However extremely defined culture can hinder progression of team members that don't fit the typical mold. Leadership needs to figure out how to embrace diversity in thought and actions
good, Verified that the safe was counted and balanced daily.
good,The place has a good environment with nice employees and customers. There is a lot of work involved which is good since it keeps you busy.
good,My review of the Target in Weatherford would be that they are too strict on deadlines and on employees.
good,"The perfect place to be while attending school full time, hours were somewhat flexible and the enviroment was very friendly. Great way to pick up on good customer service skill working hand in hand with people of all different characters and cultures."
good,"Target is pretty loose about their terms and appearance; Target tries to treat employees like family, however upper level management all seem to take part in favoritism."
good,• Unload trucks in a safe manner
good,This was a decent place to work. It could have use some improvements thought.
good,"When I worked there, they had one employee in each department at one time. Employees just had an unpleasant look upon their face. Tasks had to be done at an untimely manner, and in the most impossible ways. Managers need to understand that some tasks cannot be done they way they want, I think its because they are not the ones doing it so they don't understand. The environment seemed more business profiting instead of customer needs."
good,"Very Fast paste store, high volume that comes through this store on a daily bases, it is one of the top 60 target stores in the nation. Team member discounts are great, health insurance is so so."
good,Target is a decent company to work for. Room for advancement with a college degree.
good,good workplace to work in pepole are great and fun to work with discounts are alright.
good,fun diverse company to work for they are understanding and work with your needs to fit your schedule
good,"Unloading truck, and Stocking Day or Overnight Crew I was a great backroom worker...."
good,this was a very fun place to work i cant remember of all the things that used to happeneed there all teh costumers and all the c-workers .we use to get along very well.i defenectly will love to be able to find a place like wings over bristol to be able to work becuase it was a very good experience plus i love to be helpfull in all the aspects.
good,I injured my back while employed with them and when I recovered they cut my hours to almost nothing.
good,the hours and scheduling is all screwed up...i was hired as full time but a few weeks down the road was dropped to less than part time hours without reason.
good,A great person who love working very hard in everything I'm asign to at a job...Taking pride in my work environment.
good,My 1st job. I tulely liked this job andwish it was still open so i could work there.
good,"Its easy to get along with everyone. if there was no customers on the register, you can always attend customers throughout the store. and even go to the back in the store where they receive merchandise and bring it out to the front to stock up when they were low."
good,I liked working here however the management was very poor and not professional
good,The people were great for the most part but you are to be more successfull if you are female.
good,"Good place for learning sales, however limited growth opportunities and poor scheduling"
good,"Excellent benefits, few retailers offer vacation days, pension, and 401k. The work was different from day to day so it was always interesting. The only downfall was the political games by the managers. An employee could perform well, but if they were not in the inner circle they were constantly overlooked."
good,Target is a good company to worl for if you are just starting out in the company.
good,"Enjoyed working here, providing a good basis of skills, but unfortunatly did not pay well. Management was unsympathetic to balancing work/life and job advancement wasn't easy to come by. Being sick was looked upon poorly and company very small compensation."
good,I can not give an accurate view of this company now because it has been several years since I have worked for them. When I worked there it was ok.
good,STL lacks personal communication with lesser employees. Never comes to work when she is supposed to. Wages are horrible and so is the advancement opportuinites.
good,"Work hard for no compensation, unless you know people good luck making a name for yourself. You might get a thaNks but that’s it. Raises only yearly but most likely no more than 40 cents if you do above and beyond. And after 3 years of being full time they will easily cut you down to 12hrs or less if they aren’t making money"
good,Only thing I didn’t like was the scheduling and the time they would make us close and open but it can be a fun place to work in. Also the mangers were very cool.
good,"Need to improve daily goals, set pride to high for 12hr shift. The company need to for company policies at all times and be more understanding when members become ill or have family issues"
good,"Everyone always shops spends money. Job security, medical benefits not that great. Working holidays/ weekends. Great team experiences, work environment controlled temperatures."
good,Time goes fast because there is so much to do.  Like working at Target the employees are great.  But it is difficult to get full time hours all the time.
good,"I was only a seasonal employee but target was willing to work with me on my busy sport/ school schedule, and that was really awesome because most places aren't willing to work with you on that."
good,Taught me a lot of people skills and learning peoples needs. High stress environment during seasonal times like Black Friday and Christmas. Great first job for a college student.
good,The Hr kept changing and they don't do their job correctly and the leads were changing too. So many new hires and the conflict of schedule would be ridiculous. The lead would schedule you outside your availability or not schedule you. Don't do cashier if you want hours to apply to be on the floor.
good,Management was my only problem. They talk to you like a kid and expect you to be all smiles about it. They can get very disrespectful. They also pick favorites so when it’s time for hours to get cut only a few people hours will be cut.
good,I’ve learned to be a more social person and I got some good experience on the register the managers and workers were friendly and they treated me with respect
good,The workplace culture was a bit toxic. Management was fine but the some of the workers were a bit racist to other workers at times to the point to where it was extremely uncomfortable.
good,"Target is a good place to work but the management is lazy,Loud & don't care. We get a truck everyday and can't finish it because hours are cut and bad leadership"
good,Target is a great company to start out at for those who need work experience. Management at first is very helpful and makes you feel very welcome and as time goes on they will expect a lot out of you.
good,Decent place to work to get by. Managers are ok. Coworkers make the work and day seem better than what it really is. Benefits are average if you get enough hours to have them.
good,Target is a good job to start of with. They teach you how to do certain things and they always have good team work and outstanding attitudes towards work
good,"Management sucks but they’re some good leads that’ll look out for you. The company itself doesn’t pay you what you deserve. But the experience, schedule, co workers & the cute customers makes it an enjoyable place."
good,Nice to gain experience and learn from others. Great start for learning the shipping and receiving aspect. You also have the ability to work within the departments and gain basic understanding of the collaboration that is essential
good,Fun place to work and time goes by quick when it's busy. Team members are expected to pick up after others when staffing is low. Team work is stressed but rarely practiced. Hours are spread thin and are rarely given constantly for a full time position.
good,My overall experience wasn't that bad I was always being productive and that was good. Since Target is a big company they are a little unorganized due to the fact that they have an excessive amount of workers which may cause fewer hours and confusion with the work schedule. Other than that it is a great company and fair pay.
good,Target was one of those jobs I had in college. Its what you make of it. The people I worked with made the job fun. I was a cashier at this location and
good,"Not a bad place to work, they listen to your requests and availability, Offer volunteer opportunities, and gives good on the job training, which makes it a great place for students."
good,I was there for almost 3 years  I’ve done everything I could to move up and I was not given the opportunity. I loved the people I worked with but I did not like the the way the company executed their goals  .
good,"At target, it was a mix of very different feelings. I enjoyed it some days yet others I felt compelled to just leave. I enjoyed the area of work I did but no one was the wiser to appreciate how I did my job. As soon as I was eligible for benefits/leave time/time off(which was given based on hours worked per week), i had my hours slashed."
good,"Very repetitive and after a certain point, you know what to expect of your position. The monotony is not helped by the fact that, sometimes, it feels like management views you more as cattle to be moved and worked than a human being with emotions and responsibilities outside of work."
good,"The pay was fantastic and the experience was agreeable starting out. A typical day usually involved manning the register as a cashier, watching over self-checkout, and serving as a shift lead to organize team members when needed. Additional responsibilities as a shift lead/ CAP is that you will either need to come in early to open the front or stay at least 30 mins to an hour after closing to close registers and count money bags after the night. Dealing with customer complaints comes with every role listed, but mediation is essential in the shift lead/CAP position."
good,"It was a good learning and working experience and environment. At times there are good ups and downs. However, the time you spend working here is one to never forget. I learned much about myself personally. It’s an odd learning and working experience but a worthy endeavor nonetheless."
good,"I worked at haven ranch in boyton, it was really nice at first I loved meeting all the new people and learning niche stuff that’s useful and the managers were very outwardly nice, however at this target I don’t believe the managers had a very effective idea of what corporate wanted so it was poorly translated in the store."
good,"It was a great first job, I was a carr pusher and was trained in almost every category until I moved and transferred I was changed to seasonal and let go at the end of the season"
good,I’ve worked here for over a year. I loved it at first. I love the friends I’ve made. But they don’t give you any time to just enjoy your work. They want work done pronto and will keep bothering you until it’s done.
good,Dont no what to say . Mostly was a good experience.  Under paid and overworked . Sometimes felt like I didn't  get credit for all I did . Was very last in trading team members .
good,"I start at 5.00 am, I pick up my work teams, they assign me my homework, I take a 15-minute break in two hours, I continue working at a rapid pace without stopping, until you reach 5 hours, I take my 30-minute break, I continue working until I complete My day, delivery of equipment and I finish the work day."
good,"As Visual Merchandiser, your job is to provide and create displays for the store and help train team-members on Visual Merchandising. The company is not in line with their Visual Merchandising, it is very different compared to other large retail chains."
good,I did not mind working there until a medical condition came up and then they did not want to work with me at all. I was constantly going to the dr and asking for them to work with me and help me out and they refused therefore my health deteriorated and I needed surgery
good,"I can't speak for the company as a whole, really more of the particular location that I was in. It was actually pretty fun when I first started, we had contests in the store, employees were well recognized for their efforts, and people were just happier to come to work in general and do their jobs. That changed after a few years, things stopped being fun, certain expectancies began that could not always be helped and if you didn't do as they expected, your job was on the line. Management started pressuring the cashiers especially because of the ""Red Cards"". Target's Debit / Credit card. It was to be offered every so often to customers that may be interested in saving 5% when shopping. Later, it became a demand. All cashiers were to ask every single guest that were trying to check out. All cashiers had a quota that they had to obtain by the end of the week otherwise there would be a reprimand.  Keep in mind, at this time, cashiers received nothing for meeting their quotas. Everything became Target ""Brand"". There were other things too but that was the biggest hassle to have to deal with on a daily basis. Of course there are certain associates that help make your work days better. But, during my time it just wasn't what it used to be and I began to hate going there. As soon as I was able to get a better job that paid double and acquired my paid time off, I quit."
good,I been working at target for 4 years Working there is ok it could be a lot better with management and guess service but other than that it a nice job .
good,Although the job was interesting they would consistently mess up your schedule and change it the day of without any notice. But other than that it is a great place to gain customer experience and communication skills
good,i would work on the the cashier .so i would clock in no the goal of the day an work plan an the i would start my job .the most difficult thing would be when a customer would would get upset an there were no helping them with the problem
good,Target’s a good place to work when your going to school. Hours are okay and flexible. Get paid time and a half on holidays. There’s room for growth and opportunity to move up.
good,I enjoyed helping the customers find what the needed in a respective time. Most of the employees were great to work with. Restocking the floor to make sure customer never had to search for product and help out on register whenever there was a long line of customers
good,Ask for full time or you're wasting your time. management was cool employees were nice but they didn't give you any hours. I liked the discounts and the sales
good,Target taught me a great deal about how a warehouse operates. It may not be the most efficiently ran warehouse but it definitely works. My only issue was management at the time was very new and did not know much of what the warehouse operations in place
good,"I love working for target, I have been here a little over a year but it feels impossible to get a full time position. If you're looking for a part time job this is great but if you need full time hours don't bother."
good,"The team you are on will make or break your experience at Target. If you end up on a good team, you'll have a good time. If you end up on a bad one or have a poor manager, you'll have a very bad time. Not much of a grey area. "
good,"I workd the sales floor, helped the guests, stocked shelves, researched what items needed to be ordered. Returned reshop items back to the salesfloor."
good,"If you need a part-time job and enjoy helping people, Target can give you that experience. "
good,"Running to front end handling customers complains as well providing and assisting cashier with overrides or returns. Providing cashiers with change, breaks and lunch’s."
good,"It is a nice place to work at if you're just starting out in customer service and want some cashier experience. Cart attendants get a lot of responsibility and I believe they are underpaid for the amount of stuff they have to clean up, i.e. they collect the carts and are basically janitors all in one."
good,"Target is not a bad place to work at. The managers are good. The pay is good for the job you’re doing. Hours are not consistent. They don’t play any music so it can get pretty boring. I like that you are allowed to have piercings, funky colored hair, and dress pretty casually."
good,"Not much to say because i worked there years ago. Did not get the position i applied for and management was not very helpful. That was back when there was no head manager, im sure the business is a lot better off now"
good,Hard working company with a good staff culture to get the job done. Fast paced change and growing in the industry. Matrix environment that requires good communication skills.
good,The company does well. I feel good about job security. I enjoy coming to work and the people I work with. Great company to begin a career with the right training.
good,"The managers were never on the same page and one of the managers there was arrested for stealing money over $20,000 from the company. It was a temporary job for me."
good,"Easy job, not strict but management in this dept, (each dept has their own shift leaders), are nice but they have trouble with shift assignments and there's almost no communication or training. So be wary of that."
good,Target is allows employees to work independently and on teams. Great place to work and to meet people of different backgrounds. Employees form connections and interact with each other outside of work hours.
good,There was very little mentoring/direction from supervisors. Once on the floor i felt i was left to fend for myself with little no training and not one to ask for direction when I had a question.  Left to sort out on my own which i did but would have saved time if more thorough training and mentor had been provided on the few days or week.
good,Loved the people that I worked with but not enough hours for me to be able to live off of. With the position I worked in I did not get enough hours to be able to get my job done.
good,"The pay is pretty nice. My specific job was stressful because we had people calling off in our department all the time, and never had enough people working there."
good,It a okay company to work for. But the team leaders I was working under was horrible. They would complain about every little thing and would not do no work
good,"It's a slow  company , to implement modern technologies  they have very  old systems to support their production, ( legacy system, like IBM batch and old online application   still  supporting dump terminals)"
good,If you plan to work out target be prepared to work shifts that are an overload of work with very little hours to finish task you have to be very quick and also be careful what you do around the managers
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,"The management of the place is terrible but it is a much more laid back work environment, they have a really bad habit of cutting hours an then calling people in to work on short notice"
good,it was a seasonal job so it got intense some days. most of my days were either running around the store grabbing items for the online store or stocking the shelves in the back. I think i learned how to be a cog in a machine and how to talk to people better. that was probably the hardest part of the job for me talking to customers when they had questions i definitely got better at answering their question but it was hard at first
good,Good place to work but very strict with hours and schedules. Hard to fit in if you're younger but management will still treat you with respect and help whenever they can.
good,"Sooo. I used to be full time on price change. Then with all the new changes that came, they did away with price change and Plano team. Everyone has a department and is responsible for there own stuff. So I basically am now a flow team member and my hours went from 35 hours all the way down too 16 to 18 hours. Sucks"
good,"Work well with preferred schedule, people are great except certain management, pay is great for little to no work. Depending on location, weekends/holidays not too bad, pretty slow during the week."
good,"Target is a competitive, fast paced, and hands on job. Everyone has a job to do and works as a team. The staff was friendly and they work with you and try and help you with whatever you need."
good,"The people were not really there to be helpful or be nice, it was about the money and the costumers only. I had lost checks and lots of money that was never found."
good,"I didn’t get to work at a full blown target I worked at something called a “Target Express” it was a new concept. I was a dual employee so I worked at the Target and the Starbucks. "
good,"I learned so much working here for so many years. This job provided me a great work life balance. Opportunities to advance are for those that have better relationships with management, many employees get overlooked. The people there are great!"
good,"Bit of a long one, I'll Include a TL;DR at the bottom."
good,I worked at Target for 1 1/2 years. The entire time I worked there was stressful. Meeting deadlines on assignments was impossible and managment was very disorganized and stressed an impossible high output of work. Pay was comparable to other places I worked.
good,Target was a  great experience it's a great places to do what you love and that's working with the public.. I learn how to figure out how to handle different situations when they arrived.
good,"Good pay, minimal tolerance for mistakes, time spent taking stock from the back and pushing it to the floor, taking items from the floor and back stocking and helping customers find items they are looking for. Very little excitement in the job, same thing everyday and very little training is required and very little training is given. The training consisted of learning how the device used to stock works and then being sent to work with another employee for the first few days before you start working on your own"
good,"There seems to be a policy of keeping part-time working hours below an average of 20/week, even if you make it clear you want more hours.  This is because 20 hours/week is the threshold for receiving most benefits."
good,"I was hired as a FULL TIME Ship From Store team member. Full time, meaning I needed 40 hours each week, every week. I wasn't given that. "
good,"Working at target I always had fun, always learning. Kept trying to get a TAM card thru target, was unable to because they thought I was too young. Great atmosphere,"
good,The new changes they have is stupid but overall it's an OK company it it all depends on the store they want you to be 15 people in one and they barely give any hours
good,The people i worked with were fantastic. They made work their fun. Some of the supervisors on the other hand really made it hard to even have a smile because they would always find something to correct.
good,It was okay to work for. You have to be prepared to be very flexible. You could be handling other job functions than what you were hired to do. Supervisors are busy most of the learning of the job comes from you experiencing it not from someone teaching you about it
good,"If you can multitask well and enjoy selling the products sold, you will have a good time. Need to have a fast pace with everything you do and be able to handle working with different types of management daily."
good,"It was my first job. Overall it was a good experience. Management was alright, the coworkers were probably the best part about it. Hours where kind of inconsistent and sometimes very demanding. For instance I would get a closing shift and then an opening shift the next day, or I would get 8 hour shifts three days in a row and then no shifts for a week."
good,"The job was okay for the most part but i was on Outbound with all the men."
good,Fun environment and co-workers. Fast paced and challenging. Overall a pleasure to work with the team. Great customer service and cleanliness of work spaces.
good,"I stayed for 6 months, getting the right experience since I am new in the U.S, sad to say @ first it was a feeling of that excitement when I joined, @ the end if they don’t like you they will find ways for you to give up, giving you hard time? But probably its all depends how does the management handles staff issues or how it’s branch the MANAGEMENT RUNS THE STORE!"
good,"There is not much variation in the work, although that allows for a bit of socialization during work without affecting the pace.  If the hours were full time as a standard, and the pay was a bit higher, this would be a sustainable position.  Overall working at target is a good experience considering the balance of an enjoyable atmosphere and work."
good,"I got a lot of experience through working at Target however the changes and management always had its issues and the hours were never there.I liked the workers, and always doing something steady."
good,Was given a raise for one pay period and then it was taken when everyone moved to $13 an hour. “Specialty” areas no longer make .50 more even though it is staffed everyday every hour. Some good managers. After December you’re lucky if you get 20 hours a week.
good,"The job is fairly interesting, but I'm getting bored, and management sucks. Management and leads have cliques, too many people have access to the schedules and schedules are frequently getting changed at the last minute with no notice to employees, and it's hard to feel comfortable working there."
good,"As a HR manager with Target I found it challenging to positively and consistently connect with my team and meet their needs as the majority of my time was spent on floor assisting with operational functions of the store. In order to control staffing, managers were required to work very long shifts and run the sales floor while trying to finish office work in-between.  It always felt like someone was getting shorted.  The people that I worked with were incredible and some of the hardest workers I have had the privilege of working with"
good,"in the beginning, Target was an exciting place to work with new opportunities. had the chance to be creative with my ideas to use in my area expanded my talents in different areas. Toward the end, the raise went up but the hours went down with forced me to leave."
good,Target is a nice place to work. Staff is great! Work/Life balance is great! They are really flexible if you need days off! The pay is good. I really enjoy working with people. The only problem is not enough hours with automation taking the place of cashiers.
good,"Nice work environment as the store has been remodeled and has that ""department store"" look.  Customers are generally very pleasant and the workload is manageable."
good,"management do not care about employees, management sticks together instead of helping employees below them also good paying job with many cons its better for a temporary job"
good,"Working in the Target Backroom was inconsistent, stressful, and mindless. Not the worst place I've worked. Their management is well coordinated. "
good,It was ok for a first job. Nothing to hard. It helped me gain experience and I needed that experience to be able to find new jobs. It looks good on college resumes.
good,"One of the least favorable places I have worked as managers only worried about the employees getting people to sign up for red cards other than that, you didn't really see them much."
good,The positions fuke advancement were great although the face paced competitive environment was endless especially during peak holiday season.  Good 1st job.
good,Corporate constantly makes rules that don’t work because they don’t know what it’s like to work at store level. Managers are getting lazy. Over worked and under appreciated
good,Target was a great great experience one of my favorite jobs that I’ve held very easy to move up very easy job to do. Tryn to promote the card gets tedious but other than that no complaints
good,"I didn't have a lot of problems working there. Hours were fine, and if I need to change things, I could work it out. Some managers made working a lot harder than it needed to be. One of the managers there is the reason for quite a few people quitting the job. Yet she's still working there and I haven't seen much change in her."
good,"I worked there while in high school and a lot of my co-workers were around the same age, so it really wasn't bad, but the customers are the worst part about the job especially the ones with tons of coupons. Overall it's an okay place to work at."
good,There are many days where it is over four hours on the job before I get a break but I just power through it anyway but the company cannot keep its compliance with meals I do not think we have gone more than one day in a row with everybody making compliance for their lunch time since I've been there that's kind of disturbing since it's such an easy fix.
good,I would recommend this job to someone who is new to the retail industry. I enjoyed my job at target. It taught me organization and time management skills that I can apply to any future position.
good,Not enough pay for the cost of living. Little overtime if you're  a regular part-time employee. Not many full-time positions available for non management workers.
good,"staff are excellent and super friendly, everybody is helpful, such a ximmu it oriented job, everybody is super dedicated in bringing out the best in everybody"
good,"The 12 hour work days here can be very easy if you create a good pace for yourself. There's weeks when you will get all 12 hours for all three work days ..and there's weeks that you won't. It's extremely random. I've clocked in at my start time of 6AM and was sent home at 10AM.. other  times at 1PM, 2PM and 4PM. There have also been days where I receive a text at 12AM telling me not to come in at all."
good,"Working at Target is a solid choice for anyone seeking a second job or looking to get started in the workforce. The interviewing process of the company is fair enough to allow those with little experience, such as teenagers, to seek a job while maintaining a decent standard for who they hire. A typical workday is generally at least 6 hours long with 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute unpaid meal break. How much you move around varies based on your position in the store - each position has their pros and cons."
good,"In my opinion the job is for someone who just got out of high school. "
good,It feels like other mangers are at war against market department. Your often by yourself with no leadership. You get paid very little to do alot ot work
good,Probably the worst company I have ever worked for.. the managers were rude and unknowledgeable. Numerous occasions of verbal reprimands in a negative manner.
good,"Long story short they cut everyone's hours, used to be a good place to work but 5 hours a week doesn't cut it. I got lucky, I had a friend who got no hours one week. One of the better managers managed to temporarily fix it, but hours are still low and staying low, so I and everyone I know is leaving."
good,"While individuals & management styles can vary, often corporate poorly incentivized employees or mismanaged through top-down directives. Poor performers were not dealt with effectively, while high performers were either unrewarded, treated as the norm, or even punished."
good,New store-ops model is fraught with pitfalls in execution with unrealistic expectations on team performance if payroll is not properly allocated. Invest more in your team on a personal level and not solely on metrics.
good,Great job if you don’t have consistent bills to pay. Hours are very inconsistent. Great first job for college students but advancement takes years from what it seemed.
good,"unprofessional,only concerned about numbers and not concerned about proper training,constantly being micro managed,fellow employees unwilling to assist when needed"
good,"Working at Target was challenging at first but eventually became easier and I was able to procure and maintain a positive work experience. The employees generally get along well with one another and management, at the time, listened and attempted to handle all grievances. The hardest part of the job was completing floor diagrams for new products. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people, co-workers as well as the customers. I would work there again."
good,"Target is a good starting job and a good place to work at if you need a job, but if you see that your worth is hirer than the pay you recive at Target, than staying there isn't a good idea."
good,Ok for an entry level job. Progression and career advancement is very limited. Every day is a number game that you must meet. There are some weeks that your 40 hours are not guaranteed.
good,"I like working there, it's alright if you enjoy shopping and purchasing items with a discount, which combines well with sales that occur on a regular basis; however, you have to be careful not to overspend based on a low pay rate."
good,It was a good place to work but not to much room for advancement. managers were very good to work with.... people were usually very happy and plesant to customers
good,"Target is laser focused on the relationship between their guests and their brand. This has allowed us to find success in an quickly evolving retail landscape that is moving more digital, looking for unique and exclusive experiences, while ensuring a strong focus on environment & social efficacy."
good,It's a decent job but it can be tiring especially since my job involved waking up early in the morning. The culture there was really nice and I enjoyed working with most people there. It can get busy their on certain days.
good,Target is a good company to work for the pay is really good but they do rush you a bit and do a lot of coaching and speaking to you. The management can be a better.
good,"Target was my first job. It was good for what it is."
good,Many changes since my interview.   As a guest I view them as online order oriented with less attention given to the fast Fun friendly motto if the past.
good,"Target used to make work life balance a priority, but recently has taken a bad turn.  It is also expected to perform work duties and tasks outside of your job description."
good,Schedule was irregular and they hire too many new people rather than give hours to current employees. Had to pick up extra shifts to try to get decent hours
good,"Typical day at work in the front lanes including assisting guests with checkout, monitoring self-checkout lanes, and/or helping with guest services answering questions, preparing online orders, and doing returns. The work is easy to do and thorough training is offered, but it can suck having to stand in one place even when there aren't any customers and it's hard to get the chance to be cross-trained in related areas unless incredibly persistent."
good,"Target has a policy of a store director being there for only 2 years so they don't get overly attached to just one store, this means that every 2 years the entire dynamic of your store shifts focus. I got lucky and got out before the fresh faced girl out of business school with no real personal-able skills came into the picture but lets just say after the previous 3 directors who caused a large growth in employees and made target a safe inviting and overall fun place to be, it was turned into a depressing by the books store with no real attention to the customer and making them feel like they were family. Also she caused 3/4 of the old staff to either quit or transfer."
good,Most of the Employees I interacted with were great and some were very helpful. Management can be so much better. Unorganized is the only word I can use to describe my time there. Management didn't even know what days or hours I worked. Schedule was always late as well.
good,Well the people are OK but the workplace is crowed and never always prepared for the next work day. Also be prepared to stay longer than schedule because you are more than likely to be ask to stay longer so don't make a lot of plans after work.
good,"LODs sometimes forget to make note of call ins to your primary supervisor, being sick was indeed a hassle, no paid time off for jury duty lack of consistent directive between managers."
good,Would recommend to see how retail jobs are worked  there are lots of things you can learn from just being a cashier. Also see the benefits you get from working there as well.
good,"I feel like Target was overall a good job, but management is what makes a job stressful or easy going. In my case it was a little of both, but in entirety it was a decent college job."
good,Target is somewhat a decent place to work.I had mostly drive up shifts and GSTL/GSA’s take a lot of advantage of the person on Drive Up. Hard work is never recognized by managers and managers show lots of favoritism. Only good part of working at target are friendly coworkers and discounts.
good,"I was a hardlines employee, which means I worked on the un-carpeted salesfloor (toys, beauty, stationery, home goods, etc). Target is definitely a fast-paced work environment. In a usual 4.5-hour closing shift, I was responsible for any given ""zone"" of the store, making sure there is nothing on the ground, making sure everything is neat and pulled to the front of the shelves, picking up and sorting items that don't belong in our given area, cleaning up trash around my zone, cashiering when needed, covering breaks for beauty and/or electronics team members, and helping guests when needed. The environment overall was a pleasant experience, as I made a lot of new friends, including one I would consider one of my closest friends at the moment. Management at my store was pretty good for the most part. Some team leaders were better than others, and I definitely had my favorites, but none of them were horrible. My biggest issue with working there was the fact that regular team members are held to such a high standard by certain managers and expected to get too much work done in 4.5hrs than is possible, especially when it gets busy. Team leaders expect team members to be able to have a completely finished, clean, and neat zone by the end of the night when my Target was in a college town full of college students who don't care about putting items back where they first picked them up. My second biggest issue was that my maximum amount of hours I wanted to work was 25 hours a week, and this was constantly disregarded and I would be scheduled 26-30 hours a week. Some of my coworkers had"
good,Target has a great work environment and working there is very team oriented. A big issue was no room for moving up they ALWAYS hired external for any leadership position. It wasn't just at my store but other Targets in other states to. Corporate is always in the store visiting. The biggest issue everyone faced was not a consistent amount of hours. Some weeks would be close to 40 and the next week could be 14. At my store specifically if they were trying to get you to quit they would only give one a 4 hour shift one day a week. The management was very petty!
good,I learned a lot from  some of the employees but other employees they  didn't want to teach you anything  and supervision needs more training and the company has to do a better job preparing its associate for what they are getting into to much glitz and not enough of what you really getting into.
good,"•	Received payments, issued receipts or change due to customers."
good,"I had to cover fabrics and crafts and electronics most days by myself, sometimes id have another coworker to help me but a lot of the time I would be on my own and I would get swamped especially if i got a call to go cut fabric for somebody in the next section of the store next to my section ""electronics"""
good,I enjoyed working for target it's a good place to work the hours can vary  but it can work around your schedule if you have children.  They're starting at $15 an hour
good,"Target is a fun place to work. There are several tasks you may work at, so it's not boring. Management is very respectful and great to get along with."
good,"When i first got here i was excited to work at a store that i shop at it was pretty far from my house and pay well.i was brought in the summer time when hours were coming in very good.Then the seasons past and we lost a supervisor which brought in a new one."
good,"Target is a retail store. For someone who is starting a little part time job may enjoy working at Target. Anyone can try to work there, and see how they like it."
good,"Target is a fantastic place to work. The pay is much better than many other places I have seen. My coworkers make it an even better experience. The only thing I can say is that if you dislike a lot of change all at once, I'd stay away from Target. It changes far too often and the changes often do not make much sense for the business."
good,this is an ok place to work. i like the people the that i worked with but the communication on the management level could use a lot of improvement. Overall would not recommend.
good,"When it is a busy day at guest service, we usually have 2 - 3 team members at the desk for help. When it is a busy line, we usually do the quickest job we can and move on with the next guest."
good,There was always a lot of pressure on workers to achieve a lot of completed work while on the clock with a severe lack of team members on a daily basis.
good,Great place to learn the useful skills that you can use later on in life. Start at Target in high school and have work my way to a team leader. Good place to grow for the job force.
good,"Expectations of speed of results unrealistic without support with resources and pay.  Turnover is exceptionally high, creating an environment of constant flux."
good,"Around the Holidays when I was working, they started hiring a bunch of people. Then they screwed me over with not giving me enough hours and i mean like 5.75 hours or less a week. The staff is really friendly and so are the former employees, I don’t know if they give you more hours again after the Holidays, but I had to leave as soon as possible for money purposes."
good,"I have worked here for about a year, and still only get about 3 hours a week for the past 5 months.  I enjoy all of the people I work with, but as a student, it is not nearly enough to be sustainable."
good,Working at Target in the warehouse department is a decent experience if you are a fast learner and able to move weight efficiently without harming yourself. However the hours you get are most likely going to be cut even if you are a great worker due to the fact that product deliveries are affected by seasonal stock. This results in days without work. Decent pay inconsistent hours.
good,"It's a okay job, the hours are not too good. The management is fair and you could advance. Alot of lefting, moving pallets and packing packages. Also shipping them off too UPS."
good,So not have any at this time. Can be a good place to work. With all the new changes and more to come don't know whats going to happen at all the targets.
good,"i liked working at target for the most part. although i did not like that they hired from outside the store for management opportunities, i think the should have hired from within."
good,"Work at Target was pretty stressful but pretty rewarding. It was a retail job with customers needing help with whatever you could help them with. Be it my security position or guest services position, I enjoyed helping people. The biggest issue is that to go anywhere you needed to be-friend management. Whether or not you were considered for any higher position wasn't based on your performance, only off of the people you interacted with in and out of work."
good,"To be a leader at Target you have to be able to manage stress at a high level and be multitask, for instance as a leader and with 1 team member you have to be able to do a minimum of 10 planograms per day and take care of all clearance, at the same time respond to all call buttons, and be able to do carts of strays(returns), cover operator breaks and lunchs before 1pm. After one all you have to focus is making sure your areas are zone(looking good) for the next shift. Continue working on returns, etc.."
good,"Decent part-time job, but was hard to balance school and the position. I was unable to get a regular schedule and I was rotated from area to area more than I wanted to be."
good,"Working on truck is stressful to say the least. Speed is the name of the game, and is the only thing the managers care about. In the last month alone, 3 people have been fired from the truck team."
good,"Fast, Fun, and Friendly is their slogan, so it made it easy for myself to meet the standards and over succeed in my quarterly reviews. Stretches are always performed at start of shift, which helped us with our daily routine of speed walking and carrying heavy freight. I learned how to work great with the packing team, as well as being a leader when asked to by management (when running late). I received my CPR card when joining the ERT (emergency response team). I was able to see the ins and outs of the entire warehouse, as well as personally meeting the entire management staff. The most enjoyable part of this job was the all team member meetings with the CEO because games and activities were amongst the entire departments. The most difficult part was getting used to and helping out new management. Managers were swapped out throughout the warehouse according to their teams productivity and standards were being met. Overall, target has been the best experience in working as a team."
good,I work at target but they do not gove me more hours. It is also hard to carry boxes and one time i got bruised by it because it was really heavy. I wish they  gave me  a better salary
good,A decent place to work although there is not a whole lot of room for moving up in the company unless you plan on staying there for a few years. Also there is not much compensation for hourly employees in the way of medical insurance. I'm not sure about the salary employees - but I do believe they are compensated with health insurance and 401K as well.
good,Target had a great culture and the coworkers made it fun. You got to interact with guests a lot and management gives you a lot of responsibility. I would recommend.
good,"Fast paced environment"
good,I enjoy the energy that the co workers display. You must have an energized and happy personality to work in this company. It is quick paced at times but then it would slow down and have a relaxed setting.
good,"There are some great things about working at target especially many of the other associates that work there but the management is all over the place and seem to want loyalty from its workers while never having any towards them, and the Store manager also uses her power to belittle and borderline bully other associates and even some of the other team leads , other than that it is a great place to work at and most team leads are wonderful and help out the associates so much"
good,Have been here for years but it seems the company in its quest to move forward is forgetting about its Employees by try to change how things are done with out proper testing of new procedures
good,"I learned how to use pallet jacks, how to work fast. Very fast paced, have to learn fast. Hardest part was carrying furniture on the shelf. Most enjoyable was the co-workers, everyone was nice"
good,Was a fun place to work. But the hours were not flexible and the pay could have been better. Management is professional and runs a tight ship. They appreciate their team members.
good,The work is worth the pay. The trouble comes in when you’re dealing with certain customers or associates. Overall the job is pretty decent if you stay in the manager’s good side
good,If you are a hardlines team member you will mostly help put items back where it belongs if it's out of place on the shelf. You will also be a backup cashier if the front needs help. Prepare to do a lot of walking and helping customers find the item that they need. This job will help you boost your oral communication and customer service skills. The environment is comfortable and the managers are not that hard on you as long as you are doing your job.
good,"Working at target was quite an experience for me. I went as a seasonal ended up, permanently staying.There working requirements, changed over the year that I have been there. The management there does a lot of favoritism, Which is a little unfair. The hardest part about target was that while zoning an area, You'll have to maintain the zone as customers are shopping throughout the night. As well as helping guest with there shopping experience."
good,It was stress full we prepared for the night all the shipment that came in. They would divided into section and each group had to stick them. We had to clean before by 7-7:15 am before opening.
good,"Great company from a corporate level, Most management is external hires with little to no training. Target pushes you to skip training to meet operational goals. no training offered to leadership as to how to develop to promote hourly staff. Nearly impossible to promote to salary from hourly."
good,The salary is great but the hours they give you are too short and you can't live off the money you get. The work environment is very friendly. You will learn multiple departments if you show you want to.
good,Every experience for the company I had varied based on how the store leaders executed everything.  Also depended on the support of the store as a team.  Some times it felt like a great company to stick with and other times it wasn't.
good,"The typical day at work was fine, management was the most difficult part in that I felt there could have been better management. The employees were fun and I managed to get along with employees which made it a fun work environment. The most enjoyable part of my job was having to make drinks as a barista and communicating with employees. The workplace culture made it a very enjoyable environment, my coworkers helped make the job easier."
good,"Low paying job but you are not required to do much. Target really do not care about attendance, just make sure to call to let the manager know that you are not coming in"
good,my coworkers were great to be around. I had a good time. the work was challenging at times and quick paced. Most managers would help if needed. my depts. hours were great. others not so much.
good,"Very political to survive in this retail culture. Performance is important, but knowing and getting along with the folks in power is more important. I use the word power because managers at the district level and above operate as if they have the power to control anyone destiny rather then build a culture of respect and collaboration."
good,"When I was working for Target Distribution, I enjoyed working with alot of people and working as a big team. Some days feel good, some days feel like manure. I would recommend Target DC for people that is just now entering the workforce for experience."
good,"A few years ago, many upper and middle managers replaced with Amazon executives have pushed the company in the positive direction.  However, those that remained from the old culture still detrimental to the company as they promote based on the buddy system not actual performance."
good,"While working at Target it is what you make it. As a senior team leader you are responsible for your team in a department. If you work with them, but coach along the way it will be fun. "
good,"At Target you will be very active among your Team Members and will see a great amount of teamwork through all departments. Though there are nice benefits to the job position you apply for at Target, recently there is very little room for advancement with the introduction of modernization at Target. Hours vary greatly among fellow Team Members. And Management is very biased towards who they like and who they don't like, so please be careful when dealing with management."
good,Co-workers and my Managers were all cool but one thing me and my co-workers always complain about was the hours. I was a Flow Team Member and we started off with a fair amout of hours (for part time workers) but towards the end of 2018 we were stuck with only working about 4hrs a day and schedule for about 4-5 days a week. Typically working only about 28-31hrs a week with $11 an hour (started at $12 but they ended up taking all of our dollar pay which was another big deal we had).
good,Wasn’t helpful at all lack of management don’t match recent pay and it was seasonal no room to progress in company unorganized also a lack of team work
good,This will be a review for the overall experience of working at target seeing as I've been a employee with them several times over the years. This place used to be fun before the makeovers and re branding which is unfortunate. every shift used to begin with a staff on deck meeting with snacks and water where we would stretch together and get amped up and ready for the day. now its a clock-in grab a radio and go situation and management seems a bit more uptight and stressed. great place to work though
good,I appreciate the qualifications and lessons learned. I worked for close to 5 years..  Worth it for the time given into the position. I would  work there again.
good,"The work was not terrible, but my particular location was incredibly disorganized. I worked at two Target stores and the difference in organization and store overlay was monumental. Target can be a great place, but the difference in management can change one's experience."
good,"Target wasn’t bad, they were just really inconsistent and did try to understand their team members. They also had pretty poor management at times, most cashiers felt as if they were doing their job alone when they were faced with a rush of guests. There was much structure."
good,"definitely depends on the person, you either love it or hate it. for me, it was too big; i couldn’t get to know nearly everyone. hours often got cut so it’s manageable but not the best when you need money"
good,Fast fun and friendly working experience for me. But the only thing was that they did not offer too much hours and I was working there when the minimum wage was $8.00 an hour.
good,"Once you're clocked in you immediately head straight to your job area. Make sure you greet people with a smile and help any guest that needs assistance or look lost. Most enjoyable part is stocking up items onto the shelves all nice, neat and clean. Difficult part is when theirs a rush and only two cashiers are available, that's when you got to be faced paced, make sure the guest found everything okay and continue on."
good,Goof place to work.love the discount for team members.fast pace fun.and meeting new people. No bad problems no heavy work just a good place to be.and they enjoy us
good,I believe Target is a great place to work but i happen to be in the situation that i was not a fan of how things at my particular location was run. Some of the overall expectation were silly company wide but overall not a bad place to work.
good,"siempre necesitan personal , lo que no entiendo es porque echan a la gente si siguen contratando."
good,"Target promotes its 'fun' work culture and team-oriented approach to its workers. Daily tasks are generally repetitive, but with the right attitude, it's a nice place to work. The starting pay will be $15 by the end of 2020, so if this is your cup of tea, it may be worth it."
good,"its target, theres not much to expect. its a job if you need one, and unless you really have that drive, determination and overall want to get further in the company, you wont."
good,"The compensation is okay for a retail store, I just wish I could get more hours and become a full-time associate. They made it seem like there was more opportunity for advancement in addition to hours but I honestly think they do that so they don't have to hire as many full-timers."
good,"Was told 3 days before last day that seasonal employees (including myself) were no longer going to be working. I had called HR to ask if I would be working for the next two weeks, as coworkers were being laid off. She told me I would be and had nothing to worry about clearly I did as when I went to work a few days later I was told in the back room, not in an office, that as a seasonal employee my time was up. He told me it was nothing I did and I should reapply, but I will not be."
good,"Target is a good place to work at while going to school, but I don't know if want to stay here for a long time. I don't feel challenged anymore. I have only been working at Target for about two months.  Another that bothers me is how hours get cut after while."
good,"If you are going to work in retail then Target is a great place.  Pay and benefits are great, every other weekend off, however no matter what your job is you are a working manager required to work nights, holidays and weekends.   Life balance is mostly encouraged, but hard to manage in reality with workload.  Some Managers are awesome and some not so much, this also dictates your work life balance.  When payroll is plentiful life is good and when payroll is cut then it really stinks."
good,Target would be better if the mangers understood what the employer wanted. The pay was good. There is no talking aloud to other team members or else we would get yelled at. Its okay.
good,Compared to most retailers Target is actually a fun company to work for! I had to leave my store as higher ups saw fit to send split up management and HR staff  throughout the region.
good,"Overall I really like working there, great teamwork and team environment. Very friendly and welcoming. The management was not what it should have been and was ultimately the reason I left."
good,In general the work is very fast and you find yourself swamped with tasks which aren't hard but very detail oriented all on a timed schedule. The job pays well for what it was however if you don't like stress the management will give you a run for your money more often than not.
good,"If I had to work for a retail store, Target would be the way to go. They treat you fairly well and listen if you have a problem. The management team seems to actually care."
good,was nice at first until its failed to realize you also have life outside of work. Not super understanding. hours cut back after holidays to 2 days a week.
good,"Poor management at the store I worked in.  I was hired for an HR position, which was a higher pay bracket than part-time salesfloor employees (including front end - cashiers, etc.).  When Target corporately raised the minimum wage, they didn't raise wages for existing employees, so by the time I left, I was making less than high school kids working a part-time job as a cashier.  Raising the minimum wage to attract higher talent is a great thing for a company, but you can't forget the people who have already worked for you for years.  On the flip side, Target is a great place to work if you're just looking for a part-time job and don't have any aspirations to grow a career.  Some people can grow a career at Target, but not everyone.  I worked for Target twice.  Once, as a part-time guest services team member while I was in college.  The second time was in HR after college.  I had a far better experience the first time I worked for Target.  Target also has GREAT benefits!  Once you reach a year of employment, you're eligible for health and dental insurance and they're great!  The 10% discount is nice too.  Overall, it depends on what you're looking for, where you want to go in your career, and if you're fortunate enough to have good management in your store and district."
good,I loved working there but they fired me for an unstable mental health and cause I dyed my hair without telling anyone which I didn't think I had to do would not reccomend
good,"Target is a good place to work for. Good advancement opportunities, with a fast pace environment that encourages you to be yourself and learn as much as you can. Over my time with Target I learned multiple areas of the retail industry, preparing me to taking on a new challenge."
good,"Good paying part time job, in order to earn some money why I was unemployed.  However, with this being said be warned that the company can fire you for any reason (without warning) if you are in your 90 day probationary period."
good,"It was fun there. The coworkers, the freedom of attire, it was all great. The pay was good for me especially considering that i was about to enter college and needed some money in my pocket. I was averaging about $500 - $850 every two weeks and the shifts really didn't affect my regular life."
good,"If you are a hard worker, this is the place you want to be.  The pay is competitive, and the hours can be good.  Co-workers are friendly and helpful.  Follow the rules, and you'll be fine."
good,"I learned a lot from working in retail. It was stressful at times, but very fun at other times. The management was kind and understanding. I was grateful for the opportunity to work there. Great job for high school to college age kids to gain work experience."
good,Always lot of work.This is my first job i learned lot of things.Management is good.the hardest part of the job is standing through out the shift.And i got lot of nice people around me.
good,Became a cashier and soon after became a cashier trainer. Our main goal was to ring the guests up as quickly possible. Every now and then I'd fill in for Starbucks and for Guest Services.
good,"No work life balance , very stressful. The holidays we're absolutely awful. Higher management get stressed and take it out on the team leaders which stresses out the team leaders and then its just down the pyramid the stress chain reaction goes."
good,This is a great place to get your foot into the door of the world of employment. The experience and connections you make can become assets to you if you decide to look for something further in life.
good,"Target was a great company and very flexible over my 10.5 years. I was able to grow as leader and pick up several skills over the time. The diversity of the 65% of the employees that reported directly to me was something I took very much pride in to be their leader and get the day to day operations done. Over time, it started to wear me out mentally where even though we'd get everything complete and exceeding sales, you'd still leave defeated. I'm forever grateful for my time there and the relationships built but I needed time to realign my priorities, spend some personal time with my family during the holidays, and recalibrate my focus and energy."
good,"Started out at 10 hourly, inconsistent schedule and hours so if you need to pay bills its hard to say youd make your mark. Management was awful and unwilling to transfer me when I had to relocate"
good,You do a lot of repetitive tasks and I received consistent hours. New management is hard to work with but I enjoyed my time before. Everybody will help you if you need anything
good,"The work environment itself was a really good one. The team members I worked with were an amazing group of men and women who balance fun and work.  Management let their personal feeling/life get in the way of how they did their jobs. The most enjoyable part was my co workers, and the least enjoyable were certain members of management. The job overall was fun and quite easy."
good,"greta first job experience and thats pretty much it "
good,Target is a demanding company to work for. Management loses sight of employees and only cares about the tasks that need to be completed. They fail to provide adequate training or set clear expectations. The company's culture is changing and employees are simply tools and not individuals anymore.
good,"A good clean fun and you can do more than just one task, friendly,free lunch break and free brakes, good over time.good pay, good benefits , you get help when you need it"
good,"My experience with Target is very similar to other retail locations. One difference for me has been the size of the company itself. It's a fast paced, seasonal high stress workplace. Guest engagement is a must; be personable and friendly. Overall, team members and management are supportive and work together to get a job done. It can get overwhelming during the peak hours and seasons, but good work ethic and perseverance go a long way."
good,"rough work life balance but over all a good job.. great pay for manager and room to move up,"
good,"The Team is fast, fun and friendly with managers to match. By asking to learn different departments, one can move quickly up the corporate ladder. Time management is key to ensuring a successful shift, cleaning up your workload and communicating to your supervisor helps you to stand out from others."
good,Target has limited pay scale raises and frequently has poorly educated and lack of experienced managers who can put a lot of unnecessary stress on personnel
good,"Target is an okay place to work. You can learn a lot working at Target. Management can expect a lot from you, but the employees should be paid based on the numerous task they do. The employees do 4 to 5 other people task, but the pay does not reflect that and it should."
good,"Helping guest in any possible way. I learned great  Communication skills, money skills and great work ethic. Management can be great just really depends on the person that’s working that day.  The hardest part of my job is trying to help a guest who is irate. Most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a guest smile and working with great people"
good,"Easy money, but management sucked big time. A good job if you're young and looking for a job with room to grow. They promote based on performance not seniority."
good,Working at target was fasted paced and exciting. It was a very fun and happy working environment. The managers and other employees were always upbeat and smiling.
good,I left because they did not provide me with enough work hours to pay my bills and the inconsistent schedule made it difficult for me to get a second job.
good,"The hours given were from 10:30 to 6 or 7 depending on the work load, in between you would get a 30 min un-payed lunch break. The hours scheduled were 3 to maby 4 times a week, and only if you switch or cover for people will you scoop up on hours. Often however when I worked there the pay cut was short because we were not up to standards because of the backed up shipments and delayed containers filled with product."
good,Great job especially for college students or someone just starting out. Great environment the discounts are a plus too. I liked working there would definitely recommend
good,"I would arrive at work at 7:00 a.m. and start my day with doing the cash office.  Then my real day begins with managing the front end.  Overseeing breaks and lunches, provide excellent customer service, helping guests with returns and purchases.  Setting end caps, filling Bullseye, ensuring there were no outs at the front end.  Engaging with guests and team members."
good,"The title pretty much says it all. Great for young adults just out of college, but you work a lot of weekends/night hours and you're required to work upwards of 60 hours/week, 70 during the holidays. I wouldn't NOT recommend it, but I'm always wary telling people to try working at Target if they don't know what they're getting into. Compensation and benefits package is great, but not worth the hours in my opinion."
good,Great pay as a salaried manager. You will have no spare time though. There is always something more to do and you WILL work over the 50 hour a week minimum on a regular basis.
good,More laid back job with different people always coming and going so there’s always someone new to meet. Steady paced work with few down time to keep you busy.
good,Some weeks you get hours and other weeks you may get up to seven hours that week. Overall I think the management could use a little work but other than that it is a decent place to work.
good,"Target was never boring. It kept me on my toes and made me feel important. It was fun, but also very routine. The compensation didn’t necessarily match the work put in, however, with minimum wage you can’t expect much."
good,It can be stressful due to the lack of hours/team members there. The new driving sales culture can be frustrating at times but necessary. More hours need to be pumped into logistics.
good,"Very fast paced, must keep up with the pace. Dress code very lax, can wear jeans on saturday and sunday. Pay is good, $12.50 an hour. Hours very flexible"
good,"It is a pretty standard retail job. I worked as on the main electronics guys and I could say that we get paid no commission for selling phones or anything. we are told to inform guest on items and try to sell. we are given a daily goal to meet so the specific area can meet its goal. All it is a piece of paper with no added benefit. You get nothing from reaching that goal. The best I revived was a ""Good Job""."
good,Working with coworkers was great. Management for the most part not so much. The store manager was horrible but they fired him. It's good money and they love giving overtime. Loved interacting with the regular customers. The management role is a bit stressful.
good,"I worked there 11 years before they said I was not doing my job right. I worked on the sales floor, answered phones, was cross trained to work with pricing, sales floor, setting stuff, customer service. I once even helped out pharmacy out being a cashier."
good,"the best about working at target was the co-workers they taught me my role on the team and helped me at the workplace, and the management took care of its employees."
good,"When I started at Target It was my first job ever. I was young and out of high school going into college. I met a lot amazing people and learn about myself. I love working with people and I just love learning new things. I always, thought that the mangers needed to communicate with everyone more and go back to the team huddles."
good,"The only problem I had working for Target was the hour cuts in spring. they would cut all the employees hours to sometimes 15 hours a week. This made paying rent in those months extremely hard.  "
good,"Target was kind enough  to provide the employees with food for breaks and most coworkers were cooperative, but sometimes the management were not consistent in their regulations which often caused stressful situations."
good,"It was a positive work environment, although job advancement wasn't a priority to management. It wasn't a promising career choice. The evironment was very positive."
good,"Providing my schedule at the time, was not that flexible. Target was willing to accommodate me, while also being aware of my ambitions to play baseball professionally."
good,"Too much, political correctness, by the book...no room for common sense. Good salary.  If they don't like you, or want to work with you on your hours, they will cut your hours down to like 6 hours a week to force you out."
good,"Stock shelves, ring up guests, clean messes, price down items, set up sales, close down routine within  market. "
good,"When you first start working there its great. The other employees are really nice and its awesome because you will probably make a friend or two. However the managers will most likely have favorites. After a while you will start to realize how target is more of a high school setting, where if you are not kissing someones butt then you will be bullied. It was a great job at first but the favoritism in that place is just too much. I went from loving my job and giving it my all and even receiving employee of the month and being promoted to HR, to hating every minute of it."
good,Co-workers management maybe you knew or did not mean with speak and say hello if there was an issue with management as a team member I did not know that was not one of my burdens on my shift great work environment
good,Simply was not the place for me.  I did not care to advance and was not invested in the company.  Hours are usually scarce.  Management is nice enough.
good,"While the pay is fair and the day usually goes according to plan, when really needed management is unreliable at the least and aggravating at the worst. Not to say the job isn't worth applying to, if you stay vigilant and open-minded this job can teach you many skills that will be useful down the road."
good,Management was extremely by the book and had no social skills no one ever answered any questions I had. Just all around rough place to work for. The discounts are cool though
good,Target is a fast paced environment with day to day decision making a must.  The most enjoyable part is the people you work with and collaborating together for the common goal.  The least enjoyable part of the job is the long hours for salary management positions especially the logistics.  It makes it difficult to have worklife balance.
good,"I'm not sure if this is all target an I'm going to say its not but the store in foothill ranch is poorly run and it starts with the management, they hardly train and carry all the load on their employees. At the rancho store it was run a lot better."
good,"My job was backroom team member. Pretty repetitive job that didn't really require a lot of physicality. Overall, job was easy. Only issue was certain Team Leaders at my store didn't get along. This caused a lot of confusion sometimes because they would have conflicting ideas that would ultimately be unproductive."
good,Depends on what you like. But it could be a very toxic plce because management expectations are very unreachable. And most of the time inefficient. Although they do teach and give classes so you can learn it's get very tiring.
good,Once you are trained in an area the work becomes really easy and you always have time to finish your tasks. Management is very slow to act when it comes to common issues. It is a great job to have while being a college student. Flexible hours and Shift swaps are always an option.
good,"With my 4.5 years at target part time, morning stocker. New employs are always are always shaky because once they realize that working morning and fast paced on the line. They usually will have enough of it and quit a week or two. Its a struggle at first, no doubt. But once you get used to the hard labor and pushing boxes on the shelves all morning, you should be good to go. Build good relationships with your co workers, because in honesty theyll be your buds through thick and thin. Especially when it hits towards holiday months you will need back up on mountains of repacks. Also during holidays EXPECT to go in at 2am from the normal 4am shifts since they need to cram loads of repacks on the shelves before the store even opens! Its a face paced job your leaders will be trusting you to finish your task before you leave, it you dont itll be there the next day + the additional repacks from the trucks. Good luck!"
good,Although the employees here are great and it is a team environment the management here is terrible. They do not care about how much work you already have on your plate. They are lazy and throw their work on you and expect it to be done on time.
good,You aren’t extremely valued by the company but they pays decently well. The benefits also sucks but the job was a really fun one. The people you work woth make it all worth while in my opinion.
good,Having a good group of people to work with makes the biggest difference.   The team environment here is really good. I left this place for a position that offered more money. The can I help you environment makes it a friendly place for everyone.
good,Hardest part about this job - lack of training not enough one on one training that's hands on. Not training your trainers makes it hard to keep retention down. People get frustrated easily when they can't get answers to their questions.
good,A typical shift would include punching in and out on time. I learned how to give exceptional customer service and how to work well with team members. I also learned how to sell red cards to frequent shoppers. The hardest part of the job was being on my feet for long periods at a time. The workplace culture was very positive. Team members are social and friendly to all guests and associates. Also very willing and eager when it comes to going above and beyond with customers.
good,I choose not to write a summary as there are plenty of reviews on other sites like glassdoor that I fully support and agree with. I think every experience is different for every person.
good,"fast paced environment "
good,Not enough hours for life sustainability. Fast paced. Busy store. Management is good but it also depends on who they like better. Clients are great and have no major complaints about the way I am treated by them. Co-workers are fun to work with.
good,"I worked at target as a seasonal worker while I was in college and highly enjoyed my time there. A typical day at work involved helping customers and answering question about the mid to high level electronics that were offered in the store. Working in electronics provided me with exceptional customer service and direct sales experience. However, the eventual downfall of brick and mortar retail has lead me to look elsewhere."
good,Expectations of work is unrealistic for the hours I was given.  Manager was rarely seen on the sales floor and wasn't supportive of what the team needed.
good,"The jobs at the Distribution center are very Physical.  You will be exhausted and mentally drained.  The management pushes you hard to get to productivity, or rate, they say safety is their number one priority  but its basically productivity!  The pay is fantastic but thats basically because the bar is set so high that very few can perform the tasks and make rate consistently."
good,I gained a lot of knowledge and experience while working for Target. Id recommend working here only for people who are trying to get experience for other jobs.
good,The task they give you are not that demanding. most task as a team member is just to zone aisle and reshop and help customers. Working there is really easy as long as you do not mind walking your whole 8 hour plus shift.
good,"During the time I needed to relocate to Hemet, I was lucky to pick up the cashier job at target. They loved how fast I caught on and valued me. They were sad to see me go, but when the job opened up At lake Elsinore, I couldn't pass it up."
good,"Adhered to all safety procedures and company standards and policies."
good,"Good place to learn basic cashier, guest service, food service ect. Experiences. They train you on everything and are pretty flexible with school and time off."
good,This company is a very good place to work for if you have a good team of managers. Plus certain stores are changing their looks in order to keep up with a changing market
good,"Great place to work, friendly environment, management is usually good with anything you need from hours or just to talk about life outside of work. Amazing place to work great prices & employees there are always asking if you need anything all the time."
good,hours that were were reasonable until you need time off such as emergencies hey would question a lot. Work is only great during the holidays and a lot inventory.
good,"relaxed environment.  I work inside and out as a cart attendant.  I am also cross trained in other areas such as cashier, sales floor, guest service, and electronics."
good,Poor manager team . They kept people they knew and didn't keep the others.Lack of teamwork .Had there favorite one 's which was unfair.Nothing else to say .
good,"I personally worked in softlines (clothing) department. It was fun work as I did visual merchandising; however, I had a mixed bag of bosses. Some had realistic work expectations within a specific time frame, others did not, and would act unprofessional when goals were not met."
good,Target is a good place to work if you are not planning on moving up. One of the biggest downfalls working for Target! They never promote within. High Turnover for managers as well.
good,Do the job everyday no matter what it is. Different functions everyday multiple tasks. Be ready for anything at any moment............................
good,"Pulling items from the back and putting them on the shelves. If products weren't needed on the floor, then I would bring them back to the stock room and organize them."
good,"It was a decent seasonal job that I could come back to when I was out of school for the season. The staff was helpful and work was straightforward. Everyone was held to a standard to keep the store on task, and everyone followed it with little problem."
good,"There is a lot of drama with coworkers. I don't believe things were fair for certain coworkers. If you addressed something to HR, I don't believe that they took care of it because it would continue. I sometimes think they just didn't care."
good,"Overall, my experience at Target has been okay, but there has been too many stressful and frustrating things that have happened for me to actively recommend it to my peers. Team Members are not trained thoroughly. Team Leaders are also not trained thoroughly. Management is a mess. "
good,"no comuncation, everybody does everybody work but the ETL's"
good,"I really liked the company culture, but from what I have heard it has changed quite a bit since the new CEO took over. People are very collaborative, but it can take a while to move something forward."
good,As long as you put in the work people and managers will work with you. Definitely need a positive personality and patience when dealing with guests and their needs
good,Overall not a bad place to work however Target is very fast paced and leaves little room for error.  Store teams are different per Store Manager and all store employees are not part time so they do not have to pay for benefits.
good,"the company is decent but they promote within, who they want to promote, they don't give fair opportunities. They play favorites and it is not fair at all"
good,Lots to get done on a daily basis but sometimes with far too few resources.  Problem team members not dealt with in timely manner leads to toxic environment for many others.
good,"Target staff is very family oriented. You become a whole group when you work there for be in a sub group, which is not bad because you're never alone."
good,"I love what I do, but the management needs to improve. The managers need to understand how each department works before trying to run them. They can be friendly, but unreasonable at times."
good,"Productive and enjoyable work environment, team players, schedule flexibility to have appointments or attend college. On a typical day I would open the Food Service cafe, prepare foods, proof pizza dough, pop corn, clean/wash dishes as necessary.  I worked there 4 years.  When I transferred to cashier/customer I would work on a check lane, assisting customers with sales, questions about product availability, and bagging.  I performed these duties 6 years. Management was open door policy for any concerns.  The hardest part was the rare customer with anger and criticism, but in each incident you had the ability and training to handle it with discretion and tact.  The most enjoyable part was my faithful customers who always took my lane because they liked my service, friendly attitude and careful bagging."
good,"It is definitely a good place if you're looking for something part time to either add to your income or as your first job. The hours were not good for the most part, with the occasional 35 hour weeks for employees who were good at the job, at least on the flow team. It's really simple, just unload the truck and stock the shelves, assisting guests in the store when necessary but you have to go into it understanding you are probably only going to get 20-25 hours to start. Management was decent enough to pass, with the occasional hiccups in decision making."
good,"a typical day at work started out with me punching in and beginning to work. I would most of the time either be outside bringing in carts or working on the cash register. I learned how to use a cash register and the various electronic devices. Management was very kind but would sometimes ask me to do extremely difficult task. workplace culture was amazing, my fellow team members were wonderful and made the place relaxing at times. hardest part of the job was the stress, since I moved a lot while working I was always busy. I also was one of the best employees so management would give me more tasks sometimes I felt I was overworked. most enjoyable part was my co-workers who I had fun being around"
good,"The work was never beyond what you could handle. Most employees were friendly. If you were older as an employee and wanted to advance with the company, you could forget about it, regardless of past experience. They solely looked to college aged employees for advancement which was unfair in my opinion. Had no problem hiring older employees but never offered opportunities to them."
good,If you want to gain customer service experience then this is the place! The managers were okay but its more of the 'leads' that got to be more of the problem. The disrespect from few but not enough to be to much of a problem. I learned a lot of customer service and retail as well as marketing strategy
good,"The work environment wasn't consistent from store to store. The customer experience wasn't consistent from employee to employee. A lot of ""warm-body"" syndrome. Management was never consistent, you either got an amazing boss or one that should have been demoted or placed somewhere else months ago. I loved coming to work until the inconsistencies happened. Allowing the morale of a place to drop because you need someone to fill a position is never a solid move. The operations were very different from one place to the next. They were revisiting methods that weren't successful in the past. It just didn't make sense to me. I am all for trial and error and adaptation...But it seemed like the same mistakes were being made over and over again."
good,"I agreed to 20 hours per week or less when I began working, because I had a full course load at the University of Minnesota, but each week my manager would schedule me for close to 30 hours. It became too stressful to balance work, school, and life so I had to quit."
good,The best thing about this job is that it is very flexible.  It is great for college kids and those on a restricted schedule.  I have learned that pleasing the guest is the number one goal.  Management pushes this as a top priority.  The hardest part of retail is working holidays.  The most enjoyable part is working with great team members.
good,Sadly I was at a store with really bad management. The LODs there were horrible and would purposely schedule you for days you could not work then get upset and give you less hours if you ever said anything about it. At first it was really fun but then it turned into the worst job ever!
good,"As a first job it was fun to learn what goes into an average work day. There was always something new to do each day. Whether it be stocking the shelves, helping out ""guests""  or working the register. I never knew what I would be doing that day until I clocked in."
good,"The randomness of hours per week and the lack of seniority to some extent makes target a very stressful place to work at times, since you never know what your next paycheck will look like."
good,"At the location i worked at, something bad seemed to happen almost every single day. Whether it be theft, severe weather, tons of call-outs, or whatever... something happened. Management doesn't really care about members' schedules, you have to stand for the entire time you're working no matter what, getting scheduled time off is nearly impossible, etc. Though, if you're a young adult wanting to get money and have all the free time in the world, this is a good place to work at if you want to learn all aspects of retail and/or want to advance in it."
good,"Typical day for me for me was to take care of customers. Setting sales planners for the week, setting pogs (plan o grams), are you sure department is freshly stocked Zone clean best part of my day going home."
good,Nice place to work but environment needs improvement. Management could use a lot of improvement. Could use more paid time off. Could reconstruct work schedules to better fit the needs of all employees
good,"Target and Stop n Shop are retail stores which are pretty flexible with scheduling around your individual needs.  Stop n Shop is a grocery store which is part of a union so you get minimum of 15 hrs/week, however depending on the position may or may not lead into full time.  Target is a department store for a great energetic team member. Advancement opportunities and competitive pay."
good,It was a great place to work with great benefits and good pay. I enjoyed the training provided for the job and the amount of team work provided was great too.
good,"great days for someone who is afraid to work on the weekends or has school. the job is a good if you have had prior experience, the breaks are short but work by fast"
good,"target was/is a good place to work some people that work there are helpful and friendly a lot of the other people need to work on there people skills. it was kind of always a lot to do never perfectly in order but overall pay was good and u get decent hours, atleast for me"
good,"Helpful leaders when teaching you what to do making sure you get it, everyone is usually nice there, and the atmosphere is welcoming. Downside is poor management."
good,It was great in the beginning after a while it was a lot of cut throat when Certain managers left for a different job a lot of people quit because it became too stressful
good,"You clock in and get orders from an TL, who got their orders from an ETL, who got their orders from the GM, who gets their orders from corporate and the overall truth is that your doing the work for the person above you so they can report that they did it and you never get praised for your efforts. The GM congrats the ETL's who eventually say good job to the TL but the regular team member just gets more orders. ETL's basically call the shots and hangout either in their office, the main office or just somewhere in the store. but its not all bad. If your good at kissing A or sucking up find your self an ETL or TL and they will make sure to bring you up with them. if your in it just for the money make sure to stay out of the TL or ETL's way or they will group text about you and work on getting you written up enough to fire you ^_^"
good,"Fast paced and productive. Production varied day by day, had timelines you had to meet when pulling in the backroom. Pay could have been more competitive, insurance was decent."
good,Not everyone is treated equally. Management plays favorites regardless if two people have similar work ethic. Easy to get it but not many associates enjoy working there.
good,with the hours where higher or i would still be their. loved the job and helping people out but couldnt deal with the lack of money coming in. the pay was nice too
good,I've worked a lot of retail and Target holds the highest demands on customer service and tricks with clothes. Folding and stockimg wise. Great for people skill learning.
good,"The management at my particular store was very lazy and lacked communication skills. Other than that, Target is great to work for and has great pay and benefits."
good,The staff teaches you what you need to do. Even if you were not hired as a cashier more than likely you will be made to be in the register at some point of your shift.
good,"The job is fine, hours aren't to great. Never to crazy packed. The managers overall are nice as well as the fellow employees. I learned how to print signs and talk to people more confidently."
good,Checking out customers at the front desk and cash registers.  I learned to be humble and patient when dealing with customers.  The working culture was friendly and the hardest part of the job was dealing with unruly customers.  The most enjoyable part was being able to meet different people and cultures and interacting with customers more about their experience at the store.
good,"Target has been on a consistent downhill trajectory as a place to work for years.  It's always about cutting hours with unrealistic expectations for how the store should look with so few people working.  They don't innovate anymore, they are on a race to the bottom."
good,Overall working for target has been a good experience.  I'm just the type of employee that needs to be challenged and is passionate about my growth and development.  my impression so far of Target is that there is no coaching conversations or growth and development conversations at all within any department. I'm not sure if target just doesn't promote internally or it's just my store.
good,"I worked at Target for nearly two years. The flow team was a very close-knit group, always looking out for each other. One of the biggest problems we had to face was a constantly changing order of the sections of the sales floor we worked in on a morning's shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was the rapport I made with my colleagues. I would have stayed if I hadn't needed to finish school."
good,"Open mined"
good,"I personally feel its a great job for someone to get started in the working world such as high school or college student ,pay was not as good and forget about overtime"
good,Fairly boring. Customer flow is a lot slower compared to a fast food place. Very big place so you hardly know anymore except from your own area and the mangers are very hard to get to.
good,"Target expects a lot from each employee, however this company also provides a good place to learn new skills.The most enjoyable part of this job are the people you work with. The hardest part of this job was having shifts all over the place as well as not getting paid for what is expected of you. I have learned a lot from this job. For instance, I learned how to be efficient in guest service, how to answer and delegate phone calls, as well as lead a group of people. Target can be a great learning experience, but with expectations rising without the pay increasing this company has lost being enjoyable."
good,"Working at Target was enjoyable at times because of the other team members, and the job duties were easy to complete. The downside to my time at Target was the management: they were not friendly, very pushy with unrealistic expectations, and poor business strategies."
good,"Working with Target is a good stepping stone, whether it be for students or first time workers, but at times, due to management, it can be stressful or overloading at times. Tasks you complete, for the most part, don't go unnoticed, but you can feel underappreciated whenever you do more than what is required. Good hours, good and reputable workplace."
good,"I worked soft-lines in Target (the clothing department).  It was tedious and demoralizing to completely zone an area and then have guests trash it in a matter of minutes.  Some of the people there were great and I made a few friends.  But for the most part, people were not motivated to move up to management or do a good job on their work.  In this job, you're required to interact with lots of guests, which is great if you're an extrovert.  Also, nothing ever seemed to be good enough for management."
good,"I asked them to change my availability because of a situation with my daughter, the manager told me that he wasn't going to grant it & to figure it out. He also said it wouldn't be fair to have the other team members in my department to close, but I had been closing every single day for the first 2 months of me working there."
good,"(start of 2018) there are a lot of great things about working for Target. They have a bunch of different small things going on in the back office to keep morale up. They will provide food or fun activities for employees while on break. The biggest issue facing target are lack of work hours and management. Every part time employee is only given 2 days to work a week. Everything is very unorganized as well. At the end of the day when closing up, employees are told to fill spaces with similarly priced items to fill the gaps on the shelves. In doing this, customers and the employees assisting them have a hard time locating the desired merchandise."
good,"The best way to describe this workplace is placing a group of people on an island with a predetermined leader and a set of tools they would  use to survive.  At first it works out, but then the corporation takes those tools away one by one simply because they can.  Each store could be a great place to work, but corporate will fail you time and time again.  The leadership in the store often times gets recycled as quickly as the team members, placing recent grads that dont know how the store should be run in charge and moving the experienced leaders someplace else.  All training you recieve is done by your peers at their disgression, since management will throw you in your position after summarizing the basics that they know of.  As a backroom team member I have seen many new associates told to start the workload when they didnt even know how to log into the devices let alone know what to do with them.  Because of a neverending series of payroll cuts, the stores are almost always understaffed.  This is what I would consider to be the worst aspect of the job since it limits what work can be done every day and since call-offs are common that leads to even more work left for you.  If you do decide to work here, to make the most of the place you should be open to ask questions whenever you are doing something new and listen to the advice given by others.  You will need to think on your feet to determine how you plan to complete your priority tasks in a timely fashion and figure out how to make your area presentable regardless of the amount of workload that is left.  Then, as you build"
good,"Target is a great place if you enjoy home decor, or even looking for clothes. They have such great fashion over at target! They strongly Focus on the red card. they Have alot of positive vibes there too."
good,Management could be improved. The breaks are nice there not too short. The hardest part was the limited amount of time they gave for certain job titles and projects.
good,"Good, encouraging environment. Team leads normally are the best form of management at the store. The executives fail to get to know the team members at any level and flaunt their power when work doesn’t get done.  One failed guest experience and promotion is no longer an option for you."
good,Target was a great learning environment where I developed great customer service skills. Working the flow team required early morning shifts which taught me a lot of discipline. I also learned how logistics are run.
good,The people you work with is what makes it worth it. Learning as much as what a Team Leader does on a regular basis was also exciting to learn but to be told by management that you are moving up soon and almost a year and a half later no change has happened is unacceptable. Reasons as to why leaving was a must.
good,"A typical day at Target can be described as a chill, hard working, comfortable working environment. Every one comes ready, with their mind set on what they have planned on working on for the day. It was quiet at times, mostly calm, except for holidays like Black Friday or Christmas Eve. In these past couple months, I learned how to zone aisles, how to take my work more seriously, and how to gain more confidence in myself. I learned how to keep my focus more on my job rather than making friends. At work, you cannot be too nice to people. Focus on getting the job done first, then you can have your free time when it comes. ""Work now, play later."" I would say the hardest part about my job was getting things done at one time, also known as multitasking. I also learned how to multitask with this job being that it was so many different things that had to get done in a limited amount of time."
good,The supervisors for the most part were very kind and courteous but some of the store leads were uncommunicative and forgetful. Without and real room for advancement there is no point in staying for a long time.
good,"Like any retail job, Target can be very fast paced and busy but it is easier when working alongside good team members. I learned to work well with others and complete tasks in a timely fashion. The management is not the best I've experienced but it's also not the worst. The hardest part of the job is juggling daily tasks with helping out guests on the salesfloor. My favorite part of  the job is the people I get to work with every day. The workplace culture is very inclusive which I love."
good,"Target has some good ideas about job culture but this changes from store to store. While they don't admit to favoritism, it strongly influences job advancement in some stores. Some times takes to much in pushing numbers than being supportive of hard workers."
good,"As a college student, the $11 hourly pay is what drew me to this position. I started off as a seasonal cashier and was soon cross-trained for guest service, flexible fulfillment, and self checkout. "
good,"Working for Target is wonderful while you are school since Target prioritize school first. Typical day at Target is not busy, laid back but you get to interact with guest on a personal level. Manage is fairly easy to progress in."
good,"Target is doing a large overhaul of how it runs. Which is great news! Lots of remodels, new brands, and how team members are taught to interact with guests. This company will not go away any time soon."
good,The workers at target were great. It was the managers who shoved the red card memberships down your throat. If it wasn’t for the constant pressure of MAKING customers apply for a credit card it wouldn’t be so bad to work.
good,"management like any other place varies. could be good, could be bad. this job is an ideal for a college student, or someone who needs time to spare. i wouldn't recommend this as a career. just a 'for now' job."
good,"For the wages you are being payed, you work your butt off and they will work you like a slave. They will try and get you to shorten your lunch to help with trivial stuff they are too lazy to do."
good,"Target has its good and bad moments, the people are nice the job is fairly simple, the only issue is the lack of hours. the lack of hours hurt. and would be difficult for somebody trying to pay their bills with just this target check"
good,"Tough to really put a forced review, since it's been 10 years since I've worked there, so my experience is probably much different than what you would expierence today"
good,"It was, for the most part, a good starting job. The leaders are very unaware of what their employees are up to, so they may assume negatively. Some possibly view themselves a little too high in their position, but the coworkers are very friendly."
good,cuts hours just as soon as they start to go up. mornings are better considering you are with a team. closing shifts are more demanding and you are by yourself with multiple responsibilities.
good,Worked overnight on the remodeling team. Worked in small groups to take down and reset aisles and merchandise. Co-workers were chill and for the most part did what was required of them
good,I enjoyed the time I worked in the produce section with my sales team members. The day consisted of reviewing the list of duties for the day and executing them on a time fashion. The hardest part of the job was time management of duties to accomplish before the end of the shift.
good,Target had its ways of drawing people into a very comfortable setting. Customer service is great depending on which person you interact with. But overall I like it. I just need more hours to continue to see a decent pay check and steady paycheck
good,"Target was a very hard company to work for with management that seemed very under qualified and like they were on, for lack of a better term, a bit of a power trip. I did however enjoy work in certain departments and helping out my customers when they were around. The fitting rooms were fun to maintain and so was the shoe section :)"
good,"Enjoy co-workers; management not so much. Flexible schedule when you start, but kind of difficult to change it. Management can have there favorites at times also."
good,"Target is a very nice first ""real"" job to have as it teaches you how to interact with different personalities and teaches you the basic functions of a business.  The people I met during my two year run at Target were nothing short of amazing and I would recommend this job for someone in high school or college."
good,You can't expect much from a job at target. I was a cashier and the work is boring and tedious. The customers are sometimes nice and that helps a boring thing become a little less dreadful.
good,"Very fast paced and must be good at multitasking. Managers are usually helpful but no true benefits and given less hours if availability changes, scheduled against availability many times as well."
good,long day and a lot of things to do a lot of customers. helping customers. Ringing up customers and helping them find items. Folding all the clothes and putting them back.
good,they are willing to work with the hours you are available and after your 90 days they will give you time off when needed. flexible hours and decent pay.
good,"Very easy place to work. Friendly guest and co workers, just your usual retail store with great satisfaction. Will cut hours sometimes though. Enjoyed being there"
good,"Target as a whole does a lot of things right, the pay is decent, the benefits are decent, and the overall spirit is decent. However the atmosphere changes dependent on which store you work at. a store with less money flowing through it suffers from the stress of never having enough hours for its Team Members and constant catch up work while higher dollar stores suffer from a sort of high-school feel where its a he said she said scenario almost every day. This fused with poor judgment of character and my favorite ""you have a degree in history here's a store manager position"" can cause a lot of problems for the lower end and even the higher end team members. Overall I don't think Target as a company is that bad to work for but some stores suffer because of the people."
good,Great place to work.  Work is challenging but rewarding.  Learn a lot about big box retail functions.  Hours are not to bad for retail but must work weekends.
good,"Very busy location, not quite equipped to meet the demands of a growing store. Typically scheduled a single team member to manage Guest Services store area (the area demands 2-3 team members), therefore requiring exceptionally fast paced work. "
good,The job itself was pretty good. The problem was we never had stock for sale items because there was always trouble getting through customs. They should have only opened a couple stores to test out the market. Canada clearly did not want Target and the way Target operates probably would never work here.
good,"Target is a great entry point into the work-force. It doesn't pay much, but lays the groundwork for retail employees to learn checkout procedures, on the floor interactions with consumers, how to handle difficult situations, and team work!"
good,"Target is not a career, ment for people who go to school or want some extra cash. Hours are up to 40 per week only during holiday time, sales floor is the first to get cut hours, fast pace and fun to work. plus the discounts are not bad."
good,"I worked for this company for many years in various leadership roles and capacities. The company has changed and will continue to change in  order to stay relevant in the retail space. Be prepared to work long hours and at a fast paced. If you like to sit down do not apply! If you like leading large teams and driving thousands in daily sales, go for it!"
good,"It was a pretty easy job, all I did was help customers, stock shelves, and help other departments as needed. Management wasn't bad, they were understanding which was nice."
good,The team members are great. The upper management has no communication and lacks process knowledge. District and group leaders are never on the same page.
good,I loved the people I work with at the job and everyone is very friendly and Target knows how to take care of its employees. I work in the clothing department and I have fun doing what I do. I look forward to going to work everyday.
good,It was okay work environment it was fast paced I liked the dealing with people that was the most important part to me it was fun working with people all the time
good,The customers are very polite and have manners. Its a clean and comfortable environment to work. The best part of working here is organizing and business
good,"Typical electric work. Hours varied from week to week according to the progress of other trades. Good people, but have to live four to an apartment if you travel with them."
good,I was a cashier so the hardest part of my job was making sure i was quick with scanning all the customer merchandise. I can say cashier is probably the hardest job in target stores.
good,I was hired as a PM and outsourced 3 months later with overseas staff.  The culture is fast-paced and they are willing to train.  But they change priorities often.
good,Very stressful you have to work at a certain percent per hour which is around 400 boxes per hour and the hours are no less than 12 hours at the warehouse
good,You learn a lot of labor skills here. You also learn how to work with people that are very different from you. You learn how to work in teams and problem solve with people who have different perspectives. Nice entry level position.
good,"most of the time can't expect full-time hours unless you've been there long, you have to up sell their red card extremely if you are a cashier- your job pretty much depends on it. You do get a week vacation after a year. They're pretty flexible with scheduling if you're in school."
good,Target provided a good paying job with excellent benefits. It was a face paced environment. The best part of the job was the team. The work life balance was a challenge.
good,It was an okay place to work to an extend in my opinion. It didn't work the best for a single mother as myself do to scheduling. The hardest thing working there I would say is not to be reconized when you go above and beyound to do your job as well as help others with theirs.
good,Target was a good company.  It is a company that is run well and cares about empoyees.  Customer satisfaction is very important.  Felt like I could go to management about problems without hesitation.
good,Being 4 o clock in the morning everyone till sleepy. So to lighten the tension just give space the joke later. That way everyone can get adjusted to the shipment then have fun.
good,"working as a presentation team member is a faced paced job you go in early usually at 4 am, you are expected to do more than what you are paid, management varies by person they could either be very mean or really nice, if you are looking for a job to support yourself I do not recommend but they are flexable with your schedule"
good,"Ce travail m'a appris beaucoup de chose par exemple, comment monter l'intérieur d'un magasin tels que les comptoires et les étagèeres. Par la suite, l'environnement étais agréable autant chez les employées que les gérants."
good,I started as a team member for the presentation team. a year after I got promoted and took over the team. my team works overnights and our week starts on Sundays. the beginning of the week I always plan out our workload. I get everything prepared so my team is good to go when they clock in. I look at our workload that is a month in advance so I can check if I have to order fixtures that we don't have and get it on time for the set. I write my team schedule every Thursday and making sure that everyone gets a fair amount of hours.  I am constantly communication to our head quarters in MN if there are any problems with the set. I tend to fix the problems myself sometimes if its not too complicated or confusing. I make sure all the work is a 100% done before my team leaves and make sure I audit all their work.
good,I really enjoyed this job. It was a very fun working environment. The management was very good and caring. Hours of work were very flexible. This started out as a seasonal job.
good,"GSA position at Target was very fun but also very stressful. You do almost the exact same work as a team lead for significantly less money. "
good,"It's a fun job, but can get stressful at times. Some customers are very demanding and can make the job stressful, but you meet people that make the job fun and the pay is good."
good,"The staff is friendly, very flexible for students. They are given the opportunity for LOA , which still leaves them with a job once returned for school."
good,I worked very hard for this company and got along   with everyone . always willing to help others. I did learn about how to be a strong leader with this company.
good,"The management is horrible and they are not willing to work with you because there is ""nothing"" they can do. They ask for tasks to be completed at an unreasonable time."
good,I liked working at target but the scheduling was the worse part about the job. The peoplehat worked there where nice. Everybody worked well with each other.
good,"Used to be a great, fun place to work, as new management has came in it has become very micromanaged and feels like a dictatorship. Aside from management, the work itself is not too hard. work at least one day of every weekend and the only holiday they are closed is Christmas Day."
good,"I worked overnight, i mostly was stocking. While stocking, you wee allowed to listen to music from you electronic device and work alone or in a group."
good,"If you are looking for a great first job, this is for you. Lots to learn and many ways to advance based on performance. The expectations are always changing which can be stressful at times, but they are great business decisions."
good,"As far as first jobs go, I would strongly recommend Target. That's it though, entry level jobs are supposed to be temporary. In the back room, it is just mind numbing work with no real goal or feeling of accomplishment. Just clock out and get ready to do it all over again the next time."
good,it was a great company ; it only focus on management; if you was not management please donot look for end of the bonuses/ the management is the only ones to really make the money in the store. Lets not forget everyone part time but management no matter how many hours you work a week
good,It was fun to work with a wide variety of age groups.  I learned a lot from dealing with the public in a very customer service driven setting.  The hours were terrible which is why I left.
good,"Typical day of work was doing reshop,  straightening and keeping a clean work area. I learned how to be a good instructor and leader. Management was always changing but I learned to adapt. I loved guest service and helping customers , explaining how certain products worked. I trained new employees and volunteered a lot and represented Target outside of work hours."
good,Nice place to work good people around I keep a smile on my face at all time the management was perfect I had to relocate only reason I'm gone would go back if I could
good,"Its alright, its just not for me. Too slow paced and i dont make enough. They are very flexible with your hours, and the co workers are super friendly."
good,"For the most part the job is okay but the lack of hours given was a huge downfall, the culture is great everyone is friendly and reliable the only problem is the hours."
good,"I enjoyed working at target I just didn't like the night shift I was stuck on being that I had children in elementary school, became stressful to them and me."
good,"Target was a great place to work for someone who is willing to work and work as a team. They are incredibly team oriented and driven by people willing to work hard. They recognize hard work but really crack down on short comings. You need to keep up or ask for help. The management of Target can be disorganized though and it has caused some issues for team members. If you are flexible or looking for a team that will work with your hours, I would recommend that you try Target."
good,It was very organized but have many things that need to be fixed such as hours & pay rate and everyone should be treated equally other then that is a good company
good,Average work experience. Flexible hours. Paid well but not much advancement in the company. Good job for starting out. Would recommend depending on what position would be filled.
good,"Typical work day could vary between closing or opening the store based off the Leader on Duty schedule so sometimes hard to balance work life balance especially since you worked every other weekend."
good,Typical night involved unloading a truck and palletizing items based on department labels. The next step was running the pallets to their various departments on the sales floor and stocking shelves based on location markings on the product.
good,"No communication between managers, high expectations with minimal help/time to get jobs done, bad hours, Leadership doesn't do anything to help people lower than them"
good,"Ultimately depends on the person and what they seek in a job. My experiences ranged from good and bad and was brought upon by a number of different circumstances but the job culture itself brought upon a relaxed and enjoyable environment. I learned meaning things regarding the retail business as well as different communication techniques from marketing, business, and advertising. Hardest part had to be either the pace of the environment, depending on the day or the difficulty of learning a completely new task and being immersed into a situation where you had to learn as you go by trial and error."
good,"Learned how to handle stress and. Hardest part of the job is dealing with rudeness. Best part of the job is the volunteering aspect. We do a great deal for the community and each other,"
good,"Great workplace. Fellow team members make the hard work, easy. Flexible schedule and flexible work areas. Able to work in multiple locations within the store."
good,Nice place to work but you need to watch out as they will put someone else in your place in a heartbeat and will not even tell you and then  not understand why you are angry.
good,"Target is a good place to work at as a first job, however, I would not recomment staying there for more than a year, 2 years max. Some employees get treated  unfairly, especially when it comes to illness. My favorite part of the job was making friends with the coworkers and the occacional funny guyes that came through my lane at the register."
good,"Typical day at work is like any other retail job, fairly descent.I learned good work ethics. Management is okay not very understanding they say they are but really arnt."
good,"Scan and pack merchandise, very fast paced in order to get your production numbers for the day. It use to be a good place to work, not so much anymore. They are only concerned with numbers, not so much about quality anymore. Pay is good, the breaks are way too short for a long workday. Good benefits and most of the managers are good. They do not want to promote from within."
good,The atmosphere was relaxing.  Nice customers. However due to low staffed many of the workers were over worked. There are barely any hours to give. No one ever on register or barely.
good,Target was a great first job. It taught you to work in a team and how to fine tune your customer service skills. The management shifted frequently as they received their own promotions and moved to new stores which always would cause cycles.
good,"The work environment can be relaxed or fast paced depending on the time of day and time of week, they cross train so if you're looking for more opportunities this is a good places to start they can catch you up in the yearly pay increases and they usually pay a dollar above minimum wage but i would only suggest this to a college student or teenager fresh out of college not really a living wage."
good,low pay raise. it take a long time to get a good enough pay raise each year. for the employees that work there for a long time. for all the work that you have to do.
good,Would love to work for you again.its a great company to work for great management .Just love everything about target Always had a good day it was always something to do and i loved that the most
good,Very stressful work environment. Constant pressure from upper management to reach unrealistic goals in a short amount of time. Created unfavorable work environment.
good,"Its hard to get hours. They'll promise 20 hours a week and only give you 5. The pay is pretty decent for what it is if you can get the hours, but I've been doing things above and beyond my job description and haven't been getting paid the wage for it. They should have the TLs do the scheduling and then have the ETLs and STL approve it."
good,I liked working there. Learned  a lot about customer service and to deal with customers. Learned how to do returns and and the management was a awesome team.
good,it can be difficult at times but otherwise really fun to work for. people are fun to work with. everyone likes to have fun and enjoy themselves. there is no pressure to make everyone happy
good,"surprising Target overpays you with the easy to do task they require like other companies, but of course one is not going to complain about this. Management is horrible. They hire fresh out of junior semester interns that have no idea what they are doing, but act like they do. Internal growth does not exist unless, well you know, unless you have that brown nose they are looking for. The culture is horrible as well. People complain everyday about everything and about everyone. I know, this happens everywhere, but not as much as this place. Only reason why I am here is because of the pay and discount."
good,"My managers, coworkers, fellow supervisor were amazing gave me a great first job, but the hours are very minimal for a part-time. Yet very flexible with my school hours."
good,The typical day working as a flow team member at Target corp. was very fast paced and goal driven. Your team had a certain amount of hours to meet a certain objective.
good,"Good work life balance, Nice growth opportunities, great benefits, Challenging work Easy access to leaderhip, allows creative and out of the box thinking"
good,"The time it was fun is when the assistant manager was there and the higher manager wasnt at work, he didn't make us do things over that were literally already done just not the way he liked it, he micro managed all of us even if we did the right thing he found something to complain about. but other then that i had a great time working as a team and with my amazing coworkers."
good,every workplace has it drama and issues but if you focus on the work and do you job it will a breeze. very easy positions to work and for the most part a friendly work place.
good,"The only reason I needed to leave this position was due to finishing school. They originally stated they admire their employees getting a higher education. Also stated they have an open door policy, when push came to shove and my school schedule for the my last full semester before graduating did not allow to work with the work schedule they forced me to make an ultimatum. I chose my schooling, and when I tried to reapply for a position I was not given the chance due to ""leaving them for furthering my education""."
good,"Sometimes in the best interest of humanity, we make decisions with a golden heart. In reality, a golden heart doesn't pump blood to make sure that the entire system gets what it needs to sustain life."
good,"Working at target came with personal advantages for myself. When my lunch break would arrive, I had no problems looking for what to eat. Besides the fact that this location was at a mall, there were plenty of food places to choose from. Im a guy who's into movies so I would also get the chance to browse around the DVD section once off the clock."
good,"- Typical day, I show up receive the products I am suppose to restock on the sales floor as well as maintain any displays on the floor, and assist any guests with any sales questions. "
good,"Its like working for any other retail store. "
good,The management was horrible and it felt like they did not care about their employees. The coworkers made the daily tasks fun and felt like a family. The store is great to be in.
good,I worked at target for a year and loved the job itself but my family had some stuff going on and i had to take time off of work and my managers were very rude about it.
good,"Worked there for about 2 years, I was looking to get cross-trained for a bunch of other departments to pick up some more hours, but they never cared to do so."
good,"The job is pretty simple, but one of the leaders is quite intimidating and I feel that my coworkers aren't very inviting or inclusive, as I am still new to working there."
good,"This job taught how to operate warehouse machinery use personal accessory data machines. The management allowed us to work in our own space as well as work together, which made the job fun."
good,"At first I thought I'd love working at Target but I soon came to find out that I'd be exhausted from work on a daily basis and I'd keep going back to get more exhausted every day. I feel like I work way more than I should in a normal 40 hour work week. Due to lack of payroll, it gets way busier and way more stressful than it should be at work and I end up being spoken to about getting lines shorter. The workplace culture is nice, because everyone is really nice at Target. The management overall is awesome and very understanding and accommodating. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my team."
good,I enjoyed the environment and the people I worked with while at Target. Excellent focus on a team getting the job done while balancing the need for excellent quality of customer care.
good,"Management was fair and decent to their employees, willing to cross train employees to help avoid staleness within one retail position. Employees were treated with respect and rewarded when they went above and beyond the call of duty. Fun and healthy atmosphere with room for advancement within the company."
good,"i worked at target in the mall at crossroads in st cloud mn. work there was alright, nothing special. customers behaved and management was a little cooky but serviceable."
good,It was a decent transition job. I had fun. I learned pacie4nce working there. Would definitely recommend it for college students. It was decent pay also.
good,Being the Cart Attendant is a strenuous job. You know this going in by reading the job description but there's a-lot to it. You're out in the hot and cold and you never know what to expect. It's great if you like being physical and moving but it gets really frustrating when you always get pulled aside for assistance and the carts suffer because of it.
good,I worked there for 7 years part time. I worked my way through college and high school. I appreciate the fact that they worked so well around my school schedule for so many years.
good,"Typical day includes lots of running of around and having to balance MANY tasks at once. You learn so much and they provide you so many valuable skills for any job. Management is good just make sure you're okay with having people be on your back and being rushed with multiple tasks at once, very fast paced. Culture is amazing, great caring people just trying to make Target excel in every aspect possible. Hardest part of adapting to so many tasks at once expected to be completed in 4 hour shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job is your coworkers, everyone understands everyone and there is always someone willing to listen."
good,"Everyday is the same same routine. Need to work at a fast paste and give your all. I'm a Backroom Team Member and it does have its pros and cons. Though what I learned working with Target is that we are all cultured. Get along fairly well. Management is nice. Nice attitude, friendly to talk too. But the hardest part of the job is giving you all, your 100% everyday then to be asked to move faster and faster. To work less hours and make it seem your working full time. Hours being cut when people that want to work are being told to go home early or not enough hours. Though the most enjoyable part is the people you work with. Friendly and nice."
good,A typical day at target being a cashier was to give great customer service to guest. I learned to be very observant and to handle money in a effective way
good,"A typical day consisted of standing at a cash register for 8 hours with a lot of down time. "
good,Working at Target was challenging as the hours provided to me was limited. I overall enjoyed the atmosphere and my co-workers. I answered phones and assisted customers in the stores. I wish I was able to work more and advance with the company.
good,"Besides the lack of hours. Most of the people working there was very nice. Not much for advancement. I asked on many many occasions to be trained in other departments which was promised during orientation,  but was always turned down even though I was consistently told I did excellent work."
good,"I am beyond thankful for being accepted to this job opportunity but it doesn't match what I am looking for, not as flexible and understanding as they claim to be."
good,"Very diverse environment to work in with a lot of tasks to keep busy, friendly co-workers, great management, clean building, reasonable scheduling, would recommend to anyone in the area."
good,"I've worked at two different Target's, I transferred to be closer to home. The first Target was great, the second Target can literally kiss my butt. There's major cliques, it's like being in high school all over again and the pay and hours suck."
good,When working with target it was a very well learned experience. Mangement changed alot and it really impacted the staff. Each manger came with different rules. Just have patience when working with the company.
good,"While working on target, I was able to afford my rent and bills. Target is a good retail job for working while at school or if you need a quick job. Working during the holidays you will be working double."
good,"Management need better communication, one leader will ask you to do one thing and other leaders will ask you to do another ! I was building bike and doing security and only getting paid for doing security!  I didn't want to show insubordination so I do what they told me to ! I felt like I had no choice."
good,"Seems no different than working for Walmart. Generic work for the unmotivated and for those who actually take their jobs seriously, are swept under by the management led by their nepotism."
good,"There is always something to do but, depending on your manager, it can be easy or frustrating. The team members and team leads are usually good people its just too many managers telling you what to do."
good,Overall Target is decent to work at for a retail company. They have a fun environment and work as a team. They have a wonderful culture and it is enjoyable to go to work.
good,A typical day at work is like every other day. There is not constant change. Some high volume days and properly given break times. Little to no advancement opportunities and hours are unstable to say the least. Must have open availability. Cross training in other departments is a plus.
good,"i enjoyed working with the 1469 crew! It was fast fun and friendly! I enjoyed interacting with my customers when i checked them out. I always asked ""did you find everything you were looking for!"
good,"Target is a good place to work at. Very flexible with scheduling, a lot of college students busy store but good working environment. The hardest part of this job is dealing with  angry guests."
good,Love to work at this store everything used to run supper smoth. A quick presses to unload truck and stock everything is pretty much straight forward. Never get boarded of doing one thing you always bounce around the whole store
good,i enjoyed working for target. they appetite there employees give good feed bad and encourage moving up in the company they are making lots of sale focused changes i was not looking forward to
good,"Sometimes management can be frustrating in their task giving, though they do always have a reason for assigning tasks. Generally I do enjoy working here, but it gets annoying when it seems like I'm not allowed to talk to my coworkers as a way of trying to enjoy myself more."
good,"Not a horrible environment. After moving on I discovered there are much worse jobs to be had. You get paid breaks, excluding lunches, the team is always a pleasure to be around. The worst part is random scheduling hours and you have to fight to get full time hours unless you're a member of management staff."
good,it helped me get through collage and pay my bill. my supervisor were decent for the most part. but if youre looking for something to pay for your weekends or extra cash that all I would  say for them.
good,"If you are a cashier, you could be standing on your feet for 8 hours a day. They are very strict about breaks and the management can be VERY overbearing."
good,A majority of the co-workers are amazing people and good to work with. The job itself is monotonous and boring at times. Working on the floor means a lot of looking at and organizing the same shelves day after day.
good,It was fun to work here at first. Later It got really tiring and they did not care about what hours you were available to work. They made me close every night.
good,"picked orders from a cherry picker daily, sometimes had to hop off and help the one area put boxes on the line so they can ship out the products faster"
good,The company has changed over the years like almost all of the corporate America places of employment. Layoffs cause others take on more responsibility
good,"I worked in the mobile dept, I love it, great people, great customer, but it is retail, you have to work a lot, all major holidays and weekends, it can be fun or horrible to work"
good,"While the immersion between coworkers of the same level as you can be engaging and charismaric, the management tends to offset that, based on distribution of hours, alongside biased actions if any form of negative energy is given toward their direction"
good,"I pull, push, and back stock product. I've learned how to handle equipment and the proper procedures of the warehouse. I'm able to talk to my managers if I ever need them or talk to them. We are very divers. The hardest part of my job is to make sure that I am on top of all the items that need to be pulled and given to the right areas, such as pog team, sales floor team, and the front end team. The most enjoyable part of my job is having a fun team to be able to enjoy the day as it comes."
good,Not that hard to get started. Easy job. The other team members were typically very easy to get along with. Most team members were eager to work and learn more.
good,"My typical day at work from daily basis consists of setting Planograms, Revisions and stock the shelves with new products. I have also learned a lot from 10+ years I been with the company I have learned to work well with others and earned respect with my fellow teammates when it comes to making big decisions when my supervisor is not available. My Management are great team leaders they value my opinion and they trust my work that is always 100 percent done. My work place is very family Oriented. The hardest part of my job would be leaving the company that I been with for a very long time because of the hard work I put in, what I've learned through the years and the teammates I've meet and grown and develop friendships with. I enjoy working for this company because of the people I meet and work with."
good,"Great advancement opportunities, competitive pay and great benefits! A fast paced work environment where you are always busy. Time management must be on point."
good,"Talking to customers, trying to sell Redcards, and you should always be busy. I learned that you have to try and sell a lot of Redcards or the managers won't be happy. Management was alright but in my opinion it could have been a lot better. The workplace culture was pretty dull and wasn't all that friendly. The hardest part of the job was selling Redcards because majority of the people didn't want one. The most enjoyable part was being able to talk to different people all day."
good,I worked in the evening. You need to be specific with your availability otherwise you could end up working till midnight then be scheduled to work at 7 am the next day.
good,"An easy but dull routine. Unloading truck,breaking out merchandise, and stocking product. Assigned mostly to the market (grocery) department, rotating product was also critical. "
good,Working is sort of a routine. You do the same tasks every day. you will get cross trained in multiple areas so you can help your other team members. Hardest part of the job can be difficult guests but you get used to them.
good,Target is a good place to work while in school or even just as a way to earn extra income. The hours are flexible with outside schedules and is not very labor intensive. As a cashier you are able to communicate with guests and it helps pass the time. Working on the floor is not as fun. There is not as much guest interaction which slows down the time you are there.
good,Learned how to unload truck and work the line stocking pallets. Learned how to operate lots of mechanical equipment. Learned how to time management very well.
good,"Target does have a lot of benefits if your looking for some where to work, and the workers there are pretty nice and if your looking for your first job I couldn't think of too many better choices."
good,a typical day consisted of stocking and answering customer question. Doing so made me the happiest at work. I only had problems when it came to management.
good,"Working at Target on 9 Mile in Pensacola, FL was definitely a breath of fresh air, to say the least!! Only job while living in Pensacola after moving from Broward County and the people were amazing. The only negative about working retail is the RETAIL PAY!!! At times, we were even allowed to pick up shifts for extra hours but the pay is what the pay is!!!"
good,"As a Sales Associate I was the top salesperson for 16 consecutive weeks. All sales goals were exceeded. My duties included managing special orders, and shipping supplies to other stores in need of item not in stock. I also provided excellent customer service to assure a happy enjoyable shopping experience. I maintained an orderly workplace, assembled and organized merchandise."
good,"Lots of walking, dealing with angry guests, but fun none the less. Must have good cash handling experience as  you can be on the register for hours at a time"
good,In a typical day at work I clock in then proceed to the backroom and pull pallets to the floor. After I will begin to push out each pallet with a team member. During this time I learned how to operate jacks how to efficiently stock shelves and how to use a mi-device. The management were very professional and provided answers for any questions I had. The culture was very diverse and welcoming. I believe the hardest part of the job was stocking high shelves and adapting to waking up at an earlier time. the most enjoyable part was working with such a diverse of people.
good,Often you will find a leader who.. does not really seem to fit the position. However you are guaranteed to make friends if that even matters to you. Look at it as a good gig when you are in school just don't expect to move up that often.
good,"Working in an FDC is hard work and can be frustrating but the pay is great and the time flies.  Management is hit or miss but are at least more professional than at many other places.  "
good,Up to date on new tech to run a store.  As a store manager a lot of hours especially around the holidays.  It gets more difficult to manage each year as payroll goes down each year
good,I did not like working at Target at all. My co-workers were always slacking on the job. They would come in to work and complain about there life and how they do t want to work that day. It was an all round terrible job experience for me cause not only did my coworkers complain but my boss was serious guy who pushed you until your back was giving out it was not pleasant what so ever.
good,I've learned many skills that i can bring into any workplace and provide excellent work. I've learned to mange upset guest to going beyond my job title. The culture at Target depends on the team. Hardest thing about the job is when guests get very upset. Most enjoyable part has to be the extra 15mins to your lunch.
good,Depending on which area and who your supervisor is depends on if you will succeed here.  If you want to know more about how big corporations survive in the real world it will help.
good,"It was an okay job. I made a lot of money working for them as I was able to open or close. The benefits were wonderful, I got a discount card, flexible job hours, and they were heavily into the volunteer community. The work was sometimes overwhelming as they had very high expectations, which I didn't mind and would have gladly learned to adjust to if the management wasn't so poor. Every shift was a toss-up of who was managing that day. They had wild requests of someone who just started and whatever I did, they didn't want me to do. It was impossible to work independently as they wanted because when one manager gave me a task to complete, another manager would change it, and then another manager would change that task. I was always confused as nothing was said to me directly, I would have to hunt down a manager to find out what my task change was. I would have stayed with them for the money and benefits, but I ended up moving before my seniority date. Aside from the management, the coworkers were nice, the pay was good, they were very accepting of the LGBTQ+ community, they defended basic human rights that many companies would not."
good,"For a first time job it is not so bad. Management at least in my departments were horrible, nothing was ever ordered. Hours at target are inconsistent and there are no set schedules."
good,"management and staff are amazing, the job itself was kind of boring but the hours are pretty good they listen to your availability which is good."
good,Target can be a great starting out job and can branch out into other advancements with the company. Team members are eager to help new comers and share experiences with to help improve the store.
good,I enjoyed working for target I stopped working I was going through a divorce and it was taking a toll on me and my work I have not worked since but I do enjoy working with the public
good,"The biggest plus is all your discounts (redcard and employee) combine with sales in store and online which makes up for the bad pay. This is retail so the low pay was as expected. "
good,"It would usually be a nice day every day at work. Did my job everything was smooth, no drama or anything. Also loved working with my co-workers. They made me want to come in to work everyday because they always motivated me, made me laugh, and kept me up."
good,"my day consisted of unloading trucks, working the unloaded freight and binning it in the back stock room"
good,"As a flow team member the work is very simple, it's just extremely fast paced. It's extremely difficult to get fired so your job is pretty secure. The hours suck, trying to have a social life is very difficult but it is easy to get time off."
good,Its a very fun environment for the most part. All the team members are great. My hours were great at first but then started to drop.
good,"Good job, great for beginners who want to start making money, and it is also a good learning experience. "
good,"-cashier & customer service. Also unload a truck & stock merchandise."
good,"I gained a lot of experience being a supervisor at Target. It was my first time, and I have used everything I have learned with other jobs. I also was allowed to count all the money we made the day before to get the feel of how sales work."
good,I really enjoy working here except the managers are the type that will yell at you when you do the same things they do. Very hypocritical. The coworkers are amazing everyone gets along for the most part. You get a ton of hours and really good benefits during the holidays. After the holidays are over your hours get cut in half.
good,"In my experience, Target is a good place to work if you have flexibility in your schedule; however if you are looking for something that is stable and a schedule that is the same all the time, it may not be for you.  The culture of the company is positive and the mantra is commendable.  You must be a Team Player or you will not fit in there.  Being a Cashier takes patience, a good attitude and great customer service skills.  I am a people person, therefore I enjoyed working with guests and helping them out.  One thing to note, if you are scheduled to work at any certain day that you need off, it is your responsibility to find coverage for your shift in order to take that time off; so it is best to request a needed day off far in advance (they post schedules two weeks in advance).  Additionally, acquiring Target Red Cards are strongly encouraged and expected of each Cashier, thus it affects your job performance evaluation and rating, so it felt like being in a sales role in addition to being a Cashier; which I was did not care for as much."
good,"Target is a good place to work. The management is very easy to communicate with and understanding. People who work there are overall friendly and helpful. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers, in the most professional, polite, respectful, and curious way possible, who are cranky and rude. The most enjoyable part of the job is being the cause of a customer to overly pleased when I am able to find the item they are searching for and exceed their level of expectations for customer service."
good,"I found the managers were always helpful, they answered all my questions. My co-workers, thought very highly of me, they would often ask me questions. A lot of what I have learned, I learned either from other co-workers, such as; payment errors. The hardest part of my job was wanting to move up in management, but not having the openings to move up. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to experience the other positions."
good,"ocus your efforts to lead a specific area of the store, including Guest Experience, Human Resources, Sales Floor, Logistics, Assets Protection or Food. Motivate a team of 30-60 team members and leaders to improve performance and ensure guests have the best possible Target shopping experience during every visit. The Store Leadership Team works a flexible schedule to be present and support its teams and our guests. Positions are available for experienced and entry level candidates."
good,This is a good company to work.flexible hours.Some time could be funny with hours but just ask for more hours. Has night shifts as well which are convenient.
good,"If you are looking for a job where you can balance work and social life, target is not for you.  Even on your scheduled days off they may still call you to come in."
good,"My time at this company had its ups and downs, but mostly ups! The managers weren't the best to work with though. Days normally went by very slow, but manageable."
good,"Productive and make you attentive and interesting at work place, assistance from Seniors, good coordination, learning new things, Innovative colleagues, Sharing Thoughts and Views."
good,"If you are having trouble with in your first 90 days, don't bother asking anyone above you for help. They will use anything they can against you."
good,"A typical day at target is okay"
good,I learned about teamwork and what it takes to be a leader. I would go to work and start on the tasks assigned to me and wait to assign other tasks to my team. I learned to take action to help my team succeed p.
good,"being a deskside technical support specialist"
good,Manager staff can be rude and unhelpful. Co-workers that were on the same level as me were amazing and always helped if I needed a shift changed or swapped.
good,Working environment was cool laid back but hard at the same time creating a great balance. Management needs work. Very unorganized and unprofessional.
good,"This is mainly a job for a high school student looking for their first job before school or after school. Flexible hours, will work with you in your schedule, very flexible. Caring team, hard working managers and all together great atmosphere."
good,"I travel at least 2 hours to and from work a day (4 hours commute in all); Target would be a lot more accommodating if they ran a shuttle bus to and from the train station for sure. My team are fantastic to work with; we are highly undervalued by the business but you learn to live with it. The work is very manageable; even going above and beyond does not put you out so much, depending on how quickly you understand the financial servicing industry."
good,"Talent Acquisition"
good,I enjoyed this job for the most part. We had a competitive team and we could always make it fun. Management was always impossible to find.
good,Working at target was overall great. You meet a lot of different people from different backgrounds. It's a strong an competitive work place where you Strive to get Red Cards.
good,"A typical day at target for me is talking a lot with guest. I learned different work areas like cashiering, cart attendant, and also target cafe. I love my coworkers, one of the reasons to keep going back to  work everyday. The job isnt hard at all. The most enjoyable part of that job was seeing and communicating with different people everyday."
good,Resolving issues.  Driving sales.  Developing team members.  Retaining talent.  Educating team members on consistently changing policies.  Maintaining a diverse culture.  Providing a safe and open atmosphere.  I enjoy working with my team and our guest.  Retail is a tough environment to retain dependable employees.
good,Good to start working at target as overnight if it is your first job. Pass five years i learn almost everything there is for overnight shift that is fun to learn different stuff. For the management it is alright if you do the job if not they will have some problems but they will not fired you right. Working with people is not the best way to work together but i prefer to work by my self. The hardest part of the work is went it is holidays.
good,"I loved my job! I was a senior team leader, but because I didn't have a degree I couldn't advance to the next position, even though I had been ther for 15yrs and had done everything in that store. The pay was great, the benefits were great, the management in the last 3 yrs was awful! No compassion for their team members. No loyalty just numbers! This Target in particular lost what it meant to take care of your team. Their purpose as a company was just the bottom dollar. I wish I could have advanced in the company but it just wasn't meant to be."
good,Target was my first really job where I was actually working to pay for bills. Its not a place I would recommend if you're looking for great benefits or more than 20-25 hours per week.
good,It is a wonderful place to work at in u will never go wrong when shopping  online or at store it has the best security system ever
good,"Good job, fast paced and a lot to do. Everything was fine until I needed to change around my schedule. Was not helped very well, and didn't feel a positive vibe."
good,Its cool at first then management starts to get on put more work than you can handle. The people you work with are nice an happy to help you when ask for it . Shopper are pretty cool when your work on you section.
good,"Cashiering at Target had its ups and downs. The scheduling was difficult because of closing shifts followed by opening shifts, and the area in which the Target was located was rife with tourism, which made the lines extremely long. However, Target did take care of its employees and gave adequate payment and instruction for the work done."
good,"Target is a great job to start at during high school and fresh into your college years. Target works with your schedule, maintains decent hours, and has plenty opportunity to learn different positions within the company. The ultimate attitude within the position is positive and my personal experience with the company within the last three years have been pleasant."
good,"With target depends what department but if you work seriously then job will be hard. You have to ask question if you don't know anything, I know training sometimes good or not but most of time they don't train well that's why never hesitate to ask the more you ask better you will learn. Target should be flexible or will work with your schedule I don't know about other stores were I work they really work with my needs."
good,"Willing to work around your schedule, They do give you warnings before they fire or terminate you depending on the circumstance, semi passive before the 90 days. Great benefits though and a great atmosphere depending on the etl or TLs on staff."
good,This company was very thorough with training their staff.Daily huddles were very motivated. Occasionally we were treated to free meals. Learned about the correct method of disposing chemicals.
good,"I worked nights stocking shelves, heavy lifting , fast pace enviroment, friendly workers, unloading trucks , using pallet jacks. introduction to shipping and receiving"
good,"It's retail, really what do you expect?"
good,"I worked here in the Target Cafe.I pretty much took orders, cashed them out, and gave the guest their order. Before the store open I had to prep some foods which wasnt hard at all. The only thing i hated was topping what seems like a million pizzas. Besides that cooking was easy as long as you followed directions. My coworkers were really nice and helpful. The hardest part was probably trying to figure out where everything was. Trust me, customers want to know where every little thing is, even if its not your department. The best part was it was a good environment with good pay."
good,"The pay is great for the work you do. If you drive equipment, be careful because they will fire you for anything. The Operation managers seem cool, till they fire you and Dont give you a reason. So if you make it past your 90days, I salute you."
good,Fair place to work.  Company is publicly owned so look to satisfy shareholders and not employees.  If you work hard you do get recognized but not compensated for it.
good,"Management needs a little work in the scheduling department, often scheduling workers even when they request time off weeks in advance. Advancement opportunities are limited for anyone who is part-time or hasn't been there for years. It is a retail store so the experience is what you can expect from any retail position."
good,"I was in charge of 4 different teams that consisted of 52 people. The workers her are inviting, hard working, and dedicated."
good,The hardest part of the job was not being able to multitask zoning an area and back stocking the items. But as I stared working  there longer  I started getting the hang of things.
good,"Loved Target even though I was on my feet long hours. However, managers did not seem to care about possibly injury on job by lifting heavy products."
good,"This job is great for high school and college kids to gain knowledge. Not a company I would retire with. Needs more appreciation for team members. There should be more leaders who have retail experience before promoting, instead of just having a high degree."
good,"A typical day at work would start at checking your emails and seeing if there is any important information that you need to know to run your business appropriately. Then I will check in with my assistants, guest services, as well as Target Cafe and my Cart Attendant to see if they have any need or wants from me as their Team Leader. Then I will go to the front lanes and status which each of my cashiers and go over their goals and overall support them to achieve metric goals each week. I will also greet and connect with our guests that come through the lanes and handle any situation that may arise with a guest to ensure that they leave the store with the best experience possible."
good,it was a cool job not enough hours and felt like management wasn't up to par at the time alot of roomers going around the store
good,"The first three years at Target was rather good. I got to meet other cool people, work early mornings, and go home early. It's far from perfect however. The store manager is very annoying and everyone hates him. Even customers hate him. I have seen so many Team Leaders leave because they couldn't stand working for him. Other than that, I enjoyed my experience that I had at this job."
good,"A typical day at work starts with the management team ensuring the store is brand prior to opening, and once the store is open the mangers focus on their direct areas of business. My direct focus was shortage mitigation, and improving in-stocks to generate a positive YTD comp in sales. The hardest part of my job was not being able to see family around the holidays due to the retail schedule. the most enjoyable part of my job was the teamwork, and having a well rounded knowledge of the entire store (food, sales floor, Logistics, HR)."
good,"Management cared little about its employees. The shifts are unreliable; one week you may work 20 hours, the next week you might work 3. Working with customers was great though."
good,Overall I believe that Target is a good company to work for. They are very flexible with hours and school schedules.  The team members are willing to help each other when needed. There is a real family atmosphere between team members.
good,"It's okay but the hours are not dependable. pay rate is good. they have good benefits, but you have to work 30 hours, which is not happening because hours are always cut week to week."
good,The work is easy. They are lenient with your availability. But got 6 hours a week not even close to what was promised. Decent pay but again the hours were not even close to enough. How can you live off of 6 Hours a week.
good,"Living off of the wage here is nearly impossible. The employee discounts make shopping at Target a plausible option, but I cannot stress the inconsistency of the hours and the meager wages. Management is alright, but there is a general lack of cohesion among the ETLs, resulting in conflicting demands from people in equal positions of authority. I enjoyed electronics, but the job was mind-numbing."
good,"Target is a great company to work for."
good,I like working at Target the job itself is easy but the management isn't the greatest. The tend to be very unorganized and everybody is never on the same page.
good,Worked with a team to unload and stack shelves with a group of kind and hardworking people. An interesting part of the job was weekly team meeting where team members nominated each other for a successful job or for going beyond the requirement.
good,Working at Target provided a flexible schedule.  One of the highest positives working at Target is being able to meet so many people.
good,Its not a terrible company to work for but the pay isnt great and there isnt much room for advancement. I have learned many skills in logistics though.
good,"When I started working at Target I was very young. I was able to grow within the company, eventually becoming the backroom team lead. At first the job was fun but it started to become overwhelming due to the bickering between overnight and day time backroom executives."
good,"I worked for the overnight logistics team for Target.  Our focus was still ""guest"" centered, although we had very little interaction with the guests due our the shift (10pm-7am).  Our focus was still fast, friendly, and fun, just with more emphasis on the fast!  This was great as we all worked very hard as a team unit to unload the trailer(s), stock the store, and clean up before 8am when our guests arrived.  This was rewarding because we have an expectation, we work very hard physically, and mentally as a team to achieve our goals each and every night!  Not only to ensure we do our part, but to help our store succeed in sales and ultimately contribute to Target's overall success."
good,benefits packages available to team members are very reasonable and affordable. 401k is unmatched with the first 5% being matched dollar for dollar.
good,"Good experience, but very bad work hours, which is retail in general.  Very hard to have a work life balance.  Pay was decent and the job can be done by anyone, it isn't difficult just very tedious.  Even as a manager you walk possibly anywhere between 5-15 miles a day picking up clothes lifting boxes."
good,"They talk to you in the most condescending way ever. When you aren’t getting red cards they’ll usually say some stupid stuff like ” Are you asking every guest?” , ” are you telling them about the 5%?” NoI’ve been working here all this time obsorbing air and admiring the red paint"
good,"My Opinion (As A HR Team Member)"
good,If you don't have a good team it will be a little tough on you. You have to develop one or make a entire new team. Work hours can nne extremely long some days. You will learn how to be accountable and how to hold the team accountable. Your co workers could be good and some could be bad but you have to go with the flow.
good,"Target used to be a fun, competitive, productive place to work but in recent years (the last 3 or so) it has gone downhill.  I used to enjoy working there but now I dread going in for my shifts.  I also just recently graduated and am looking for a job in my field of study. The management at the particular store I work has gone downhill, there seems to be no integrity, team work, or disciplinary action given to those who need it.  They cut the team member hours thus cutting the benefits and it is incredibly hard to pay mortgages, rent, loans, and take care of children on such small wages and minimal hours. That's just a small portion.  Target has, unfortunately, become a toxic place to work and it is time for me to move forward with my career and my life."
good,I enjoy working for Target. They are good about work life balance and my co-workers are great. Corporate downsizing is a constant however. Good benefits and the discount at Target is awesome too.
good,Target is a great place to interact with amazing guests and to assist people who just want and need everyday things and sometimes things for special occasions.
good,Target Leadership positions provide a fast paced work environment with a lot of developmental opportunity.  The work life balance for salaried leaders is not good and has gotten much worse over the years.  As payroll continues to decline for store team members the demands for leadership climbs.  Be ready to work hard and lead harder!
good,"A typical morning was after clocking in, I would collect my work area's returns and sort them back on the shelf. Then I would see to maintaining the Electronics Department. While working there I learned a great deal about hot electronics on the market and about specific technologies. The management was the worst part of my Target career. Lack of communication with my department led to low morale within the work environment. Favoritism led to promotions to individuals who were newer to the company, despite countless attempts at being trained for it. They gave very little in terms of supporting the team. The co-workers were the highlight of my career there. Being in a specialty workplace with few employees made us a tight knit group and made work durable during the hard times."
good,Ok company. Minimal hours unless you get into managment. Not really any room for advancement. They pay was worth the work though so that was good. In all an ok place to work for short term.
good,Typical day at work was the insure all stock was located in proper shelf orders. Shelves where full with product areas were clean. etc.
good,"As a packer, I had worked night shift, 6pm to 6am, sat to tueday. Pay was fair. Nice way to grind out a decent paycheck and still have time to enjoy life. Unfortunately, there was little to no job security. Target, rather than hiring full-time employees and being forced to pay benefits to them as instructed by current insurance law, they would instead fill the work force gaps with temporary agencies like manpower and accustaff."
good,"management is good, although the customers can be a bit harsh and not easy to deal with the work environment was nice and settle"
good,"This job wasn't terrible but it wasn't my favorite. Some of the people were great but the hours were rough. i hated only getting minimum, plus getting paid every other week was hard. i did like meeting new people and learning the cash register."
good,"work was slow but also easy to complete."
good,"Depending on what you apply for and your shift will determine what you'll be doing. Cashiers will always be cashiers. Cart attendants will do both carts and cashier as well as store clean up. People hired for snack bar/Starbucks will always be there. But people on sales floor might be cashier for their first few shifts starting out then advance onto the floor. The shifts and where you are were a little unorthodox. You could be sales floor and start on the floor then be called back to register for the rest of your shift. Usually if it's a closing shift you were sent back to the floor to help close. Even though you were on register most of the time and were not able to get any of your sales floor duties accomplished. If it was a morning/mid-day shift you might be solely on register, half register and half taking flats and carts from the back and restocking shelves, or you might be on the sales floor the entire time. It was definitely a lot to handle but you had to manage your time well and prioritize what had to be done first depending on the assigned position. It had it's ups and downs, few chaotic moments here and there. The biggest bother would be the schedule. I was hired for seasonal position and got a lot of hours in. I was told at orientation that if we did well, they would keep us and offer full time. I was on the schedule 4-5 days a week. Some were closing shifts so i pulled 9-10 hours that day. Once the holiday season ended, i was on the schedule once every week. I approached one of the managers and they said we'll find somewhere to fit you, but your best bet is to pick"
good,Hardest part of the job is trying to stay on the same page with the Leaders on Duty and Team Leads as well as other Team Members.
good,A Typical target day includes helping out a number of guests find what they are looking for in all areas of the store. Generally I am putting away reshop or handling push. Reshop items are items that have been bought and then returned. Push includes items that have come from the logistics room and need to be pushed onto the sales floor.
good,managers really talk to you very friendly and its a decent job if you are in high school they will try to work with your schedule and you can always swap shifts or give away shifts with other people
good,"Fun place to work for but not very good pay or benefits.  Management provides free food a couple times a month. Despite that, I did not enjoy working for this company."
good,Physical job but pays well. A lot of friendly and knowledgeable co-workers. Benefits are not the greatest besides the 401k match.
good,This was a good job during college because they were willing to work with my school schedule. I was also able to work in multiple areas in the store. The only downfall was that it was stressful during the holiday season.
good,A great place to work with a fun and fast paced team. The management really looks out for the teams and makes sure everyone is putting in the effort to keep things running smoothly!
good,in the short time i was there i as promoted from flow team to backroom team due to my hard work. the people i worked with seemed to enjoy my company. there was a really lax atmosphere and calming work space
good,What I liked about working at Target was how involved they were with the local community and planning community service for its team members. They also help other Target stores that have been affected by natural disasters.
good,Left Target to pursue professional position more suited to my college education. Joined an office setting that worked well with my family life.
good,Start at 4am and got your duties to do and complete them in the amount of time it would take say on the paper. If finished eary you would go help team memebers.
good,job satisfaction depends on who is the leader on duty as well as hob position. Great place to work if the store you work in supports Targets mission statement
good,My days at work are usually fun rather challenging but never unmanageable i learned to work with others handle customers and employee's problems without incident my co workers are lively with colorful personality's each unique onto its own witch brought on new interactions every time from hard workers to the not so hard workers the hardest part of the job would be holidays and the rush of people that come with and the possibility of being under staffed but never to an extent that was impossible to achieve our goal but it has its good days to when we all come together as a team to finish a hard day or just making a regular day fun and treating each other with respect those were the days i loved
good,learned how to become a better cashier and helped customers with their shopping needs. stocked goods for the store ad made displays
good,ok place to work well in school. managers are ok the people are ok. this work place is ok. target is a busy place you will learn different thing there if you want to learn they will help you
good,"Target needs to find it's ""mojo"" in the world of online retailing. A lot of changes have been made at a leadership level, but it is taking a while for the culture to take."
good,"Target was my first 'real job' and it was great! Loved it at first, however, after nearly two years of working at my previous store, it was no longer enjoyable. Good for a first job, but that is about it."
good,I can't say much about this store because I was only a holiday seasonal associate. They do train you well and you must have fast hands if you're closing. You and sometimes another associate will be responsible for a department which can be a tall task.
good,This is a great opportunity but the work life balance is not the best. It just depends on the manager that you get. There is a lot of great training involved and you do get a lot of management experience while on the job.
good,"I was a Backroom Team Member. A typical day for me consisted mostly of going to and from multiple stockrooms, gathering merchandise for empty locations on the sales floor."
good,"great place to work but all about the numbers"
good,"I enjoyed working for Target before I became a trucker. Great people, work environment, and work days go by fast. As I stated before I left to become a trucker because target doesn't pay enough to pay bills especially when you live in California."
good,"Roles are divided by section, but ultimately you are an assistant retail manager for the company.  Only those with a passion for retail and people are successful in the company."
good,"Target is a good place to start if you're in high school or need a part time job for college. The hours that I was getting was very slim. I would ask to be put on the schedule and they did...just not during my available hours. I'm a student so most of my time is consumed with class during the day and I would get calls about why I didn't come in and I would be in class. I learned a lot about apparel. I learned how to handle Irate customers face to face as well as over the phone. Sometimes we would have to stay and help with other departments as cashiers. If you were hungry and didn't have any money, the management were selfless enough to get you something to eat. I loved how involved within the community as a company. There were several opportunities to volunteer for certain events within the city."
good,The management sucks a lot of the time but my coworkers are the best part they help keep a positve additude even when guest get bad.
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Flexible with scheduling and hours. The supervisors and coworkers respectful as well as supportive. Working alongside colleagues was very enjoyable.
good,It was a fun and enjoyable place to work the first five years I worked there than upper management changed a lot and it wasn't to benefit the employees as much. The raise pay scale was my biggest complaint didn't seem fair to the employees. A way for them to make more money buy giving out percentages rather than the normal pay range raise.
good,"Employees are, usually, awesome to work with. Hardest part of the job is, not enough employees for the work load. Most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and being able to help them."
good,start unloading truck and loading them or be on the forklift or what the scanners with the product we take our 2 20 min breaks then our 30 min break
good,"Great job for first job, although it's hard to work your way up. Plus only way of becoming part of management you must have a degree, most managers are just out of college."
good,"1) Organize Meetings to drive decisions and solutions with business and Technology teams."
good,"my day starts at random times anywhere from 7am,12pm,3pm or 7pm but depending on what i am scheduled that day each day is different."
good,"It's hard to describe Target as a whole since each store can vary greatly depending on who works there and how they do things. But here is what mine is like:"
good,"Was able to interact with co-workers and vendors alike.  Able to bring in new ideas that are still in use today.  Ability to time manage and multi-task came in handy on a daily basis.  Learned food safety protocol in addition to disposal of environmentally sensitive items.  Enjoyed working with local community food shelves, etc. during the exchange of donated food / household / personal items from store to community as per company policies."
good,"The teams were great to work with and very flexible and understanding as well as very patient training you to the team flow not just an individual."
good,"Target is a good place to work. Nice people, decent hours, and management, sometimes, gets along. Overnight is a lot simpler, just unload a truck, or two, then go to your designated areas."
good,Fun workplace with supportive management. Treated everyone equally.Great place to work if you're a college student who needs a stable job. Very helpful when it comes to helping students out.
good,"Working for Target I had to multitask. Between answering phone calls, helping customers in store, cashiering, and handling the fitting room. I had a lot on my plate but I love staying busy so it worked out for me."
good,"After I was recruited for a Target Stores Exempt position, I had a great first several years with the company.  The training culture was clearly evident, as was its ability to manage people out of the company.  When I became the one of the oldest Exempt Team Leaders in the district (at 27), it was clear that the company was interested in younger managers.  Overall, the company is a performance-driven machine that lost some of its Fast, Fun, and Friendly mentality when former Gregg Steinhafel took the reigns.  I wouldn't recommend this company for anyone with a family, as the work-life balance is pretty much non-existent."
good,"Sometimes fast, sometimes slow, always something to do. Working in the clothing department was fun and rewarding, working as a cashier wasn't bad; I wouldn't work in the café again to save my life. When you're over there you'll receive little-to-no help from management or co-workers. Management often ignored their responsibilities in the café area. Some of the things required 20-40 pound lifting capacity that most of the people working there didn't seem capable of. I'd work there again if I knew I wouldn't be shoved into the café."
good,"It's a busy store."
good,This job is average.  I happen to be at a good store that has decent management.  Overall the company as a whole doesn't pay well.  They constantly under staff the store and expect miracles from their workers.  I've worked for 2 different stores and it is like that at both.
good,"Target it a great place to start a career. You could learn a lot about yourself and development. A typical day as a Group leader is 11-14 hours, standing, walking, and various physical activities throughout the day. You will manage anywhere from 20-30 team members productivity and team engagement. It is a unique culture that may take some time to adjust, but adjusting is necessary for success. Overall, 3/5."
good,I would ring peoples items up and try to get them to sign up for a target red card. I learned that you cant take what other people say to heart. My co-workers were a little different not very good work ethic from most of them. The hardest part of my job was trying to get people to sign up for a target red card. My favorite part of the job was going on break
good,Fun and relax environment but the pay and benefits are not good. I feel that the training is poor and that they are looking for young blood to promote within.
good,"I loved the people I worked with, but working with some of the managers was a hit or miss. My job was simple and was easy to accomplish, but depending on who your manager was it was a little difficult. Some of the managers will give you a hard time for no reason. Outside of management, it is not a completely bad place to work or to have as a first job."
good,Being able to provide guest service was the best part. Having no support from upper management in the store was not so much fun. Having no support from upper management to meet minimum Red card goal for each and everyday was inconsiderate. The most enjoyable part was when i solved problems for guests and team member to satisfy them and to create guest loyalty.
good,"It gave me a job when I needed it. The work itself is retail, it's nothing special if you had worked retail before. My positives are mostly with my coworkers and supervisors, they are generally friendly people who are willing to work with you if you ask them."
good,Dyson US is a great company to work.  They have only been in the US since the early 2000s so they operate very much like a start up.  their systems are behind the times and some of their practices are dictated from the home office in the UK.  Even with their issues there are a lot of great people there who are all trying to work together for the most part.
good,The typical day is all dependent on the work center and the day of the week. There is a very clear pattern that the weeks follow and as a worker/manager that means routines and plans. Very team based operating style and also emphasis on empowering the individual to develop talent and foster innovation.
good,"Most customers were friendly but you always get those rude customers you have to deal with. You're on your feet the entire day, organizing your departments while helping customers. The co-workers were very friendly and made the job much easier."
good,I finally got a promotion within the company and i worked the job for 6 months only to find out we will all lose our jobs. Made the promotion feel pointless.
good,Would be a job anyone would love if it paid enough to not be on food stamps at full time hours. It's a struggle to get hours and pay is a joke. But the atmosphere and professionalism of management is great.
good,A typical day at Target would be ringing up items for guest and ensuring a positive shopping experience for them. A main focus for the company was selling Redcards (credit or debit) and that was probably the most stressful part about it. For the most part the other cashiers were pleasant but management could be a little overbearing at times. The most enjoyable part would have to be helping out guest who really appreciate the effort you put forth in making sure everything is to their liking as much as you possibly can. I definitely learned how to deal with others in situations where customers are unhappy and how to better communicate.
good,"some great managers that work there yet in the past few months the place and company went completely down hill, Has great potential but still needs to improve"
good,"* A typical day at work would involve helping customers with their purchases, directing them to the appropriate departments, and providing excellent customer service."
good,"I learned a lot about OTC medications, steps to ensure accurate dispensing, meeting and greeting patients and patient's agents, prioritizing work while multitasking. "
good,the team members working their were great people and had a fun time working there interacting with all the employees it was the management that was the problem it was not well run
good,"great coworkers, sometimes laid back, management is ok. hardest part on the job would be when your on production. learned alot of things and skills"
good,"For an early-morning Backroom/Flow Team Member, the day may start as early as 4:00 A.M. (or 2 hours earlier during the final months of the year). This typically involves either retrieving goods from incoming trucks, replenishing supplies on the floor, or storing the remainder in the backroom."
good,It was a good place to work at especially out in the surburbs of San Clemente in Talega. THe area and store is pleasant. A typical day at work was straigtening and folding clothes on the table and assist the cashiers when needed.
good,"-Target offers a great opportunity for advancement."
good,"Team Members continuously work to keep the store looking great and assist guests in locating products."
good,There are a ton of smart people but it was difficult to get a decision made. Which is expected when working for such a large company.
good,Provide very good training to entry level associates. Very encouraging as well as demanding particularly the overnight shift. Overall a good place to work.
good,Working at Target was positive work experience. Every other day I learned something new from my Manager. I had great co-workers who taught alot throughout the year and I did the same for those who started after me.
good,Best part about it was working with my best friend. We could clear out the Backroom in half the time it took everyone else.
good,"Productive, informative place to work. Fun atmosphere. Short shifts. Good management. Group efforts. Daily challenges. Recognition of job well done. Daily goals. Volunteerism. Folding and cashiering."
good,"If you have worked retail before there won't be any surprises here. Random work schedule, get full time hours under a part time tag. minimum wage compensation so you'll do more work than you feel like you're being paid to do albeit not very hard work."
good,"Target is a great company to work for and the environment is friendly and offers great benefits!!! Strong leadership, training should be more precise and longer. the work may sometimes be stressful, but it is a great and friendly environment."
good,A typical day at work would be hectic and a lot of multitasking. I learned how to have patience and control my temper. Management was professional for the most part and very attentive to their staff.
good,A typical day if filled with mainly guest assistance. The coworkers are good people. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the coworkers.
good,Target is amazing to gain experience.  I have learned so much from them and I am ready to take my learnings to help benefit another organization.
good,The Overnight Team is something that gets very little credit. I had the experience of working on this great yet highly underated team. These are the people who unload the trucks of stock and stock the items every night.
good,"I loved working for Target, I was there for almost 5 years. The only reason why I left was because of the way the company was evolving. They were recruiting new executive management based off of experience or college, but from outside the company rather than promoting from within. Let's just say, this is when all of us (those that were there for 5+ years together) realized that the company did not value hard working employees that knew a lot about the business along with being cross trained in every single area of the store. They were letting old team members and managers go for such little issues, instead of just issuing a write up or final warning. Old Executive Management used to be able to speak with us and let us know if we were doing something wrong and needed to fix it because they valued having a team that worked hard and knew every aspect of the business. So they did not want to see us leave or get fired over something that could be fixed."
good,"Pulling and Back stocking merchandise was an all day job. Fast, Fun, Friendly and Helpful co-workers that maintain positive attitude."
good,"Retail Management is hard. The hours are long and the rewards are minimal because new problems arise quickly. If you are good at facing challenges and being resilient, you can be successful."
good,Culture at work focuses on positive environment for everyone. Focused on the new concept of online order fulfillment.
good,Try to make the company better then it was yesterday excited about trying new things meeting new people developing new skill
good,I learned the value of building relationships with your supervisors and employees. I only worked here for a short time but I learned how hard it can be to work with the public. The job itself was very easy but the environment was always changing. Guests could be rude and you had to know how to maintain your temper or otherwise you were out of a job.
good,Great place to work if your a college student. It's flexible with your schedule. I enjoyed working here back in the day. Great place to start out to get where you need to be professionally.
good,I come in and clock in take care of the area I was assigned and help the guests in need. The hardest part about the job was the drama and keeping the store presentable on busy days.
good,Overall Target is a great company with many career options and an excellent compensation package.  Yet my job was incredibly boring - Target has too many employees and not enough work.
good,"Target overall was a great place to work, the management did not show their employees that they were valued. There was no room for advancement."
good,"Target requires much demand on regular-end employees, however they give a good amount of hours. It may not be the area you want to work in the rest of your life, yet if you are looking to work in retail, they are a good company. They show moral value and professionalism."
good,Great place to work. Just need more opportunities to grow. They need to offer more hours to team members. More compensation as well.
good,"I moved up fast in this company due to prior experience. A lot of employees that was working at South Windsor location, didn't have enough hours as a full time employer."
good,helped freight team in morning and served as a casheir supervisor midday. the hardest part of this job was being to work by 3 am on frieght days
good,"Target is in the midst of what many hope is a resurrection of past glory.  Sadly, many good people will be let go while the company re-brands itself."
good,Fun workplace with a strong focus on leadership development.  Learned how to overcome any developmental opportunities I identified through work with my senior leaders and peers.
good,"Provide a friendly environment, which includes greeting and acknowledging every guest, maintaining solid product knowledge and all other aspects of guest service"
good,Learned some amazing customer service skills. The fast pace environment helps you learn to multi task and utilize everyone around you. Some teamwork is a must to provide customer service for guest that is speedy and helpful.
good,"Very fun company, awesome employees. Best suited for a certain kind of person - one who is willing and able to keep a happy face and go with the flow and be happy with whatever political BS and buzz-word filled nonsensical instructions are thrown at you each day that get in the way of you simply doing your job right. The pay is excellent, but it comes at the cost of your work life balance. The leadership development is amazing, but over time you'll find that they want a certain kind of leader and value some traits more than others. Popularity is everything, and having strong values and being wiling to stand up for them is discouraged in favor of smiling and making everyone feel good. They demand talent management, but their HRs always take the side of the team member and not the leader and there is so much red tape involved in the performancing process, it's almost not worth it. Like I said before, can be a dream for the right person, but most end up leaving within the first two years."
good,Lots of talented people but there are far too many layers of management to get things done quickly.  Given responsibility very early and expected to deliver.  Forces professionals to learn to collaborate and delegate very quickly and allows you to enhance your presentation skills frequently. Great culture with a feeling that people genuinely care about your well-being.
good,"My career at target helped me a lot because its where I gained most of my knowledge and experience as a leader. I mentored some great managers as they came and went and I'm thankful for them. some locations great place to work for if the managers and team members are nice, other locations not so much. My typical day would be starting off meeting with both my teams setting goals and distributing workload. I would also prepare and communicate plans for workload . I would check progress reposts, write emails, supervise teams, pull merchandise, help guests, support the front and back end of the store. I would be a support manager, and also take part in workload execution for both teams. The hardest part of the job is dealing with some peers and managers not being nice to some employees.The most enjoyable thing about Target was the fact that I was able to cross train in teams to pick up hours and experience. I enjoyed helping guests and interacting with different people all day and that's one main thing they focus on most."
good,"Target is a great brand to work for, especially when just beginning to seek unemployment. Retail can be outgrown and exhausting quickly, however advancement is available and the overall environment is friendly."
good,"I usually start the day with going into the backroom to go check for our market product then start to work the product onto the floor. As i am putting product on the floor i have to zone the department in between while checking pulls every hour. I also cover breaks and lunches if need be for our electronics area, helping customers is a great deal of my day to find certain product or even asking them are they finding everything okay just to assure they are being serviced and i am there to help. The relationship with management is stable its more on a business level, at times they will try and help you to their best ability. Some relationships are better than others as far as the foundation between worker and supervisor and so on. As far as co workers again my relationship is stronger than others but the teamwork aspect is there so that if my co worker needs help i will try to the best of my ability to do so. The hardest part of the job is trying to find a balance between pleasing everybody and actually doing quality work. The enjoyment i find in my job is really making the customers day by exhausting all options, going the extra mile and meeting new people at target."
good,Can be mentally and physically  challenging at times because of time constraints. Co-workers are enjoyable to work with. Management is young and inexperienced.
good,"Target is a great company to work for. Their benefits are top notch and the business structure is solid. I would consider the management average, in terms of the store that I worked for. However, the management structure for the company is very well designed for optimal efficiency and communication. The thing that I found most enjoyable about the job, were the team members. There was a dull moment there."
good,"When I first found out target was coming to Winnipeg and it was close to home I wanted to apply, it was kinda a dream job for me. It was an amazing experience."
good,"Although target was a generally good and friendly place to work, it did have it's downsides with rumours about dishonesty from management while we are closing as well as hours becoming a mess and sometimes cut a great deal for me and my co-workers. I was also told I would be working full-time only to see my hours at 25-30 hours weekly and occasionally having the schedule changed last minute without informing me."
good,"Target is excellent when it comes to work-life balance. They make it very easy to attend school and continue to work for the company. However, they very rarely promote from within the company, and management has a very high turnover rate. There is strong job security, but little opportunity for advancement."
good,"typical day everyone just get there work done "
good,"working at zellers as a cashier never gave me the option to develop new skills, but at target my position was fun a rewarding I enjoyed going to work"
good,"Fast pace , Didn't lern much becasue i have had previous experience . My co-workers and very incompetant, hard woring and nice . the hardest part of the job was busy hours and your put on the wrong shift. The most enjoyable was being around so much nice people who are interested in what you have to sell."
good,"Answer customers' questions about merchandise and advised customers on merchandise selection."
good,A typical day at work is usually pretty easy. We usually do our job and go home. When it comes to the management it sucks. I don't know if it is actually my boss or my boss's boss but they make myself and my co-workers hate our job.
good,"It was pretty decent, minor issues common among retail jobs. Good management, very motivational. Decent job, nice seasonal position. Hours didn't really correspond with my class schedule but they made proper changes. Management really cared. Nice coworkers. Breaks are cool."
good,"Life as an ETL at target can be difficult with large demands on your time and a less than ideal schedule, but there are rewards as well. There are certain benefits to working hard at a store and then knowing that your time at home is entirely yours, but the expectations while at work can be strenuous enough. "
good,"worked there for about 3 months, job was pleasant but they had trouble with overscheduling on availability on many occasions leaving me with having to chose school over work because It was hard to find coverage for those overscheduled hours. other than that I would have stayed."
good,"Was my first job, I was a cashier yet did a little bit of everything for this job even cleaned bathrooms. Management not so good they didn't pay me for some work hours."
good,"Overall, Target was a fun place to work.. The co-workers we're really cool, but the managers had very high expectations."
good,A lot of amazing people that work hard for little to no money.
good,"Working for Target as a cashier seems like it would be a simple job, but the level of responsibility they give to their cashiers is tremendous. I was not only responsible for my station, but for the appearance of the front of the store. Once my responsibilities were taken care of, I would work with and handle customers' transactions. There were times when I would work a full eight-hour shift, and be completely ignored by the managers. When it was time for me to take my lunch, I was unable to flag down a manager to alert them of my time to take a break or a lunch. I understand it was my responsibility, but the unavailability of the managers was frustrating. My co-workers were friendly, and the culture diverse. However, some co-workers were competitive for numbers of red cards sold. The hardest part of this job was having to pick up the slack of the managers, co-workers, and cleaning up after customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. Meeting new people and getting to know them in the short period of time they passed through my lane was great."
good,"In order to get the most out of this company and your experience, you must educate yourself on rules put in place by the corporation."
good,"Able to  run business with with out interference as long as goals were met and general guide lines followed."
good,Target is a good place to start off at.  It is not a long term job though.  Management will be on your back if you're good at what you do and will let you slide if you don't want to do your job.  I would do my job correctly and would get looked at under a microscope.  Others would do half of their job and be praised.
good,"This is a great company to gain experience and build leadership skills. However, it very demanding in the retail environment, long hours at some times and difficult to balance work/home life at times. Compensation/pay and benefits is higher than most retail companies, but still does not match the work you put in."
good,Liked my co workers hated my managers they where very petty and not understanding at all. sneaky and childish
good,"if you wanted to make your meager money and never accomplish anything while not really givin af, great. for advancement, you had to sell your soul and brown nose for months then hope and pray you got that 50 cent promotion with 100% more responsiblities. rinse and repeat."
good,"I enjoy working at Target, I had unusually work schedules towards the end of my career. I was working overnight and some early mornings. I was the Logistic Backroom Team Lead, working closing with the Receiving Team Lead. Always making sure of constant reorganizing of merchandise that flowed between the backroom and sales floor for replenishment."
good,"You get all types of people that come into Target, all age groups, looking for something. You have to not only help guests, you have to zone (straighten shelves), do go back carts, and restock your section. It's a very ""on time"" type of job. There's a place for everything, and everything should be in it's place, exactly."
good,a typical day at target would be to go in do reshops and do the push if any was there. you would walk around and help customers and go to the back if they needed anything that wasn't on the sales floor. sometimes there will be customers that will just come in and be very angry for no reason and you still have to be nice to them
good,However they do not pay enought money and do not give workers 40 hrs a week. I had to keep swapping shifts to make a 40 hr work week. Which caused me to work all kinds of crazy hours.
good,"Early mornings were tough, because we had to work when everyone was just  getting up"
good,"I loved working with friends here. They're never low on hours they actually encourage people to pick up more hours when available. Things I didn't like were how much work was expected for one person to do. Managers were sorry, they picked favorites while they overworked other team members."
good,"A typical day a work for me is I come in read my email to see what my store leader needs, I see if I have any call outs or if anybody called in late, I print all paper work I need for my truck unload and head downstairs to set up my unload. When my team comes in we unload sometimes a big truck or small such as 1878 or 2534. Once the unload is complete the team heads upstairs to stock the shelves before the store open at 8 am.  Around 6 am is where the team goes home and process is complete."
good,"The co-workers are nice. The work is easy to learn. It just seems as if you want to learn something new or transfer departments, it seems as if they don't want you to."
good,"Working with Target has been a great experience. "
good,Target is a decent place to work but the pay dosent match the busy work needed
good,Target Was A Great Job Except For The HORRIBLE Pay Compared To The Work We Did. Typically You Were Doing Things That Were'nt Even On Your Job Description. The Management Was Great Though Everyone Was Very Nice And Friendly.The Best Part Of The Job Was Talking With My Managers And Co-workers In The Break Room They Were Really Cool And We Always Had Laughs. The Hardest Part About The Job Was How Some Of My Co-workers Could Never Do Their Job Right So I Was Covering Their Tracks So I Didnt Get In Trouble.
good,"if you like working at a face pace then its your kind of job. "
good,Target is very employee friendly and a positive enviorment to work.
good,"Target started off great, but started to fizzle when I realized that caring for team members is just a facade. Everything is about the sale, and how to make/save money for the company."
good,"Expectation is 10 hours plus each day"
good,"My responsibility was sales floor, back room, cashier, and guest service. Processed multiple transaction, greeted customers, pulled items from the back, put merchandise back on the floor, trained in the electronic center."
good,working at target is a modernate working area for people who wants to start a first job after finishing high school.
good,"Helping guests in multiple areas of the store"
good,"A very simple job consisting of logging in items and pulling them out to restock the sales floor every hour through use of a PDA. Simple job, but very time-consuming, little-to-no downtime."
good,"If you have a good management staff, your experience with Target will be very much enjoyable, fun, exciting and a place you'll want to be. Days are all pretty much the same back to back. I did learn a lot working with Target, but I did get tired of some of the management. The hardest part was dealing with the on-the-spot stressful moments. The most enjoyable part was being able to have a fun workplace. They did have a lot of events going, and hired friendly people."
good,Great pay simple job but not easy. management was hard to find if you had a question. other shifts did not clean as they went making it harder for you to keep you area clean.
good,"Created brand new team to ensure guest data was clean, accurate and updated per defined cadence.  Leveraged experts to learn data quality techniques and also defined my own techniques that changed the way data stewards looked at their data.  Learned many new things during this role that I have used in daily training conversations and brainstorming sessions."
good,Love to work in the warehouse but the staff and supervisor were more on advancment then taking care of there employees. on a typical night i would be working in a area were its a three man job and ill be taking the challenge of completing the job at hand. I exceeded there expectations and did not receive no recognition threw 3 years.
good,"My typical day at Target is just a usually fun and fast pace environment. I learned that I can look up a product that a guest brought up to see if we have anymore in the store or in the backroom, the management is good and my co-workers are fun to work with. The hardest part of the job is that you have to keep your score up and you have to keep asking every guest to see if they have a Target red card and ask them if they want to save 5% by signing up for a Target Debit or Target credit card. Finally, the most enjoyable part of the job is that I can talk to different guests as they come down to my register so they can have a nice and safe checkout without have any problems."
good,"This company was alright. I didn't mind interacting with customers and ringing people up, but if you didn't do it in an orderly fashion withing a certain time constraint. They'll warn you, then eventually get written up."
good,working overnight  it not  for every one and  truely messes with your eatting and sleeping  patterns
good,"Target is an okay work to place to work at. Most everybody is nice, it just is not for me."
good,"I absolutely have loved working for Target the last 11 years. While the job expectations can be hard to achieve at times, with the right people in place, (upper management) it always gets completed and I was able to have fun while doing it."
good,Average place always make sure you are working on something. Co-workers are nice people. Most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customers there satisfied and finding the things they need.
good,"A typical day would include walking the department, checking on day to day tasks with the associates, as well as talking with customers at service desk."
good,"A typical day being a cashier clock in to work,going to the register i am a sign to loge in an started great customers.I enjoyed my co workers which became some of my friends.The hard part was standing most of the day an bagging groceries, all an all i just enjoyed doing that i would love to do it again"
good,it was a great place to work and the people were very nice. fast friendly service.
good,"A typical day at work would be running the cashier, greeting customers, helping them when needed, stocking shelves, cleaning. management was great, never had a problem. The hardest part of the job was memorizing where the products were in the store, but I mastered it pretty quickly. the most enjoyable part of the job was definitely working with the people, even though i met some rude people it was well worth being patient when i came across the kindest people who came shopping."
good,"Big retail chains like this are hard to review for because each employee's experience depends mostly on the quality of store management, and this can vary wildly from store to store. Consider this a disclaimer: If you decide to work for Target, your experience may differ greatly from mine."
good,It's a good company to work for. Great benefits and compensation.
good,I was working two jobs including Target and going to school. My managers were aware of this an they scheduled during times of other things i was already committed to. Its like they prepared me to fail.
good,"it was a job, a stepping stone, but I made some good connections there and I know I am welcomed back if ever I need a job."
good,"I started off as a cashier. you are told when to go to break and lunch. cashiers are responsible for stocking bags and keeping your register clean. I got promoted years later to Guest Service Adviser which is a supervisor for the front end of the store. Responsible for counting money, telling cashiers when breaks are lunches are. I like this position but it didn't offer much raise but 20 cent. this job has a lot of duties but doesn't offer much. hours are limited, and other managers don't do anything else. there is a lot of stress for not enough pay. once you began to move up with this company and began to make good money they find a reason to let you go. this is a great job for a college student."
good,I learned a great deal of team work and leadership. Being able to gather statistics from shopping habits of guests and use information to build presentation for maximum sales. Knowledgably of food safety. A typical day would consist of helping guest over and beyond. Constructing end-caps for presentation. Building teams to keep the store in check and brand.
good,I learned a lot about how security works at Target and what it takes to keep store losses down. My manager at the time was one of the most fair and loyal managers I have ever had. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unruly customers. The most enjoyable part was my coworkers and my managers.
good,"The store I worked for was great, outside of some things that often bothered me. However a typical day at work was coming in, picking up where the person before me left off, taking care of returns/exchanges/helping guests leave the store with a smile on their face. I learned a lot about retail and how to handle situations that I wouldn't have learned had I not worked there. My management was great, always willing to help out and listen to make sure that we got everything we needed done. My co-workers were just a nice, most of them were always willing to help and make sure tasks got finished. The hardest part of the job was getting shouted at by angry guests that would come into the store when they were upset. The best part of the job was making people happy."
good,"There was very little ability to talk to people, everybody spoke a different language. The mornings were long because we started at 3AM and ended at 8AM. We didn't get much more than the average worker in pay and our job was way more dangerous and difficult."
good,"I have mixed feelings:  I have made many friends over the years and have had good benefits and a dependable job, but lately the company has cut hours to the point of being unable to finish all daily tasks and driven many good people to leave and find work elsewhere.  While the emphasis on the store as a unified whole is good in theory, you are forced to balance the needs of the store with the needs of your department and often times one of them suffers.  Managers can be very helpful and energetic but it often times comes off as fake or forced.  Over the years, Target has gone from hiring experienced, strong leadership to graduates straight out of college with little in-store experience.  As of today, I would only recommend working in a Target store part-time as a student or supplemental income."
good,Great entry level position out of college. Valuable experience and heavy focus on individual's development. Opportunity for advancement for strong performers. The company truly cares about their employees and places a heavy focus on the employees and requires such behaviors from their leaders.
good,A day for me working at Target would be constantly climbing and moving around working in the stockroom. I learned how Target operate when filling merchandise and stocking the sales floor. The management was okay some were easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was maintaining the stockroom due some people being careless about properly back stocking the items. The most enjoyable part was working in a group.
good,"Target is a decent company depending on the department.  As with many companies, who you know and who knows you is a big thing with Target. However, Facilities Management is a great department to work in but there is very little room for advancement once you become a Facilities Technician"
good,"very busy helping out guest with prints"
good,"Fast fun & friendly is the motto.Coworkers and management are friendly. Nice atmosphere to work in (we play music at my store...It helps).  I received on the job training and earned my pharmacy technician license. The guest are pleasant once you get to know them."
good,"A typical day at work-- making sure the guest is happy"
good,"- Typical day at work consisted of constant change.  You had to adapt to what the day brought you. "
good,Everyday I come to work and wait for the boxes to be unloaded from the truck and then I push the product to the shelves. The hardest part of the job is trying to handle all of the product on days when we are receiving a large shipment. The most enjoyable part of the job is when management orders food for us to keep the morale up.
good,"typical day fast pace"
good,Great place to work in if I had an opportunity to work there again I would but not in night shift. This job opportunity helped me regain my people skills.
good,"Fast and always learning something new"
good,There were some great workers there. The pay was nice. The only problem was some of the managers were unfairly.
good,"A typical work day at Target was very busy, and fun. Working at Target was a great experience because it taught me different things like how to push an item, how to stock items, how to work as a team, and much more. Target also taught me how to make sure everything was neat. The hardest part of the job was working as a team because some people didn't work as fast as others. The most enjoyable part was helping the guest around the store."
good,"Select orders for all Target stores all perishables. Meat,deli produce, and ambient product."
good,"If you're interesting in learning how to work in the retail market, then Target is as good a place as any to start. I find that the regular sales floor workers (for the most part) are a lot of hard working individuals, barring a few exceptions. I can say the same for low level management as well. The issue for me comes with the majority of the upper level management, the executives. I've seen far too many of them either not know what's going on in their departments (leaving their unrealistic demands with lower level managers). I think this could easily be remedied if each executive was obligated to train in each position under them, in order to engender a deeper understanding of the people working under them."
good,"A typical day at work usually consist of merchandise protection, at least one apprehension, and recovering pilferage. I have learned how to properly follow routines, how to keep consent communication, and proper investigative skills. Management is some times short of staff but productive in the store. Most of my co-workers are very hard working and consistent through out the day, they are also friendly and open with communication. The hardest part of the job is not getting side tracked and staying on top of the routines in a timely manner. At times we get a lot of customers and co-workers who ask us to perform other task for them that may throw us off schedule with our own routines or apprehensions. The most enjoyable part of the job I believe are the apprehensions. It's a good feeling knowing you are properly protecting your store."
good,My experience to date has been pleasant. This company made a considerable effort to ensure that people with an exceptional amount of natural talent and strong business acumen are driving for results in a highly competitive climate.
good,"The company pays very well, however they are attempting to place to many jobs under one umbrella, which doesn't allow for a very balanced work life schedule. The big picture is that this is a great company for a single up and comer, all othere proceed with caution"
good,"This job was easy at first but slowly became stressful because things weren't ordered on time at the restaurant area of the store, then they switched me to cashier which was fun and easy."
good,"Its a pretty standard part-time job. A job where the management looks to squeeze as much from you, for as cheaply as they can. Other then that you build strong relationships. would say a good job for some extra money"
good,"Target was a great place to work.  I learned so much about so many different aspects of the retail world.  Overall, I worked with some fantastic people, and made some really good friends in the process.  I was initially hired on as seasonal help, but after a month of working, was hired permanently, and promoted.  I enjoyed working not only with the customers, but also learning about logistics and what it takes to get goods on the shelf and out the door!"
good,There are a lot of great people that work here. You have to always be on your toes and constantly working. You do get a good amount of rest but you are always trying to catch up and be ahead.
good,On a typical day work we would start at 4 am and would end around 9 am. At this job I learned how to be a team leader and get things done at a quick paste. Management is okay but it could be better. My co-workers are fun to work around and hard working people. the hardest part of this job is keeping a maintainable paste for everybody to keep up. the most enjoyable part of this job is working with my co-workers and providing quality customer service to the customers.
good,"On a typical day i would help customers with returns, exchanges and other issues.  i learned how to assist customers on anything they needed.  management was often to busy to no everything that was going on or wasn't going on.  The hardest part of this job was having to do your job along with other co-workers jobs because they would find excuses not to do it.  The most enjoyable part of this job was when management did recognize how well i was doing."
good,"I didn't know who was a good and true coworker or not, I didn't know my rights and wrongs well enough. I was young and didn't feel at home at the business. I wanted to be me but had to keep my thoughts to myself. Sadly mostly the only comfort I found was in the customers I helped check out, or find their way around the store."
good,"Retail overall is a tough industry to work in. You work long hours (12-14 hour days) and there is little appreciation, but more work to be done. "
good,"On a typical workday I check the system via PDA and see what items in the back room stored as inventory have been sold or have empty locations on the sales floor. These items are pulled, and then pushed to their respective spots on the sales floor. However, I also work in almost every other area of the store; I unload trucks, I cashier, I help guests in the electronics area, and I also work the sales floor assisting guests storewide. Overall Target workdays are smooth and fun; the team members are friendly and guests can be fun. The main downside is the low pay per hour along with the limited hours make for small pay days."
good,The job provides very good benefits. The people I work with are very friendly and a pleasure to work with. They are very willing to work with your schedule.
good,"It's a great place to work, especially right after college. There are a lot of young people throughout the company and they want you to feel welcome.  You work hard in MP, but the benefits make it worth the while."
good,"set up deli for the day make sandwcihes and customer service, cashier"
good,"good part time job- flexible scheduling,great for college students,seasonal workers,retirees"
good,"A typical day while I worked at Target would start at 4 am. I would wake up, get dressed in my red shirt and khakis, then be on my way to start my shift at 4:30 am. At work I would make my way to the backroom and collect the boxes of the unload truck and put them onto pallets and make my way back to my work area next to the socks and unload the boxes into separate shopping carts according to women's, men's, intimates, socks, boys, girls, and babies. As this went on, I would keep going until all the boxes were unpacked and on a usual day, I worked alone and had to move fast. Softlines, clothing, usually gets as many as four pallets in one shipment so it was very important to move fast. A huge problem was always how much backstock was received. You always get boxes and boxes of the same item in the same size but never the sizes that were needed. And after you finished certain areas, the backroom would send out the autopull which is the backstock from the day before and you would have to complete the autopull before you finished any task which would take up a majority of your time seeing that the autopull is mixed of every section of clothing. The management was well and did always ask if I needed help which was nice, but some days they would not let us know if we had to leave early so we would in fact get in trouble for working over our time, but when they only have one person working a section with 16 boxes a pallet and 4 pallets a day, it was not easy. The co-workers were always nice and for it being so early morning, they were always very nice and cheerful. If anyone ever needed"
good,A typical day at work was simple help guest with carry outs and make sure there enough carts inside other then that if you had free time help out wherever you could.
good,"A typical day at Target started at 7am and ended at 5pm. My daily responsibilities included total store operations follow-up and communication. The Management would take 15-20 minutes reviewing sales and checking emails then we would walk the store for a list of daily wins and operations to address. We would have daily huddles where the entire team addressed big store issues and discuss sales and upcoming news and changes that may be occurring. The morning would be very focused around directing employee tasks and follow-up as well as customer service. After lunch the management team would be available on the floor helping hourly team members zone and deliver customer service. Usually I was Leader on Duty from 12pm-5pm so I would run the business and ensure all employees were on task. I learned Exceptional leadership skills through my career with Target. During District training and my partnerships with other leaders. I understand how to manage people, stay organized and ensure that operations are executed to a company standards. The most challenging part of being an Executive Team Leader at Target was continuing to challenge myself to give and receive feedback to co-workers. I was always trying to improve my skills and the skills of others and ensuring you make enough time to do this and keep the store running was definitely a challenge. I enjoyed the outcome of being a part of a hard working management team that was seen as #1 in our district based off of operational, financial and service results."
good,"This job was an average cashier job with an exceptional team spirit. Daily goals were set to open new store credit and debit accounts with store guests'. Also, suggest replacement plans for all electrical appliances."
good,"If I have more to write at a later date, I will update this to better suit others."
good,"This was an internship, so I was an Asst. Store Manager. The hours were really long, but they did allow you to decide what holiday you wanted to work and which one you did not."
good,"This was a seasonal job for me. I really didn't get a chance to work with management much, but for the most part the people were friendly and helpful. They didn't mind helping anyone in need and they were flexible and understanding when it came to ones personal life."
good,"A typical day consists of providing the best guest service possible. I started as a seasonal team member but have since grown and learned the business itself, as well as being able to lead a group of team members toward the success of the company."
good,Good company to work for and Good people to work with. Competitive Company that tries work hard for its guests.
good,"A fun and friendly environment. Encouraging team members, effective team leaders."
good,Had to leave company to seek better opportunities. I was there for five years. Very flexible with schedule which was of great help especially while attending college. Received HEB's Scholarship.
good,"It would be a great place to work if they paid more, that is the only part about the job that brings it down . Perfect if you are in high school or college. wiling to work around any schedule you give."
good,"It is a good company to work for but the environment is very dry. Company expect way too high of expectation out of the individuals (95% -100%). If your adherence score is below 95%, chance is you will no longer have your job."
good,I have definitely learned how to deal with daily situations and personalities but I have also  seen the difference between management and leadership and how employees can be affected  by it.
good,I would not recommend this company for overnight unless in need of winter work and you believe you can work with the compensation.
good,"coming in and unloading trucks, i learned a lot with the logistics process, the management is fare, co-workers are great to get along with, the most enjoyable part is that we are rewarded with snacks and lunches."
good,Overall I did enjoy working for this company. I think it is a great corporation.
good,"-Leader on duty"
good,It was a very good experience. It was very hard work. It could be very tiring at times but I got the job done. The other employees were very nice to work with.
good,"This was also a fun, fast paced work environment. I learned strong customer service skills and had great experiences with managment. The hardest part of the job would be seasonal hoidays with black friday at the top of the list. The most enjoyable part of my job was connecting with people and giving advice whether it be for movies, music or games."
good,"I enjoyed working here part-time while starting college. My co-workers were awesome, but it is a retail schedule. Therefore, the schedule was never consistent."
good,"A permanent position where my skills and resources"
good,It is a great place to work at but I have hit my limit as a cashier and it looks like the management is not willing to train their employees for them to move up in various positions so they can obtain better skills and advance in pay.
good,Enjoyed working with customers answers phone and dispatched to the right departments
good,"Taught Team work and Diligence at this Company, "
good,Decent company to work for; make sure you have clear expectations between you and your superior.  Ask for what you need and be clear about your goals and results.
good,Target was great had a lot good opportunities  but the management was always changing.
good,This is a good part time job but they remind you of how replaceable you are with the smallest of mistakes.
good,"Very Busy"
good,"Typical day as a GSTL is opening by preparing every cash register, opening up guest services and starting to sort every piece of merchandise that was scattered by customers from the previous day and found by overnight crew.  The rest of the day involves running from one end of the checkout to the other to resolve customer complaints, going up to guest services to get chewed out by a customer trying to return an item they bought from another store and taking it with a big smile on your face and pushing your team to get REDcards.  If I remember correctly, goals for weekdays were about 20 per day and around 30 on the weekends.  Some perks of the job include a 10% employee discount (with 5% on top if you have the REDcard credit or debit card).  The biggest complaint I had about the job is that you really can't trust anyone and you'll have to tip toe around people's ""sensitivity.""  I will say though, if you are like myself and enjoy helping people, this job can be rewarding when you go above and beyond for your peers and customers, but in the end it just wasn't worth it for me."
good,"A typical day at Target is hectic in the morning to ensure staffing and volume match then throughout the shift is mostly just balancing out to ensure goals are met. Development is the biggest focus here, that could be good or bad depending on who you were. If you were liked then you were pushed to the front, regardless of how well you ran a shift. Very competitive with co-workers for advancement opportunities. The hardest part was playing the ""corporate game"". I will say development wise, whether you stayed at Target or not, they prepared you for corporate life."
good,"Retail!! Long, crazy hours. You could be working during the day one week and be required to work overnight the next week (high volume store)."
good,On a given day working at Target I had to unload the the truck of new items and stock shelves. We were allowed to do this in 4 hours which sometimes was not possible
good,The management was good. I loved working with customers. The co-workers were friendly.
good,"Good structure, occasionally fun due to great co-workers. but overall its still a good job"
good,I enjoy working with coworkers learned different skills and roles everyday
good,"- Very well structured work process always did a lot  of repetition the only difference was the amount of freight each night"
good,Typical day was spent solving theft or operational related issues. Learned a lot about partnerships with community and how to delegate with others. Fun job but it grew stale with me after six years.
good,"Being in Asset Protection its a fun place to work and you work alone most of the time. You learn how to read peoples body language and you get to know a lot of different people. You have managers over different sections of the store and you have the opportunity to interact with all of them. You patrol the store and the parking lot to make sure everyone is safe and secure. You are able to inventory your merchandise so you can manage your profits and losses. The hardest part is when you have to apprehend someone so is violent and wants to fight you, but that's your job and we are trained to be professionals at it."
good,I enjoy setting all the new pogs and filling with all the freight. Setting with all the new signage and actually completing the job. I take great satisfaction when all is complete and lokks great
good,Its was an ok experience working for this company just wish they had better things to offer their associates for working for them
good,"Target was a place where you start slow and eventually work your way up. Their is much room to grow. The managers and my co workers were always helpful and willing to go above and beyond. we had a young but dedicated crew, and we all stayed grounded and knew what we were to do."
good,I work on the Planogram Team in setting the store planograms as directed by HQ.  Target is very leadership driven and can often times overshadow the ordinary team members making them feel insignificant in the grand scheme of the company.
good,"A typical day involved monitoring the activities of your team, reading reports, performing investigations and walking store visits during announced and unannounced store visits. I learned how to investigate internal theft, how to manage a large team, how to lead a visit and work in a management team. My co workers were hard working individuals who gave everything they had, we were all typically straight out of college and had no understanding of how retail worked nor the hours expected of us. The pay was great, but the hours were long and work life balance often suffered. The hardest part of the job was the expectations and long hours. It was not acceptable to do a good job, everything was expected to be great, every day, every night.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the pay and my management team, we made as much fun as possible, despite the high stress."
good,My time at Target was a good experience. A typical day at would be me meeting new people everyday and helping guests with whatever they needed. The management at Target was good. Not very understanding though. My most enjoyable part of working there would have to be my co-workers. They were amazing people and fun to be around. They made the day go by fast and made work very enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers. Dealing with upset guests made me learn patience.
good,"Target is a great corporation. They really make an emphasis in the way team members and guest are treated. They make it a core role to recognize others for their hard work as well as making sure each team member is acknowledging each guest for great customer service. They have various resources available to all team members and guest regarding every matter. Safety, security, and cleanliness is another high priority and is treated with specific guidelines. "
good,"Routines and Best Practice. Work/Life Balance not bad, and compensation pretty good.  Becomes a bit of a popularity contest for promotion."
good,Great management program for people who are interested in retail environments
good,"My daily tasks will be to communicate with vendors by placing orders and follow-up of orders placed, in charge of the inventory and stocks.  Assist customers as needed and assist in other departments as needed.  Use forklift as needed."
good,"Productive; Not Fair all of the time"
good,"Team oriented enviroment "
good,Target is a great company with lots of focus on development.
good,"I enjoy having a job, but I don't really enjoy working here. I do try to make the best of what I have, but i'm really not happy at all."
good,Better than the competition.  Great exercise was an unexpected perk that I miss.
good,Helping customers and making sure the sales floor look neat. Sometimes helping ring up customers when the stores was busy. 
good,"A typical day at work included a variety of tasks and responisbilities as I was a jack of all trades, master of none. Parking lot attendant, pulling carts, restocking shelves, assisting cusomers, attending the customer service desk, pulling stock from the back room. I learned the inner working of retail. I found management efficient for the most part, and helpful. My co-workers were a joy to work with daily, especially in such a fast-paced store as Target. The hardest part of the job was working holidays. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,"Never a stressful day, everybody helps everybody.  We were all treated equally.  I would not mind ever working for them again. "
good,"-Great opportunities for project experience"
good,"Target Corporation's central focus in on customer service, and this is consistently emphasized, albeit not always in the most effective of methods. However, this commitment is consistently and clearly demonstrated to every employee."
good,Great set of rules and policies. Pay is near minimum wage in stores and is very competitive for advancement.   
good,"Putting clothes back onto the floor,pulling merchandise from the backroom and putting it on the sales floor, cleaning the area and other parts of the store, answering phone and helping guests. I learned how to ask for help instead of taking on to much work, and how to create mutual work relationships. I felt like the management were more focused on their own personal advancement than leading by example. My co-workers were friendly and very helpful and informative. The most enjoyable part were team huddles and fun activities or free food in the break room. "
good,"A typical day at work can have a range of responsibilities including cashiering, restocking, setting planograms, preparing re-shops, helping our guests, resetting our salesfloor for the next business day, and even directing all incoming phone calls while monitoring our fitting room. I have learned how to multi-task to complete many projects, how to work in large groups to complete large projects and how to interact with respectfully with co-workers in a large scale environment. My management is decent most work hard for there dedicated areas, however many managers do not know much about areas of the store that are not directly related to their areas. The co-workers in my area are mostly young college aged students and recent high school graduates so it can be difficult to relate at times however they are all very nice girls. The hardest part of my job is not being able to control issues that arise is our area, when I am not there. The most enjoyable part of this job is helping guests and seeing how truly grateful they are for great customer service."
good,Target has taught me a lot of leadership skill and how to build on those skills. 
good, 
good,"I learned to prepair and audit a budget "
good,"Target is a great environment to work to help customers on a daily basis. I basically helped customers find the items that fits their needs and budget. In addition, when I moved up as a stock clerk. I still continued to help customers while placing items on shelves. The hardest part about the job is dealing with unsatisfied customers about an item they want to return. "
good,I had great people at my job. I would lead the store in its daily operations and manage all those on the sales floor. 
good,"first retail job, learned basics of retail, honed customer service skills. hardest part was holiday rushes, chaos of guest services and returns at holiday times with unreasonable guests. was easy as long as i followed company protocol for directing appropriate cases for higher ups. long hours standing but good hours for income."
good,"My experience at Target was very far from what I expected.  Before I got hired, I did a lot of research to learn about how employees are treated.  Being that it was my first job right out of college, I did not pay much attention to what some of the former employees wrote about the company.  I quickly dismissed anything negative about the company because I thought they were all ""disgruntled and bitter"" ex-employees.  Sadly I had to learn it first hand.  My experience was ruined during my first week in ""Business College"" for Executive Team Leaders.  I was very excited and filled with energy when I showed up and met my trainer.  Unfortunately she didn't feel the same way because she gave me a pep talk that sounded more like a scare tactic to help me quit.  At the time I was unaware that I could request a new trainer.  During my training I felt suffocated just about every day she was there.  She had me on a leach and wouldn't allow me do anything by myself.  I understand that I was new and was still in training, but the other Executives In Training (EITs) had a very different experience than I did because their trainers were not as up tight.  She had a cut-throat attitude because she was gunning for a promotion and didn't mind crushing anyone perceived as an obstacle or a threat.  The underhanded backstabber made me feel worthless every time I left and dreaded waking up in the morning to go to work.  I knew what was going on, but how could I talk to someone about it without feeling paranoid?  Besides, she told her workmates what she wanted them to know.  If you're a new hire or"
good,Worked unloading trailers.  The management was very demanding and always pushed us to get our numbers.  Quality of work didn't seem to be as important as quantity.  My co workers where excellent people and I made many lasting friendships.  The hardest part of the job was satisfying management.  The most enjoyable part was coming home from a hard day and realizing I had done my best.  
good,"For the most part i worked the customer service desk, so i handled all the returns and credit card payments, recall items among other things. I learned to multitask being that i was doing a lot of things at once while working here. Management was great and my coworkers were too. The hardest part of the job was the hours, i would sometimes work up to 2am and always working weekends. I loved being able to deal with people all day."
good,You had to stay working very late
good,Target offers chances for advancement as long as you put in the work. Co-workers are friendly and can be a joy to work with. Management will continue to increase your workload when you are trying to promote.
good,They didn't pay much but they respected that people have lives outside of the work place.
good,"Everyday wasn't bad, the only negative thing about working here were the management. Co-workers were mostly cool, could've been better."
good,Target truly is a great place to work in terms of talent and development. Your development is your own and there is always room to grow.
good,Helped guest with electronic products and questions. Making sure inventory is up to date. Report to Leader on duty. Keep working area a clean and safe place.
good,"Typically, its an okay place to work at. Everyone there kind of hates being there but they are fun to be with. Management usually contradicts policies set in place and hardly ever side with the employee. Its basically customer service so depending on what mood the customer is in, it will either be an enjoyable experience or a horrendous experience."
good,"Target is a great company. The management takes care of you, trains you, makes sure you have a sufficient amount of hours. You have a five minute window both ways for clocking in and are supervised minimally throughout the day. This is good, no feeling of being watched all the time."
good,"I only worked there for about a month during the Christmas season right after Katrina, so my review for this job may be inaccurate."
good,i have been with the company for 7 years and have tried to advance many times but didnt get anything. I am trained in just about every area of the store and have gone through 2 store remodels and worked at 4 different stores and i have been told i am not qualified enough to hold a leadership role. I love the company and its goals but some of the people in management need to be termed.
good,"Compensation is just a little above minimum wages. Annual raise are ridiculous. We're talking fifteen cents at best. There are a lot of advancement opportunity depending on the availability of the position, which only opens up if someone leaves or promotes out of that position. A lot of interaction with guest and team members, so it never gets boring, but you still have to deal with all the issues of major retail."
good,guest service and cashier.
good,Good experience to work with different kind of individual and from different background and leant more about cleaning
good,I worked to unload 1-2 trucks per night during the Christmas season. The hardest part of the job was learning the read the planograms. I learned back of house procedures.
good,You get to test your customer service abilities. Great for extra cash.
good,It was a great job for the holidays. I Love photograph so this was the perfect job for me.
good,it was a life learn listen 2 work around people of different creed everyday i learned something new from each otherf
good,I learned quite a bit about the field and loved my co workers.
good,cashiering
good,On a typical day at work I would be standing by the cash register ringing customers up.
good,Great place to start your career. Very competitive work environment and company is beginning to become more about the results than the team.
good,"Each team member is very friendly and helpful. We all work as a team to complete tasks. Management is alright, they are consistent with collaborating with the team members on their duties and if there are any concerns."
good,A typical day at work started at 6am with daily announcements and recognition followed by warming up for work. We would then receive our job assignments for the day. We had breaks at 10:30-11:00 and 2:30-3:00. The management was available if needed but left us to work as we knew what needed to be done. Some job functions required team work while others were done by ones self. The hardest part of the job was probably working the weekends for 5 years. The best part was having four days off.
good,Overall a typical day at work was never the same. As an LOD you are responsible for making sure the store is guest ready and that you are optimizing tasks to drive sales and payroll. I learned a lot in this job and it felt good to know that I was collaborating with my peers to help drive a single store to make over 40 billion dollars in a year. My coworkers were very welcoming and very driven on managing talent by delegating tasks and jumping in as a team when needed.
good,"Each day would consist of zoning and doing go backs. I learned how to stock, set up shelves, cashiering, and assisting in back up in electronics and pharmacy. Occasionally I would work in the clothing department and market. Management was very serious and knew what they needed done. The hardest part of the job would be working during the holiday rush. Getting trained in new departments and learning new things was the most enjoyable part."
good,"It's all about dealing with helping entitled shoppers. They pay is HORRIBLE, but its easy enough and they let you off whatever days you want."
good,"I loved my job at Target Portrait Studio. My co-workers were the best. My manger on the other hand was not the best. I started to get sick at the end of November I worked through it until, It had gotten very bad. She took my kindness for weakness and over worked me, she did not higher enough people for the season. we were all over worked sick and tired. she did not know how to mange ever, when we were busy on the weekends she would leave early. I loved my other two co-workers as for the manger, yes her work is great,but she could use another sensitivity training and management classes"
good,"A typical day greet customers at door, wonder about and look for discarded packages from theft. Record what items are missing from inventory’s and move cameras around to monitor those items. Use CCTV to monitor both customers and coworkers. Assist and report to local law enforcement. Detain theft suspect and recover stolen merchandise. I learned Targets CCTV systems and security standards. Mangers were fine but I typically didn’t interact with them to much unless there was a serious security concern."
good,"Typical day at work involved dealing with guests, some of which who could be extremely volatile. Also would help my direct supervisors with some of their duties including assisting other team members. I learned a lot about the way work places such as Target function. The biggest issue with Target was the supervisors who were higher up on the chain, i.e; the bosses of my direct supervisors. They are known as ETLs, and they basically treat the team members as cattle, in the sense that they make you feel you are expendable and not quite important. The most enjoyable part of the job, by far, were the co-workers and direct supervisors, all of whom were amazing."
good,"they never hire people for full time, hours can vary from nine hours one week, to thirty the next and you never know if or when the hours will change. understaffed is an understatement. only a ten percent discount, always pressure to sign people up for credit cards with high interest rates. I was hired for one position, and ended up filling eleven peoples positions without pay raise. average pay rate, little advancement and very small annual raises. there are at least five bosses, and they all want you to do five different things at the same time, and lack communication."
good,I learned how to use a lot of machinery and become certified and glad I did because a lot of business rather you be certified in those before working with them. My co-workers were the best and kept me going probably one of the best team playing organizations ever. The hardest part of the job was the major change in the management and getting use to it. The most enjoyable part was probably pushing merchandise on the sales floor and pulling cafs.
good,The training of skills provided are hard to get used to considering that everybody does everything different. Had a few problems with co-workers and a manager or two didn't quite help the situation but other than that it was a rather fun and interesting job.
good,Greeted customers
good,"For a typical work day, team members and I, work to make the best of our shifts while putting smiles on our guests faces. My co-workers are very supportive in all decisions, which makes us one big family. The hardest part working here is having disagreements with guests when it is obvious that they are wrong. However, we abide by all rules to make sure the guests are satisfied. The most enjoyable part of this job is to be able to just feel comfortable."
good,My job is to interact with guests in finding solutions to their needs and also helping them realize other actual or potential needs as well.
good,"I felt like it was just work, but employees were still friendly!"
good,"A typical day for me at Target is working on the salesfloor. That means that I take all the returned items or re-shop from guest services and put it in the correct places on the salesfloor. I am also trained to answer cashier back-up calls when lines get too long. I answer questions guests have both in the store and by phone. I have strengthened my communication skills, cashiering skills, confidence at Target. I used to feel more like a team and that managers cared about my advancement. However, that really isn't much of the case anymore. I just feel like most of the managers don't even care about Target...it's just a job to them. Most of my co-workers are friendly, but some like petty drama. The hardest part about the job is I don't get paid enough for the work I do, and once January hits hours are cut drastically low. I've been there a few years now, and I had only 12-16 hours for the week. I can't live on that. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I can get my section looking nice during my shift. I feel very accomplished when my section looks good."
good,"Target is fast,fun and friendly workplace, typical day start with filling the shelves with products before guest starting shopping. I learned to be courageous and resilient amidst every difficulties, management have open door policy, always creating enjoyable work environment and team/guest satisfactions."
good,"Target is a great company to work for, Unfortunately Target is not to good at realizing good skilled worker with inside the store and only take a assessment on employees to see if they are qualified to get a raise or be promoted but only once a year. They feed you lies just to get you to work harder for them. Its true that the customers make the store but at the same time your employees the store associates also are the ones that make the store without out us there would be nobody to run the store. Management could do it but that would mean less sleep for them and more paperwork to be done but not finished. Only thing that is asked is to treat the employees better and stop trying to under pay them so much and they wouldnt have to worry about having to always worry about employees leaving the company to work for another company."
good,Good place to work but seasonal position. I worked in mulitple departments each day.
good,"I was a Sales Floor Team Member at Target. I would walk around the store and help out the guests who needed help. Also you get a certain section that you are in charge of each night (ex. Mens, Kids, Lingere/Acessories, etc.) and you have to keep the area looking nice and clean for the shoppers. Occasionally, I had to operate the cashier to back up the front end when there were a lot of guests checking out. My job was only a seasonal position and also my first job. It was great interacting with people and it gave me some insight on what to expect in the workforce. For the most, I think that the managers were pretty cool. They did their job and did what they could to ensure everyone had a great shopping experience. I can't speak for every Target but at the one I worked at, I loved my co-workers. They were fun to work with and very helpful."
good,"A typical day at work can be rigorous and stressful. The hours of the pharmacy are only 10 hour work days therefore the amount of work is greater considering we're trying to accomodate the small window of time the pharmacy is open. I learned and developed great organizational skills as well as time managment. I learned how to maximaize my time. I enjoy working relationships with my team of co-workers! The hardest part of my day is the latter part simply because I am a perfectionist and I desire to complete all my task by all means by the end of my work day. The most pleasurable part of my day is providing great guest service by helping my guest that are in need! All in all, I absolute love what it is I do on a day to day basis!"
good,"Productive work environment, co workers are friendly and outgoing."
good,good people to work with
good,"I learned a lot while at this job. The principles and fundamentals that the company are based on are seen in the management and are exemplified through the employees. A day on the job consisted of ongoing learning, cross-training, and many opportunities to improve."
good,"Good place to advance with good benefits, fun environment and fast paced. A little flexible with schedules,but is not particularly generous with paid vacations."
good,"Target is a good place to work if your looking for part time work. Every store is different with different upper mangers and team leads. Which means you may be working for a rude or decent caring leader, but a boss is a boss."
good,Enjoyable place to work and great people to work with. Many opportunities for advancement
good,"I personally love shopping at Target, it is one of my favorite big box stores."
good,"During an opening shift I would open the registrars and service desk, stock both with bags and other essentials and create a break schedule with coverage for front end team members. As the day went on I would answer guests concerns and questions, assist cashiers and keep a clean, obstacle free area with a good flow for guests. I enjoyed seeing my co-works and still consider many of them my friends. My immediate supervisors were great people who were always ready to answer any of my questions and listen to any concerns I might have. One of the least enjoyable parts of my job was how understaffed we were and the stressful result of that. Without the proper support it was difficult to get everything done correctly and quickly. I learned how to interact with several types of people, how to keep my cool in confrontational situations and what it meant to be a supervisor."
good,Target is a fairly good company to work for with opportunities to advance in the company. While working there one has the chance to acquire skills from different departments as well has work in multiple departments if so desired.
good,"My work duties are fitting room/operator, cashier, or sales floor member. I answer the phone while being an operator and assistant guest at the fitting room. When I'm a cashier that's where I get the most interaction with guest and customer service. The sales floor is pretty easy I zone, and assistant customers in the soft lines area, which is all clothing departments, jewelry, and infants/toddlers. I also pull items from the backroom for guests."
good,"A typical day at work with Target is very fast-paced. It's customers constantly coming to you or in your line. There are only a few down times but most of the day is very pressuring. Management really don't make themselves known. I've probably only known one manager and that's the one who've hired me.Co-workers were great and helpful. Older people who've been there for years but still in the same positions. Hardest part of the job is trying to get time off when you want it. Most enjoyable part is because it's always busy, time goes by quickly and then it's time to clock on out!!!"
good,"I ensured that customers needs were satisfied and that they had a satiisfying shopping experience.I managed the cashiers and cart attendants ,as well as, maintaining the front lanes setting endcaps and maintaining that they were well stocked. The hardest part of the job were the long hours and the changing weekly schedules. The most enjoyable part of the job was the atmosphere I enjoyed the people that I worked with and I love Target it is one of my favorite stores."
good,"Most co-workers are below par. A lot of physical labor as well as angry guests that constantly know more than you. When a rare good employee comes along, they are a treasure. Recognition for all the hard work put in by good employees is often neglected. If you make it past your 90 days, it's basically impossible to get fired. I work in clothing, and it can be overwhelming with how few of staff they schedule, especially during back to school."
good,Great benefits. Hard work.
good,Just overall experience was great tho throughout time i was there i learned that people come and go but i enjoyed every bit of it
good,I enjoyed working here but needed potential to make more money and advance and this did not fit that description.
good,"The team I work with is great. I have a lot of fun and a lot of room for development, but the support is not there from our executive team leaders. They are never down on the floor engaging them selves... They have some room for improvement.. but everything else is great."
good,"A typical day at target is OK you walk in say hello punch in then told what you are supposed to do it was enjoyable because the coworkers a are honestly fun to be around and the managers (GSTL'S) are a joy to work with and sometimes the store had a dedicated day such as ""chocolate day"" i did learn a lot from my time here how to handle angry guest how to talk to people even when there is a language barrier and how to handle situations before they get out of control the most enjoyable thing about the job was everyone knew each other well everyone knew me and they were like my second family Lots of love in the store with team members the hardest part of the job was dealing with angry people and since it was in an Asian Community language barrier was a problem at times"
good,Ive had issues with Target with my availabilty when I was in school and other days. My annual review was not what I expected and I felt like my feelings were hurt and I was put down and that my needs were not taken care of. I do like working the Starbucks area with my other coworkers. We have fun and get along but everyday some new rule is put into effect and it affects our ability to do our work the way we were trained to do.
good,This was a job that was short lived due to having complications with a pregnancy.
good,"I stock shelves while the store is still closed, and when the store does open for business in the morning, I help the Guests find what they need. My co-workers are fun and easy to get along with, it makes the day less stressful. The most difficult part of the job is getting everything accomplished within a time limit. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with your co-workers, and having fun events and contests in the break room."
good,"A typical day at work is going to your department, make sure its clean and help assist customers or ring up customers."
good,"typical day at work , got along with all my co- workers, the most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and meeting there needs. Custumers first."
good,this a great company for someone just starting a career. it is a fun place to work for the most part
good,A typical day for me was going into food ave while it was kinda busy with only one other person to work with or I would be by myself helping customers. I learned how to manage my time more efficiently and become more of an independent worker. Management over all was okay but there were a few people that would still run all over you for no reason. The co-workers where great I loved working with them! I always tend to work better as a team. The hardest part of my job i would have to say is cleaning up messes while preparing food for people and me being the only one there but I still manged to get everything done as needed. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers and making sure everyone was happy.
good,At that time was an overall good place to be employed. Team work was essential and employees were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was having to work the seasonal months. I enjoyed my team and appreciated all their hard work.
good,"A typical day at work involves a variety of tasks such as pushing freight, setting sales planners, interacting with customers, and developing and addressing team member performance. I have learned a lot about how to interact with employees and deal with many different situations as a manager in the company. It has been a great experience getting to know the co-workers that I have, it is a great opportunity to work with many different people, and get to network and build new relationships. The hardest part of the job is learning to balance all of the things you need to do and still be prepared for those unexpected situations that happen that cause you to reevaluate and rearrange the things that you need to do. It is all about prioritizing. The best part of my job has to be the relationships that I have gotten to build with the people I work with as well as the customers, I have gotten to meet so many people and learn so many different things from each of them."
good,"It was a good company to work for. I got promoted fast, but the raise was horrible. I did not get all the raises i was supposed to because of my promotion which I thought was not fair. Everyone is friendly but people tend to form cliques. The team members complained alot and it always seemed like the management team was never really helpful."
good,"Worked in the fitting room, answered phones, helped customers find items."
good,"Target is a company that expects almost more than can be accomplished in a normal work day. If you work hard, they will leave you alone. If you do not they will constantly be checking on you. I have no problem with that, I have always believed you should work the best that you can regardless of the pay. However, they do not reward the good, hard working employees with anymore than just the average ""Effective"" rating on their annual review. Basically giving the good and the bad team members all the same raise. They are very careful to rate you to an effective to keep the pay raise at the maximum they want to give for that year."
good,"My day at work would consist of setting planograms overnight. I also stocked or worked in the backroom. I loved this job because resetting the store and stepping back to look at my handy work made me feel like a creator. the management changed hands too much for my liking's but I guess that is part of the filtering process to get the best results. The hardest part of my day was leaving because I love to reset the store so when I leave I had to say to myself you will be back tonight to start it all over again so don't worry. some of my co-workers was a little bit to playful but, i tend to stick to my job and not get caught up in the playfulness."
good,Typical retail position. Low pay. Working with teenagers. On feet all day. Co-workers were good as long as they did their share.
good,Very busy from 6am to 8am unloading a truck every Monday and Wednesday. It was a very fun place to work just got hot in the stockroom because it did not have any air conditioner.
good,The (higher) management at Target are the epitome of corporate tools. They drive their employees into the ground while having no real expertise themselves.
good,Everyday was fast paced. You have to be able to keep up. It never really gets boring.
good,"Good place to work if no experience is under your belt. Minimum wage, advancement is unknown unless you really are interested in going up the target ladder and managing your own target. Hours is not fair to few and usually if you worked there for a long time you get more hours. If you looking for 20/hr week good place to go, but be aware of probably having a 8hr work week if you go to school after holidays. Good job security, good management, work/life balance is there as they are good with requests for days off. But not a money making job if that is what you looking for. If you looking with no experience with some change in your pocket then its a perfect job. If you looking for something to put food in the table and some then this is not for you"
good,"-Work follows a basic set of routines while maintaining a close eye on people to ensure the safety of guests and employees, while also keeping an eye out for potential theft."
good,"A typical day at work was busy. I always had something to do which is exactly what I need. I liked my co-workers. Management, to me, wasn't very organized."
good,Not a horrible place. But overtime it becomes a job you don't want to do for the rest of your life.
good,increase my skills as a Pharmacy Technician
good,At Target there was never a dead moment. The lines stayed busy with customers and also merchandise. As an employee there had fun the most helping my teammates and get our job done in a timely fashion. This store is hands on and was challenging at times and management wasn't all was the best of help but we didn't let that stop us from succeeding.
good,"Overall, this company was pretty okay to work for. It definitely stayed busy and the customers were polite for the most part. The training is good and the company does make their employees feel appreciated by doing special things for them each month. The only thing I disagreed with is when a family situation came up, management did not help well with it."
good,When I would come in to work I was in charge of setting up softlines and making sure everything was ready for the truck we would be receiving. I would head back to the truck and help them scan most days and work the truck. Then we sorted our work put it out and set new items. They came to me for questions and help. I loved being the head so I could assist them when they needed it. the hardest part of my job was the truck it usually took 2 hours and was physically exhausting but having the job of scanning was a huge honor because I set the flow of the whole day of work.
good,it was a fun place to work but there was a lot of management turnover
good,I enjoyed working for target it was really nice.My customers made my work day pass really fast lovely people.
good,"Started with Target direct out of college, learned skills needed to run a successfull company and all HR processes."
good,good job for a high school student and or a 2nd job.... The work load is easy
good,A very fast place to work. i have learned to lead a team of 30
good,I enjoyed working for the company there was just so many employees they werent hiring for part or full time
good,If you like to be busy then this job is great because there's always plenty to do. The management was fantastic and very helpful.
good,"Target for me was a fun and fast pase place to work , enjoyed all my fellow co-workers . co - workers were all ready to help eachother at any given time .Enjoyed working in the public and getting to know my regular guest and learning about new cultures ."
good,Target is a fun place to work with good people. The benefits are good but the pay could be much better.
good,"THe company was great while I was working there. I liked the the people that I was around and how quickly I learned to adapt the work place. As an employer I learned how to use an cash register, handle credit card and cash transactions. I enjoyed working here."
good,Target is a big company. That comes with the good and the bad. Overall it’s a good place to work but can get too repetitive and some focuses seem arbitrary.
good,"A typical day at work varies. Normally, I make a connection with guests by engaging in friendly and genuine conversation throughout each transaction; asking open-ended questions about the guest’s shopping experience and using those questions to assess, understand, and determine how to tailor my approach. I work efficiently to minimize guest wait time while maintaining guest service and accuracy. I inform the guest aware of current and upcoming brand launches, store activities, and events. I demonstrate the know-how to direct the guest to enroll, activate, and use the Target app as well as demonstrating a culture of ethical conduct, safety, and compliance. There are other times where I am pulled for my duties as a cashier and asked to restock shelves or push shopping carts inside for customers to use. Most of the management treats employees well, and they show great amounts of kindness and patience with employees. The hardest part of the job is adapting to the changing environment of the store (i.e power outage, store flood, sever down for registers). The most enjoyable part is interacting with the children of the guests because they are easy to make smile and put a smile on my face too."
good,"Target has a Clean environment , nice area , nice people and customers , they will help you find whatever you need and help order things online if you need too"
good,"While working at Target, my main tasks would be putting clothes back from the fitting room, helping customers in the fitting room, and organizing shipments of clothes we had gotten. This was a seasonal job for me. I learned a lot about customer service and organizational skills. I thought the management were nice people but sometimes had unrealistic expectations about what could be done in a workday. For example, when we get new shipments of clothes it takes awhile to organize and put out on display, and they would sometimes get frustrated if we couldn't do it fast. The hardest part of the job would be pushing heavy shipments or when there was nobody in the store while you were working the fitting room, which made the job super boring. The most enjoyable part of the job was when customers needed help, because I like helping people."
good,"My job is not that hard. Sometimes It may get stressful when there are a lot of boxes, but working hard and being productive will get you through it. Target is great."
good,A typical day as a cashier at Target is long but if you like meeting a lot of new people then it can be fun. The hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day but the most enjoyable part is the people you work with.
good,We all work together and work hard and get along with each other we work as families responsible for our work and respect customers that comes in so they can come back
good,"Target was a great job to work at, but a lot of things has change since I was a worker there. I met a lot of great people there, people that I call family because of the closeness. However the politics and dynamics of the company has shifted, making it not a place I would go back to."
good,"While the starting pay is higher than a lot of other places out there, this also means that you have much less supporting team members.  Management styles can vary, but the main focus is with logistics.  They have talked about being more guest focused but at the end of the day you are still needed to help put product out instead of being available for the guests as soon as possible."
good,"Work load was manageable for the most part. Changing in management seemed rushed, store unprepared for change. Teamwork was emphasized and executed. Scheduling was often an issue, time off requests were almost always denied with no explanation, and schedule changes would happen without notice."
good,"It was an easy jobs but the employees that work for Target was causing trouble by trying to make us do there work."
good,"While I was working at target, I requested a max of 15 hours a week, due to the fact I was in college. At first they were scheduling me 20 which is fine, but it lead to them forcing me to take 35 hour weeks. The pay was good, but be prepared for long work days."
good,"During my time there I felt the store (at the time) was a bit fragmented and no structure was set, I made it a bit confusing working under my manager at the time. I was given some tasks I didn't have much knowledge of or was told very little about, it ended up having me to have others in the back room (if there was any available during the holiday season) to help me on locations of excess inventory."
good,"Target is a great company to work for and seems to have decent value along with paying really well compared to most retail establishments. The downfall is getting into a location that plays favorites and has established ""cliques."" This can make a great job grueling when you get a majority of the workload while the favorites are tasked with the easiest tasks. And then you are reprimanded for not finishing as quickly. In addition, no consideration is taken for call offs or business above forecast when it comes to what you got done."
good,"Working as a barista in Target's Starbucks was a great learning experience. Often being short staffed, one had to learn to multitask and be able to work the register and make drinks at the same time."
good,"I admit that I might be a little biased about being an FOS attendant, since I'm a little more tolerant of spending hours at a time out in the weather. That said, I wouldn't have stayed for over a year if it weren't for my coworkers and especially my managers being helpful and easy to work with. There's going to be plenty of confusion and it's hard to get better than part-time hours, but it's still overall one of the better retail jobs."
good,working at target I enjoyed it most of the time. it is hard work but you always feel busy. it's a fast pace environment. you'll begin to feel closer to the people you work with while working as a team.
good,"Working at target helped me improve my customer service skills a lot. I got along with all my co workers very easily, they made me feel comfortable from when i first started working there, this job also helped me become less shy."
good,"I’ve been with Target for 9 months and really enjoy working for company. There are new challenges everyday, but the challenges makes you a better leader."
good,The people you work with are amazing and make the work place a fun one to work at. The company does well in most areas except pay. They are stingy with your pay raises. One supervisor did notify me that they are expected to never give the max pay raise which yearly at best you can get a 50 cent raise which usually was wasted when minimum wage goes up.
good,"Management isn’t great, and neither are the hours. However your coworkers are the easiest people to get along with. Overall I would not recommend target just by how little they train you/ explain things to you thoroughly."
good,"Pros "
good,"Target is a great place to work if you need a part time position."
good,Really the only thing that makes working at Target tolerable is the competitive pay. Everybody who works there shows a severe undeserving sense of entitlement and there is little to no room for error of any kind.
good,"Management can be an issue sometimes, in relation to balancing workload for departments. Very flexible in scheduling and will give you hours if you work hard and take the extra step."
good,"Overall decent job, needs to work on managing skills. more attention to the ones that need help. Mostly good manners, mostly very helpful, overall is pleased with service."
good,Always something to do and you get to learn so much communication skills while talking to cusotmers and coworkers. Really great place to start your career journey.
good,This job is fine. You know what to do and your peers train you on how to do them. They can be flexible with schedules but take that with a grain of salt. Be wary of that especially if you are a student.
good,"I’ve been working at this target for over a year now. The hours can be wonky week to week but the management (for the most part) is pretty good and the job itself isn’t bad; but be wary that if you begin as a cashier at the front end, you don’t have many opportunities to branch out into other job opportunities, once they have you in the front they like to keep you there. Managers are pretty understanding and once you’ve been employed for over ninety days flexibility is a definite pro. One of the negatives I can give is the job training, it is minimal and leaves you feeling quite nervous and unprepared."
good,"Being target security, the whole job is a gray area. Some days flow and are easy and some days are just choatic. Basically, you watch people steal and then document it. You can receipt check people which is the main way of getting merchandise back, but be prepared to be called racist, xenophobic, all the phobics even though they blatantly wear it out or stuff it in a shopping bag."
good,As a cashier I was constantly put down by customers and reprimanded for not trying to upsell to customers who obviously just wanted to leave. I was promised flexibility in my schedule once school started but was told it wasn't possible.
good,Need to have the ability to problem solve on your own and be self sufficient. Ability to provide great customer service at all times. Understanding how to prioritize on your own. Being self-motivated is a big key to the job. Leadership is hit or miss. Taking matters into your own hands and being confident in your choices.
good,You never get what you put out. That's life. Target is an awesome company. We are human. Keep things simple. I want to be paid more and get more hours but I'm capped at about 30 hours due to 30+ year tenors and payroll .
good,"Working at Target has taught me various things I will need in the ""real world."" It's very flexible and understanding with schedules. You also get to meet a lot of people from all over the world, they are very good with being diverse."
good,"Most days weren't too busy unless it was a holiday or after everyone was off work. Training is very easy, but the red card is highly focused on, and is one of the things that made the job less interesting."
good,"The job was relatively stress free, the management wasn’t over bearing and overall the employees were quite friendly and easy to get along with. Guests that come in are also (for the most part) much nicer than the ones you’d find at Walmart"
good,"Awesome place to work. Great benefits and sometimes good work schedules. Depends on some locations team moral is decent."
good,A typical day at work was standing at the register during the rush of the holidays. Work was quick paced. The hardest part of the job was knowing what sales were going on that day. I enjoyed being challenged each day.
good,"Very grateful that I got the chance to work here, learned a lot about different positions and pushed myself to learn supervisor shifts as well. great place to grow."
good,"Job should be straight forward, but management complicates things with ever changing requirements and demands. No job here is full time under leader rank. Normal team members need a very flexible schedule and a willingness to learn as much of the store as possible if they expect to make a real living on this job."
good,"A typical day at work consists of returning rails of clothing from fitting rooms or from the front registers, then allocated departments required an adequate tidy. I learnt Prime Retail skills like customer serivice in person and via telephone, orders and lay buys complaints and display of our store. The hardest part of this job would be Sustaining my constant shifts and long hours whilst trying to balance school.It has taught me to be a sufficient retail assistant."
good,"It's a decent job overall and the pay is good.  It's very repetitive.  It's not a hard job at all, but you're constantly interacting with customers, which can easily wear you out if you're not an extraverted person."
good,"It's a good position for a college student or high school. It's a part time job no one gets fulltime hours, only certain people. Flexible hours but not enough to support yourself."
good,"the pay could be better, and the schedule Could be better as well. Management could be more organize an communication could be better. the job have some very friendly."
good,"This had been my first job, and I was hired around the holidays. I started off in one department, and then was transferred twice until I ended up in seasonal. It was a bit tricky learning the process of the store in such a short time, but I managed it alright. MY coworkers there were great, management helped any of us out when it was needed.  I would have stayed had it not been for their lack of hours after the holidays."
good,Target in Mississippi sucks. They curse you out and blame you for every thing never can get a break. Never will they give you hours and they show favoritism.
good,"Working at Target requires standing and walking for long periods of time and showing your best attitude towards everyone. Typical day at target for me was getting carts, going on the register, cleaning the restrooms, helping co-workers/customers. All random timing so required fast responding and multitasking."
good,"- Have to be able to complete task in a timely manner"
good,I work at a target as a cashier and so far its been really easy and slow at times due to the season but when it does get busy its very fun. I am the type of person that likes working all the time and not just standing there.
good,"Fast paced, quickly changing, must be able to adapt to changing workload quickly, learn several different tasks and be able to switch between job functions"
good,"My work experience there was doing all the work but not being paid for it I was (GSL) which is guest service leader and yet I was taking over the role of being a (gstl) which is guest service team leader, so they were being paid  more when we actually did the exact thing, very rude staff there were a lot of bosses and not enough employees even my breaks and lunches were impossible"
good,"Working for target can be very stressful at time the turn over rate is pretty high, Most partners are in high school or right out of college that might not take the job to seriously."
good,"If you're a cashier, be ready to stand up for 8 hours. You aren't allowed to sit and don't always have customers coming through so be prepared to stand aimlessly."
good,A day at work consisted of unloading freight from the trailer and processing boxes. I learned how to use their handheld and learned how to build and receive pallets. Management was very friendly and down to earth. The work culture is good as long as you are a hard worker. The hardest part of the job was putting your mind to the fast paced environment. The most enjoyable part was going home.
good,"Good place to work. Of course management changes a lot overtime. Every store is different some are great some are bad. I think the companies corporate roles waste a lot of money, useless jobs for over educated individuals. The business is retail and I worry about downsizing in there future."
good,"It’s an ok company, a lot of favoritism involved. You can’t really get promoted without becoming someone’s best friend. It’s not good, hard work and effort is not the only stuff you need to have a chance at promotion."
good,They pay well and offer good benefits. They tend to hire people for the degree they hold instead of hiring people for job knowledge to be managers. They are constantly trying to make improvements to better serve the customer. The job can be strenuous but it isn’t the most mentally taxing once you learn the basics.
good,"Never a dull day. Working in this position during college is a great way to earn good work experience if you are looking to go into security or law enforcement. With the right education and experience there is room to advance if you are willing to put in the work and impress the right people. However, due to the nature of retail, the work/life balance is horrible. I frequently had to work a closing shift (4pm-12am) the night before working an opening shift (8am-4pm). Also, don't count on having weekends or holidays off if you don't ask off in advance. The only two days the stores are closed are on Christmas Day and Easter."
good,"For how much you get paid, being a warehouse worker is easy money in any department (I did PTS, USS, IBOB & Control Center Tech. But the management is just absolutely atrocious in DeKalb, which lead to my departure. The OMs, SOMs and PCs are just terrible."
good,"they are extremely strict on how they want you to interact with the guest most of the time if their way is not fulfilled properly you get brought into the office for a write up. every single time that you call out you get written up. poor hours but great pay, ok management."
good,The one thing I hated with Target was training someone who just got out of college to do their job to be my boss. And never being able to have that job unless you had a 4 year degree. At the time I didn't so with 10 years of experience in the grocery business I got to train the 25 year old know it all that just got finished with college and thought it would be fun to come work in retail as a boss and leave after they got experience in having a job.
good,"all the people who work here are nice but corporate keeps cutting hours, I got a 1% raise for 1 reason. A typical day at work is unloading the truck and the work said freight to the floor."
good,"I heard other targets aren't like mine. All ETLs are in cliques so if employees get treated by horribly from one , they wont take it seriously. No OT, and favoritism is blindingly apparent."
good,"At Target there was never a moment where I was bored or had nothing to do, I was always busy. The hours were fairly poor, the hourly rate was okay, but the job culture was great. Overall if I had an opportunity for more work hours I would go back"
good,i really enjoyed working for target and hope to continue my employment there it was definitely a nice job to have and will and want to go back. i would reccomend it to everyone
good,Target was a slow paced day but it offered opportunity to talk to people and assist guests on the daily. I learned how to effectively communicate with people.
good,"Loved the company and my job when I first started, LOVED IT. They have this whole new business model now that completely sucks and is gonna cost them a lot of valuable employees. There’s no work/life balance with the hours they’re forcing upon their employees to work."
good,Working as a planogram team member i did product resets signage & label placement endcap sets Displays and opened meny new store's. I also filled in as backup cashier. I really enjoyed the job and the people i worked with. Manigment was fare and easy to communicate with. Pay and available hours could have been a little better. But overall it was a good experience.
good,Work hard. Focus on your goal. Open to opportunities. Open to ideas. Confident to put your points on focus. Ask questions when doubts to the superiors. Be aware of FAKE People. Carry positive attitude.
good,"Great place to work. Focused on people and recognition, Would never leave the company but one issue I feel it is hard to advance and my direct supervisor was lacking"
good,"Fast-paced work environment, with corporate making decisions that make work more stressful. They expect team members to do multiple people's jobs in the time it would take to do one."
good,This is a great first job choice because while it isn't very demanding it can at times have areas for one to grow as a person and as a worker. helping customers or me even just doing the best job you can.
good,"Hours are good some times of year and others you have to fight to get them. Tons of micromanaging and constant change to operating procedures due to corporate's constant need to change and make things more ""efficient""."
good,"Target was a great place to work, great Benefits, fun coworkers however management never managed. It was extremely easy to lie on someone and if that manager liked you chances are they'll believe you. So yeah a great amount of favoritism"
good,"A typical day working at target, as far as my position is concerned, is not so bad. It will go by quick if their is a good amount of orders to keep you busy. I   learned how to properly pack and prepare goods for shipping. The employees are for the most part friendly and willing to help when you need it. The hardest part of the job is when orders get backed up, either from being understaffed or workers moving slowly. The most enjoyable part of the job is relaxing with fellow co-workers in the break/staff room."
good,This was an ok job to have. The problem was their management or managers. The managers were very rude and out of place. They do not care about other people’s time and jobs.
good,"The first few days of working at Target were easy to get a grasp of the basics, packaging the items and scanning them from the store to be shipped. My only issue with working here was the lack of training in item locations and how to help guests. Every time talking to a customer was improvised as I helped at the best of my ability."
good,The hours suck. There is poor communication skills among everyone. And there is a bunch of favoritism going on. The management depending on where you work at sucks
good,"Target was a great place to work for a little while, but then managers started shifting and with that came many changes that made the culture hard to work in."
good,"While working here for years, you will find ways to do things efficiently and still in safe conditions too, which is greatly important. Then come leaders outside of your field of area (departments), trying to assert their leadership roles across the store, commanding everyone and ruining what you built up to be an ideal working environment. However, it wasn't always this way. We have times when things are running smoothly for the most part, but when you have days your leaders are off-duty, it's all free-game from there. Anyone with an idea on how to run things won't get a say in how to work together with others to accomplish the day's goals."
good,They cut you on hours unless you're in a management position. They do not offer you extra shifts unless they can not find anyone to fill them. If you do not have a manager title you're nothing.
good,"Taxes are handled professionally"
good,Working at target was the first job ive ever had and working there has been good. The hours there are just getting slim so i need a new job to help pay off college.
good,Target is a very relaxed environment. All the employees are friendly and its very good pay. The benefits are really nice! And the hours arent all that bad. They fluctuate but its still pretty good hrs!
good,target does not like to pay overtime and unless you work for a long time or become management you will not have full 40 hrs per week. and discount is cash or there red card only.
good,"I got to work with a good store manager, and that makes all the difference. The company tries to maintain a good job culture and make you feel part of a team."
good,It is a fast paced and hard working environment. Although it is reasonably well paid position I don't feel they pay in accordance with the work required. After maxing out in your job description there are no annual raises even if the company overall is doing well. They do offer a very good benefit package.
good,"Working with Target has been a great experience with retail, although I think I’d like to go a different route maybe in the future. It is a lot of work, but it was never anything we weren’t trained to handle. Sales are what determine our pay, and hours so I’d like do find a job with steady hours."
good,Your ability at target is all about providing quality customer service to the consumers. It is your responsiblity to help the customers find what they are looking for.
good,Has pretty high pay but it can be very stressful and fast pace workAnd a lot of the shifts are 10 and 12 hours towards the holidays which leaves you emotional time for your family and the overtime is mandatoryWhen is the regular hours of just for 10 hour days it’s a much better schedule
good,"A typical day at work is fast pace. you deal with customers all day and other job duties. they can include cashiering, working sales floor, plushing product to the floor and even changing prices."
good,They just started a new process so no one gets more than 30 hours a week meaning that they don't have to pay anyone health insurance. They have no hours to give and when they don they screw over the college kids and give all the hours to the old timers. i cannot pay bills off of $13 an hour when i only work 10 hours a week.
good,Target use to be a place where you could have fun at work. Over the last few years that has changed. Target is more focused on how much work they can get out of a person with the minimal amount of help. Stores lately are understaffed.
good,"restocking of the items in store, as well as the sales of red cards and warranty are part of the typical work week.  Everyday your position changes and they might have you move to registers or a different section of the store so you must be willilng to multi-task"
good,I did not feel like management was organized. One person would tell me to do something and then another member of management would walk by and get mad I wasn't doing something else. The schedule would change the day before without anyone calling so I would get there at 5am for no reason.
good,"Targets work environment depends on the day, the truck unloading days tend to be the most stressful due to the understaffing and amount of work needed to be completed  in the small time."
good,"Target has some really great benefits.  The hours were starting to drop off since online shopping became a priority.  That is when I decided to find another job.  Management was always changing and though I had the best supervisor I ever had a year ago, I also had managers that were out of touch with our department.  Loved Target for its all inclusive culture.  Was always fun to see the change of seasons with this retail establishment."
good,"The Store has great sales and employees discounts. Good looking store. Generous salary, great benefits and flexibility.Nice customers and atmosphere. Busy work always."
good,target was my very first job and I absolutely loved it! I honestly regret leaving but my manager made it so hard to stay. She was so hateful and rude towards me for no apparent reason.
good,"Processing returns, assisting with baby and wedding registries, answered questions from guest, signing guest up with red cards per request, filling in when needed while others were on break/lunch"
good,This job is only good if you're a young adult still in high school or college. Working seasonal is good too.Otherwise not a good long term job to work at. Not a place you want to work at forever. Not enough work hours to be paid well.
good,"A typical day at work at Target is a lot of back and forth between job positions and tasks, sometimes having one left unfinished when called to help another department. "
good,"The typical work day is all about time management. f you can't meet your quota, then you're gone. the management on certain shifts are way more relaxed than others. The hardest part of the job is being by yourself and not falling asleep. the most enjoyable part is definitely getting off work."
good,The constant change of management took a toll on all the good people that worked there.  Lack of respect for my personal schedule and made me feel expendable
good,I really liked this job for awhile but I have to admit the pay could've been a little better and they were kind of messy with the scheduling. Either you get a ridiculous amount of hours or you barely get anything at all there's no inbetween.
good,It's a great place to work for growth you learn a lot. There are some perks and some draw backs. But most of all you can leave with new understanding.
good,"Working for  target was a experience. Had no problem at all, it was great fun and just a lot of energy no one slacked off, if you did we came as a team to bring you up because that’s what team work is about not leaving someone behind."
good,"I started working at Target as a part-time seasonal hire. Due to my work ethic and self motivated attitude I was brought on to the team permanently. I worked as a Logistics team member at first, and my job consisted of helping unload the delivery truck, moving goods out to the sales floor, and then stocking the shelves. "
good,never enjoyed working at target and the the pay isn't that good but the hours vary by season. during the summer all the way to december it gets busy..
good,It is a great place to work. the management could use alittle work but overall it’s a fantastic place to work! I have met amazing people there and have developed great friendships
good,The modernization has brought standards up exponentially and requires the most hardworking individuals possible to meet all expectations for these new stores.
good,really great place to work but very low pay and even less hours if you need a second job this where i'd work not a primary work place to pay the bills with.
good,"I enjoyed working with the other team members on my shift as well as I did, my team leader on my shift. It sometimes became a challenge keeping morale up, due to working for long periods of times alone and secluded from the rest of team in your designated work area."
good,"Daily challenges met with supportive help to achieve goals"
good,I think that leadership could use some changes and how the overall store operates as a whole. I recomend this place for someones first job. I have been with the company for 6 years and have seen many different changes that haven't been for the best in my opinion.
good,"Target would be one of the better retail company's to work for.  I was only part time, but they didn't have a problem working around people schedules too much and if you were scheduled on a day you couldn't work you could find someone to cover generally.  It's reatil so it can be stressful and difficult at times, but Target is a good company."
good,I found the Flexible Fulfillment Team job quite boring. It was slow-paced and did not challenge me. The job payed well; however it was not enjoyable to say the least.
good,"Fast, Fun, and Friendly! The tagline was kind of cliche, but it rang true during my time there. Target was a great place to work and the people were very fun to work with."
good,Loved it at first now it’s like I go simply so I can get paid. The environment changed drastically & we lost a lot of very talented people. Maybe it was just my store.
good,"Not a bad place to work if you're student. Decent/flexible hours. Not for someone who is looking for full time work. Job training is alright, could be better."
good,"The coworkers made all of the difference in the workplace but management demanded a lot of you, or nagged you about little things that you missed.Also always supervising you with their cameras."
good,Target overall was a pleasant company to work for. It seemed that employees came and went but that's all part of the retail workplace. Pay raises were minimal and far between (every year).
good,There are good and bad days ..one day people like you next minute they dont.. sometimes target can be fair sometimes it depends on who you are but I loved working with coworkers mainly.. fair as management some were okay some were picky.. but hey its a great enviroment most of the time the guest give you a great laugh and some of your coworkers do as welll. i never really had a hard part during work because it was a very easy layed back job..the most enjoyable part is meeting new people and seeing them smile … We did have fun every once in a while .. I actually miss working for them but hey things change and not everyone will always like you.. NO IM NOT  bashing anyone cause mainly I learned a lot from everyone ..but its best to learn people before they learn you
good,"The environment provided great Leadership training and guidance on directing Teams of Associates.  There was an extremely competitive culture that existed, which at times, appeared hostile."
good,It was an interesting experience and a good start off job for people just graduating high school but think could have better advantages of advancement in company and little more benefits and make environment more fun friendly for future customers
good,I've been with the company for a while now. I've enjoyed working there overall but with alot of the changes being made in the way the departments are run it been putting more pressure on the employees and has resulted In many of the employees that have been working there for years to leave.
good,"I've worked for Target for seven years now and I must say as a whole I've loved the job. I've always felt the pay has been fair and the benefits they offer are pretty good. Management at the store level , at my store, has always been pretty good. Just recently Target has gone to a new system of unloading and pushing truck freight that just does not work. The store always feels wildly understaffed for the amount of work that needs to be done and the pressure to finish the work of three people can sometimes be overwhelming when everything seems to be falling apart around you and you're told you need to finish. Multiple online forums have blown up since this new system was implemented containing multiple pictures of how bad other store backrooms look. The common theme being that it does not work. While I've loved my time at Target, they are h311 bent on making this work with a half a skeleton crew and I really feel like my time with the company is coming to a close."
good,"I like it for it to be my first job , but some of the workers was rude an a little bit of racist there but overall I liked it . A few high school kids work there an was kinda getting my hours cut ."
good,Team members were proud of the work that they did and were driven to provide the best service that they could to guests that came into our store. There was never a dull moment working!
good,As upper management expect little to no work life balance. Pays well and obviously you are expected to work weekends and holidays which is a basic ask for any retail job.
good,"Working at target has its good and bad days, obviously you're bound to get rude guests, its apart of being in customer service. But some managers are very rude and unprofessional and sometimes tend not to as understanding as others. Other than that the experience of working for a big company such as target have been very interesting and unforgettable."
good,"The problems faced by a Target employee are not unique to this company; they are endemic of the entire retail industry.  You are being asked to work multiple job positions because the company is combining two completely separate business models. They want to remain a brick-and-mortar store, which means maintaining the building, putting out displays and physical items, and helping customers face-to-face. They also want to become an online merchant, like Amazon. This means using the store as a warehouse and a shipping center while also remaining open for business.  This double model is not sustainable unless Target commits to hiring more workers and dividing job roles.  Instead, they have decided to raise the hourly wage, but ask much, much more of each employee. Squeezing blood from a stone, proverbially. This will result in quick burnout and high employee turnover. Ultimately, Target will fail at both being a store and a shipping center."
good,"go in. do your job. go home. "
good,I worked at target for nearly 4 years. I literally have nothing bad to say about target it is a great company. Only thing I can say is after 4 years no moving up? Give people a chance
good,I enjoyed working there. I love the customers and I like staying busy there. Everyone is a pleasure to work with. There are some difficulties with the scheduling.
good,"It was a very enjoyable, fun job. The atmosphere was pretty good and people genuinely got along. The only downside was, like any retail job, you are always working nights and weekends."
good,Target is a great place to work if you are just starting into the workforce and learning what your skills are.  I would recommend keeping it during school time as a place to come back and work.
good,"I enjoyed working at target but as it is with 99% of retail jobs they do not often offer full time work and the pay per hour isn't enough to keep myself afloat. The only reason I was able to stay so long is because I didn't have a car to pay for and I lived in a small one bedroom apartment with my husband. I also worked numerous side jobs that were able to help pay where the gaps ended. However, the culture at Target is extremely welcoming and making friends was pretty easy. The upper management was pretty open and helped a lot when I got into a car accident. Unfortunately they weren't able to supply the income I needed to live. Extra bonus points to the companies commitment to helping their employee's stay fit by supplying fitbit's to us. I don't know how long that went on or if it's continued but it was one of the highlights of my career and I continue to use it to this day."
good,"As with any place to work there are positives and negatives. "
good,"Target has gone downhill over the past 2+ years I have worked with them in terms of management. At my store that is. Overall it isn't so bad but after seeing communication amongst leaders grow worse, hours inevitably being inconsistent, and seemingly only getting raises when other retailers bump their wages, rather than based off of performance, I have decided to begin looking for better opportunities."
good,"A typical day is putting out new products"
good,"Working at Target has its benefits, don't get me wrong, but I don't think I'd ever want to work there again. You're worked past your breaking point, and not compensated fairly. You're treated poorly by customers and expected to be happy and cheerful anyway. The HR department is shady and doesn't make it feel like team members are cared for."
good,"The most enjoyable part about working at target is definitely the customers, everyday you meet new people with great personalities that make you laugh."
good,it is the target way or no way. Culture is good. no freedom to operate your business. Management have no freedom to merchandise. No ability to order merchandise for customer.
good,Strict place to work but pays well long nights easy to get hurt very big building so its was a walk getting to my department everyday didint like they had one  smoking room
good,"The full time remodel job is hard because you are so tired on your feet 7 days a week but everyone is nice and works together."
good,"i enjoyed working for target, as it seemed to be very explanitory. at times it felt like favorites were picked between staff, other than that the pay was great, the environment was always a blast."
good,"Lots of long hours and hard work, but the amount of leadership development will set you apart from your counterparts at other companies. I gave a lot to Target but got so much more back. You give a lot, no doubt but they do create great leaders."
good,Holiday assignment with target to help with stocking and filling the floors. Really uptempo and fast shift. Was only part time with option for extra shifts which I always said yes to.
good,"Fairly too quick of a pace for most people, teamwork was very efficient, but sometimes had lack of communication, management was average, tasks were reasonable and the job itself wasn't too difficult"
good,"Target is a fast paced company, and I enjoyed that every day was different. You get to be involved in many aspects of the business, from HR to merchandising to operations. I loved interacting with my team, challenging them and training them to achieve goals. Target isn't afraid to change, and is working hard to stay ahead in retail. The toughest part of the job is lack of empowerment- there is too much structure for even Directors to be able to drive their business, it is turning into a culture of micro management. There are opportunities to advance, but the schedule and demands can be difficult if you have a family."
good,Work 40 hours a week everyone is chill and it’s not minimum wage. That being said I don’t see myself moving up for how little they pay team leads. I don’t see myself making a career at Target.
good,"Target is a very good environment to work in for me , until I started seeing less hours and closing everyday which led me to come home late night everyday"
good,It’s very fun in the sense of working with a lot of good people and meeting a lot of new people however it can be stressful because a lot of times the store is understaffed and some guests can be cranky.
good,"I has only worked there for less than 10 months.   While working there, the did have a vey structured work environment.   If they're open, they have multiple job opportunities for all types of people."
good,"Have gone through 4 store mangers in less than 3 years. 2 left the company for a better job. The company lacks direction and clear goals for teams due to every level of management is not on the same page. Regional manager wants one thing, district another so store management changes is expectations weekly or by who's in the area."
good,Target has a fun group of people that always kept the job fun as for the management decisions and constant managerial turn it made the company no longer a good place to work for me.
good,Not my dream career to be in for the rest of my life. I know what I'm doing when I get there. I know what to expect. People tend to call out so you have double the work sometimes
good,I fill for what employees get paid they/ we were over worked. I felt that there wasn't opportunity to grow.The hardest part of the job was when I had to get shelf from outside  had to clean them and they were heavy and in a fast manner because I had to get back inside to put out the merchandise. I was thankful that when I didn't have a job I was employed by Target.
good,It was very organized they assign you a check out lane for the day and you get all your breaks on time I learned so much there from the different departments because it is such a huge store Management was okay but it being a big store with so many workers they couldn't really fit or deal with anyone needs as much and the disabled or sick like me didn't get much help or understanding that we should have got.  The Culture was very diverse everyone one could be there-self from body art to hair color to race and sexual orientation that was amazing to me I loved that part of that company. The hardest part was how busy we would get and the fast pace we had to work most of the day and standing for at least four to five hours straight was hard on me but Im sick so its different for me then others. The most enjoyable part was talking to customers people from all over the world and the potlucks we had and our spring cook out it was just a very fun vibrant environment.
good,Typical day is a fairly easy day of assisting customers.  As long as you love people you will do well.  I didn't find it difficult at all.  The job was pretty much enjoyable.  The only downfall was not having enough hours or a set schedule.
good,stocking items on a daily basis and ensuring certain items are stocked fully daily. helping customers finding items and carry outs if needed and question answering
good,The staff was always nice and accommodating to any concerns or questions i had. I would recommended anyone that wants a simple job with a nice crew to try it out
good,Target is a fast paced environment with always things to do. A typical day is making sure our guests have the best experience they can have. You learn new things every day.
good,The workload is excessive and unnecessary. You will always work at least 50 hours a week as an executive. The work is hands on and not for the slow paced worker
good,"The current manager isn't exactly management material, but they rotate every few years. The rest of the team is supportive, kind and fun. They work hard and take initiative. Target is typically a place where one can take pride in their work."
good,"i went from a cashier to guest service at target, i enjoyed my job and most of the people i worked with i got to set up my own routine and work at my own pace as long as things got done, but i didt care for the management all to much"
good,"It was okay. I liked the management but some of my coworkers weren’t so friendly. They always had cool days where management would bring in free pizza on “national pizza day” or things like that. They really took care of you, but the associates could be a bit nicer."
good,"My typical day at work would include checking if labels were up to date, inventory count, cashier check, and making everything look presentable, has very flexible schedule."
good,I enjoyed my stay at Target at first.Them it come to a time where hours get cut hire more employees and seniority does not matter or how good of worker you are
good,"This was my ""first job"" in a big work place. Typical days were coming in to open Cafe then making things, putting things away, and then once you knew your coworkers were set, you could go for the day. Management in my department has change a great deal. Still not sure how I feel about it. The hardest part I think is the fact that the there is stress that shouldn't be. what I love most is helping Guest's and my team member."
good,Working for this company brings with it many rewarding opportunities including working with fun and accepting people. It is a great job for people starting out in the career field and a great place to gain beginners experience.
good,"Its a good job in that it allows you to save up and buy your dream car or to go on vacations, but the job itself if you stay too long is soul sucking. "
good,"They train you well, and are very flexible with your hours. They're very helpful, and hands on with your work and designated tasks. Overall a good vibe there, can be stressful if you're bad at time management."
good,The business is a very fast pace and high demanding business. Everything needs to be completed with little to no communication or instruction from management. Management expects perfection and jobs completed in a timely manor with not enough time given. Hardest part of the day is trying to fit 10 hours of work in a 7 hour day and with quality work.
good,"As a front of store attendant, you take keep carts stocked, clean bathrooms every hour, take out the trash once or twice a day, and carry out things that are too big for a guest to take by themselves. You decide."
good,"Overall decent workplace, but management can be a little spotty, as well as hours. Aren't treated as well if you say no. Good holiday pay and during holiday,overtime is allowed"
good,"I started working at target when I was 16 as a cashier. I was provided several opportunities to advance and receive raises and promotions. When I worked there the management was great, and I enjoyed working with the people that I worked with. I changed positions several times and loved being able to take ownership of my area. The pay was decent for a teenager, but I don't think I could have lived off of that pay after graduating and moving on to college."
good,Nice work place fast pace friendly manger hard labor  dealing with customers learning new things unloading trucks clean restroom a lot of walking great deals
good,"Target had its days were it was busier than others days. This was a fast paced job, running around helping guests checking for other products in other stores, getting merchandise from the back, helping cashiers and helping other departments."
good,"The environment is overall relaxed, but very productive. "
good,"Personally I believe in having individual tasks, and when those are completed, one’s job is done and they should be able to go home. Target does not, therefore when your job is done, you must stay and help other workers who aren’t as efficient do there’s, and sometimes you’ll end up there an hour plus after you were scheduled."
good,"Fun place to work. There are some amazing people employed there."
good,"Target was a nice and fair paying job but during this time I was in high school and they weren't very flexible with my hours and needs at that time. Maybe now since I'm in college, it would be a better place to work, but I don't recommend it for high school students."
good,i had to make sure every aisle was clean and put everything back in place you need good communication skills for this job and you need to be prepared to work hard so you can advance to manager etc
good,Target is a good company to work for in general.  Would like however to see them be more aggressive in the M&A space and take more risks as a retailer.
good,"I worked seasonally at Target and had a decent time working there. My only complaint would be that I was not talked to about staying on until I asked about it and was told that the deadline for my manager to talk to me was the next day, because of this I was unable to stay on at Target and was told to reapply in a couple months. After that I had to constantly battle with the HR at the time to be able to work there again. Eventually I got an interview, but the next day was called to say the position had been filled..."
good,"Hastings Store was like Family, day at work punch in and hop right to it, Learned there is always change. Most of the management team was helpful and understanding of your needs."
good,"I work at a lower volume store. The hours are long in order to meet expectations. Pay is great, but be prepared to never be home. I enjoy Target overall, but lower volume stores are a lot harder than a high volume store with more team members and more payroll."
good,Not enough hours I had to travel 120 miles a day to get to work to only work 5 hours until peak season besides that the job was okay and safety was a must.
good,I worked at the starbucks in target. It was pretty stressful in my opinion. My co workers were very nice though. It was a lot of multitasking. I liked my boss for the most part.
good,"basic place to work, very basic place to work. makes you basic to work there. Basic comes to mind. soooo basic. like extremely basic. Nothing further to add"
good,"Day started at 3am, unloading Trailers of product.  By 6am, on the floor stocking shelves.  On break at 8am, back to stocking and helping customers by 8:30am.  More stocking and helping customers until 10:30am than another 30 minute break and home by 12."
good,Each day at target is different but me personally didn't enjoy myself the most at the job they say its an family well its far from reality. I understand this isn't for every Target but this one was one of the worst.
good,"Short staffed, underpaid, and management expects you to do ten different things all at once.  Corporate is trying to cut hours to make up for having to pay a minimum of $15/hour by 2020."
good,"When I was hired Christmas season was in full swing so it was a very stressful environment and employees didn't have time or weren't made aware of training me. Therefore, they'd give brief explanations of my responsibilities and what I had to focus on, so I had to learn quick and with repetition."
good,"A normal day is coming in clocking in, taking calls, going on break, and having statuses or coaching. There is a lot of information wanted but that's literally how everyday is."
good,Target was a seasonal Job. typical work day was very fast but sometime hard. What I learned about working at target was take your time with people and work your hardest.
good,"My job has been fast paced and have given me plenty of opportunities to problem solve with customers and co-workers. I have learned money handling, team building, paperwork and office work, and customer service skills. A typical day at work would consist of money management and helping to lead a team of cashiers,as well as the assistance of customers in their purchases."
good,"Target is not a bad place to work. The workload is not too much and you have no problem leaving work on time. However, one week they would have you working 35 hours and the next your hours would drop to 15. Hours of work are inconsistent and unfair. Sometimes our hours would drop as low as 8 a week. You cannot live off of this little bit of income coming in. When you would address the problem, they would never give a good, reasonable answer."
good,"Although I enjoyed working at Target, there were times to was just unbearable. The Fun and Friendly was taken out of their ""FAST FUN and FRIENDLY"" and just left you with just FAST. This lead to a very high turn-over rate or unhappy employees. Overall the associates were a joy to work with"
good,"A lot of single mothers and mothers work at Target. There have good benefits, such as health insurance. "
good,Decent place to work especially to get your feet wet if you're out of school looking for experience. It is difficult to advance upward from a base team member role.
good,"Making multiple sales fast in a short time frame. I learned how much team work plays an factor in getting jobs done while working here at Target. The management was sometimes difficult to deal with, other times friendly. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the fast pace of the work area. The most enjoyable part of the job was the teamwork demonstrated by me and other staff members."
good,"learned a lot during my time with Target. definitely a place to start when wanting a competitive workplace"
good,"during my 2 weeks at target for work experience, my job was to go on the floor and help people on what they were looking for. And also was also put out the warehouse to help out the deliveries that came into the store."
good,"Whether or not you like your job will depend entirely on how understanding your manager is. If they're good, they can buffer the higher managment from being unreasonable. But if they're bad, they can force you to quit just with micromanaging and unreasonable expectations."
good,"My time there was well spent, I started from the bottom at an entry level position and I worked my way up to supervisor. My advice for working there is to work hard"
good,"Target will always have a place in my heart. Its a very dynamic place to work full of energy and fast-paced days. Great people from all walks of life. Wold work there again, only PT though."
good,"Was a god company to work for retail has long hour and 10 stores to cover, Fellow investigators care about there own interest so team was poor when it came to the new guy"
good,"The freedom to do what I wanted at work was great but otherwise my time at target was awful, no one liked their jobs unless you were management and that,s because they abused their power."
good,"Working with people who never did their job was the most annoying thing ever. Some would literally walk away and go do something else rather than work and the manager would do absolutely nothing about it. I worked hard every day because I had to make up what they left off and then team leaders would put even more work on me to do by myself and made me stress out a lot. I would have to work cart attendant because there were no carts inside because the one in charge would just be in his cars for hours, I would tell the team leaders about it but they let it be and that got me mad to be honest. I worked hard and I got paid the same as those who didn't work and that to me was unfair in my opinion. Target then later fired/ let go of those who would work hard just too keep those who didn’t work. The management there was just bad and unfair. I would also tell them about my availability because I would have school in the morning but they didn't care because they would still put my schedule in the morning and they would get mad at me for calling off because I had school."
good,"Overall, a good company to work for. There is a lack of advancement opportunities. Pay is competitive. I would recommend this job for people that are looking for full benefits and job security."
good,"I worked during the holidays and that really my first experience dealing with retail.  I worked there for about two months.  It was really my first time using a registrar.  I did not remember being nervous at all.  I learned pretty quick and was able to rely on my former co-workers as much as I can."
good,"I love working for target, the company provides you with many benefits if you aren’t eligible and there is a good chance you can move up in th company"
good,A typical day at Target is a matter of getting your pulls done as quickly as possible while done correctly and helping guests. You may be asked to do other tasks such as zoning and stray but they are not hard tasks much rather just time consuming. You'll learn that if you ever need a team everyone there is happy to help but there are some who may not be as eager. Management is professional but also able to be informal rather than just a boss. The hardest part would be the cold temperatures of the freezers and the sometimes heavy objects you have to move or lift. The best part of the job are your co-workers all ages and all personalities can be found at target you just have to find your people.
good,"I unloaded trucks and received merchandise, however there was too much horse playing and bad management. People were resigned often and most were treat unfairly."
good,Target was a steady job for me at the time fresh out of high school ready to get a jump start on life had a great time at target great place to work meet some good people
good,"Target is a fun place to work when you get your job done , if you don't get your job done you normally get yelled at , and sometimes the managers arent very understanding or get annoyed if you ask too many questions , but other than that its fine ."
good,"Target has a great workplace culture. You will most likely get along with all of your peers. However, management is another story. Stay positive throughout and you will be good. Target is a good first job and is also quite flexible with their scheduling so it is an ideal place for students/part timers."
good,"Working at Target was a fine job if you didn't let them make you take it too seriously. Afterall it is retail. You're expected to clean aisles, sort merchandise, and help customers find anything they are looking for. You also need to try and sign people up for RED CARDS which are poorly designed credit cards or fairly useful debit cards that provide an instant 5% discount while shopping. Aside from weird hours and low pay, it's a nice work environment when you're not near the holidays. Then co-workers and customers alike turn into monsters."
good,"Loved the team I worked with, but the work environment was not enjoyable. Having to pull the weight of others at times was frustrating. Some of management wanted to micromanage everyone which became a problem as time went on."
good,"Management was very good, but the job is fast paced, and you must be willing to constantly move. You also have to interact with customers and keep them satisfied on top of your other job duties."
good,"Enjoyed going to work each day. Learned new ways to make the job easier. The challenge would be setting up the different departments of the store, and maintaining them through the year."
good,Management and coworkers were all very friendly and helpful. However there simply were not enough hours to go around and hours could vary greatly week to week. I would recommend this job to anyone looking for their first employment but I would not recommend this job to anyone requiring a steady paycheck.
good,Target is a very friendly workplace. Fast paced and customer service is above all. Managers are always there to help. And many hours are open as well.
good,"Target was very stressful. The only good things about about working at Target was the pay and flexible scheduling. I was going to school at the time so my supervisor was very accommodating to my school schedule, BUT there was absolutely too much drama and negativity. The area I worked in was shared with Starbucks so we were limited on space for all of our stuff. There was a lot of heavy lifting and some times I was the only one there to lift all that heavy stuff and put everything away."
good,A typical day at work would be rushing to your order picker to be scanning by 415. the hardest part of the job would have to be for me the hours. 10-12 hours 4-6 days a week wasn't suitable for me and my family.
good,"This position is based inside of Target Stores, but you don't work for target. The problem is that Target wants to pretend that you do and force you to do their jobs so they can get rid of their own employees. You are there to sell phones and electronics for Marketsource. NOT STOCK. NOT CLEAN UP THEIR STORE. NOT CASHIER BECAUSE THEIR WORKERS AREN'T AROUND. The commission is great when you're actually able to do your own job and not theirs."
good,"working at target was not so bad but the pay was really low and the managers were not nice they were mean and they did not help at the registers, no so good."
good,target is a good place to work and the other employees are nice as well. the work is not hard but it keeps you busy and the time flies buy. the only down side is the number of hours you get a week.
good,Not really much room for advancement unless you spend many years with the company. Otherwise decent pay for monotonous work. Coworkers are typically fun to work with.
good,"Easy job, fun coworkers. Hard to find hours after holiday season. Poor communication and lacks training. Required to cashier and get shopping carts despite not being hired for those areas."
good,A typical work day was very long and either over or understaffed. Everyone that worked in HR was fantastic and helpful but some department heads were very clique-y and several co-workers were cut-throat and rude.
good,"You had to do put in work because management was always on your tail. They criticize you quickly so you gotta be able to take in what they called ""constructive criticism"""
good,"Currently working at target and have been there for three years. Good starting job for minors to work through school, not very career centered. Generic Retail enviroment"
good,Working at target was a stressful experience. Worked to hard to get pay to little. Managers didn't acknowledge potential to see growth. only offered night shifts and never offered morning and always scheduled me the wrongs days and couldn't fix it
good,"It was an okay job. As a deaf person, I was able to learn plenty stuff to be able to perform my work well. I didn't enjoy working during the Black Friday shift because it was harder to communicate with the frustrated customers. To be honest, no one enjoyed working during the Black Friday anyway. "
good,I enjoyed the opportunity working in a fast paced fun enviroment but memebers of management needed more training to better assist others with their job
good,every day was very typical every day was the same noting changed about the job ! i didnt learned much everything they thought me i already knew from past jobs
good,Management became too focused on the bottom line and not the employees or the customers. Up until then it was a great place to work. Hard to advance. Ty
good,"After clocking in, We are given our daily list of duties and goals involving our department. These goals are related to the sale of certain products and have guest sign up for red cards. While working at Target, learned the value of doing personal research. There was a day when i was asked about our cameras. I was unable to answer the guest questions so i retrieved someone who could. Then after i did research on my own to be more knowledgeable of the products in my department. Management did their job exceptionally. They were very approachable and informative. The hardest part of my job was the change in shifts for holiday hours. The most enjoyably part of my job was being apart of a great team."
good,"Long, stressful hours, very rushed, store was often behind on stocking. Minor discount on items. Flexible hours. Manage just bossed around, never helped with anything."
good,"It was a good transitional job that was very fast paced but had great co-workers. I had to go into work early in the day. During the Holidays, I had to go in at 4 in the morning. But then I got to leave sooner than the other employees."
good,"VERY GOOD MANAGEMENT ...had the fridge stocked in the break room, fast and friendly events for fellow employees. Very understanding of family emergencies."
good,Externship was short and unpaid. Difficult to learn all pharmacy technician duties at a typical retail type pharmacy in such a short time-frame. Friendly and caring management. Diverse colleagues from a multitude of backgrounds.
good,"Working for Target was a nice way to make some cash while I was going through College. They worked around my College schedule and never had any issues with it. You can't really advance in the company without some form of College education, but if you have the education, why would you stay there instead of working in your field?"
good,"Loading and unloading parcels; stocking and un-stocking shelves."
good,Very laid back place to work.  Of my coworkers at target were very nice to me however some of the management seem likely were not sure what they were supposed be doing which made working there a pain at times.
good,"Target is an ok place to work, pay could be better as well as the workload balance. The discount came in handy and the benefits where good, i enjoyed the people i worked with, but management could have been better."
good,"I worked there for 2 years and it always seemed like their were never enough people. However there were a lot of perks, and individual achievements did not go unknowest, however the Starbucks was different. Poor scheduling and ever worst management made it hard to be progressive. Managers lacked accountability and responsibility, and made it very to talk to them about problems primarily involving them. High probablityof not getting sufficient breaks due to poor scheduling, only a meal maybe, somedays you work for 8 hours by yourself with no break."
good,"- great orientation program to start with "
good,The only part that sucked was when they would threaten termination/ yell at you for not getting enough people to sign up for their credit card. Other than that you got a decent store discount and the job was easy.
good,"Target was a job that if you would come to work and perform you would not have a problem with job security. The job was not a very stressful place to work things a rather balanced with surges due to holidays, going back to school, and Black Friday sales."
good,The job started at 3am and usually went until we were finished around 10-11am depending on the day. Schedule said 3-9 but we were told if we didn't stay and finish that it would be held against us. The work was heavy and the people weren't super friendly. Managers were supportive but there weren't enough of them to make a difference.
good,"You always had to be on your feet. I learned the saying ""If you have time to lean, you have time to clean."" from one of my bosses. Modest pay, and they did a nice benefit of raising your pay every so often depending on how long you worked there."
good,Working for target was definitely a neat experiance. I was able to attend college and work at target part time. They were very flexible with my school schedule.
good,"You stand up all day, you are to allowed to leave the building once you are in . they monitor your every move. the only good part about the job is the every week pay"
good,"Target is a easy going job for Me I loved the people there, very down to earth enjoyed coming to work to work...mad a few friends there but half the time stayed to myself"
good,i worked as a stocker before. The pay was great but it was a lot of hard work and early shifts. Management was great and co workers were nice. I would recommend this job for guys who are looking for an early morning part time job.
good,"A typical day at work would be very calming and relaxing early morning. Mid day is when we would get a big rush due to people in the area enjoying they day shopping. The team members is what made up the culture of the target atmosphere. the management could of been better as far as knowing who people are individually and communication. The hardest part of the job was the end of the day also known as closing shifts,"
good,"Working at target has taught me a lot and has given me a lot of experience. For example target has taught me have patience and to multitask. Not only have I learned to have patience but I have worked many areas in the store. For Example I have worked fitting room, cashier and sales floor."
good,This company really takes peoples personal schedules into consideration and helps to work around certain circumstances to make sure you still get a decent amount of hours throughout the week.
good,"I was a first year in college working the carts and cash register. There's not much to say other than you get the typical ""kid"" salary at the minimum and free water/hot chocolate if you're outside running the carts back inside."
good,"I wouldn't make a career out of target. LODs are inconsistent and only care about them self. They retaliate with cutting hours, making me short of money needed for bills ."
good,"Pick boxes for three 12 hr days per week. Must meet goal of x # of boxes per hour. Management was alright. Had 4 days off each week, which was nice. Warehouse work wasn't my cup of tea."
good,"I am responsible, along with other coworkers for unloading the trailer by palletizing freight to appropriate sections.  I have learned how to work in a fast, demanding and competitive environment!   "
good,This was a good overall experience.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers and completing the various aspects of the remodel process and I would gladly have continued to work there if I had been offered a permanent position.
good,"* A typical day at target for me is when i come in to work, clock in, grab equipment, if my manager is there ask if theres a specific task he/she wants me to get on, after get to the team member I'm relieving and ask what they were working on and see if i will need to finish it. I would start all those tasks, help the guest, zone and do re-shop, then go home."
good,"Pay was great for what you do, benefits were okay as well. Lower end jobs more for younger people who are also going to school. Not a good place for advancement or if you are trying to build your career. Sick time and vacation depends on how many hours you work. You *must* use sick time if you call out for any reason and if you run out and are still sick, then you still have to show up for work. Even if you feel like you're about to die. They also don't take doctor's notes."
good,Certain roles make it tough to live a normal life outside of work. Generally 50hrs/week. Rotating weekings. Working most holidays. You're paid well and advancement is there if you want it. 3 weeks starting vacation is nice. No vacations between Nov-Dec due to Q4 retail. Your boss and your peers will determine your sanity.
good,"The hardest part was for me to see how some kids behaved. Some people abused the EBT that  was given to them."
good,I learned a lot about time management and teamwork while I worked in the fast paced distribution center for Target Corporation. The four day work week was a brilliant idea that was popular with all employees.
good,A typical day day at work is communicating with team members about our plan for the day determined about the amount of freight we were going to receive for the day.
good,Working at target is pretty stressful in this town because Target is the best shopping place in this area so theres always a good amount of customers to serve
good,Of this is your first job great its much to learn but your greater than working for the man expand yourself . this job has shown me so much and I'm so grateful but I feel like as much money as the company makes at least 13 won't hurt
good,Target has amazing benefits but is it really worth getting worked out till your completely beat by mid-shift? They don't always respect your availability and will schedule you crazy hours. I understand they need coverage and stuff but if im only available to come in at certain hours then don't expect me to come outside of those hours.
good,"As a Target Team Member, I started out on the salesfloor for a few months. Zoning and restocking shelves was enjoyable. I was eventually moved to the position of cashier which I did not enjoy as much; however, I did still learn some valuable lessons. My hours were not that bad and I had decent breaks and benefits. Working at Target was a worthwhile life experience."
good,Target followed all state guidelines for meals and breaks. They paid their employees fair wages. The processes were vey advanced making the job easier.
good,"Worked in two different distribution centers. The first I loved the people, the culture and vision. Transferred to another distribution center where the culture was cut-throat and did not focus on personal growth and development. Very disappointed that the same company can have such different cultures"
good,"I usually pushed the team in a positive way and exceeded management's expectations on how my department should be ran, I have two new team leads that I am training. I should've been promoted but continuously being told to ""have patience"". When you are a hard worker they will tell you to work harder to balance out the lack of work ethic in others."
good,"I learn a lot about how to unload CDL trucks with all  different types of weights merchandise. Scan items in and out to be displayed in different Target locations. This was a great environment, but the lack of hours and pay was not pleasant."
good,Morning inventory checks for theft. Merchandise protection on high theft items. Surveillance on cameras all day looking for activity/ supporting APS. Being first to respond to any inappropriate activities or suspicious characters.
good,"Working here is fun, but it can be stressful of you get on team leaders bad sides. Softlines can be very cliquey and makes for a miserable work environment."
good,"Paid well and I liked my job. Was very fast-paced and physically demanding.  I did learn all areas of the store, and training was very nice and friendly. Everybody respected one another."
good,"It was a nice place to work short term. Nice team members and store. I would recommend working the floor rather then Cashiering, if your not keen on selling credit/debit cards and having management constantly on your back about it."
good,"Target doesn't give full time hours , but they will work you hard. You can move up in the company but only if if a good money grabbing target. And there cart attendant neee free water !"
good,I have worked at target for 7 years. I have worked with many staff and there is a big overtime of employees. Target is very fast paced and change is very constant.
good,"Good for high school student or people who don't mind working every weekend. Must be good with being asked a lot of questions from customers.It is very fast paced, especially during holidays and back to school. Lots of standing and walking, occasional heavy lifting."
good,"Have been here about a year as a cashier and guest services. They will kill you with hours unless you make your availability so that they can't. Easy to get promoted if you stand out. Always get approved for time off, works well with school schedule. The yearly raises are absolutely horrible though, don't expect anything more than a quarter. Management is kind of annoying, they definitely pick favorites. The shifts are typically all 8 hours, but no more than 9 hours and no less than 4 hours. Closing shift is annoying, you'll be staying after and cleaning up the store. Christmas time is very hectic but certainly doable, it's fun if you work with the right people. I've met some amazing people since I began working here, some coworkers have turned into my close friends! Overall a nice place to work, but as a cashier it can DEFINITELY get boring because you're standing in the same spot for hours on end (aside from breaks.) very easy starting job, good for college students"
good,"Target pharmacies are usually a lot slower than your typical pharmacy. However, their pharmacy software will make you feel otherwise. Since they merged with CVS I am sure all that has changed."
good,I worked for Target just a little over a year and it was okay. The job included health benefits and a 401k but the the amount of hours you work was not worth the money they paid.
good,"Not a bad environment to start your first job at . . . . . . . . . . friendly coworkers, a lot of younger workers. easy place to get stuck at though.."
good,"Working at target opened many doors for me which I will always be grateful for. I think everyone should work once in their life time in a retail store. Helps you be stern, and quick."
good,I enjoyed working for them and I will be reapplying even if it was seasonal. I enjoyed the hours I was scheduled to work and the wages they offered.  Overall satisfied with the company.
good,Target is a fun interactive environment with a plethora of things to learn and develop from. The leadership is fun and interactive. guest and daily duties are typically fun and you get to interact with great guests.
good,Target is a great place to work while in school. They will work around your schedule and make sure that you can get to your classes. Some of the managers aren't great. They like to hire them right out of college and a lot don't have any real world experience but are willing to learn. The only real problem is that sometimes the scheduling is not solid and with shopping seasons sometimes your hours can be severely cut.
good,Depending on the day your shift can go fast or slow. Being in market your work load is heavier than other department in the store and is a faster pace.
good,"Great for people who need a first job. A lot of friendly coworker, but you get over worked. you'll be working two jobs for the price of one, unless you're a cashier."
good,"Great pay for salaried managers and decent work-life balance compared to many other big-box retails (5-day work weeks, every other weekend off, generally understanding upper management).  However, it's still retail, meaning long days, especially around Holidays and usually not enough resources to get job done, resulting in salaried managers working 60+ hours a week and occasional 6+ days a week."
good,"I enjoyed working at target you need to be friendly and do your part, It can be fun or hard depending on your position and your level of friendship with the staff. I recommend working for target for a short time but really thinking about it if you want to stay longer. "
good,"As a guest service rep you will start off the day by completing a checklist of opening day tasks. Throughout the day you will provide fast and efficient services to many customers who seek to make returns, learn about product, locate product, contact other stores and target services, and provide information regarding lost and found items, assets protection, wic help, and registries. It is highly encouraged, and stressed, that you promote the target credit and debit card options along with their perks. This will continue until the end of the day where a second closing checklist should be completed."
good,"A typical day at work included checking in with the leader on duty and coming up with a game plan for the day. Checking in later on to update them, perhaps receive some help from others. Through Target, I have learned how to cashier, give exceptional customer/guest service, properly recover an area, set planograms, merchandise and use my creative thinking to fix issues or come up with another solution. The workplace culture is great for expressing yourself. You can incorporate your personal style through the red shirts and khaki pants. The hardest part about the job is finding ways to accommodate call-offs during large trucks or busy days. The most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships and learning new things."
good,"requires to be global and resilient to constant change"
good,Servicing consumers whether over the phone or in person through guest services. Helping people to find the items that they were interested in purchasing.
good,"I have some fond memories of working at Target, but most of that is because of the people I worked with. The management was usually changing pretty often and much of the time you were taking instruction from people who knew less than you did. Target really wanted to make itself the best company for employees, but I think it would take some restructuring of its work force in order to do that, not just free food on Black Friday... I'm sorry, Green Friday!"
good,"Upper management needs to be on the same page and convey the same message"
good,"demands of your job will hinder ability to have work/life balance.  Future development/opportunities for growth are sometimes nonexistent depending on work center.  "
good,"I loved working at target. I believe it was just the target that I worked at which is located downtown Chicago on State Street. The people there did not care about team members  they only cared  about themselves.  I typical day at target would be me working on the cash register, promoting targets red cars, and  leaving a great last impression on the store. My customer service skills are great I had guest that only came to my line because of my great attitude and  determination to help them with whatever they needed.  During that time I was going through some family issues and I had to quit right away. I'll try to work though so I wouldn't have to quit but they weren't trying to help. I've been wanting to get back at target but just a different location."
good,Help process payroll by approving schedules and time-off requests. Developed schedules weekly. Helped to keep back office areas clean and organize staff events for staff appreciation days.
good,Unless you plan on going to school for business and plan to dedicate your life to target then don't expect much it's a great first job or even temporary job but not a forever one unless you truly plan to stay and only want to live up the ranks
good,"Great place for those who choose retail management. If you like retail and merchandising then Target is the place for you. Solid career that pays well, although they recently changed their pay structure so you can't earn as much as you use to. Culture depends on your district and store. I've worked in a store where they made me work 12 hours a day like a slave, and a store where I only had to put in 8 hours. It depends on store manager and district manager on your overall experience."
good,Always interacting with guest & team members.  Work life balance depends on location & leadership team.  Great culture & pay. Leadership skills a must
good,"Was an okay place to be for retail. A lot of people stay with the company for years and rack up their pay. Everyone was nice and management was, for the most part, friendly and kind. I don't want to work retail again but if I had to I would pick Target."
good,"You'd arrive at work just before 10pm then spend the next hour to 4 hours unloading a truck with boxes that vary in size onto pallets before taking a small break then heading out to the sales floor after store close to restock the shelves for a couple hours. Then you'd get a lunch break before continuing stocking the shelves until just before store open. Management was mostly there to direct everyone to their work location. The culture was okay, I never really felt like there was very open communication with management for grievances. Aside from the one person I started the job with I never really got to know any one else I worked with. In the application and interview I was told that I'd be lifting boxes no more than 50lbs and I distinctly remember a time where I was lifting boxes that were intended for two people to lift, by myself. I didn't mind working at night though. It was kind of surreal working in a large retail outlet like that in the middle of the night. I didn't like not having a set amount of hours worked each night. When we finished stocking we went home. Sometimes that would be at 5am, sometimes it was at 10a just before or after open."
good,"A typical day of work was very simple. unload the truck, stock, rinse and repeat. I didn't learn much besides working more consistently and in a team. Management is iffy, they either like you or they don't. Culture was very professional, sundays were the hardest because of the truck, most enjoyable part would have to be when we all work effectively"
good,"Overall easy job. Benefits but low pay. Raises were usually about 10 cents every year. Only 10% off discount. Sadly you have to work on Thanksgiving for ""Black Friday""."
good,"I've worked here under a couple different management teams and honestly that's what made the difference in the store culture. Getting through the day with a solid team behind you makes dealing with difficult guests so much easier. But if your store doesn't have a solid management team thats looking out for you, its easy to get overwhelmed and frustrated with the job."
good,From the time I have started at target I have learned about cashiering gas service I've done photo lab I went to unloading truck stocking the store to plan on teen resetting the store which is a lot of fun you learn a lot setting for season to season back to school .
good,What I learned working at Target is that it get extremely busy really fast no matter what time in the day it is. You have customers come in and buy all kinds of things from electronics to groceries.
good,Hard Work and stopped giving incentives. Will not help with advancing career if you are not a drone to their procedures.  Best part of the job is the people whom you work with.
good,"If you are a student then I would recommend working at this company. I actually really enjoyed Target, it's more or less the management I encountered at my particular store that made me want to quit."
good,"Great management training, able to move up quickly if you do well.  Compensation is good, but working on holidays/weekends is a tradeoff. Would recommend to a friend."
good,"A typical work day at Target was typically structured as you'll clock in and read your duties for the day, it'll usually be your normal assignment unless they were short on staff or busier than normal"
good,"Target is a great company to work for overall. The benefits package is really good, and they really take care of their team members. They offer insurance, 401k, team member discounts, and education reimbursement, just to name a few. However at my particular location, the upper management (executive team leaders and above; aka, the people running the store) are generally kind of lazy and don't know what they're doing. Many executive team leaders are hired right out of college and have no real world management experience. They are also really cheap with payroll, so there are never enough people on the floor, which has a negative impact on culture and morale."
good,This job was a perfect jumpstart into the retail world where one's social and critical thinking skills are most important. As i developed those skills I found that there is only so much growth amongst a corporation like Target. I felt as if I had given more than I had received and therefore found it necessary to leave.
good,"The pay may be better than what anyone in retail is used to seeing, but they definitely make you work for the extra pay. They hire in bulk and look 2/3 of those people that they do not replace and often and little to no coverage in the store."
good,Very busy and fast paced job.  Target did a great job in showing that employees are very important to the success of the company.  Benefits were very good as well.
good,"Productive and you are trained in more than just one area. I've seen employees promote from one job to another, and they are very flexible with your class schedule. Benefits are great also, for a college student part time they offer a lot of different benefits to help you. You can work as many hours as you want, pick up as many shifts as you want. The training is pretty quick, but you learn a lot as you go and overtime you will be asked to train someone new."
good,working their was good but the hours depended on the time the trucks were done and the shelves where stocked the pacing was good and the people there were great.
good,In the beginning of the day you would unload the trailer of all product and organize it in to their prospective departments. Once everything was organized you would unwrap or unpack all product and place it on the shelves to be restocked. Once the soft lines department was complete we would move to hard lines to assist them. We had a team meeting everyday to discuss numbers and progress. Management was always there. The work place was a fast pace work environment. The hardest part of the job was completing everything in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting guests in finding what they needed.
good,"When I joined Target they were relevant, trending and leading the industry in merchandising, presentation, and marketing. Over the years I was with Target they changed the culture of leadership from a focus on identifying and developing great talent to more of a focus on social action."
good,"The thing that bothered me the most besides the low wages was that they really expected you to make Target your number one job/priority over everything else. The discount was okay but you were spending your low wages on stuff that most times you didn't need or could get elsewhere for cheaper. The best part about working there was definitely the people you worked with and got to know on a day-to-day basis. But on the flipside, they have a very high turnover rate. Even in manager positions."
good,"Whatever a day is like working here depends largely on the kind of people you work with. Personally, it is not the worst job I've ever had, however, it could be better."
good,I transfer from Cypress Ca  to west Covina Ca  Because my husband and I got own place I'm   really happy were I'm they always tell everyone good job...
good,"very relaxed environment almost detached "
good,"I worked the sales floor and backroom at two different locations. Pretty typical retail setting. High turnover, slightly more than minimum wage compensation. The workload is reasonable, no specific skills required to start, management typically listens and tries to help. I prefer variety in my daily tasks. the work ""Union"" might as well be a curse word. I consider it to have been a good stepping stone for a better job/career."
good,This job was ok however I was hired full time and after working there less than a month I started getting my hours cut to part time for most weeks because of over spending.
good,The work is easy and training is good. The management sucks they will throw you under the bus pretty quick to make them self-look good.The team environment is great but overall is a okay job
good,"I enjoyed working at Target, although it wasn't the right job for me. Each shift I had could be a little different depending on what part of the store I was assigned to. I completed duties like organizing clothes, pricing, tagging, taking products to the floor, assisting customers, answering the stores phone and directing people. I learned good skills on how to greet all different people. It taught me patience while also giving me good practice on managing a full time job. The most enjoyable part of my job was the the communication I got to have with customers. I loved being able to help them."
good,"It is the same thing over and over again. I enjoyed it but it gets stressful on peak times. At the location I'm at the management is not great, very unorganized, unhappy, and falling apart. Target is great, a previous location I worked at was a lot better. The Kennesaw target has bad management and is not in a great area so there are lots of high item thefts which leads to employee hour cuts."
good,"Company is going down hill so they're trying all these new things to turn things around.  They're opening smaller stores only because the big stores are failing and it's cheaper labor."
good,I was a good job but I had to leave cause. I had a baby and it was hurting my back real bad...but it's a good company to work for and coming up in the company.
good,"Target is okay, the work is easy but sometimes coworkers will not pull their own weight, and if you try to seek help from a manager, they might not take you seriously. It's just frustrating customer service."
good,"worked to the bone, 70+ hours per week.  Extremely fast paced and physically demanding role.  High level of accountability and pressure. Would not recommend the role to anyone.  Working for Target was not so bad, just steer clear of logistics."
good,"Target was somewhere I always imagined I would work. Sadly the dream didn't match up to the reality. Day in and day out as a Cashiers supervisor I was instructed to push cashier harder and harder to get the consumers to buy into our corporate loyalty cards. My direct supervisors told me to tell them that even after the first ""No"" given by the guest to keep pestering their shopping experience and try to further sell. The jobs fast paced and usually fine until you are over selling REDCARDS, and telling guests they can't duplicate their coupons."
good,"Had to pressure guests daily to apply for red cards.  If you got a decent amount the reward would be decent, but the pressure was to high to have people apply.  It would go towards your review every 6 months."
good,I worked at target for over a year and transferred from a chicago target to a texas target. My main issue with this target was the scheduling. Other than that it was a good job that involved me in customer service and many other opportunities.
good,"fast paced environment, in which you learn the day to day customer services qualities. Management is very knowledgably trained. Hardest part of the job is not being able to please all customers to all their needs, company policies sometimes restrict you to certain regulations. The most enjoyable part of this job was interaction with many different cultures in customers."
good,"Pros:"
good,Made lifelong friends with employees and customers while enjoying the work experience. Friendly and customer service attitude and environment. Ability to be creative and helpful to all.
good,I loved working with many nice coworkers and vendors I learned alot from them and I had fun making customers smile knowing they liked shopping our stores.
good,"I love working at Target. I feel like a valued part of the team.  I have been working on the flow team.  I do not unload the trucks, I unpack, sort and put items on the shelf."
good,Great work place and team work . Some of the workers aren't really friendly. The management team always there most of the time of need. Clean store. Security is always on point
good,A typical day is ringing up guests. I learned to be patient with guests and how to use a PDA for stocking. It's an overall smooth work environment even during the holidays.
good,Typical day to day was easy to understand and plan. Adjusting to business needs can be stressful and put pressure on your teams. Employee culture was great and made you look forward to coming to work.
good,"Any job is what you make of it. It's hard, physical work. Time goes by quickly as long as you can stay busy. If you're single the opportunity to make good money. People with families can as well if you don't mind the separation in the busy time."
good,"Either your doing your own work or you are helping a co- worker, always busy work place, need better support system. Worked as pharmacy cashier then I was placed to work on the sales floor."
good,"Target loves their staff, and I love how they give recognition for your hard work! We all need that every now and then. Being a sales associate kept me busy but I will say that is one job I can see me returning to."
good,Overall valuable work experience. Management could have communicated a lot better. Most enjoyable part was working with some of the other team members.
good,"Its good to work there if you get enough shifts. friendly team members and management. But its bad when you are given very little shifts, and very little shifts mean no bills get paid."
good,"Loved Working at Target. Learnt how to do many things such as"
good,"Overall Target is a cool place to work, however I would only recommend it for students because of the flexible scheduling. Wish there was more people working in each department especially the closing shift"
good,Nothing crazy simple. No issues really with target. Hardest part of job was jus trying to get red cards. When people didn't really want them.
good,"Great place to work, with good pay just not the place for you if you cannot stand being on your feet all day. You are only given 15 min breaks, and being a cashier the customers only get more crowded."
good,"Unload 2400 Piece truck, meaning 2400 boxes."
good,Great team atmosphere where the store managers are hands on & will jump in to help the team members. great chances for growth & advancement. will be trained to succeed
good,Job is only great for younger generation or part timers. They actively under staff store and managers. Goals are unreachable for almost everyone.  They do provide great advancement and job security.
good,"Hours are plentiful, coworkers are nice, but management didnt listen to anything that was said. Liked the customers but was expected to do a lot in a short amount of time. Sometimes was even expected to do the supervisor job for my pay. Learned a lot of people skills though and how to de-escalate some angry customers."
good,"It's like a family. Definitely a team like atmosphere when it comes to understanding. But hours can change and open availability is recommended. Getting hired in the spring and summer can mean you are a regular employee. Holiday pay you will work a ton but apply to other jobs if you plan to keep working. As a regular employee, after holidays you will get less hours. So I suggest getting another jobs or applying elsewhere."
good,"Could be doing other jobs other than original job applied for. Cashier (cashing people out, Selling Red Cards), Merchandising (stocking shelves with new merchandise), or Sales floor (sizing, folding, cleaning)."
good,"Just depends on the people you work with, can be a good job or a bad job. When working there I learned how to use a box compactor."
good,"Pay could be better, they may keep more employees that way. Company was good, management was fine. There should be more opportunities for advancement."
good,"Fast paced and very expectant of fast learners at all tasks."
good,I would get in and start by going to the front end as a brand attendant but as a warehouse worker I would go straight to the warehouse and start work immediately. I learned how to organize the warehouse and operate pallet jacks and a cardboard baler proficiently. Management was friendly but a little scattered and didn't really have good coordination with one another. Co-workers were friendly and good workers. Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers most of the time. Most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction of meeting merchandising deadlines.
good,Fun and great place to work easy to move up in this company . Management is really invovled with employees and is always there to answer all questions
good,My team at my experience at target was what kept me going . With such a big store target does an amazing job at keeping there team informed and we'll supported however which such a well built team of associates is sad to say that once you reach the higher arch  things get complicated team leads should be more apart of everyday work and management should allow that a leader that can not work with its pack will never be respected by them
good,pay could be more the wear and tear put on your body. they put a high demand on the employees because without us theres nothing and there is very little care when it comes to our cars being parked on their property..always random car break ins several in a day..whats security there for just to watch whats in the building what about someone just to protect our cars that get us here to do the work is that to much to ask..just care about the employee too..thats all
good,"If you don't hit your numbers then they don't care. If you do hit your numbers your walls better be good because they will fuss about those next. Training was pretty bad, you are left alone and if you have questions you have to walk around to find someone or wait until someone passes your lanes. Every employee should have a radio on them because there were times I wouldn't see another person for a half hour if I was on an outer quad. In that heat someone could pass out on a trailer and nobody know."
good,Great fun and fast paced work environment.  Room for advancement great benefits and upbeat staff and management team. They provided great resources.
good,Fun and friendly workplace. I learned how to read light blueprint and schematics. The management was very professional and the co-workers were freindly.
good,Its a good place to be . only reason I stopped was transportation. Once you step foot inside them double doors you must be ready to work. This job is not for anyone that's like to take breaks in between time
good,"Target Executive Team Leads (ETLs) are responsible for leading teams of up to 60 team members to drive positive sales, resolve conflicts, and positively engage with guests. ETLs must be able to examine sales trends, identify business priorities, and lead a team to meet daily, weekly, and long-term goals.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction that comes from driving a team to meet goals. What is most frustrating is the often inconsistent communication from company leaders and how it affects business on a daily basis."
good,my coworkers make my job really in enjoyable. They were a big help on getting all the task that was assign to us on a daily biases done and on time.
good,I loved working at Target. I love the company and my Team. I spent three years being promoted every six months. The last year however has been very different. The STL is all about playing games and favorites. The only reason management got one star is bc I had to.
good,Target is a fast paced place to work. I'm always so time goes by quickly. My co-workers are helpful and ready to work. My manager is determined and easy to talk to.
good,I would say Target has been good to me over the years.  I was able to leverage my natural abilities and grow my skill set.  I believe that you truly will hit a cap at some point with Target so you will need to be prepared for that to happen for you.
good,"I worked for Target for approximately five years while I was going to school.  It provided a great opportunity to work while going to school and it seemed that management was flexible with accommodating its employees in this regard.  The company provided good benefits, even to part-time employees.  When it came time for me to graduate school, however, I put in for an internship with the company and was denied.  This ultimately lead to me leaving the company all together and changing my career goals."
good,Difficult to move up in the company with a college degree. Great Medical and dental benefits. Poor vacation time for Hourly employees.
good,"Target was a pretty good place to work, I was working on the truck unloading in the morning and set up of the departments. Everyone was nice and helpful if I needed something and training was straight forward."
good,Fun place to work at people were nice it was an easy job the hard part was waking up to get there I had the 4am shift so i was tired because i would do stuff in the day time and not get enough sleep.
good,Fun and easy going work environment with strong team membership throughout store leaders as well as a strong work ethic among coworkers
good,They have a great design in equipment but the stupid engineers put all that sophisticated equipment in a non-environment controlled building.  They don't understand that temperatures / humidity damaged electronics.  In summer it is brutal and winter you freeze your @#% off.
good,A typical day at work consists of you doing everything on your own. No one is holding your hand throughout the day and the freedom is nice. The hardest part of the day is your on your own.
good,Target is a good place to work. The managers are very understanding and willing to work with you if you are having issues outside of work. I've learned how to manage the cash register and deal with angry customers. The co workers are very helpful and generous. The hardest part of the day is when we have a afternoon rush. My most enjoyable part of the day is when I take my lunch break.
good,"Receive merchandise in busy retail outlet."
good,"Very casual workplace that effectively gets things done on time."
good,"what i learned was how to be more orangnized and how to work as a team. management is the worst now horrible communication,they need to learn how to act like a team , be organized. I like some of my co workers. the only hard part about the job is getting a promotion. the most enjoyable is working with my co workers that work hard, managers that appreciate are hard work."
good,"Helped guest select products that best fit their personal needs."
good,"Most of the day is spent doing other people's job while trying to ensure that yours is done as well. You always have an opportunity to relay your complaints to hr or to a team leader but more times than not, they fall on deaf ears. The benefits that are shown to you actually for the most part aren't there. The college benefit is only applicable if you are having to go for a position they want to hire you for. The insurance is not available through target but is through an open market and you have to maintain 32 hours weekly to qualify. The only ""full time"" positions are for higher ups. You will average between 20-30 hours a week. It is RARE if you will ever get 40 and even then it's only during back to college and Christmas. I love my job and enjoy most of my coworkers but for the most part, it is not worth the hassle."
good,I worked at Target for a year and a couple months and I started worked as a flow team associate. It was pretty challenging unloading the trucks that they wanted you to get done in a certain amount of time depending on the size of the freight. I thought that they should have gave a pay increase specifically for doing that because only a few people were able to do the work labor and most of the others didn't want anything to do with unloading the truck. But then later when I started getting trained in other areas I began to pick up different shifts in different departments around the store which I thought was pretty cool if you needed to pick up any additional hours. The managers in my particular store were very professional and treated everyone with respect. But I didn't feel like they really pushed people into getting promoted. So for some associates they didn't really feel like doing anything extra because they didn't see anything to work towards. also the raises were terrible. Most associates told me that their raises after a year were 10 cents and below. and I myself was a very good worker and seen my raise was only 26 cents which is something that discourages you to even want to work there anymore. especially when you only start off at making $8.50 an hour base pay.
good,I like the job it was fun not only that I enjoyed helping the guest with everything they needed. I have learned how to promote their red cards but getting the guest to sign up. I loved working with my coworkers that I have gained to know. the hardest part of my job was dealing with disrespectful people.
good,"Working at Target was, for me, not a great experience. Employees around me got away with a lot of slacking off or mistakes, and management did not seem knowledgeable about how to create schedules that worked for their employees. People were constantly being given shifts they simply could not work due to other obligations like college classes and were treated harshly when bringing these issues up."
good,"My typical day at work is coming into work at least 5 minutes early and clocking in for my shift. I go on a lane that my manager wants me to go on. I make sure my lane is clean and make sure that everything we need is there. I stand outside of my lane and always see if guests need help with anything or are ready to check out. What I have learned in my five years working at Target, is that it is important to have confidence in yourself and the ability to communicate with guests in the most manageable way possible. I am hearing impaired so I was shy when I started working at Target and stumbled a lot when I tried to communicate with guests in a calm manner. I believe I have gotten better over the years. In the end it is always about having confidence in yourself and your abilities. "
good,Nice for seasonal but no more for permanent. But it is better than fast food. I wouldn't recommend them for permanent unless your starting in flow.
good,The job is very fast paced and there is never a day where you have the same day. It is an amazing start into a management career. You learn how to be resilient and adaptable.  It is a struggle to keep up with the ever-changing demands and new metrics.  It does become challenging to have personal time when you work 10 hour days and work every other weekend. You also have no holidays except for christmas day.
good,"Efficient process for stocking and unloading boxes from the truck. Dependence on every team member means when one doesn't work well with others, it affects the whole team."
good,Target its a good job espcailly if you're trying to get retail experience. you learn fast fun and friendly customer service. Management is okay. Co-workers give good vibes and the hardest part is when they cut hours when they do not make sales.
good,A typical day at Target is cool.I learned a lot from from the Team Leaders hard working co-workers there is nothing hard about this job easy work for your pay.The most enjoyable part of the job is it can be a career.
good,A normal day at work was fun and held a steady pace. My coworkers were great and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was selling the Target Redcard. It could be stressful at times to meet our daily goals of signing guests up for the savings card. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with friendly guests.
good,"I was able to request certain hours to work. The employees and supervisor were very friendly and helpful.  Employee recognition daily from supervisors  on job well done, recognized by customers, etc."
good,"A typical day at work consists of me being fast fun and friendly.Everyday i learn something different about a guest and for me that is a great challenge, because everyone is different. My management is always there when i need something. The most enjoyable part of me being at work is when i get to help others."
good,"Target as a company is fine, but your personal experience will really boil down to management. If management is poor you will likely be seeking another job sooner rather than later."
good,"They work you like a slave and they don't pay you much.  However, I'm sure it looks good on your resume.  In a typical shift, a Sales Floor Team Member which is my position runs the cash register, stocks the shelves, assists guests(Target calls the customers guests.), and straightens out the shelves.  You do learn the retail trade quite well there.  Management is highly professional and good but they are slave drivers.  My co-workers are cool.  I think your co-workers are the best part of the job.  The hardest part of the job is the overwhelming work load they give you.  The most enjoyable part of the job is hanging out with your co-workers which doesn't happen a lot."
good,"Worked hard for not a lot of pay, and a lot was asked of each employee. Advancement was often contingent upon a 4 year degree."
good,"Opening store getting cashiers in place to serve customers, helping customers with inquires in store, processing returns, photo orders, check outs, collecting data for credit cards etc."
good,Super target is a fun and exciting workplace that allows potential for growth within the company and supports all schedules as well as working with those in school.
good,"The day always starts right when I come in, we do the same things everyday. I've learned that you can't expect everyone can work like you, knowing the procedures and process and how to work smart and knowing the reports around the store. My co-workers are amazing, I have 3 veterans workers that have been with me for 8-9 years and some new ones that are willing to learn and improve. My management, has been through a lot of ups and downs. Our head of logistics recently resigned and now we our having a new one come in, our Replishment Exec is current taking over. The hardest part of the job is when you know your doing the right thing everyday but the others that don't push to the piece or check other locations get away with it. The appreciation I get from my higher ups I don't get, or the opportunity to grow I don't get it. Instead they choose someone younger or newer than me. The most enjoyable thing in this work is when I'm working in the receiving end and I get to communicate with other vendors that come in or when results of the reports tells me my accuracy is getting better or the errors for the store is getting lower, or I get feedback from my Team lead and he gives me feedback to improve to be a better person as a team member or in the future a better team lead."
good,"- Could use better management"
good,"great place to work for. people are very nice and great atmosphere. management needs some work to improve. Overall, great company to work for."
good,Good environment to work in co workers were helpful and friendly. A lot of interaction with others makes it fun and workable
good,"The pay is low but I did enjoy working there. Benefits are average,But having fun is not a crime here as long as the work is done correctly and safely."
good,Friendly staff. never a bad day. they should hire more cashiers though. I always had a long line no matter how fast i went. And there were only 2 other cashiers open.
good,"the job is not hard its just that there is late nights and the management is terrible/ The job needs to be more flexible, and respect the hours that you asked when hired. The management dont care about your life out of work."
good,"Target team members perform a variety of job duties throughout department store locations. Typical work days include greeting customers, stocking shelves, organizing displays, taking inventory, and assisting in sales. Many crew members with Target serve as cashiers, as well. Target team member jobs may involve heavy lifting and working on foot for long periods of time. Holiday shopping seasons may create hectic and demanding work environments at times. Applicants with customer service experience may gain preferential treatment during the Target hiring process; however, crew member jobs typically require no previous experience. Training includes a brief probationary period involving visual, verbal, and hands-on orientation lasting up to a month. Training period may vary by Target location and employee experience."
good,"A day at Target consists of a lot of hard work, determination, time limits, and a lot of things that you cannot possibly do within the hours that they give you, and even when you do your best, your best isn't enough. Managers talk down to you. Its a lot of pressure. "
good,"Like many jobs I have had, the people I worked with were the main reason I came to work each day.  It was also rewarding to help the patient population, but unfortunately the heavy hand that HR had on the company and in my department made work life tedious and cumbersome on many days."
good,"A typical day consisted of helping customers find the items they were looking for, or suggesting good substitutes. Also working to keep the store clean and well stocked. "
good,Helping customers cash out. Helping stock the store and working the deli area. Keeping up with the customers was hard during holiday seasons. Checking customers out was the most enjoyable.
good,Overall a positive experience.  Work life balance is difficult and retail is now for everyone.  At some point one must look toward a career that caters more toward the family.
good,Working at Target was a great experience co-workers and management were very helpful. The most enjoyable part about the job for me was meeting new people.
good,"Target as a whole seems like a great company with a vision for the future. The problem comes from that vision. It seems like there is either mixed direction to the Store Leadership team or for some reason the Store Leadership can not get on the same page. "
good,"I worked at Target for nearly 3 years. When I started I worked the Flow Team early in the morning and eventually moved to the back room. The work was very labor intensive and often times we were given unrealistic deadlines to finish in in order to make us work harder. The management was alright. Certain managers were wonderful, smart, and kind while other would cause work drama and carry themselves in a very unprofessional way. My biggest complaint would be that they frown upon promoting from within because they wanted managers with college degrees (any degree, one manager had a degree in surfing or something to that nature, I kid you not). More often than not a new manager was almost always someone who had never worked at Target in their life, had no idea what they were doing, and had to be taught what to do by the people they were supposed to be in charge of which led to clumsy inefficient performance. That being said, I had good days and bad days working here. Its an alright first job but I would not recommend seeking a career here unless you plan on quitting, going to college, and coming back to be a manager which some people did do and that did seem to workout for them which has made me consider doing the same."
good,"Thanks to this new service company I got more experience in administration. I used to do almost the same things I did in my previous job such as: organising, communicate with customers, maintain supplies inventory, solve billing problems that were missed and so on. The hardest part of this job was work to deadlines and the most enjoyable part was to make new connections and gain more experience in my field."
good,when working in the cafe you must check for expired food and product. keeping the cafe lobby clean at all times and customer service. Everyday you must make orders for the cafe and pizza hut so you dont run out of supplies except Sunday and Saturday.When opening you must start proof the dough and preparing the food for the next day. Evening person finish the what ever the morning hasn't done and pans the pizza for tomorrow. closer must clean all equipment and check to see if everything is done for tomorrow.
good,I love this job! I love the people the work place and the management team was great and open to helping. Fun work place and great team work.
good,A typical day at work is providing great guest service to the customers and making sure they go home with what they came to shop for.
good,"Poor management leads to high turn over and inconsistient  team performance."
good,Wonderful working atmosphere.  Learned many skills on the job. Highly charged environment. Multiple management changes.  Physically attractive work space.  Meeting heavy.
good,"It is extremely difficult to move up at Target.When I started, I put all of my life into the company to get recognized by the management and continued to work hard. But then i Realized that  putting 100% for $9.07 isn't worth it. I was hired for softlines (working with the clothes), and wanted to move to guest services. MY ETL (Executive Team Leader) wouldn't allow me to get trained for guest services for there were only 10people trained for softlines. Target is a good starting out job. They are great for references but don't try to stay and move up. You get one raise a year and it goes up only a couple of cents. There are people that have worked there for 5 years and recieve a handful of change more than me"
good,"Target is a great place for developing yourself as a leader.  This is a company that really likes to promote within and will respond, for the most part, if you put the effort in to moving up.  The downside of this is that this all varies by store and leadership, even though this is the overall culture.  "
good,"By the end of my first six months, I found myself taking on responsibilities all over the store. Frankly, they were running me ragged. Regardless, my pay only increased 9 cents from minimum wage. This was, in part, due to the reality that someone was heavily involved with my employee review process, who had been on the job only a few weeks. This person was unkind and unrealistic with nearly everyone."
good,"This type of work was alright, had to wake up very early in the morning, at the crack of dawn. The pay was min, but no really any benefits, or career advancement."
good,It was nice to have such an understand team to work with. If i had any problems i knew if i confronted my employer about it it would be solved in a speedy amount of time. Almost everyone there was nice and intuitive to your needs.
good,Fast paced and fun retail environment to work at. Great opportunity to interact and meet new people on a daily basis. Strong customer service skills needed.
good,Target has a great corporate culture. I enjoy the people I have met and have had the chance to work with for the past three years as Target employs people from all different backgrounds.
good,Target was a very fun place to work. Management was fantastic and team members made the shifts go by fast. interacting with guests was almost always a positive experience
good,"Retail is its own type of work, with that being said.  Management has great concepts; however, we can't always maintain that culture and meet profit margins.  Push yourself you got the one week training, now push yourself to be amazing.  You are a salary employee so if you don't have ""hours"" for your team members to complete the work, I guess you have to step up to finish the job."
good,"A typical day for me would consist of ordering supplies, performing scheduled interviews, writing 90 day and annual reviews, making sure my team and our guests were taken care of and happy."
good,"A typical day at work included checking people out at the register, greeting them, and making sure they were satisfied with their experience at target. i also tried to promote target credit or debit card which helps the guess save money. Management are very professional.  some of our Co-workers are very friendly and easy to work with. The most enjoyable part working for target was the ability to help people with any question they had about the store. and making sure they had an amazing experience."
good,"As salesfloor team leader, responsible for managing the hardlines and softlines team, ensuring endcaps are set, the store is neat and presentable, drive sales, create fun ideas to make work fun."
good,"O trabalho era rotineiro, embora tivéssemos que interagir e procurar soluções diárias."
good,"Supervisor didn't make things clear about what should be expected during your work trial. Employees were cool, but remember they are not your friends.  Always smile and know the store before you help guests otherwise you will look stupid trying to help them."
good,"Through a focus of inclusiveness, this company strives to focus on the work/life balance, while maintaining a focus on delivering exceptional shopping experiences for all customers."
good,"I am currently working at Target, while finishing off my bachelors  degree at Keystone College. I would say that Target has been one of the best companies I have worked for during my college experience and they were very flexible with school hours."
good,"Responsible for assisting the director of sales on Natl Accounts. Sales Support, pricing purchase orders, maintain relationships with clients. Post sale implementation: insertion orders, invoices, billing."
good,"It was a lot of work but I say it was fun. I like staying busy so for me working on the floor picking up clothes, helping guest on there needs and also jumping into the register to help out with guest was great for me. It had me moving a lot."
good,Cashier work at a fast and timely paste. Friendly co workers in the work place. There were no hard parts about this job. Most enjoyable part of this job is helping the customers.
good,"Long hours with little or no support. Learned how to complete goals on my own. Management Team worked well in meeting to help all teams, but was more concerned with their own departments. Long hours and working holidays. Working with a great team."
good,Customer service helping and assiting with people. I learn to get along with people my management so very helpful I enjoy working with different types of people.
good,"Simple stuff, stock and refill shelves into their proper locations."
good,"Target has an amazing culture, and offers analysts a world of opportunities with respect to strategic projects, innovation etc.  The company lacks the discipline to apply refined processes especially with respect to their Canadian entry.  There was little to no direction, and their decision to leave was haste and impacted thousands of people negatively."
good,"Great focus on development and leadership, lots of opportunity to promote if willing to put in long hours.  Lack of work/life balance, talked about, but not put into application.  "
good,"Working at Target was an excellent experiance. While the store was doing well, the atmosphere was great. The team worked very well together and the leaders provided a fast, fun and friendly environment. The company eventually chose to leave Canada, which was very difficult on every team member. I enjoyed my time at Target St. Albert and was sad to see the store close."
good,I learned a lot while I was there but it is hard to get ahead unless you are very motivated and willing to do anything at anytime.
good,Enjoyed being with a great team of coworkers that strive to better themselves. The job security was terrible though. That is the reason why i made the tough choice to leave.
good,"•	Sales floor trainer"
good,"i learned to help out others when they needed help learned to do some supervisory tasks i learned alot of the customers names that came by almost every day target when i was there and also performing cashier duties, product assistance and cleaning"
good,"When arrive on time Cloking the schedule in,out and lunch time"
good,"Long hours, very fast paced but fun at the same time.  Really depends on what store you are assigned to.  4th quarter is a rough one but if you can survive you can make it."
good,"Target is fast paced work environment that at one time was a great company to work for. They invest into your development, but fail to always follow through with what you're being developed for. Often the executives in the larger volume stores have a better chance of being promoted as they have less to stress about and can focus on bigger projects to get themselves noticed."
good,"It's a great place to work for the most part. The only thing that is tough is not really getting any time off and if you requested time off some of management would try and talk you out of it or would deny it without giving you a reason why. Overall the work environment is okay, although they do stress you out when talking about how sales are doing. Basically this place is a good place to work at if you don't have much going on in your personal life."
good,The team i worked with at Target was a fun group. We all got along well with each other and had some really fun times It was a great working environment.Everyone worked hard in their departments yet there was always a happy environment.
good,"Usually, at work on a good day its a lot of guests that comes into the building looking for different items they need. Its been times we didn't have specifically what they would request so I always did best by ordering it. I learned about new technologies & techniques to get the job done faster & satisfy the guest. The management was OK but at times a lot of words were said that wasn't suppose to. And human resources wouldn't do their job as well by the employees either. The hardest part of the job was trying to please every guests by their needs so we always was told to apologize anyway for the inconvenience. The most enjoyable part was meeting the new co-workers and guests as i did & genuinely connecting to everyone."
good,"I'm currently in charge of the shoe department. I make sure the whole department is dusted and shoe benches, mirrors, and displays are clean. I make sure endcaps are full and presentable. I go through each aisle and make sure they are detailed. Then if there is any reshop I make sure it is put away. Other days require different tasks depending on the needs of business."
good,"everyone was friendly,outgoing,i had constant work with little lay over time.plenty room for advancement. great pay discount on alot of merchandise in the store...overall fun place to work"
good,"Although its a retail store, Target has been a great company to work for. There are always opportunities to move up at the store level, although can be hard to move into upper management or Corporate levels. I have learned a lot of great skills working in specific positions that will help me through my life as I look for better jobs. The hardest part of working at Target is that it is retail, so working Holidays. Target is constantly changing and sometimes the changes are not for the better, i.e. some policies put in place are not the best for the store. But, the good thing is Target will improve where they see the need."
good,"A typical day at Target can be stressful if you let it. The guest are sometimes rude. I clock in and I go to my area listed on the sheet. I zone and help out any customer that comes my way. I've learned not to take work home with me. I've learned how to fold clothing the proper way, set up displays, put out new product, cleanup spills the proper way. The management was ok for the most part. The co-workers are what made the job fun for me. They laughed at my jokes, helped me with any problems I had, super useful. The hardest part about the job was not stressing about something that you had no control over as far as getting 10 carts of clothes back to the floor. The most enjoyable part is meeting and working with different people."
good,"The job paid relatively well, I got 30 minutes of break time for every two hours I worked, and the management was friendly; I can't really complain too much."
good,"I loved Target. Pay was good, work was simple, culture was wonderful. I wouldn't have left but they decided to close up shop."
good,"A typical day at work is easy and yet hard at the same time. Dealing with retail is alway rushing and getting everyone happy and out the door. One hard part about working as a cashier is dealing with people, mix and match signs, and when someone is on bad terms with you as a cashier. I've learned so many things working as a cashier. I value a lot of things for exmaple, putting things away where they belong. Another thing I've learned is social skills by talking to the managers, co-workers, and customers."
good,"A tupical day would start whith unloading trucks, and then stocking the sales floor. "
good,"Target is a great place to work. A typical day was pretty much constantly checking the sales floor, putting out items for guest and checking for re-shop. Work environment is"
good,"Lower volume store where managers, both Executive and fellow Team Leads work together to lead team members to a successful execution of daily tasks, company expectations and procedures. Working with fellow leaders of diverse backgrounds and the ability to learn from one another and use suggestions to better execute business needs. Enjoy working with the public and the ability to make a difference in their day. Hardest part is taking on multiple leadership roles and retaining the ability of completing all tasks within a timely manner in both assigned leadership role and additional roles added to daily routines."
good,"Working at target was a very fun experience, I planned on continuing work there, but it was only a seasonal job and they had to let me go. Other than that it was a nice workplace. My managers were nice, and the co-workers were literally my best friends. The hardest part of the day was closing, very stressful! But overall, i loved coming into work each day seeing everybody and showing great customer service."
good,Target works your complete hard but doesn't pay you enough. Working here you definitely will not have a life outside of work.
good,"Good overall place, My location specifically was hard to reach & Gave bad hours."
good,Frequent Change in management. Co workers take job to serious no room to grow
good,"I have worked for Target for 3 years now and it was a great place to work. Now, management seems to have little to no involvement with helping the team and the LOD's are to busy running the store from the office to provide a fun atmosphere anymore. Management works part time unless there is a visit and the team is highly mico-managed. I use to love working here but with horrible leadership provided by the ETL's I am looking to move on."
good,my coworkers made my day. we always had fun as we taught each other how to stock the store and learn new things.
good,"Working at Target was an experience. Some days would go faster than others, but there was always something to do and something to learn."
good,"From day to day you could work in one or more work-center(s). Answering guests' (costumers') questions, responding to backups, replenishing the shelves, and cleaning an area."
good,"You started your day by walking the sales floor before the store opened, made notes for what needed to be done.  Had store meeting at 8:00.  Discussed sales for previous day and year to date, announced any events that everyone needed to know about, manager of each area gave brief status of their area and any shout outs for great performance.  I enjoyed the people I worked with.  I felt I was part of the team like I said until my last year.  The hardest part of the job was having to watch your back other than that the job was awesome."
good,Target was a nice workplace. Worked with a cool overnight crew.
good,"Job responsibilities:"
good,"When I clocked into work at Target on a usual day I would be greeted by a friendly and familiar face. I could immediately gauge how the day would be based on the work load left over for me or by the amount of people at the registers shopping. This would always determine how fast or slow my work shift would be. The management wouldn't be an issue to me because I always knew what was going on an was always the forst to respond to help in other sections. Although fair some of the mangers would be, there were times where the workload could be a bit of a challenge. This only meant for m to call for more back up which i was never afraid to do. Work loads sometimes came in waves and we would have surprise loads of customers but over time this became a normalcy and didn't bother me or defer me from slowing down. All in all the job was a created opportunities to meet and help new people and to make lasting relationships with good and hard working people each and everyday."
good,I enjoyed my coworkers. There was a great atmosphere of teamwork.
good,It is a lot of work for little pay but that seems to be how minimum wage type jobs are.
good,always busy. different people everyday. tiring job. Great managers
good,"My personal standards of how a professional business should be ran were not met. Often you trained yourself instead of having some one else train you, or during your training were pulled away do to other tasks. Making the majority of people self-trained instead of receiving quality training, I assume not all targets are ran this way, however, the one I was employed at. Things were often done on ""good enough"" standards, I feel things should be ran that when you do something you do it correctly, not good enough."
good,"Very diverse work place. Management is cool. They're fun until they have to meet a deadline with something, then it becomes a plantation. Don't like staying in one area too long? Well cross training in other departments is very encouraged here! They want you to do it all for nothing. Great part time for school goers just looking for extra $$ and first time workers."
good,"My typical day started either cooking breakfast or, lunch for the customers. making fresh salads for the day, checking temperature  gauges on foods, washing dishes, cooking fresh cookies, popping a batch of fresh popcorn, making fresh coffee, stocking cooler, changing out soda drinks if needed, greeting customers, and cashiering."
good,"The Team Leaders I have right now make working at Target the best Job I have had. "
good,"Good place for married people,not a company to start career with"
good,"arrive to work before the store opens, Unload the truck or trucks, separate all products to be pushed onto the sales floor. Stock shelves and back stock the extra products"
good,"Always have something to do, I've learned all of my work ethics from Target because I have had this job since I was 16, co-workers and management are friendly, most difficult thing to do is keeping up with the heavy work loads, and the most enjoyable part of my job is communicating with so many different people."
good,Overall I enjoyed working there but certain tasks that are asked of you are somewhat ridiculous and makes team members uncomfortable.
good,"Everyday is a new day for me. I stride to make my tomorrow better than today, and my today better than yesterday. I learned a lot while working. From communication skills, and how to manage my time wisely. My coworkers keep me motivated and hungry for success. The toughest part of my job was having to work with little time, feeling that I was in rush with much to do but so little time to work with. My most enjoying part were the customers, for they would keep a smile on my face, and it was always nice to meet new people."
good,Target is a difficult place to work. It is better than most retail jobs out there but you must drink the Target kool aid in order to love it.
good,Very competitive environment and the organization allows you to own your business. You are your only obstacle to getting ahead and it is very tough in the retail industry to keep up with management demands and the guests all at once.
good,My time at Target was overall a really good one. I had a very good Team leaders when I first started but once the Logistics ETL quit it went downhill very fast. The team leader I reported to was leader of the flow team and while the good ETL was there he was allowed to run the flow team how he saw fit as long as he made goal times and kept the flow team in the green and didn't go over hours. Well he was able to do all those things. He made our store's flow team the most efficient team out of any of the teams in our district He even fixed the backroom team and Instocks team while that leader was on leave for having a baby. After the ETL quit however the new one was brought in and killed the efficiency of all 3 teams. It still is a pretty good place to work though because if you are a good worker you get crossed trained and are able to get alot more hours. Another bad thing about Target or at least the one I worked at said they promote from within but every time a team lead position was open the people in our store that were supposedly next in line were never hired as team leads except for one guy who worked there for a long time and was very good at customer service he was finally promoted to front of the store team lead. All in all my Experience at target was a good one because the people were very friendly and they acknowledged the people who worked hard most of the time. Also they could pay their harder workers a little bit more as an incentive for those people to stay. It's alot better place to work at that Walmart Though.
good,Target employees form a family that is willing to include new hires and temporary people. Its a very loving company.
good,"Its very enjoyable the customer was very nice people. I keep myself business always  trying to help someone"
good,Teach employees how to provide great customer service. Management is constantly checking on you. Very nice and friendly environment.
good,"Enjoyable place to work"
good,"A typical day is unloading boxes off a truck, cutting the boxes open with a box knife, releasing the merchandise from their plastic wrapping, and then sending them to their proper location in the store. Typically, this takes a full 8 hours of hard work."
good,"There really is no typical work day, every thing is usually different every day, the process, however, is usually the same though. In my time at Target, I have learned to be more open to people, which was quite difficult for me because I'm usually a shy person. The people I worked with were great and very friendly."
good,"I gained patience working, I loved the direct customer relations that centered my work. I can say that it contained ups and downs, but I inherited many skills and much insight in sales and customer service."
good,"If I were to work in retail again it would be at Target. The company is drastically changing, however. It is a Fast, Fun, & Friendly place to work. Each store is different since each store's management and the store culture will be very different. I was very disappointed in mine and it was not the experience I hoped for."
good,"While retail work is all basically the same, Target focuses so much on employee happiness and customer experience that I'd have to say it's not a bad place to work."
good,"You learn something new and interesting everyday as you have different tasks at hand every time you come in. "
good,"I like to be on time to work, get all paper ready for my team so when they clock in I have all the workload ready for them. The hardest part of my job is been a Supervisor but I have to keep working hard to get all the work done for the week."
good,"A basic day in Target was to come in and head to the Team Members area in the back of the store and clock in. If you came early you'd just wait in the break room to do that. After that you'd start your shift."
good,"A typical day consist of picking orders, or maybe helping in other department if necessary. All my warehouse experiance was gained here."
good,A day At work I would preform my regular task at assisting customers. I would help the other cashiers if they needed assistance. I would process returns and sort threw go backs and put them back on the floor.
good,"As a sales associate, I'd scour the aisles of the store to make sure all items on shelves were placed neatly and in the most marketable position possible. I spent a large majority of my day assisting customers locate merchandise in the store. I learned that retail has its rewards and challenges, and that one should never personalize customer issues. Irate customers have an issue with Target, Inc., not the sales people who don't make return/merchandising policy. Therefore, conduct yourself professionally and courteously; it is hard to argue with someone who is being exceedingly polite. Nothing was particularly hard about being a salesperson at Target. The most enjoyable part of the job was of course having an understanding and compassionate supervisor and manager. I felt like my best interest was at the very least a considered priority. They groomed their employees and actually gave them the ""blueprint"" to rise up the ranks in the corporation rather than just hire and fire ""bad"" people."
good,"I would come into work, clock in, find out if I worked the floor or the cash register and manage my job based off of that. I learned patience and reliability. My co-workers worked hard but often never got their jobs finished."
good,"A typical day at Target is going into the building and getting right to what you need to do. It could be doing back up cashiering or putting back returns."
good,Working in retail was a stepping stone for me.  I gained people skills by always talking to the guests while helping them find what they were looking for in a good shopping experience.  It is mostly about what you bring to this company and how.
good,A Day At Work Included Helping Customers Find Things As Well As Checking Them Out At The Front Lanes. Keeping The Lanes Organized.
good,friendly place to work at if you can deal with the rudeness and lack of respect given to you by higher ranking people.
good,"-Good pay for a non-career type job"
good,"Management goes on power streaks and talks down to team members. ( Go lift all these heavy boxes, I'll be chatting with all the other managers in the office and do nothing.)"
good,"Fast moving great crew, management was good. Hardest part probably had to stock the overstock in the freezer, very cold."
good,"The amount of responsibilities we have is so much, that we cannot accomplish everything that is asked of us. Yet, we feel pressured in completing all our tasks. I feel that I do not earn enough to deal with a high stress environment. Your job is highly dependent on your co-workers as well as guests in the store, both of which you have little control over. So if you fall behind in your work because of things you can't control, you get hassled about it anyway, and I see that as unfair. "
good,- My current position at Target includes partnership with many other HR teams at Target. It is an extremely fast paced environment to work at.
good,"Constant movement"
good,"Target is a typical retail job, it can be taxing and frustrating. I was so fortunate to work with an amazing group of people who were fun-loving and cared about me as a person. I can't say the same for all Target locations, but I can honestly say I miss my friends and coworkers and we still keep in touch."
good,I learned to stock and keep things Organized. How to well greet our guest.Great co-workers around.
good,"Had a long career at Target, ending with my assignment to Electronics (overnight crew). Enjoyed that most of my work was done independently of the rest of the team. I learned a lot about assets protection (product security)."
good,"Advancement to full-time only begins at the supervisor level, which can be difficult given the fact that many supervisor have been with the company for quite some time, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Health benefits are terrible.  Training is on the fly, need people who will sink or swim very quickly.  Supervisors work with their departments but for the most part higher management delegates all tasks.  Great inventory system."
good,HTE job was great up until the point where you tried to move up. The pressue was really high at this location.
good,Loved working with the Manager of the Pharmacy.  Loved our customers
good,Constantly interacting with guest. Stocking and zoning isle so they are presentable for guest. Co-workers are interactive when they want to be. Hardest part of job walking without comfortable shoes and most enjoyable part being able to put a smile on the guest face and helping.
good,"Stand at a door and greet guest, conduct inventory counts twice per day on high security item determined by store leadership and assist with theft and fraud apprehensions."
good,"was not with the company for too long because had to relocate but for the time that i was there i learned some cashiering skills, and how to work as a team member."
good,"The human resources department was a busy department to work in.  We worked in a diverse environment so everyday we learned something new whether it was about a team member or about how we worked together to reach our goals.  My store was a training store, so we worked with many different managers.  We learned a lot about working with different types of personalities.  There were many challenging days but there were always a manager or a peer that was willing to help work through an issue if I had any questions. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with all different employees, and I really enjoyed being the district team trainer for the human resources team members and team leaders."
good,"The raises and the job is mostly fair, there will be times you have to do extra work.  Most of the time the managers are professional and well trained, though there have been times they haven't been, great place to work, except on black friday."
good,A typical day at work was no great for the simple fact that target management doesn't communicate well with each other. One manager will tell you to do one task and two hours late another manger will tell you to do the same. An hour later another manager might tell you to do the same task that you did thee hours ago. I had no problems with my co-workers they were great people to be around. The hardest part of my job was to make sure i was on tract with all my duties and adjusting to how each manager wants things done. T he most enjoyable part of my job was being able to interact with co-workers and guests in the store.
good,"Enjoyed ability to move into various positions throughout career, deepening expertise in expanding roles"
good,"A typical day at work would be; to clock in, sign out a walkie-talkie , figure out my location for the day and work on re shop and organizing, folding, and putting clothes away. Also helping and greeting customers. At the end of each shift I write done a ""vibe card"" which is what I did to help customers. Then I sign out my walkie-talkie and get ready to leave. The management for my department are nice and helpful and very understanding. I absolutely love my co workers, they are all so nice. The hardest part of the job is certain areas on weekends because it gets busy and messy. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and finding what they need."
good,"Perfect work life balance, no pressure, good guidance and mentoring, friendly environment, flat pay and benefits"
good,"Customer Service or at Target better known as Guest Relations is very important to the experience at Target.  When one works at Target they will learn how to accommodate all guests to have great shopping experience.  We really go out of our way to ensure the guests vibe is uplifted once they enter our doors.  For this reason I really enjoy working for this company.  Since this is the way we desire all of our guests to feel then we have to maintain the same great vibe experience among ourselves in the work place.  The guests can feel what we feel and this is felt throughout the store as you enjoy your shift.  Our motto has been Fast Fun and Friendly and we really strive to have that experience with our co-workers and guests.  The management at Target leads by example in this aspect so we always know what is expected of us once we hit the sales floor.  And they do all they can to give positive feedback to ensure we are having a great job experience.  "
good,"Black horse finance was a very target driven company and following FSA guidelines were important as we could have easily breeched DPA. I learnt a lot whilst working for this company whilst also making a lot of new friends and meeting a lot of people who worked there way up within the company."
good,"work 9 hour days, alternate weekends, alternate shifts.  Team members are some of the best in the retail field."
good,"Far North Peoria:"
good,"Target provided a great structure to grow as a leader. I learned problem solving skills, leadership fundamentals, and several core values that will be an asset to any company."
good,At times is was very slow so we were given the opportunity to catch up and get ahead. Then times where it seemed liked everyone wanted to call/shop at one time.
good,"In the photo lab and guest services area of the store, I have a wide range of contact with all kinds of people with all kinds of needs. Both guests in the store and team members have many things that they require and I do my best to help them. Sometimes I can't do what these people need, which leaves me a bit disappointed that I couldn't help. Other times, I have a good laugh or pleasant experience with any of these people, including managers, who have their own set of goals to achieve, and I help them when I can. I've learned that listening is first and talking should be second when trying to solve someone's else problems, which can go from being the hardest part of the job to the most enjoyable in a matter of minutes."
good,I loved my job at Target unfortunately my schedule didn't fit their availabilty.
good,Target did well to find strong talented individuals and exploit them with promises of advancement. A lot of these people would be given more responsibility then they could ever handle. These people would confide in me about those issues and the overall flaw in the pay scale. Very often newer members would be making more money then others who had been there for years.
good,Weekends off. Work close as a team environment. The hardest part of the job is lifting for 10 hrs.
good,You feel that you are apart of a family that will do just what regular families will do.
good,"Target is well known for their focus on team spirit and focus on customer service. They definitely have awesome compensation and benefits and are very competitive with other retail jobs. Don't count on a much of a discount (only 5%), but they have great prices, so you don't really need it :)"
good,"Ok place to work, pay not so good. Management was great, co-workers were friendly."
good,Little room for advancement if the company does not feel is right about you. Very hard on driving the Vibe with Guest even as security guards.
good,"-Great culture and People :)"
good,"Target was a great place to work at when it came to co-workers, pay, benifits, 401K, and hours. The only thing that made target an unenjoyable place to work at was Managment. The managers did not approuch the workers with respect or care for the workers emotions. Managers continously talked down to the workers, like a drill instructor in the Army. There was lack of care when workers would adress HR or the manager of the building. There were many co-workers that would complain about mental stress because managers would constatly threatin the worker about being fired. Aside from management, the work was great, pay was great, and co-workers became good friends."
good,"There is no typical day. However the consistencies I have learned are how to communicate effectively with a diverse team member base to reach and exceed day to day business goals. I have had a lot conflict management and critical thinking challenges to overcome as I have worked in many markets (small volume, large volume, high risk, etc). My latest developments in my career are influencing my peers to have a larger scope of impact to my stores and district to benefit the company. Seeing my teams succeed and advance through my guidance and mentorship is by far the most enjoyable aspect of my day and tenure with Target."
good,"Running around like a headless chicken. It can be a lot of fun, but sometimes so much is expected of you that it can be a bit overwhelming."
good,A typical day was fun and it got me moving around. I enjoyed working with the employees as well as management. The job was time consuming but made the night go faster and in general was a good place to work
good,"Overall a good company to work for.  All stores are not created equal therefore depending on where you are placed, the experience can vary."
good,4am Start up. Unload Truck. Break by 6. Unpack boxes. Leave by 11am or 12pm. Management down your neck every 10 min to check progress when it takes about 30 - 1hr to complete task. A lot of walking and lifting. Most enjoyable part is interaction with co-workers.
good,"loading and unloading on the dock "
good,"The only part of this job I enjoyed was talking to the customers, all of which who were nice/"
good,"The logistics process of Target Inc., which is my area of work, is the most important and fast-paced process in the entire store. It includes receiving trucks, unloading freight, and stocking merchandise. It's a fast pace environment which involves a substantial amount of manual labor along with strong interpersonal skills. I'm a team trainer, which involves training new employees to ensure they're capable of working effectively and efficiently. "
good,"run a mobile kiosk, sell phones and customer service help other co workers "
good,"A typical day at work would consist of managing the entire sales floor, pull up any reports, manage team members, "
good,"Come in at 3:45 in the morning. People unload truck, place boxes onto pallets, bring pallets out onto sales floor, bowl out the boxes to appropriate section, then stock shelves. Too much pressure is put on by team leaders. Very hard, physical job. "
good,"The above employers were fun to work for.  A typical day was never the same.  We assisted customers with their purchases, helped them with product knowledge, processed their trasnactions, and whatever other special needs came up.  I learned a lot about handling grocery transactions (produce, hardware, etc).  My co-workers were friendly and helped me from becoming too serious about the things that I could not grasp initially.  The hardest part of the job was what seperated me from employ. (shif-work-disorder) I had trouble dealing with the changes in shift-hours.  Also the hardest part was being unemployed.  The most enjoyable part was the sense of a job well done."
good,Target is a very unorganized place to work for they lack leadership management tend to have no clue of what they doing ..
good,The job was very difficult and always enough work to keep you busy. I learned a lot about time management and communication skills. The management team was hit or miss becasue a lot of managers did not know what to do. The co-workers are the best part because everyone tries to keep a good attitude even if they have a bad day.
good,Don't get me wrong I loved working for target but only getting paid $7.50 an hour was not enought.
good,"Overall a great experience, you will learn a lot working here, the discount is good, the co-workers are amazing. besides annoying executives everything else is cool, but you won't get promoted unless you kiss up and become a ""yes man"" a lot of favoritism free food on some days. one thing about this job is once you get in, if you decide to learn all departments you can go to any other retail."
good,"The work is challenging but rewarding, and you get out of the company what you put in. Overall, a great place to start a career. Compensation could use a little improvement."
good,promotes team work as the highest value. a very fast pace enviorment.
good,they have some of the most best people to work with i was a cashier for 4 months
good,Working with the company Target is a fun experience.
good,"When you walk into the store, it is busy business before you even clock in. You see all that the shift has in store. You walk into the breakroom see team members & team leads and you are welcomed. Even though the store is messy & you have tons of reshop (go backs & returns) the vibe you recieve gives you the will to work hard."
good,This is an ok part time job. You couldn't live off of the salary they provide and they rarely hire people for full time so they do not have to pay benefits which I find appalling. Everyone was generally nice and friendly. The worst part was trying to get off a shift. If you couldnt find someone to work for you you got in trouble. You couldn't ask off otherwise.
good,"Advertising lead woodinville, wa."
good,It was a good experience. Everyone was really helpful in times that i needed assistance.
good,A typical day at work would be very slow at first but slowly pick up.I have learned that everyone deserves a chance.The management was very fun and friendly.The Co-Workers were very nice and kind. The hardest thing part of the job was learniing where everything the back stock were.The most enjoyable thinag about was interactin with people.
good,The management at Target at Concord is very efficient and very team oriented They care about the employees My co workers are a great team and we get along very well we help each other when we finish early The hardest part of the job is not enough time allowed to do a thorough job
good,"-A typical day for me would be either coming in mornings or closing which I would work any pulls (Products that need to be put up) then help any customers when needed for assistance. Then Zone (go through and straighten' up my area, go through my aisles and pull any out of area items)."
good,"A normal day at work, every one is nice. Meeting new people is okay. The work is kind of the same thing all the time. which is not a bad thing, but since i have worked at a compete store ""WALMART"". Management is very friendly and they do all take their jobs very seriously. With pay in the end comes a lot of hard work."
good,"OK job, it paid the bills, Good second job, good co-workers, Ok pay. Ok benefits."
good,fun place to work if you know what your doing. I learned alot about sales the best part of the job is selling cell phones to people in need the worst part is when no one buys phones. i love customer service
good,Target is a great learning environment for a growing leader. Excellent training is provided; leaders will be able to immediately apply what they learn.
good,"it was a good high school job, stocking shelves, cashiering, met a lot of friends there"
good,A great place to work if you like retail. This salary job isn't great for a work life balance.
good,OK place to work but management and labor did had way to many different ideas. NO NO advancement into management.
good,"Target has a solid benefits package and they work overtime to make sure the work/life balance is maintained. They don't make their workloads too heavy, which allows an employee to go home without taking their work with them."
good,We work as a team to get things done. We are trained in many areas so we can be valuable in a crunch.
good,I typical day at work would be seeing all the smile on every ones face. I learned how to improve my communication skills. Now i have have great customer service. My co- workers were like family to me. The hardest part of the job would ending the day. my most enjoyable park is working with my team
good,"Management worked with you and led by example. Management not only encouraged good work, but recognized it."
good,"Great place to work. Fast, fun, and friendly. The only downfall is the that the company does not promote from within."
good,"Daily work is interesting, learned new things fr ex:- inventory planning, forecasting etc"
good,"Understaffed, over-worked, underpaid. Management is terrible most of the time, the only thing that makes it worth it sometimes are the people you work with everyday. Everyone who works at this company takes themselves way too seriously."
good,"To make sure the customer had a fun fast and friendly checkout. Management was understanding and very helpful at any available time. I learned the you must on time in retail, due to the fact that there are lots of people depending on you, no matter what department your in."
good,Good Job. Just dont expect to have a life if you work overnight.
good,What you would expect out of a target. I did like the aspect of being cross trained in different areas of the company.
good,early morning
good,"a productive enviroment ,a great place to work,friendly people"
good,Target gave me great customer service skills. the customer is always right even when they're wrong. I learned to give customers options and to keep a smile on my face which will put a smile on theirs.
good,Meetings every night before a night shift starts to rile up the crew while handing out red bulls.
good,I don't recommend working at Target unless it's a part time job while going to school to get a better job.
good,Pleasant atmosphere. Comfortable working environment. effective management. coworkers easy to get along with and productive. hardest part of job were irate guests. most enl=joyable part of the job was working next to a starbucks.
good,"A typical day assisting guests with merchandise while working the sales floor or performing sales transactions as cashier. I learned fast customer service with accuracy and satisfaction. My co-workers were people of diverse cultures,students and seniors. There were no hard parts of this job, but the most enjoyable part was organizing and stocking new merchandise,and giving customer service and creating return customers."
good,"I only worked here for a month as a holiday seasonal worker. There wasn't anything remarkable about the experience. Due to the holiday season, I'd be there until past 1am cleaning up displays and restocking shelves. There was also a lot of time pressure from managerial staff, as they demanded certain tasks be done within a small window of time. That would have been okay, except they never enlisted enough employees to get it done on time. There were a lot of times when it felt really understaffed, especially as we got closer to December 25th."
good,I got to meet a lot of new people. I learned a lot about products out their.
good,"A typical day at work would include me and several others, completing the task of replenishment of bulk room and sales floor, utilizing the PDT, planning who would handle which tasks and when, and helping customers on the sales floor. I learned leadership qualities, how to use the PDT, and how to more effectively socialize with everyone. I also learned to operate some machinery while I was there. The hardest part of the job however, was getting the Bulk items, or heavy items, off the Bulk room shelves on to the sales floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with alongside the co-workers and customers."
good,I learned how to work at a fast pace. To make the right decisions without getting a manager involved. There was no hard part about my job.
good,"It was fun, encouraging, and I find that their ” Fun, Fast and friendly” system is effective but their Credit Card/ Debit Card sales goals are sometimes ridiculous. People do not want these cards most of the time. But yet the employees are told to drive those cards!"
good,Nice place to work people are friendly Clean safe work enviorment
good,"It is a great company when it comes to programs and benefits. It however requires long hours, and does not always allow for a work-life balance. This is dependent on which store you work in. I worked for 5 different stores, and depending on volume and management, was whether I truly enjoyed working for Target. Target is very fair, has good policies in place, and makes a good effort to motivate their employees. They do not however, actively manage performance of executive or store managers. They are afraid of getting sued and they would rather you quit than give unemployment. I ended up leaving after 6 years because I was working 14 hour days and commuting an hour each way. There is no work life balance in that. If you are fortunate to get a wonderful store manager and have a low volume store, then you are going to be happy working for this company."
good,A day at Target was always busy and full of energy. I learned how to lead a cashier team...interviewing skills..how to coach team members and how to work well with others...the management team was always willing to help each other. my co-workers went above and beyond to do their work. the hardest part of my job was to balance out all of my job duties..I enjoyed working with the public
good,"A typical day as a cashier at Target is simple. It's not really a challenge for a person like me. Greeting guests as they walk through the door if we are on that side of the front lanes. Stepping out of our box to help and lead guests to our lane to help them out as friendly and as fast as possible to give them the best shopping experience. It is a live and positive environment that I would recommend to anyone. The hardest part of the day is when someone comes in with a complaint, becuase you don't want to know that your store did something to upset someone, but it's an easy fix when you and the guest work together to come up with a solution. Talking and getting to know each guests as a regular and pointing them out of a crowd to say hello would probably be the most enjoyable part of the day. It's always nice to see a familiar face on a daily basis."
good,learning how to redo things you had done for over 3 yrs was a big turn around for us. but i loved working with the co-workers that i had a close relationship with on a daily basis. we never knew when we would be able to go home sometimes we would be there 12 to 16 hours a day 5 days a week sometimes 6 days...
good,"Target was overall a good place to work.I liked the job itself. The customers were really nice. My coworkers were nice overall. Target was also very strict about our breaks. We had to make sure we took 15 minutes breaks at certain times. If we missed a break, we got a warning. If it happened again after we were warned, we were fired. As cashiers, we also had to keep busy. This was fine when it was busy, but sometimes there's nothing. Sometimes I would have a contest with myself to see just how many times I could straighten the same shelf."
good,"Target was a good experience for me they could have done better with the managers. I loved dealing with the customers, co-workers were great we were really fast, fun and friendly."
good,Fun workplace but working every other weekend is not for me.
good,"In a hot trailer for 12 hours a night cubing out a trailer, which means stacking boxes from side wall to side wall, floor to roof. If there is an inch of space on top, you get chewed out."
good,target was my first job and i learned a lot from them. i became a manager after one year and they teach you a lot about how to work in retail. they offer good benefits and the culture of the store is always fast fun and friendly! this is a great company to start working for or stay for long term employement.
good,I didnt mind it to bad. The co-workers and management was very friendly. Although the job was a little boaring doing the same thing over and over.
good,"While it has benefits, this job is intended for someone in school or looking for better work."
good,"This job was very hectic at times. I helped a lot of customers, and did a lot of cleaning. It was a great starter job for me though. I got to see what the working world was all about."
good,I've worked at Target for approximately 4+ years. The company is forever advancing and balances service.
good,"Working at Target you must learn how to multitask, I say this because the company makes the schedules with a limited numbers of worker. I understand that their trying to preserve hours, but don't over work the employees to accomendate budgets cuts. Other than that this is a fun and friendly environment to be apart of!"
good,It was a fun experience working at Target. Made a lot of friends Team Lead and Supervisors were great. I would have liked for my hard work to be recognized more and also more promotions. Overall it was a good time working there a lot of great people.
good,they are always smiling and ready to greet guests. they are very helpful and they work great as a team..
good,Challenging and Exciting Environment. Chance to learn and advance technological and business knowledge.
good,"If your looking for a place to work that offers part-time work,Target's the place. If you love helping others,Target's the place. We at Target care very much about your visit and your needs. We will not hesitate to ask,""Can I Help You Find Something?"""
good,"Having worked for Target for 2.5 years, I've come to realize that so much of my satisfaction as a cashier comes from guest interaction—which is often unpredictable. The management at my store has been pretty consistent, and I look forward to seeing many of my coworkers. My store is larger/busier than most, so I found myself a bit overwhelmed when I first started, as I dealt with the learning curve while trying to satisfy so many guests every day. By now, though, I've come to enjoy the positive guest interactions as they come, and take the negative ones in stride."
good,I overall say Target was a really good job. Some things I feel they could work on is flexibility for athletes but otherwise it was really good. The diversity also made it a very good job.
good,"well, you.re able to get by . don't expect to be able to go to class and pay attention after getting off of work . the manegers don't care if you are tiered from working and over working yourself all night because of them telling you to go faster so u can work in another section ."
good,Target is a great company. A great place to work at but the team leaders there are horrible and rude. They can knock u off and make u feel bad. Too much drama and I mean the pay is great but the work and the drama needs a lot of fixing to do and the manager needs a lot of fixing to do.
good,Target is a decent company to work for. Pay is fine. My advice is to make sure you communicate with leaders according to your schedule. Management is decent.
good,"Target was my first retail experience, and it was just the start I needed. The hours were a bit much as a school student, however, the shifts were usually very enjoyable."
good,"Target was a pretty great place to have my first job. The environment was nice and welcoming, and the people I work with are very kind. The only thing I would say is that the dress code needs to be more enforced."
good,What I really like about working at target is all the different people I get to interact with. I have wonderful coworkers that really help me enjoy the job.
good,Target was a really fun place to work. Hands on training and friendly customers. But management could of been better with more communication. People should be held accountable for not doing their jod. Team leaders should led by example.
good,Target was the first place that hired me at 16. They were very accommodating while I was there. This year I only worked seasonal due to me working another job over the summer. It was overall a good experience.
good,"Employees get paid and rewarded nicely for the hard work done, but management could be improved to encourage employee happiness. Although sometimes chaotic due to the workload, it's a great and fair company to work for."
good,My experience working at target for 7 months was the worse ever. I had managers who would pick favorites and always have something to get after you about
good,At this job I worked in the backroom stocking product that comes in during the early morning hours along with replenishing the sales floor for the guests.
good,If you work at a Target with good team leaders then your experience will be very enjoyable. That being said I have worked at two Targets and have had only a handful of good team leaders.
good,The company is constantly changing and evolving for the better as far as company direction. It values community engagement. Target gives back to both through donations and volunteer work. The hardest part of working for Target is the lack of work-life balance. It's retail after all.
good,"To compete with amazon they have introduced a new modernization model which has changed how the company runs. Less payroll allocated, which means unrealistic expectations and pressure placed upon the employees attached with the stress of retail. Once the kinks have been worked out, this may be a great place to work. As of now, it's not worth it to work here if it means giving up a healthy state of mind and body."
good,"Of all the jobs I've ever had, this is probably the easiest, though it still remains frustrating as there always feels that there is more to be done than can be in the time allowed.  The people I work with are all generally good to be around and helpful when requested, and management is also good at answering calls for assistance.  However I've been here for over six years, and it feels that I will only ever be at the bottom, with little to no way to advance.  It is a good-paying job for what it is, but that is all."
good,"Sometimes people don't document their go-backs or pulling stock, and those tasks are made difficult to figure out what is completed or not. A typical day at work is, straightening out shoe boxes, grabbing shipment, putting out shoes, maintaining the shoe section."
good,I personally didn’t enjoy my position after a couple weeks. The job it self became very stale. I like to be at work with some type of motivation and push to want to get things done. It was like that the first couple weeks but after it got boring and repetitive. I didn’t enjoy work there anymore.
good,I really enjoyed working at target at the time but I really wanted to level up and get paid more which is the reason I had left. I enjoyed the fact that we worked as a team.
good,"Target wasn’t the best place I would say I worked. The hours are okay, but the way they pay you for the amount a work we did wasn’t fair at all. If your in school And want to work at the same time I recommend that you work part time at target."
good,"Target is a great place to work. Their environment is friendly, clean and positive. Being apart of Target was like being apart of a second family. Working for Target was more than just a job."
good,It was okay just be sure to have track of your coworkers names or you will get yelled at. They are very giving as well especially during the holiday they provide food and as well a bonus for holidays.
good,"I found the management to be very disconnected. Job training was at an Express Rate and could have been done better. They wanted me to know how to use their zebra device for Merchandising but they didn't even give me one for most of the express training!! Like I'm supposed to have a photographic memory of everything they said ?? They trained us how to use the zebra device and how to merchandise and work the stockroom simultaneously. I recommend they teach you how to use the zebra device first  then teach the other aspects of the job!"
good,i had to leave target because it was my second job i had a newborn baby and i could no longer work overnight i would love to work there again          hg
good,"I worked for Target for almost three years, and during my time there multiple management changes took place, including a new store manager.  So my store went through many changes during my time.  I got to see different management/leadership styles, some I liked and some I hated, but one thing remained constant, all my managers liked and respected me.  My managers let me work in all most all departments and let me show off my skills on a daily basis.  I say the management was average, however, in terms of the way things got done behind the scenes.  Overall, great place to work, they treat their employees really well, but behind the scenes decisions and the things guests do not see are where the problems with this job arise."
good,"Sometimes deadlines are stressful and the customers can be pretty rude, but it's chill.  I like the people in my department and that makes it more fun to work there."
good,Pay is great although you max out in three years. Not a job for you if you like to advance. Fast paced job. Job posting are not fulfilled by experience. They are done by who could possibly have a case against target or who knows who. Management goes either way depending where and when you work. Team member appreciation has really gone down over the past year.
good,Working there was fun and fast paced. It's good work and keeps you moving. It wasn't until I was hurt that I had a problem. I wanted to use my own healthcare instead of theirs. I found that my own healthcare had done more tests and found what was actually wrong with me after my incident where their health care seemed to be ignoring the amount of pain I was in. The injury turned to be much greater than what was saidOther than that I loved working for the company.
good,I believe every Target employee has a different experience which depends on your position there. I stocked shelves early morning which was fast paced and stressful but the pay is great and it is only getting higher.
good,The best part about working as a beauty consultant is that you get truck days and sampling’s on weekends where basically you sample products to guests and tell them why they should buy it and how to use and truck days you usually just restock inventory on shelves.
good,You will make friends at target that will make the job fun and good to work at. At the end of the day we're all serious workers and we get the stuff done.
good,Target is a great place to work if its your first job or if you're starting out in a higher position. Once you've worked at target for a long period you'll come to realize that they all know you're replaceable and don't offer good raises.
good,"As for retail, it's on the good side. Work isn't too difficult and for the most part it's totally reasonable. For non-management, hours are low, as it is almost always a strictly part-time job."
good,nice place to work for the most part. can be hard during the holidays. I have worked with some great people and met with some good connections for my future.
good,"i first worked at the Farmingdale target for 9 months,which i fell in love with, the people are amazing, management is amazing and my coworkers became lifelong friends and it was heartbreaking, but then i had to work at the Levittown target, closer to my new home, and while the job is satisfactory, the management is poorly structured, they expect way too much from the workers, and the employees do not work as a team, it’s basically every man for themselves, i have honestly only been staying until i find a better job"
good,The distribution center was great to work for in aspects that the benefits were good and the pay was there. The job was very physically demanding so much so that I had to quit and they wouldn't negotiate moving me departments.
good,Fun place to work easy money just not the right job if you have a family. If you want to ever see them kiss it goodbye during the holidays cause you’re just living to work at that point
good,Target is a big company that can get you into better position but the problem with mine was the people associated around the job. Overall I do believe the company is a great place to shop but working there is a bit different.
good,"As Target transitions its business style to keep up with the demands of online order fulfillment, the job became more and more physically demanding and warehouse-like than it had been in the past. The Guest Services position is no longer nearly as disabled-friendly as it used to be now with the rising demand of fulfilling online orders (with a two-minute timer, no less). Fulfilling online orders is not the difficult part of the job: it's the products within those orders that throw your back out literally (you try to get a mini-fridge out to someone's car in 120 seconds or less and see how well that turns out)."
good,target is a decent place to work my only complaint is the poor time management and higher ups when it comes to customer orders. the pay is good i wasnt there long enough to recieve benefits but i heard that those were also decent.
good,"Management is a hit are miss depending on what store toy are located I have seen alot of great workers leave cause managment sucks "
good,"Days are different, no two days are alike.  The culture is focused on the team, but is based on the leadership within each store.  The expectations are extremely high, but you definitely get rewarded for doing a great job."
good,"I absolutely love target, and the pay and hours were great for me. I just wish I would've taken a sales floor position because working in the backroom was nothing but a stressful experience for me. The team lead for my department was constantly treating employees like dirt, and made me feel like an idiot numerous times just because I simply asked a question about my job. Not a friendly person in the slightest and constantly belittled me not knowing about my mental disabilities. Had to leave because it became too stressful of an environment. Most of the management was friendly and it wasn't a horrible place to work, but I was constantly scheduled to work days I had marked as conflicts which was always a pain to get fixed."
good,It is not a bad place to work but managers expect you to build a rocket in a 6 1/2 hour shift and you might be the only one who works in that department and no one will cover your department in certain areas. Team Leads do little to help.
good,Great place to gain experience in interacting with customers as well as build interpersonal communication skills.  The work is challenging but rewarding.
good,"I would get to work at 7am usually work for a couple hours then take my break where I would get a snack use the restroom and then go back to work. Before the store opened I would make sure everything in my aisle is pushed towards the front, check dates on products and stock shelves with carts already in the aisle. Once the store opened I would work in the back-stock area until the carts back there were finished and then I would finish my shift helping customers in my section and stocking misplaced items. Lunches were 45 minutes unpaid, but there was food for purchase at a discount in the food court area."
good,"The big buys in suits sitting at comfy desks hundreds of miles away try to put in place weird changes but instead of stream lining the workplace it makes our job harder. They breathe down your neck about doing all you assigned work, however their is never enough people for the job and you have to constantly help other departments so you cant do your own work. The store managers were amazing, they all were very friendly to me and kind this is not directed toward them. I loved my fellow employees. Its the desk jokies that ruin this job."
good,This job  was a fun experience. My coworkers definitely helped me make the best of it although the managers at the time weren't the best but I'm not sure if they're still there.
good,The company is very structured and uses technology to make task easier and more accurate. Good benefits and employee moral booster such as parties and giveaways.
good,Target is a good place to work. Although most of the time it is short handed but we work as a team. Guest always comes first so we can make sure the guest was always taken care of.
good,You'll be working pretty quick and a lot but the environment Is actually better than most. Benefits seed to be pretty good including the employee discount which stacks with the target debit card.
good,"Target can be a great place to work but sometimes not. The company is converting to an inefficient working system that puts its service and efficiency par with Kmart. Executive management outside the store makes decisions based on what they want instead of focusing on guests, safety, team moral, and what will get the jobs done the most efficient."
good,"Slow paced during school hours, busy during holidays, great for part time and you don't want to be busy, retail, customer service, first grabs on new releases, great employee discounts."
good,Target is a fast paced working environment with good opportunities for many people- but you can't rely on your management for full help if you need it.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the relationships that you build with your team.  I continue to have a great relationship with my mentors and mentees that I established there.
good,"Target is great to shop at, who doesn't love Target? I think we all go for one thing and end up leaving with 10 things we don't need. It's also a fun place to work at, but management is poor and needs to figure things out for themselves. Half the time management isn't doing their job like they're supposed to, that place is like a roller coaster. Most enjoyable part is the co-workers, and extra hours during seasonal times."
good,I was a cashier and it was super boring for me I was working so fast on the line that time went by quick. I was so bored and ready to leave everyday. i
good,"My first few months of experience with target was the most fun. Getting to learn about my new position and the company in general after my very first job was very insightful. The mangers and staff are all extremely welcoming, and my trainer always provided me with the knowledge to complete just about any task to the best of my ability. It isn't the most difficult job, but the hardest part would definitely be completing tasks on weeks without many hours provided on my schedule. This in of itself already stunted my income a bit, as for the actual job, it definitely made it harder to meet goal times on various tasks. Especially on the truck push where we have to not only unload the boxes and shelve the items, but make sure our particular area is zoned, looks good and cater to our guests. The most enjoyable part for me is definitely interacting with team members and guests. I love helping guests, as a simple item search can turn into a fun chat, me helping with an item carryout and so on,"
good,"Great company with a great vision for the future. Just am ready to exit the retail environment in this facet. High expectations, never enough, tough to lead at the right level with workload as it is."
good,It’s been good and bad at times. Really depends on who’s in charge that day. It makes a huge difference in terms of work environment. The pay is good and hours are flexible
good,"Working at Target is a hard thing to describe. The discounts are nice, the staff members are friendly, and the guests that shop there are decent most of the time. However, there are days where the work load that comes in is overwhelming to a single person and they expect it to all be done with time to spare to clean up aisles. All of which is possible assuming that there few shoppers there with time consuming amount of questions."
good,"I think I just started at a bad time of the year or I work in a bad department. . In apparel, they’re always backed up, not enough hours or staff for the workload. There’s too many items being pushed onto the floors and the store is constantly a mess. The team leads don’t use their voice to tell their boss about the problems. Benefits aren’t offered until you either reached 1000 hours or worked a whole year. Other than those problems, everybody is pretty nice and the work itself is pretty good."
good,"I enjoyed my colleagues at Target. Management was flexible with me and accommodated my schedule perfectly. However, their turnover rate is relatively high for a big-box retailer. I did not feel appreciated for the work that I did as much as I wished I had."
good,the environment was very relaxed and low stress while still requiring a quick pace and skill to keep it up. only thing i disliked was the management always seemed to add unnecessary stress to those who were doing fine
good,working at target was very helpful even thou its a very busy and fast paced job there many areas in the store were you can learn and improve in different positions which are helpful when applying for future jobs. What I learned was to always work with a clear head and to always make sure to put the customers need above anything else. The store is managed pretty well for it being a big company teamwork is essential when having a job position in the company. What I enjoyed most was teamwork and how the managers were very helpful and always came fast to help and assist when ever an employee or costumer needed assistance.
good,"Do they pay well, yes but unless it's the holidays you will not see over 25 hours a week and when it is holidays you will be working 50. Managers are hit and miss and a lot of them have been there long enough they're just mean. You can't use your employee discount unless you use cash or a target red card."
good,"The place is good to work at the start, once you start working the management gives you impossible task to complete,then blames you for not finishing the task and you get in trouble. management blows at some places not all."
good,"temporary job that payed well, didn't get along with some of the coworkers but over al the people were generally nice, a lot of recovery work, very quick paced environment they expect you to work fast right away. Steep learning curve"
good,I worked fast paced to make sure the task for the night was finished before time to open up. They also work with u on your schedule . We just unload the trucks and restock shelves
good,Target has a relaxed atmosphere for guests and workers alike although it can sometime be daunting due to negligent supervisors especially if you are in the front end.
good,Recent changes to company outlook has shown less focus on community as we have seen in years past. Increased focus on internal information sharing along with restructuring for better alignment of partnerships have proven successful.
good,It is a fun entry level job. They’re good about working with your schedule if you give them 2 weeks notice. If you have good coworkers then it’s really enjoyable.
good,"Target is actually a great company to work with, on a long-term basis.  If you're looking to make a living, you'll have better luck if there is an open position for a TL position rather than being a TM. Reason being is that you're more guaranteed a FT position as a TL/ETL versus being a regular TM. Hours can be stagnant depending on how many hours your Store Team has available to offer throughout the entire team. If you're looking for a good starting job, Target is a good stepping stone to get your feet wet in the workforce."
good,"Target can be a great company to work for. The day-to-day duties of the job are easy enough and there is always something to do. But, the often conflicted message from the corporate level down to the store level can often leave a store scrambling to adapt. There is a lot of politics at the store, like any job, but with upper management specifically."
good,"A typical work day at Target for me is simply stocking shelves in the market area. It is a very relaxed environment, however in became difficult for me as I got sick. I learned to team work but also working independently. in my role it was more of an independent job, although when a team member needs help, or someone in another area needs backup, all of the staff works together. Management at Target was a bit confusing at times because you never really knew who the manager was for that day, so I always relied on my team leader. The hardest part of the job was communication at times, the most enjoyable part of the job was the relaxed environment."
good,The target I work in had a manager who would get mad if you didn't get a red card for the day. No matter how hard I tried to get people to apply for a red card they just didn't want to.
good,you cant just take your time;You have to keep a steady pace.thee fulfillment job is based off of how many orders you got together packed and shipped .
good,"The co workers there and job itself are good. However, the attitude and pretentious mood that most of the managers carry with them is awful. I left not because of the pay or because of the hours but because the manager I had at the time yelled at me in a public bathroom for throwing up in there instead of continuing to help on the register."
good,helping guest is fun and keeping a good zone is imperative...during the holidays can be hectic but it makes the day go by fast. Typical day at work consist of folding clothes constantly and re-shop. Back stocking and restocking.
good,"Didn't receive barely any hours for the time I worked here, but it was a very enjoyable work experience. Had some good experiences with the managers and co-workers."
good,"Being a cashier there is easy and simple to do, but It gets a little slow at times. Overall, other workers treat you very well and you never have to worry about your paycheck not being on time."
good,"Everyday was different. I loved the guests but overall I received less than 25 hours a week and I am a adult with a child. I learned Patience and to always smile. Nothing was ever too hard for me to achieve. The Most Enjoyable Part of my job was the guest, they always loved me and would tell my head manager how kind and nice I am."
good,Not a place i would stay at more than a few years because it just doesn't pay enough for what you are expected to do on a day to day basis. It also has some of the worst management you fine in the retail seen.
good,Working here was easy but the days got very repetitive very quickly. Management and co workers were very nice and accommodating. Given tools that made the job much easier.
good,I Like the friendly environment and the Co-workers I like the fact that it's always something different to work around Never a Dual Moment.  I'm a people person and like to work with the Public.
good,"Target DC felt like a great place to work, but the management was horrible. Our direct supervisors were great but anything above that was downright terrible. There was no communication coming down to anyone on the floor. Work flow was very bad. Some days you are literally standing around doing nothing until you are sent home early and some days there's so much work it cannot get done. Always feeling pressure of lay offs."
good,"This was my first ever job at 16. I was a cart attendant/cashier. A typical day at work would usually involve me coming in after school, I would go get carts from outside, and then go stock shelves or clean or make sure the store looked good. Sometimes I would cashier if backups were needed. Management was pretty good, but sometimes when I would voice my concerns or ask for help I would basically be told to just deal with it. One time, there were maybe 7-8 carts left at the beginning of my shift out of the hundred or so we have. I asked if anybody could help me so we could catch up quickly and efficiently, but nobody came. It took me over an hour to get all of the carts in by myself. However, I did enjoy most of the people I worked with and I got free drinks from Starbucks and the GSAs. Breaks were 15 minutes and you only got one if you worked 4 hours or more, and then you got a 30 minute lunch if you worked 6 or more. Shifts were easy to pick up and switch, but not easy to take off. I did not like the online system, as it usually crashed and didn't work on any computers at home. Overall, it's a good first job and will teach you about hard work."
good,"Working at Target was a good job for me. It helped strengthen my social and collaborative skills. Management was exceptional at the location I worked, and I enjoyed the company of all the employees there. The job, however, could be very stressful, as it is a service job."
good,to many changes with not enough forthought wanting to change this for the sake of changing them is sometimes necessary but you must first figure out the best way to make the changes at each store a long with all the training require for peoples new rolls before you make the changes
good,"This is fast paced.  Working in food service there are a lot of stricter rules then working out on the floor.  In food service you need to make sure you wear some sort of hair covering, no long nails, and no jewelry.  Many different customer personalities involved when working food service and at times this can be very trying."
good,"The hours are long and it seems like even though you only work three days those three days take up your entire week. The pay is good for the work you do, even if you're miserable the whole time."
good,"Target is a wonderful company and I loved working there until we got new management. I am a tech consultant and I love it. I help people with their electrical needs such as new consoles, help with their phones, laptops and other gadgets. A normal day as a tech consultant consists of putting away products, restocking the aisles, and helping guests with whatever they may need. It can be very stressful when it gets busy but overall once the whole team, including management, are on the same page it will run smoothly."
good,"I have learned a lot about responsibility, and working with higher ups. The managers work a lot with the teams, give us each our own tasks. By giving us different task, it really helps the employees gain knowledge of the company and each position in Target."
good,What can i say its target its alright . doesnt pay you good. people there are usually nice and friendly . long and boring days. sign up for something you know youll like
good,"Working at Target means forming bonds with your co-workers that will last. The environment is fast-paced, so you are never bored. Most of the time, the job is easy, fast, and busy. My only issue was my management team was poor. Conflicts of expectations, lack of communication, and lack of leadership skills led to me leaving because the stress they caused was not worth the pay."
good,A nice place to work if you can get on long term. Always busy. Not to stressful. A fast pace work environment. I liked my time there while I was there.
good,"target is a community full of friendly hard working team members. everyone always has each others back when working to get a job done. the hardest part of the job is making sure everything is left better than when you came, because there is always a lot to do with so little staff."
good,I enjoyed working at Target as my experience with my co-workers and management was collaborative and assisted willingly.  I would recommend working here for a starter job.
good,"A typical day in logistics starts with you cleaning the department you own, and then you replenish your department with backstocked freight. After an hour of that, you will take the unloaded box freight from the truck and stock your department with it. You will then backstock your excess freight to the backroom. If you finish your truck frieght, you will either handle price change, planograms, or do someone else's job because they are not there or they are incompetant. The people at the front lanes will get overwhelmed with customers and they will call you up to be a cashier, most of your coworkers will ignore the calls for back up and you will end up doing it."
good,"My title is Guest Service Ambassador (GSA), but I was basically all over the Front End department, in a managerial role. I loved the fact that I could practically go around the entire store and helping different guests in various departments to assist with their shopping needs and listen to them carefully."
good,"8 hour day, starting with stretching."
good,"This job helps you have a life outside of work and they are keenly aware of wage competitiveness, but the work is highly dependent upon trends and rumors in retail market strategy, sometimes at the expense of a cohesive work routine."
good,"Target is an ok place to work at, but don't expect to get any overtime or get a pat on the back for the work you've done. It's very hard to get a promotion, so don't expect to make a career working starting from the bottom. If you want to learn how retail works, Target is a great place to learn how it all goes and how much work it takes to run a store."
good,Respectful and consider the team as family. Target is sometime stressful job and operate by pression. In the end of year the compensation is low rate.
good,"Everyone was nice and the management always went out of the way when necessary. The only downfalls were the need to always help the cashiers kill the lines but at the same time supervisors would get mad if you weren't moving fast enough to finish personal assigned work, so that was fustrating."
good,"It works great as an extra job or for a student of either high school or collage. You often work in a good atmosphere with training, help, and capable management. Management is a mixed bag due to the large amount of managers and would differ depending on location however i felt confidence in management."
good,"Logistics-Flow is fast paced -- requires a lot of physical lifting, a lot of communication & teamwork helps .. so at the end of the day, you're beat .. sadly, it is generally seasonal (usually Oct - New yrs), the Mgt team are good ppl -- usually helpful,"
good,"My supervisor was a little hard but other then that it was pleasant and i liked my job but the work environment i didn't care to much about, The first day was tuff as there was a lot to take in and deal with"
good,I put in schedules and they wouldn’t look at them even after reminding them many times. They seemed like work was more important than my schooling. It was extremely stressful.
good,"Target was my first job. I would say it was an overall good experience. But, at the end of the day it's a job not a career. The management is all over the place so its very frustrating for the rest of the employees. If you need steady work, this is a great place. Room for growth if you take initiative."
good,"Lots of opportunist at work and move around the company, as well as learning new job skills. Was always able to make the hours i need and do the work i was give as well as helping the guest."
good,"Target has a fun exciting atmosphere, and has great management that helps push all the team members to succeed in the jobs they are tasked with doing."
good,"Target is a great place to work for permanent employees ONLY. If you get an opportunity to work here as a contractor, run-away without looking back. Great food and OK environment. But CEO lacks vision."
good,a typical day at target as backroom team member can be stressful and/or easy going some days. Learned to work with a team and how to be productive in span of few hours. Management was great.
good,Target is a stressful job that requires its Electronics workers to look over a huge section with little to no help. The location I worked at felt very understaffed. The management was nice but it was extremely difficult to get time off because sometimes they were hard to get a hold of or they forget you needed a day off.
good,I loved my guest and co-workers management sucked only gave raises to there friends and people they liked. They do promote within i have had several promotion over my 8 year career.
good,"Great Sales associate employees though there is a large disparity in work ethic/numbers when compared to other (higher) positions. Not very difficult tasks are given and if an individual tries their best, more than likely to succeed"
good,"Target was a great place to work, but managed to push out older employees. Great leadership was ruined with social media taking over it's common-sense. Long-term with Target only happens now, if you are a foreign born, young graduate."
good,Great place to start when out of high school. Pay was ok and the hours was plentiful. Good work in environment. Learning to do different positions within the store was helpful in my future career
good,"Your days will fly by! Multi-tasking is a must. Good pay with decent benefits, but they prefer to promote external hires or college interns than internal candidates. These interns usually have next to zero job experience and usually last no longer than six months. The lower team leaders do most of the work with the rotating upper management, however they are decently compensated for it. Hours are pretty common for retail; every other weekend off with one or two closing rotations."
good,"Target is becoming a while new store, with emphasis on helping guests and ensuring that their needs are meet are 10x better than 10 years ago. The employees are friendly and kind."
good,"Indeed has highlighted the wrong employer - I work for the Tech Mahindra Company Target, not the american chain of superstores."
good,Friendly work environment with great benefits and salary. Opportunities for advancement were offered. I would recommend this position to anyone who wants to work in retail.
good,"Overall working at target is ok.The main issue is with hours. They have lots of positive things about the work place, but somethings need to be fixed."
good,"I enjoy working at Target but for some reason I am not able to work in the desired department that I want when I know I am more appreciated and know that I am really good in. I am given no recognitions of any work that I do. So now I have the attitude of, I have hours, I am grateful for my hours in order to provide for my 3 kid with this low one income household. "
good,"I still like work at Target , friendly team member and great Team Leader. Hoever, since I relocated to WA  from AZ ,then little far distance from where I live. Also would like to challenge and learn more from different industries ."
good,"Management is very understanding and flexible.  Our store culture expects us to work quickly and efficiently but fairly.  The hardest part of my job is the work hours - 4AM to 12PM which isn't a typical work day.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the lack of micromanagement. I can go a whole day doing work only exchanging a few words with my managers and I prefer the self-sufficiency.  I learned how stockroom and inventory management works at big box stores, and how much work goes on behind the scenes keeping a retail store looking nice and organized for customers."
good,really good place to work as a teenager looking for extra money but unless you have worked there for a long time hours are pretty inconsistent during the busier periods
good,"Upper management needed work, understaffed, didn't seem to hire more people. other than that co workers were great, hours weren't bad but inconsistent at times"
good,"unload truck, separate by departments and make sure everyone and everything is in the right place, assigned ailes an departments execute task clean up"
good,"Target is raising the minimum wage often, it will be at $15 an hour by 2020.  But they do not offer full time employment.  They can only get you to 40 hrs a week during the holidays (4th qtr).  The rest of the year you will be lucky to get 25 hrs a week.  More often then not it's less than that.  This is a work schedule for teenagers, not adults with family's to take care of."
good,"I was there for a few short months. Working out of a farely busy target. It was simple work. Just selling cell phones and plans and helping out the target employees occasionally. there was a ton of compwtition betweent the stores wich made things fun and drove sales up. "
good,I'd come in and start unloading the truck. Once the truck(s) are  unloading we process the boxes accordingly. Then we begin our stocking train where everyone has a set job and area to complete until everything is stocked.
good,"I enjoyed working with target. I very much appreciated their flexibility. If I had the chance I'd work with them again. I enjoyed their hiring event , it was wonderful. I love shopping at target and everyone in my area appreciates their work and opportunities."
good,"Working at the Starbucks within Target, you earn 30 cents more per hour. Since they have upped their pay (at least where I am) Target Starbucks employees get a starting pay of 11.55, which is decent in my opinion. Raises are practically nothing, you get one annually. (My first raise was a whole nickel). Advancing up the chain is a very hard task. You basically need to know someone in HR and upper management to be promoted (then again, that may just be at my store)."
good,"Target is an amazing company to work for, but in times of stress, the leaders are not trained on how to stay calm. All and all, the company itself is a GREAT company to work for,"
good,"Typical day was restocking items on the sales floor, assisting with customers, restock the backroom, clean the backroom, and operate an PDA system for customer orders or to pull merchandise from the backroom to the showroom floor. Workplace culture was great, they let you be yourself."
good,Target was a good place to work. The hours kind of suck if you have a family.  The direction the company is going in is questionable. I feel like they are missing the basics.
good,"Target was an easy going jobthat allowed you to be able to work in many different areas such as on the floor, at a register, or even making food. This job is great for students, retired people, or even someone who just wants to make a couple of extra bucks to get by."
good,"Target follows state laws and Target best practices. They are consistent in posting work schedules and paychecks are always timely. There are many perks, such as target discount, % off sprint bill, weight watchers and dell products. They provide 4 hours a year for mental/physical health."
good,"Love my job, my hours and extra hours they offered. Not lately thou. The changes they are making moral is down people are quitting. Change is good as long as it makes sense. What they are doing is not good for anyone."
good,going to school for business and being on hand to actually manage business turned out to be two completely different things. All in all it was a rewarding experience.
good,"High turnover rate, management inconsistent, great pay that is only going up, great staff/ coworkers you enjoy seeing every day, understaffed/ always cutting hours"
good,"relaxed and busy"
good,"At the target that I worked at, the management was very professional and always on their employees. Work got completed here. The store was constantly busy and the gobacks were always fll to the top. Lots of traffic in and out of the store. Great job security, if you like the life of retail!"
good,"Target was very organized and all about business very tight and oiled machine. Very collaborative effort of the logistics department."
good,"Target was actually fun, I consider it very useful when I moved into my first apartment. I could've worked there for as long as they'd have me had I not moved."
good,"great pay and benefits, the best thing about the job are the people  you work with. Advancement opportunities are non existent, company rather pay some kid straight out of college and have you train them than promote from within. Even if you do have a college degree (like me) the conflict of interest is too great a risk for them to take. Great  JOB not a CAREER."
good,"This is one of the chillest places to work at. As long as you ask questions and do your job at a steady pace, it is all good. The managers are very understanding as long as you can explain how you invested your time on a particular day. You approach the ""learning threshold"" within a week or so, meaning you've learned what you've learned by that time. The downside is that no one is ever allowed to hit overtime and raises are rare, and when you do get one, it's not a lot."
good,I loved working at target. Management would always change like every other month but all in all i learned a lot from there. Nice place to work for a first job.
good,Awesome job. I loved being around different people and also the customers were really nice. The management is very poor. They treat the employees like poo poo.
good,"This is maninly a job for kids getting out of H.S. or men and women looking for a job on the side or party time unless you are management, logistics, etc."
good,Target was the same thing everyday unload the truck and stock the shelves afterwards. If the floor couldn't get done before we opened the store we would have to move things to the back and work out the stock room.
good,the other employees working at Target made it such a fun team atmosphere to work in. Working in a fast pace environment with the people you liked made the day go by fast
good,I you are looking for experience this is a great job but if you are looking to climb the ranks i would not recommend  it. management is always a new outside hire usually someone with no experience which left a bad taste in my mouth.
good,"A job at Target is about as much as you would expect a generic retail job to be. Stock shelves, help customers(called guests at Target), work on occasional projects given to you by your superior, etc. There are some great customers, and some problem ones, and the same goes for your coworkers and management. I've made some of my greatest friends working at Target; I've worked with some people I would very much like to never see again. "
good,I was a seasonal employee in hopes I would get hired on full-time.I even made top sales two weeks in a row in RedCard sales and still didn't get a full time position.
good,"Target was a fun place to work, but moving up seemed nearly impossible to do, although that could have just been the position I was in. The people were pleasant, the workload wasn't that big, but the equipment was very hard to come by."
good,Great place to work. It shaped my peoples skill and made me build my customer services and taught me to use a register and had a great set of employees.
good,You like some managers and don't like others. Normal workplace. They have dedicated breaks and room for advancement. I made manager in under 2 years. Better than most places.
good,"Worked there as a seasonal position. Saw many on the regular team stay and move up with promotions etc. The pay at first isn't so great, but the discounts are nice. Management is usually good."
good,"always pay on time, keep checking on you if you're doing your job and help you with everything you need.always try to keep there store very neat and nice for the people shopping."
good,"On my first day of training I was placed with a female and male."
good,"It's just come to work, do my tasks, go home; no real socializing, no music or real atmosphere while shopping in the store; it feels dry. Managers or leaders on duty could do a better job of having new employees more active within the entire store team and getting to know everyone better."
good,Working at target was cool comfortable and opportunity for advancement is there if wanted just work hard and be positive with every one doing there job the days run smooth.
good,"I worked a couple different departments, and I was able to learn a lot through doing so. The management staff was not good and I learned more through my co workers and department supervisors then I did management staff!"
good,"Day to day operations, what to expect:"
good,"Target is a great company; however, its an extremely large company and the day-in, day-out tasks were extremely monotonous and rote. "
good,Target overall is okay and I don’t mind it. I would say if you needed a job definitely apply here. It’s very flexible and understanding. I just want to see what else is out there.
good,A typical day at Target as a cashier was easy going and beneficial as a learning experience. Provided me with more customer service and was helpful in that aspect.
good,"A typical work day at Target wasn't always the same, every day was different and different people that I was working with. Which wasn't  always easy but it taught me how to work better with others, sort of pushing me out of my comfort zone. Management was a little confusing just because I had so many different people telling me different things, it definitely got confusing at times and I would say that was the hardest part of the job. Despite any hardships, I always made the best of every day and meeting new people, getting to learn all that I did, I'd say that was the most enjoyable part of it all."
good,"I worked there while I was trying to go to college. I was just stocking shelves and it wasn't too bad, it built organization further into my life. The people there were very nice and helpful."
good,"You are never guaranteed hours.  They rarely hire full-time employees and I was usually looking for more hours all the time.  Some of the work was extremely physical and the freezer was unbearable to work in.  I loved unload and staying busy, but I did not see a place for advancement without a college degree.  I needed to work 40 hours per week."
good,unload trucks pull product to the area on the floor you maybe working.  first in first out. rotate products daily and check dates on all food etc products for out of date food. very friendly work place.  helping quest find stuff they need or want.
good,I am proud to work for Target and value their goal to exceed sales forecasts as well as respect their motivation to compete in this modern age of online sales.
good,"My team was great. However, I left mainly to focus on school.  Hours were flexible and the manager was great. She was easy to talk to and friendly. She didn't lack on the job."
good,Just a good basic job.  Helps learn basic skills for retail/grocery type jobs.  Friendly employees and opportunities for volunteer work.  Just wasn't fast advancement.
good,"They allowed us to be free, make our own decisions as far as what was next. Just had to make sure all was done on time. They unfortunately did not pay well enough to make us do anything."
good,it was a great experience and was able to expand my knowledge of knowing materials. It was sad to see team leds and LODs choose their favorites but over all loved the team i had to work with
good,"All around enjoyable work place"
good,Work wasn't bad at target. It was fast paced and went by quick. Management was OK at target. I enjoyed the people i worked with there. i would recommend working there
good,"As an unloader, this job will drain you physically for some time that you might not want to work much longer after finishing. It's just you and around 2-3 others helping sort the merchandise while one person is stuck taking down all the boxes and the other sorts repacks. Unless you get a designated area in the store, this job is nonstop physical for at least 4 hours. "
good,Good job to have opportunity and move to different departments. A good sense of team and helping out on another. Mostly a positive atmosphere with good leaders.
good,It was a great place to work just not enough hours for my lifestyle. Eventhough I was a temp associate they planned for me to become apart of the team. Unfortunately I had to relocate.
good,"I would clock-in and start in my main primarily area which is the department of electronics/toys. I learned how to handle customer's needs and question. I would organize the toy aisles and explain to customers on the specs of electronic devices to help them make a clear decision. I used a handheld scanner to help customers find inventory. The environment of the company was friendly and laid back. The managers were professional and always had great communication with us through walkie-talkies. Their was really nothing hard about working for Target, just to make sure we had the aisles cleaned and organized. The best part of the job was to exceed customer satisfaction and when I put a big grin on there face, that would make me feel great inside!"
good,I was young and didnt have much experience or expectations.it served its purpose for the time being but i prefer more responsibilities and a bigger salary
good,a typical day at work is to help the guests and make sure you get at least on redbird for the day. i learned how to handle myself during difficult situations. the hardest part of the job was the red cards.
good,"Working at target can be fun but lots of work. "
good,"It's corporate in every sense. There isn't much room to advance. Employees are treated like sheep. The pay was pretty good, especially for a kid in college."
good,"I had this job while I was in high school. They worked fairly decently with my busy schedule and the pay was perfect for me (I hear the starting rate is even higher now). They're very pushy with meeting a quota with redcards which is probably the main reason I left. Other than that, it was pretty alright."
good,"Very Productive work environment, Extremely fast paced,great employee interactions, Productive peaceful work environment.Well Trained employes, Great Learning Experience"
good,"Target is alright could pay a little more but not bad pay either , managers over all are kind caring and compassionate, days can be stressful but always have fun at work on the job and always looking forward to coming back in the next day to work another day yet again"
good,A great place to work.  You have to be able to strategically plan in order to get ahead to keep up wth expectations and workload.  A great place for development but it may take a while to get the position you want.
good,"Target was a fun place to work. It isn't anything glamorous, but they paid competitively and made sure to take care of their team members. TV's and Wii's in the break room, food often brought in for holidays and parties, and it was easy to move around the store if you wanted to learn something new."
good,"I loved working with my outgoing employees. I've built strong relationships with a handful of them working at target! One thing I liked about target was the employee teamwork. However working for target was extremely stressful when your managers put you down for not ""trying hard enough"", even though most of us worked very hard to complete our assignments. I remembered getting yelled at by the HR for not completing my Zone in softlines 100% during the month of Christmas, the most busiest time of the year. Management took their frustration, anger, and negative emotions out on a majority of the employees. Some of my fellow employees developed extreme anxiety and stress problems because of the unhealthy work environment and ended up leaving target. There were nights when a majority of the department called out sick on a busy Saturday night, and only 2 employees took on a job that would need 4-5 more helping hands. At the end of those crazy busy nights, we would get lectured and yelled at for not completing all tasks. They were never understanding about our inconveniences of being short staffed on the busiest of days."
good,"Many hours and many vacation days. Plenty of opportunities to advance in different departments, and gain retail knowledge. Accommodation to your life/school needs."
good,Target is a fun place to work . The backro team was amazing . It's just the hours that we're giving out wasn't enough. But the staff were short staffed
good,"I would not work here again unless I really had to."
good,"i normally work on the truck,fix the displays,train new employees, order products, i basically to what an assistant manager would do. i also work as target I've been on the sales floor, doing in-caps,folding clothes,flexing,zoning etc. the management there is really bad they have favoritism and the managers aren't willing to give hours to those who are willing to get them and work hard, instead they rather just close the place down thats the only thing i hate about my job, my coworkers are so helpful with everything they always try their best to make everything look clean. target does this volunteer events every now and then, its pretty fun, i like that,other than that the store its self needs improvement but with those kind of managers i doubt ill change."
good,"This was my first job and I learned a lot, but honestly I was a little disappointed. I love the store and at this time I was on summer break. I wanted to work as a cashier, but they put me as fitting room operator, which was fine with me at that time. But what is more, I wanted to work part time. Well most of the time I was working like 38 hours a week, which is only 2 hours away from full time. When I started school, I had to quit because they didn't want to put me as cashier and I had to work Saturday and Sunday like 8 hours, which didn't really appealed to me."
good,"Target was a big space, i had to get used to everything, although i had a lot of support, it as a  lot of time spent there during my employment there."
good,Overall target is a good place to work at is fast but slow paste all the same time. The staff is great there always happy and smiling. Sometimes there even flexible with what hour you can and can't work
good,"Working for the Target Distribution Center was just like any other factory or warehouse work but with a higher level of entry pay. The management and employees seem to never see eye to eye and the stock distribution interface is complex and hard to learn. IF hired in though the hours are very manageable, benefits are great, and its a great way to stay in shape."
good,"I found expectations too unrealistic, while pushing team members as hard as possible. I found myself dragging myself to work feeling like I was entering a losing battle every day. The people that work there are really good-hearted though, as far as the team members."
good,"Fun and interesting place to work but not if you are looking for a career. Great if you need a extra job or maybe a part time job while in school , unless your options include being a manger of some sort"
good,"In hindsight I learned so much from working here. It's a great first job. Like any job there's some things that weren't too great about it and some unpleasant co-workers, but there were job growth opportunities for hard workers who wanted them. This was my first job. I was young and dumb and didn't take some of the opportunities that presented themselves. Target is great about benefits and pay increases. Also diversity; you can have tattoos and purple hair."
good,I started as cart attendant but then was easily moved to the electronics department where I knew i was best at. The best thing about the job was the management and the worst was having to deal with Black Friday.
good,"Like any retail store. Lots of ""team spirit"". Customer service. Sometimes unrealistic expectations from management. This is a high school/college job. A great job to get you through college. They do offer benefits and a flexible schedule."
good,"Each day is easily and clearly worked out and scheduled, with clear directions for each team member. Jobs are detailed and easily laid out, and management is very willing work and cooperate with employees."
good,"Having worked at Target for more than two years, I have learned a lot, more so about myself and my ability to complete tasks, autonomously, with little or no assistance from management, as well as increasing the efficiency of the work completed."
good,"If you're their favorite you will be praised working at this particular Target. What I mean by that is, If you do everything exactly how they want you to do it and not get any complaints or really messing up then you're gonna be one of their favorite employees."
good,During my day I would set up a line and unload many trucks with a team of people.  We would categorize to products into sections of the door and then those skids would be picked up on pallet jacks and taken to the isle.  Then unload onto the shelves.  Any over stock would be moved by pallet jack towards the warehouse and stock as backstock.  I did all of these duties and rotate daily.  Then I would scan the product into the system.  I would greet guest and assist them when needed.  Target was great a giving their employees snacks and lunches.
good,"Great place to work if you are a student or need a part time job, difficult to work full time since hours are never guaranteed. Management could be better, but work environment is good.  Employee appreciation is guaranteed."
good,"difficult position, great company for advancement opportunities. my direct manager was horrible though. My position was expected to do a ton of things but never given support from leadership or any other team members. not enough hours and staff."
good,good people to work for and friendly. good work environment. kind of a high turnover rate. management is fair and understanding. hours can be slim....
good,Me trouxe bastante experiêncial profissional e pessoal.
good,"Working here was fun but there was no room for growth. "
good,"The only best thing about Target is the team spirits. Without your coworkers, Target can be very draining in terms of what position you are in. They have high expectation but give slim rewards for achieving it. There is monthly goals just to maintain your jobs."
good,"Target is a fun place to work with a good work life balance.. People enjoy what they do.. Managment does focus on building People.. But not always.. there are more people to do the same work.. this helps in building.. Capacity at work place.."
good,"I Like Fast Past On Going Jobs, I Like To Constantly Be Busy. And Target Only Got Busy On The Weekends. But My coworkers were Cool And The Job was Easy !"
good,"When i worked at target my co-workers and bosses were very helpful in getting me used to working in the backroom and working on the store floor, they made sure i was willing to do everything i needed to do within the first week. I was tasked with pulling items of the shelves of the backroom that need to go to the store floor, this was all done it batches that had to be done within one hour so efficiency was always key in getting my work done. Besides pulling i was also tasked with managing inventory and making the quantity of items in the backroom was the same as the computers information, this meant knowing where everything in the backroom was and how to read shipping labels to know exactly how much product we had. The hardest part of my job was keeping up with not only the batches that needed to be done but also helping guests when something needed to be pulled for a guest, juggling all these things and stilling getting done on time was important and was not always feasible. The thing that i least enjoyed about the job was how no matter how efficient we were there were always factors that lead to us not being able to complete our work on time (ex. Understaffed, too many guest pulls, unforeseen shortages, computer would ask for things that didn't need to be pulled.), but despite that we were always punished for factors that were outside of our control and upper-management treated us as if we failed to pull on purpose or because of our lack of efficiency."
good,"team work is there but not aways, the have great workers ready to put in their best but at times the company neglect their needs. work place is organise, routine followed and job description. at the start of the day team members come together and know exactly who will be working where, that is division of labour is the key in this company, that is why i love working there."
good,great for college students but good older people looking for a second job. I'm looking for an new job to help my income at this point and make target my second job
good,"I worked there for four years and felt extremely comfortable, the co-workers are great to work with and management is easy to get along with. There is not a lot of stress except during the holidays and back to school."
good,Target is a good place to work some faults in management but other then that it's a pretty easy and good job to have! They work really well with your availability!
good,Target gives opportunities to everyone who wants to grow. There are many different varieties products to decide from when shopping with target. Excellent customer service satisfaction and great prices.
good,"Target can be a fun place to work because you learn a lot about management, are tested daily, and work in a fast paced environment. The schedule can be grueling at times (nights, every other weekend) and work/life balance is hard to come by. Regular hours during the week are 7-5, with a 50 hour work week being the minimum expectation. Salary is good, especially out of college, but could be better given the schedule and demands on the job. If you succeed and have a boss who will support you, you can advance rather quickly, but there is a lot of politics, as with any company. If you don't plan to stay in retail, I would try to get into HR - gives you great tangible skills when you move on. Other work centers can lack transferrable skills to other work at a certain point."
good,"I love working in Hardlines for Target, but I maybe get ten hours a week at most which can just barely cover the bills I have. You can try and sign up for more hours but most of the time their is none to sign up for because their all taken really fast., and with me being in college they are not very flexible with hours. The way the schedule people is very uneven. One thing I can not understand and do not like is the fact the LOD or higher up managers can open your personal lockers with your stuff in it, look around in it and then can leave the lockers open every day when they do their ""walk"" around the store as a safety precaution. Its a big invasion of privacy, and it opens the chances of your stuff getting stolen or tampered with. I have had several co-workers leave because of the lockers or with the way some of the management treats them and the rest of us, but if you like fast paced work, and good pay, hardlines at target is not a bad place to be employed at as long as you have open availability, and can keep your valuables in your car or another safe place."
good,"Sevice customers at the checkstand. Work at the fast food section. Return things for customers. Help people find items they need, and check prices for people."
good,A typical day at work would be fast pace action all day long. I have learned to move at a fast pace and staying on my feet for a long period of time. I have also learned how to commutate with costumers one on one and learned how to did cash exchange and stocking items on the store shelves.
good,"Good place to work with good benefits, young people and decent culture that values diversity. Advancement is still being defined under the new direction."
good,"Clock in and pick up reshop and head back to the operator both"
good,Good place to work if we are open to learn new technologies. Now a days as a part of cost saving company mostly relaying on open source and in house development tools.
good,"Work life balance is awesome!  Ability to work from home when needed, however, if you don't have a supportive leader you can wind up hitting a wall in your career."
good,This was an awesome company they were just not very open to giving the younger workers 40 hrs a week. I was a full time worker with 10 hrs a week.
good,"Target was the first retail store I experienced working there I was taught a lot by working with others the team members and staff are really good people I worked in hardline,softlines,price change I developed skills that I thought I wouldn't have target showed me a lot"
good,okay stand all day at the register all day it was long and boring but it was a job stopped working a target for another job. workers were cool managers were okay
good,Target gave great pay and benefits.  The management team though could use an upgrade.  They were great slave drivers to get the proper numbers needed to keep the head executives happy.  They would were their crews out to the point of injuries and once the crew member was injured they were released from the job completely.
good,"Made sales, interacted with customers, stocked shelves Sometimes cleaned aisles when we slowed down. Enjoyable place to work at"
good,The job was good I love it the fact that my hours change and is not enough to support my living. The staff was funny and always tried to have fun and brighten the work day.
good,"My job at target was very productive, there was always something to do.The people I worked with were very kind and taught me a lot about the workplace."
good,My average day at work consists keeping the store looking good while also doing whatever my managers deem important to do. I learned a lot of people skills. I get along with management well. Most of my co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with. Nothing about the job is really hard.The most enjoyable part is that I can usually get along and have fun even while working with anyone in the work place.
good,"Target has been the best place of employment I have ever experienced. Management is wonderful. They almost always want to work with you and understand situations. My only problem is the people who come in to shop there. Most people are nice but the ones who dump there stuff every where around the store make a great job terrible. Target has high standards for how the floor should look so trying to achieve that while guests are continuing to leave things about is difficult. This job has really taught me patience. I love all of my co-workers, it makes the job just that much more enjoyable."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy and fast paced."
good,"I got a few individuals who didn't understand the rules, but I took care of it comely and politely. I also asked the managers for help and talked to many customers to make sure they were doing ok and finding everything they needed."
good,"Most days are very hectic and also fast paced, involves me doing a lot of back and forward but it does keep the day moving fast."
good,"If all you care about is money this job is great, good money and tons of opportunity for overtime.  However you are stuck, there is next to no opportunity for job advancement and you cap out in pay after about 3 year meaning you are going nowhere. The job is very physical but that kept me in the best shape of my life so that was nice."
good,"Typical days had high points and low points. You were alone most of the time and its always busy.  but sometimes customers would  make your day.Only the rudest mangers, co-workers and overall job was pretty good. Hardest part about the job was having to learn so much before you are thrown to the wolves. Best thing I learned was how to adjust quickly."
good,"Working grave yards on weekends was fun! Started the shift's with a stretch and warm up prep talk. Each employees knew exactly what they were doing by the end of warm ups. I learned to be a good leader to others. The ability to learn from others, no matter how many year's or week's they have been there. Co-workers were friendly and easy to get along. The hardest part of the job was to take on challenges from a GL to complete impossible task at a certain time."
good,I enjoy working for Target mainly because I enjoy working with the other members of my team as well as our leaders. The average work hours are also beneficial as I am off early afternoon and am able to transport my kids to and from extracurricular sports activities on a daily basis. This is a good store to work at because I feel there is a genuine care for the well being of the team members by the management staff.
good,Target is a great company to work for. Just relocating because of family issues. and the just isn't understanding enough.
good,we are not llowed to call them customers they are guest in our home as they would say.If you see a guest yu say can i help you find something? other then that you unload the truck stock the selves and go home that is a typical day at tagret
good,Target is an awesome place to work if you just need a side job. I just wish the hours of work were better.The discounts are fair. I like the people I work with they are very friendly.
good,The overall job was good. The management department need a little more improvement. The some of the guest were very friendly like family. I learned that some jobs aren't meant for some people. Coworkers are okay. some are lazy and some can lift your spirit. The hardest part is the managers thinking they can treat and talk to you any kind of way. The most enjoyable part is working.
good,"Super flexible with schedules. Managers tend to be comprehensive and understandable. You have to work every holiday. It is a fun place to work, especially if it is your first job."
good,Great introductory management role that allows you to develop applicable experience that can be used in many industries. You will be challenged and really develop your ability to lead a group effectively.
good,"Honest work, though lacking in the coworker togetherness experienced at other jobs. Not as personable, though it was easy to keep busy the entire shift."
good,"Plenty of room for advancement. Very physical/hands on work. No work life balance. Work typically 60+ hours per week. Additionally, need to work multiple nights and weekends. Definitely not a family friendly position."
good,"Co-workers are the best,i learned how to manage security cameras system,Hardest part of the job is apprehension's,enjoyable part is after the apprehension's."
good,"A very friendly environment to work in! There is a large focus on guest service rather than metrics in the pharmacy, which is different that other retail companies. Each day was new and different and you get to work with a variety of people. "
good,"I always saw myself working at Target, everything I own from clothes to home décor has always come from Target. When I was offered a job with the company i was more than ecstatic."
good,"Over-all, I have enjoyed working at Target Mobile. I have learned a lot about patience, and consistency. Though, my manager was not exactly a role model, he was part of the reason I wanted to quit. Like I previously mentioned, I've learned a lot. Guests would come in and ask about phones everyday, and that opened the door for a sale. What I learned was that every person who came to look at a phone was a potential customer. My co-workers were very helpful when I had first started and helped me to be a better sales woman. The hardest part of the job for me would be dealing with my manager because sometime's he would be wrong and I would lose sales because of it, but we had learned to work as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was making a sale. Making a sale meant success for me, and if I didn't make a sale the whole day, it would've been a terrible day."
good,"Co-workers and managers are nice. It's not a difficult job, but they don't have payrolls to schedule more people on the floor. RedCard pressure is crazy. Work/life balance is bad as you are expected to work on the weekends."
good,I worked overnight as stock person then promoted to backroom team leader. The reason for leaving was cause was having health issues do to the overnight work life. I loved the work.
good,"Daily Manager on duty routines, allowing you to learn more about the business and Target's Guest Loyalty. Fun Loving co-workers.  Stressful environment at times, just because it so busy, but the team you work with on a day to day basis makes it worth wile."
good,"I enjoyed working there and learning, co-workers were great and the hardest part was working every weekend, most enjoyable catching the bad guy"
good,"Working with a big and successful corporation.  Had been very flexible with my schedule when finishing up my last year of college.  Taught me a lot about customer service and how to work with different people.  It helped put me through school.  Have worked more with managers.  Co-workers for most part have been good to work with.  Generally, setting up the sales floor in the PFresh department and making sure the floor looks brand, clean, and fresh.  I would also attend the needs of the guest.  I have kept up with making the weekly orders for the produce and meat department to ensure fullness throughout the week.  For 6 weeks, I filled in for a team leader in the market department and setting up the sales planners and keeping market looking brand and bold.  Hardest part I have found of the job is how to keep the sales floor when not having the available product."
good,"I, within the last couple months of me working there, was the peat fresh opener.  This consisted of me opening the market department and checking all food for any inconsistency, pushing fresh food out to the floor, and cleaning my section of the store in the morning.  I learned how to be quick under a specific time frame and accomplish tasks effectively and quickly.  "
good,It was a good first job but some of the managers were very rude and disrespectful. Glad they got new managers now though and have made a change for the better.
good,"My typical day at Target includes ringing up guests, engaging in friendly conversation with them, providing good service and educating them on REDcard benefits. Most of the guest were regulars and already had a REDcard or hating hearing the speech about it."
good,"A typical day at Target includes ringing up guests items, engaging in friendly conversation with them, providing good service and educating them on REDcard benefits. Management is great. My co workers are positive, and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job is when there is a rush of guests coming to the lanes, and we don't have enough cashiers to ring them up, and when we have technical difficulties. This often results in the guests being impatient and frustrated. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to learn new things everyday, and being part of the team."
good,"easy work culture with good pay, but the job security is not good,  and do not get the challenging role in the coimnpany, the work timing is good and flexible"
good,"Decent retail job, that is great for part-time & full time opportunities. Management is decent and the co-workers are very helpful with decent pay."
good,"Target is good place to learn new tools, technologies. "
good,"Target is great place to work if you are getting started with work. the starting age is 16 years old so you can start their very young. it will teach you to be responsible for the mixed scheduled time and attendance. it has flexible hours, so its good if you are a student. you are dealing with a lot of people so it will improve your people skills.they are very strict when it comes to attendance. so don't be late. raise in pay isn't that good too."
good,"shipping/receiving"
good,"Great place to work, but corporate layoffs loom over your head. Great people, great benefits. I really loved my job with Target."
good,"I started with Target In winter of 2012 as an Executive Team Leader, It was great place to work I must admit, it had its challenges but that is given in retail, nothing I couldn't over come by being resilient and adaptable. The team culture we had in our store was the greatest, every team member was willing to support their peers and deliver great guest experience."
good,"Coming in to work for Target has it's perks, along with it's low days. But regardless my mentality is to get the work done effectively and productively while maintaining the green looking store."
good,"Day to day was pretty typical; restock shelves, assist customers, zone your assigned area, assist where needed. During my experience, management staff was not friendly and usually abrasive in tone."
good,"Target provides great guest service. They were like family on many occasions in times of need. Working with my teams and seeing their accomplishments was very enjoyable. The hardest part of the job was not all management communicated with each other therefore, each had their own perspective of what should be done."
good,"If retail is your cup of tea, by all means Power to YOU!"
good,"I loved the culture there. The team work was phenomenal. My typical morning was busy. I had to make sure supplies were organized and full. I was on Guest Service Desk. I dealt with a lot of problems and issues in a timely and friendly manner. I  told guests about all our benefits for the credit  cards and price matching, coupons, sales and in store specials. We were very helpful on the floor too."
good,"It was an alright workplace , since it was in Manhattan Beach it was very busy at times which made it unorganized. My co-workers were very nice and helpful at times."
good,"I was put on as a new worker with a patient, and caring staff. I was slow to understand all the processes but the employees were always available to help no matter the work load. After a week I was efficient, and smooth working. The hardest part of the job was coercing with angry, and rude customers, but the best part was to see them smiling at the end of the transaction. "
good,"* A day at work is 90%of the time on the floor & can never finish paper work expected to be done."
good,"A typical day working at target was coming at 6 am to unload the truck.  While working at target i learned to work until the boss tells you to stop and do not worry about the clock.  I did not agree with a lot of the management daily, but it never stopped me from making it work which was very helpful of my co-workers to be there to help.  The hardest part of the job was switching from task to task because of a new system but i adjusted to each and every one of them."
good,"fast pace environment learned how to cook, do administrative duties =held banquet coordinator position when offered, management needed lots of experience. met lots of new people and travelers"
good,"Target accepts you for who you are. There is not certain ""mold"" that you have to fit to be appreciated!"
good,"Typical day at work: very busy, cashier, cleaning, restock, staying in late"
good,Great staff. Nice workplace. Everyone helps each other out when they are in need. Learned alot about customers. Hardest part is when Target didnt say anything that they are closing down.
good,"Nice co-workers, fun workplace, friendly supervisors. Target is very flexible with your availability and time off requests, professional management. Sometimes could get difficult on busy days with many tasks, and impatient customers."
good,"Very social work environment, networking comes in handy both for project execution and personal advancement. Interpersonal skills are a must and will take you far at this workplace! Place health and well being first."
good,More efficient work skills at target. Including bettering myself without losing again. By simply being open and honest with people including my employers and fellow employes. Just simply not talking about my life. But being aware of everyone around me to safe. Because simple is safe. You live by your rules of or get fired and that's it.
good,"I was hired at Target during the winter holiday season, but after conversations with my Co Workers, anything from back-to-school to halloween seems to bring in a gigantic crowd. Then you have people just buying a video game, then you have people buying a month's worth of groceries and they all need your help. The management is doing it's best but was completely overwhelmed."
good,"Working at Target was okay, however I remember always being tired. Work never ran out! It was always something else to do even after business hours! The hardest part of the workday was after the store had already closed. There was so much organizing, stocking, and cleaning. I often felt the job never got completely done. My co-workers were friendly and helpful. Management could be very motivating, however I rarely saw the team leads really doing work. The most enjoyable part of the job was the 30 minute lunch break."
good,"Out of all the years of working, Target may have unfair situation but at the same time there is fairness. It is a good work place to be in starting off as a first job."
good,"I learned how to answer multiple phones calls at one time and help the quests the best way I could, how to handle angry guests about why we couldn't return an item or any other problems. I learned how to stock shelves with the right merchandise and labels. I loved my co-workers at target. the managers on the other hand showed favoritism towards certain people, I did not like that. There really wasn't a hard part of the job, im a fast worker and can handle a lot going on at once."
good,"Most people that entered the store were friendly and so were most of the coworkers. Everyone wanted to make sure everything went smoothly and everyone had a good attitude when the customers would come and leave."
good,Great job if you like to be active and love working with people.    Only drawback is the hours  can be anytime depending on location.   Salary is very competitive.
good,"Unfortunately Target is no longer in Canada as of January 2015. Before it exited the market, the company was wonderful to work for with a positive work environment. The marketing campaigns and events made it for an overall exciting brand to work for."
good,"Target is a very productive , fast pace, and fun work place. I have a great set of co- workers who help me get through the day. On a typical work day, the morning time is pretty slow and  tends to pick up on most days during rush hour. Once rush hour has surpassed, the madness dies down to where my co-workers and I are able to breathe, customers can say they had a great experience and were provided with great customer service."
good,"Good place to work, friendly co-workers, decent managers, and a nice discount."
good,A good stepping stone work place. Very friendly atmosphere and a good amount of support. I managed to learn different skills that can be transferred to other forms of work. The goal driven environment allows you to continuously keep in a working attitude. Some leaders will not always be supportive to your needs. There is definitely a give and take culture when it comes to the needs of the team members. While it can be chaotic at times there can be moments of peace despite the consistently changing needs of the retail clients.
good,responsibility consist of maintaining a safe and secure environment for co workers and guest.
good,"Stable job security, but require a very heavy and demanding work load"
good,"A typical day at work was very pleasant. My co-workers were very friendly and easy to get along with. On a day to day basis I learned how to present myself to guest and learn that the customer is always right and to multi-task. There was not a really a hard part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people to the best of my ability, getting my job done the right way always felt good."
good,"Organized days with game-plan development, that helped me establish my foundation as a retail manager."
good,"The people whom I interacted with was great, and they saw me as a great person whom wanted to make sure the company networking system was operating at its best on a daily basis."
good,Lots of changes.  I really don't want to take the time to write this review
good,Great company to work for. A lot of advancement and training in multiple areas. A little disorganized sometimes. Overall for Me it is an okay place to work if your not really into retail type work.
good,"The job/work balance was difficult but the culture and environment was positive. I learned many management processes that made it possible for me to develop a positive team environment. I developed and refined my communication skills. I learned important knowledge on how to get the most out of my team."
good,When your a credit adviser you get cussed out by guests on the phone all day. Some leads are good but others are horrible. You do get rewarded a lot. Good pay.
good,"Typical day at work would be assisting customers, and helping out when the management when I was needed. I learned that anything is possible with hard work and maintaing a positive outlook. Co-workers were very helpful and friendly. Hardest part of my job was stocking while helping customers. Enjoyable part of my job was getting recognized by customers for doing a great job."
good,Target was not a great Job for me but I stayed to make ends meet. It just didnt fit me. Everything was great .
good,"A typical workday involves a lot of urgency. I am dealing with perishable goods all the time, so a quick and efficient service is a must. It can get overwhelming at times whenever your reliever is not available."
good,Not very much room for advancement. Not a whole lot of contact with management. Straight forward job responsibilities.
good,"very good for a working woman ,work life balance , neither good benefits nor salary for starters but it improves with experience ."
good,its a good place to work.  they dont mind you having tats or piercings
good,"A great place to work if you love working with people. "
good,"Great company where people can work their way up, but you have to be ok with the retail industry aka: working holidays and crazy schedules, some employee issues you wouldn't see elsewhere, and dealing with customers. Thankfully they take care of management with good pay."
good,"It was a great place to work but I found it to be a little to competitive for me.  Before the Red Card issues we had to convince a certain number of guests a day to sign up for a Red Card.  The higher the number the more favorable the manager was with you.  Other than that I enjoyed working there and getting to meet new people every day.  The hardest part in the beginning was interacting with guests but as I got more comfortable it became easier to interact and soon it was my favorite part of the day.  I had good co-workers and most of the supervisors were really nice.  I learned lots of good skills like operating a cash register, handling change and how to be efficient and maintain good interaction with customers."
good,Very progressive company with room for growth. Days can be a little long. The hardest part is working ALL holidays and being away from family.
good,"Target is a great store to shop in and I love working there, they cultivated a better customer service model and teach it to all employees.  They thrive on what they call Fast, Fun and Friendly. We as team members are expected to be quick to respond, to do it with a smile and a friendly welcoming attitude."
good,"Empresa agradável, com bons funcionários que se dedicavam a fazer seu trabalho com honestidade."
good,"A very fast paced work environment, frumpy co-workers, but working graveyard isn't much of a very paradise anyways. Working logistics at Target was descent enough to survive through the weeks."
good,"Walking threw the elevator doors you can basically tell what kind of night you would have. Each manager, team lead, and ETL have their own way of working and how they want you to work. Ive learned to push faster and make sure as you push fast everything looks nice and neat. Co-workers were a soap opra just too much gossip and drama. In the team room you could tell who was separated and who didnt like who. Sometimes the hardest part of my job was pushing the heavy boxes down the assembly line as i scanned them. Overall i enjoyed my job because I had never experienced such on an assembly kind of reminded me of a warehouse job"
good,Okay place to work. The co-workers are GREAT. Management is approachable and try to build relationships with workers. HR = HORRIBLE. Two of three woman were pretty rude and unapproachable. The 10 hour shifts on your feet and constantly bending were h3ll and made some days impossible to get through. The pay was good and your schedule is pretty much set with the exception of holiday season when overtime (60+ hour weeks) are mandatory.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job would be connecting with the guest when you ask them if they need assistance. Hearing some of their personal stories is very touching."
good,A typical day at Target involved plenty of running around and staying alert. The work never slowed up which made your time on the clock go by quick. There is rarely any downtime.
good,"Worked in management."
good,Target can be a nice place to work but it seems that management hires anybody which can make the work place a little uncomfortable.
good,"On a typical day at work I'm in the fitting room waiting for guests to come in and try on clothes. I count how many pieces of clothing they  have to determine whether they have passed the maximum amount of clothing they can go in with which is six pieces. The phone is always ringing so I'm always on the phone assisting the guests while looking out to see who comes in and goes out of the fitting room. Every half hour or 45 minutes I check the rooms to make sure nothing was stolen. Throughout the day I always get ""go-backs"" which is any clothing, shoes, accessories etc., that was returned or found around the store. I then have to separate everything and put it in baskets for the co workers to carry them back out to the floor. If I have free time I go out to the sales floor and help out the girls folding clothes on the tables or picking up clothes that are on the floor. At closing time I make the announcements that the store is about to close and sometimes stay a half hour longer after the store is closed to organize the fitting room and all the clothing departments. The hardest part of my job is having to assist guests in front of me and also on the phone. The phone should not ring more than three times so its a really fast pace. Also having to be very careful and make sure the guests are coming out with the amount they first brought in and they did not steal anything. The most enjoyable part is making the announcements and meeting so many great co workers. I learned how to manage a cash register, and fold clothes neatly."
good,"Trained staff on company safety policies and procedures, operation of forklift, pallet jack and baler in order to complete tasks such as loading, unloading, sorting, staging and transporting products, cycle counting, data entry."
good,Target is a great place to gain knowledge in many aspects of the work environment. Since I have been employed at Target I have gained strong leadership and communication skills. I have learned how to adjust to constant changes and immediately implement changes. I have had the joy of working with some of the most motivating and goal driven people.
good,decent place to work. had a decent work culture. easy to get along with the customers and coworkers. through training on job duties.
good,"Handling shipping and receiving duties, send back to distribution list of items that need to be sent back."
good,"1. Stat line review"
good,"come clock in  head straight to a fast environment,different customers with new needs every day"
good,"Very Fast, Ive learned how to communicate with different types of individuals on the daily basis"
good,I learned Manhattan WMOS in Target Corporation working in their FC. Created a Platform for knowing about Manhattan
good,"A typical day at this company was very routine, by the book so to speak, it was enjoyable and my co-workers were kind but very to them self's as we all worked alone. Working for this company I learned to really become a self starter and to accomplish tasks on my own."
good,"As an electronics team member it's nice to be able to talk to customers about certain products that I enjoy talking about.  The pay is slightly higher as it's a specialty department, and most people who work in my store are pretty enjoyable to work with.  Management is a huge issue as most if not all of the management is brand new to target and fresh out of college."
good,"I  work swing shift and i as never guarantee hours each week.  "
good,I like Target But be specific on your wanted shifts because they will put you to any shift
good,Target provides perfect work life balance for employees and a very warm culture ensures you are in the right place.
good,Target is a fast pace job and customers are our priorities. Your section is required to stay clean at all times to make it easy for our customers.
good,"However, if you have a family, friends etc then you should seriously consider something else. Target will become your family if you let it and trust me it has ruined more than a few marriages along the way."
good,"My typical day was to clock in, put my things in my locker, and get on a register. sometimes i would clear my reshop and hangers. i loved my co workers and the customers. I learned how to mutli task more .The most enjoyable part was talking to the customers and giving them great customer service they made my day at times. I became sick twice and missed days and if i didnt get red cards, it would seem like they didnt care."
good,"I learned a lot here.  How to use a hand held scanner, how to do the ordering, stocking, back stocking.  The management were great to deal with, and I enjoyed my co-workers."
good,"Not so great if you have children, because the hours are very long and sometimes unpredictable. Poor work/life balance"
good,Great Team Environment.  I learn a lot since I started my career with Target I was able to come out my comfort zone and grow as well as having the opportunity to do the same for others.
good,J'en parlerais lors de mon entrevue avec plaisir car selon moi ce sont des points a aborder durant une rencontre
good,I have enjoyed my employment at target co. though it is more than a little  bit monotonous in itself. It feels too round about for my personal tastes.
good,"On an average day I would work the back room inventory with the other staff. I designed end caps for seasonal displays (holiday decorations, sale items,  seasonal flavored coffees, and special gifts).I also worked with customers to help them register for weddings, and worked the front register."
good,"Good for Beginners."
good,"Fast, Fun and Friendly"
good,If you dont mind the hours you'll love having afternoons free
good,"Great environment, Good company, and wonderful employees."
good,"Working at Target you get alot of rude people, but i learned how to keep smiling and try to turn a bad situation into a good one. When you learn how to do that, then you day goes by smooth. I am a F.F.F ( Fast, Friendly, FUN) person."
good,usually fast paced with friendly coworker. there are alot of opertunities to learn here and be yourself. this is sometimes a high stress job.
good,"Plan and execute daily/weekly workload"
good,"Working at Target was a nice retail experience. What I didn't particularly like was how much they stressed the Team environment. I was so used to doing things on my own, to be constantly shoved into teamwork was some what annoying. You couldn't finish your work early, it just always had to be on time. If you did something early, you were scolded. They tended to treat everyone as a whole not as individuals. I liked being able to do different things there. One day I could be at a register all day, the next I was on the sales floor. Target always offered chances to be trained for other departments so it was really easy to pick up shifts and get more hours if you needed it. They also gave you a ton of breaks, which was something I wasn't used to, but whenever you really needed one they tended to ignore it. Sometimes I would be stuck in a department where if I just wanted to go to the bathroom I would need someone to cover for a minute and I would be told to wait for my break, but it never came."
good,"excellent leadership, motivating his team always, accessible when you need one day."
good,"The job was fun, but can become monotones. I basicaly scaned inventory, stocked it, and back stocked it. Co workers wer cool. The hardest part of the job was the end of the day when you have to work at the same pace eventhough you might be tired."
good,everyday brought something new. the job was mostly routine after you learn the ropes. I learned a lot about sterilization.
good,"We typically were required to stock products, pull stock to replenish items used on the floor.  Conduct inventory of stock"
good,A typical day of work consisted of working with my team to provide exceptional customer service with great quality and care.
good,Potentially very long hours. Productivity crunches continuously happen. Work life balance is talked about however rarely achieved.
good,"I assisted shoppers with purchases, stocked shelves and worked as a cashier. The management is good and the company takes care of its employees. However the hours are long and irregular. But that's the nature of retail work."
good,Not enough hours in the day to complete what they wanted done in the work day. Stressful place to work. Always short staffed. General set up of store and customer service was the general job description each day. Co-workers were easy to get along with. Management was  never seen that much and never stepped in to help when needed.
good,"A typical day at Target consists of completing the task list for market, while supporting other departments and providing excellent customer service.  I have been consistently recognized and promoted for my strong work ethic, leadership, and communication skills.  My skills and experience over the years have allowed me to recruit and train new employees."
good,I worked everywhere in the department. From cashier to guest services 
good,nice place love it customers are fun and the people are very understanding
good,"come in at 4am, unload truck. Go out on the sales floor and make sure all items are stocked correctly in their correct area. Keep up a fast pace. I learned a lot about how to read codes on items and still remember this. Management was a flux, target is known for it's revolving door of employees. Co-workers were great!! I could never ask for better co-workers ever. Hardest part of the job was unloading a trailer with no circulating air in the summertime. Most enjoyable part was able to talk and cut up while working on a isle with co-worker."
good,The job keeps you busy. Lots of things to get accomphlish. Personal development is a must. The team members are friendly and great to be around.
good,with all my job expiriance i have always enjoyed work at all the time.my co worker and my menegers i got long just fine with them.yes i worked really hard all the time .the hard part of the work is going to work like evrybody but after i got there i was keep on going the most enjoyable part is when everybody got together and did  celebretion .what i learned is if you work hard and enjoy what you do makes job little easy.for me no job is to hard or to big i always like working.
good,ok company communication is a lil bit off between managers and associates. Hours suck if you become a cashier. Your looking at 2-3 days a week of work depending on how busy the store will be around a time of the year. 
good,flexible hours great pay and benefits great co-workers. many convenient locations
good,Once you clock in you get your supplies and start your work on a certain side of the store. A shift a Target includes customer service and maintaining and clean safe store with the help of other team members
good,"Management is very good to their workers, technically I'm alone in the office. I'm the only person doing the cash office."
good,-I love to manage under pressure whenever my customer is trying to argue with me.
good,Will love to continue working for this company very flexible and work well with your schedule.
good,"productive, casual, assisting customers, keeping floor clean and products viewable"
good,Steady work until the end.
good,"Taking lots of calls, fast paste job, communication, wonderful co-workers, most enjoyable of job is having a goos time and being around awesome team members. But my supervisor was not all that about me she said i did not meet her requirements and for 4 weeks did wat she could to have me let go. but she had only been my supervisor for the last month i was there out of the 5 months i worked there."
good,Fast pace work with sometimes enjoyable moments. Management could be a little better with pushing responsibilities evenly across the board. Co-workers are pleasent in their department not really an overall team participation.
good,i worked really hard at this job was one of my first and excelled very fast
good,"My co workers were fun to work with. Being a cashier was an adventure, I never knew who I would meet and have interesting conversations with. I mostly liked the electronics department and their CD selection."
good,"most time would be packing customers orders, sometimes would be loading trucks by hand in order to maximize space in the truck at the end of the day would clean working area."
good,Worked as a cashier and worked the salesfloor when needed. learned how to balence money in the cash register as a Target Team member and providing guests information about the latest products out
good,It is a job in my eyes and not a career they do well about adjusting to your schedule but required a shifting schedule which does not work well with what I wanted.
good,"The work at Target Distribution Center is not glamorous. It is loading and unloading boxes and pallets of materials to be sold at retail Target locations. They are definately a solid company financially and they do have several positive benefits such as management advancement opportunities, health care benefits, multiple work schedules to choose from. Management varied from individuals who had worked their way up from entry level positions to individuals who had never sweated a day in their life. Overall management was fair. Most of my co-workers were satisified with Target in general but everyone seemed to agree that the production numbers that Target expected were unrealistic. That's where corporate managers and the dock workers experienced the biggest difference of opinion. The hardest part of the job was the 12 hour shift from 6pm to 6am. The most enjoyable part of the job was the comraderie. I have some life long friends that I met at this job."
good,"I started on the floor with target came into the pharmacy when someone quit with no notice went back to help for the day and ended up staying there for 9 years got registered, found it to be very rewarding helping (espically the elderly) with perscripitons understanding there medications and making sure none of them interacted with other medications they were on, also like helping them find different things on the floor got to know alot of them personally really missed them when I left. I worked with some of the best pharmasists in the business great managers, my co-workers are more than that they are still my friends outside of work. The hardest part of the job is seeing someone not be able to afford some of their medications, would always try to find a way to help them like calling the MD to see if there was something else they could use that was less costly. The most enjoyable part of my job was the patients and hearing stories about their children and family stories, some of the families had babies that I watched grow up to see over the pharamacy counter."
good,"Target was overall an okay place to work at. It wasn't horrible, yet it wasn't great. The co-workers either got along or they didn't. The management was fair. The hardest part of the job was the co-workers, and the most enjoyable is meeting new people and making others smile."
good,"i learned a lot there, it was like my first real job, it worked around my school schudule, when most jobs wouldnt, taught me how to fold clothes, there the reason i love working in retail."
good,"Work hard and fast at 4 o'clock am. Put out merchandise on floor, build bikes for sale. Always leaning better and faster and safer way to do daily shores at work.management always willing to listen, co-worker work well together,nothing hard about the job,once you learn that job.enjoyable- trying to do better"
good,"Very busy daily, a lot about different cultures, the management was very helpful and understanding. my co workers were fun to interact with and we worked great as a team, the hardest part of the job was working in the fitting room at closing time. i enjoyed the job mostly because you are constantly learning"
good,"Working at Target, your shift were never the same. You never did the same jobs each time you worked. Which made work be exciting. My favorite part of working was on the Blue side which was on grocery side on lane 5."
good,"The managers at the store level are reasonable for the most part. Of course, there are a few exceptions."
good,I liked working there sometimes i think the where not always willing to work around things you had going on outside of work. But it had great team members that put smiles on customers face on a daily bases.
good,Learned how to work different machines. Management was okay.
good,They demand that as workers we are flexible to fill any position if necessary . Which was a great experience for me.
good,A friendly place to work work under pressur and try to finish or job in a time lid of maner
good,"I would show up to work and jump right into action. There were always customers that I was always involved in something. I learned how to interact with different people. Since it was my first job, I didn't know how to deal with people. I was always extremely shy growing up that I had to open up to survive. I had 6 managers. Two of them were not fun working with or for, but the other 4 were a joy to work with and for. The hardest part of my job was dealing with so many people at one time. Learning how to multitask was vital in being an exceptional team member. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I was working with. We had a lot of fun inside and outside of work."
good,Unloaded trailers and organize products on line. stocked items on pallet and took pallets out to the floor for stocking. stocked items and assisted customers with finding products.
good,"On a typical day of work, presentation team members set 'Planograms' predetermined by corporate to give guests the best shopping experience. During my time there, I have learned much about the retail business and merchandising, guest service, in-store logistics, and working within a team concept. I have enjoed working with my coworkers and team leaders. The toughest part of working in a retail environment is managing tasks on a busy day with the increased amount of time needed from guests. The most enjoyable aspect of the job is completing a task and feeling a sense of accomplishment, as well as being able to provide great service for guests."
good,Stock inventory and provide customer service to guests. My communication skills have improved by managing various requests from guests.
good,I used to come in and start right away. It's stays busy so it's good to start assisting with customers as soon as possible. I also would check my listings on the computer to see what orders were up for photos that need to be developed and continue to do that. when any free time was possible I would assist on programming returns into the computer and sort the in each department.
good,"Target is a fun place to work. Fast and friendly is their motto. It's what they strive for for anything. With customers, register and on the sales floor. The co-workers were cool. But with every job, there's always a few who aren't as cool to work with. They gossip A LOT!!!"
good,The typical workday as Overnight Logistics for Target Corporation consists of the following:
good,"a typical day at work would be as i would call it very adventurous, I'd have my own department to keep organized, sometimes I'd switch to cashier if it got too busy or maybe the customer service line, I'd also relieve others if it were too busy or if it were time for their lunch break."
good,"Logistics or Sales Floor. I learned how to read bar coding on Products and Logistics as a whole. Management at the time wasn't the greatest because they were in the process of changing management, but things are different. Co-workers were awesome. A fun, Loving bunch of Crazies! Hardest part of the job was the Repetition. Repetitive task become mundane and might have you wishing for break to come faster. Night time pay is more then day.. but still under 10.00 an hour. Co-workers and a consistent pay check is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,What can I say I learned so much about the retail industry from helping customers to solving problems.
good,Never a dull moment at work. You will always have something to do and if you dont trust me management will find you sdomething to do.
good,"As a cashier , we have to make sure the customer leaves happy. We get timed on ringing out customers, the ones with large orders or undecided purchases would decrease the timing score and leaders will get upset and put pressure on us cashiers."
good,Productive and fun working at target because I've learned to communicate with different people and experience new area of work like merchandising and dealing with costumers at the service desk.
good,not a good place for advancement. good pay and like my hour. a fast pace jobs and safe.
good,I enjoyed working at Target and the pat made it even better. I just believe that I performed the job with a high level of performance and should've been offered a permanent position. If I was offered a job there I would accept it with no hesitation.
good,"A clean and well organized workplace.A number one goal attitude for customer satisfactory. A very planned sell goals . morning support meetings, with positive encouragement."
good,As a young adult this was a very laid back job. I enjoyed working with the customers as well as the other employees. Target is a great company to get your work history started.
good,"Long boring shifts where you don't really interact with anyone, but it's easy. You just put stuff away from boxes, then put things that didn't fit in the back and organize all the shelves at the end of the day. This is for any general merchandise position in ""hard lines"". Sometimes you have a lot of work sometimes not as much, you get 2 fifteens and a 30 usually for a typical 8 hour shift."
good,"I enjoyed working here. I enjoyed meeting new people and learning how to use different materials. But, I personally didn’t like how there wasn’t much communication within the workforce."
good,"Money management "
good,"Reload the trucks and the paddles, moving from one area to another, floor panel. They would work with you when they did schedule. There were no hard part about my job. The most enjoyable part of the job knowing that everything was done and in the right order."
good,They did not really care about many employees they just cared about production they’re getting and putting it out I understand thatwork production is important but employees go through things at home that maybe affects their work efficiency
good,Target was a ok company to work for. The biggest negative about working both the cafe and Starbucks was that they only scheduled two people and when one of the employees had to go on a lunch break I was stuck taking care of both sides with no help from other employees
good,very fair i made so many friends being around caring coworkers and team leaders it made me a better adult and values i can take with me to my next job
good,Pay and work is good only around seasonal and then hours are usually cut. With flexible fulfillment it is fun and energetic but is hard to complete orders for guests because items are sometimes not located.
good,"working for target is fun and easy, yet physically exhausting.  my shoulder was exhausted or else I would have stayed.  I enjoyed the upbeat nature.  discount was ok."
good,I was employed for the company for two and half year and resigned to continue my education. target offer many benefits to its employees and employees are also able to create their own schedule and hours.
good,Needs more work management wise. Team needs to talk about the do and don’t and how to get the job done effectively. Communication is key and it is something target is definitely lacking in.
good,"Do not work in retail if you enjoy spending time with your family around the holidays, that is the only drawback. Other than that, it is a great atmosphere to broaden your skills and knowledge and have the opportunity to lead teams of hundreds of people."
good,I met a lot of amazing people and made a good bit of friends. i eventually knew that the managers and store director had favorites who would get 40 hours and the rest would get 20 every two weeks. the hardest part of my fulfillment role was when the online an pick-up orders got super busy.
good,"Overall working at Target isn't difficult and generally easy going, it's a better experience for younger employees as you will find more team members in early to late 20s. But the huge downside depends can be management depending on your individual store. A few things that stand out would be being left unappreciated or very ineffective communication-action. Most annoying part would probably being constantly called in or members calling out. A. Lot. So watch out."
good,you do your job occasionally get heckled by the management for being not up to there standards after that they let you bee till your shift is over but they don't train you and expect to know what a skew number is when its your first job and don't tell them you cant read one or they throw tantrums
good,Hardest part about the job was the amount of physical effort it required. Lots of walking and lifting with little time to break. Employees were nice and management was not harsh.
good,Treated great during seasonal and I could always pick up more hours I loved it. I loved being able to unload the truck and stock the sales floor. I enjoyed being able to get to know many different people.
good,"Honestly at my store in particular the environment is pretty great. All of the people work together well, everyone is willing to help each other out for the most part. The problem is that there aren't enough hours to go around. I would stay if I was able to get at least 30 hours a week, but it doesn't happen unless you fight others for the hours (metaphorically). If you ask about hours, they tell you that you can work other departments and pick up shifts there, but so can literally anyone else in the store, so it's no guarantee. You either deal with what you get, fight for the scraps, or come in every time they call you. Don't get me wrong, I genuinely love my job and it's the only job I've ever had that I actually liked. But if you're looking for a stable job, this isn't it. It's great if you just want to work part time though."
good,I didn't enjoy the environment because it was so fast paced and there was a requirement to sell a red card that I didn't agree with. I didn't feel good about having to sell something to someone if they didn't want it. It was much too forceful.
good,Started my day at 5 in the morning clock in walk to the backroom would move merchandise from truck to store floor it was fun you need to be quick in placing merchandise
good,"A typical overnight shift would consist of the team being divided into three. Backroom, unload truck and floor. We had a routine which made it less of a headache.As each team is divided we’re initially all working together to complete our shift with complete or nearly completed tasks for the overnight team. We also have to make sure the entire store is completely brand before opening"
good,My time working for target was ok. I worked with fun staff and cool managers. It was always refreshing to see new faces everyday and to help guests with their shopping experience
good,"Target is running out Modernization which provides many opportunities to impress management. The workload may be stressful at times, but you just have to remember you're only human and can only get done what you can."
good,"While I was not personally satisfied with the experience, I don't think that the job path itself is necessarily a bad idea. The environment was enjoyable, the people were very helpful and coordinated. Likely the hardest part about this job was communicating with guests."
good,"This job is perfect for someone who has a lot of time on their hands and a whole lot of patience. If you decide to work here,  I would recommend working in a specific area (hardlines, softlines, food), not cashiering."
good,"The job itself isn't hard its actually very easy. Everyday we get goals we have to try to make, we get put in teams to try to reach those goals and we go against other teams to make it competitive and fun but it's all added together as a big building plan so end the end we're all working towards one goal it's a great family atmosphere the managers are fun and easy going the pay is great andbenefits are even better overall it's a good place to work and even retire from"
good,Good first job for people with little to no work experience. Above average pay for starting and the HR and high up staff are usually nice and friendly
good,Only 30 minutes to pick orders or you dont receive your goal. Orders come in all morning with a horn blown over the speaker. Someone had to acknowledge and fill the order whether 10 or 70 items. Very stressful.
good,The managers were always easy to talk to and understanding about life situations. Very flexible when it came to making my work schedule. Overall great all around work environment.
good,they are an amazing place to work. they treat there employees fair and work around there life and there schedule. If you need a flexible place to work they are one of your best bets.
good,"Target is a company that cares about their employees, however it is not a job for the faint of heart. It requires hard work and dedication and can sometimes be very stressful. However if you are looking for a place to develop your skills and grow in the long term, then Target is the place for you."
good,"Target Distribution is considered to be one of the most physically demanding jobs in my area. I was employed there for a few years and achieved the maximum pay for my position. They max out at around ~20/hr currently, not including shift differential and yearly cost of living raises (which usually are like 50 cents max). The job is very fast based and number driven. You might lose a few pounds working there. Overtime became much more frequent than it was in previous years. Mandatory 60 hour weeksTje benefits are great, but honestly I would say that the work that is expected is pretty rough for 20/hr. Many come in thinking they will do whatever it takes to get 20 an hour and learn quickly that they were wrong, which explains the pretty high turnover rate as most people who leave are new hires that may have been there for only a few days, sometimes only hours. It’s what you make it really. Pretty good for someone who doesn’t intend on going to college."
good,Target is a good place to work they r just funny about the hours u don't know how many hours u gonna get for the week they will cut your hours and won't inform u. The workers who have been there longer has been cut down to 4 hours a day know one can live off of that
good,The expect alot out of you but you get paid very well to do so but everyday is never easy no matter what so you always have to come in ready to work hard and fast or your not gonna meet goal
good,"Its a good place to work if you base it off pay, high compared to other retail jobs. Managers also receive yearly bonuses (not that much). GSTL (Now known as Service and Engagement Team Leaders) work in a very stressful environment. All Target stores are different, in mine, everyone wasn't supportive of the Front End. Calls for back up weren't responded, instead ignored then got annoyed why we called so much. Schedule was bad, never enough people for a busy day. There wasn't enough hours to schedule people the HR dept would say. Other leaders will take Front End team members for their work center and not care if Front End struggled, if you voiced your concerns then you were told you're not being supportive of the store as a whole."
good,"I had the opportunity to meet many people and work as a team orientated organization."
good,It was my first official job and it felt good to work. I was even able to work two jobs at the same time because of the schedule workings of Target. Not only that but management helped things from getting dull by offering competitions between cashiers. It never got cut throat but it kept things interesting.
good,"Each stores culture is different and takes some getting used to. You'll usually be paired up with someone in the beginning for a little while, but after that it's pretty straight forward work. Can be fun at times if you don't take everything personally."
good,Not a bad place to work the drive is far from Columbus but they pay well so it makes up for it. Clean warehouse biggest I’ve ever seen. Plenty of opportunities to advance
good,"Pretty good if you work at a larger location ( super target ) because they have the hours to give you, but at a smaller location, you will go from 40+ hours to 15-20 hours. Great benefits if they allow your average work hours get above the required amount, which is hard to do. Temp work is good and you can usually get a permanent job offer after holidays. What really helps in that case is to pick up as many shifts from other people and always come in if they call. They have fun volunteer options. Its a great job as long as you get a location with a manager that doesn't have their head up their you know what and don't think they're better than you just because they're management (RARE FIND LOL)"
good,it was a great first job. i enjoyed it quite a lot.  i got very few hours which was disappointing but the people i worked with were great and i still stay in touch with some of them.
good,I like working at target..the people are great. There just redoing things now.  Cutting hours.  I need my 40 hours. I enjoyed  my job. The company is making changes now.  Plus  the pay is increasing.  Good place to start  out .
good,"I liked working here when I was living with my parents and not paying rent, but this job simply would not cover the cost of living in Colorado on its own even at full time. I would however go back as a part time associate as a second or seasonal job."
good,"Love work as a cashier and don’t the work it great to me and love the paid and discount much more , ',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,it get hard to work at time with customer. On holiday"
good,great job to work at just no hours and not enough pay.Benefits are good.i wouldn't recommend it if you have a family and living expense.Its alots of changes in retail.
good,"A normal day started with at least one call off, but that didn't stop the workflow, it just meant everyone else had to work harder, which was the most difficult part. Some management was wonderful, completely understanding of personal life or education, and other's didn't even know my name. Overall, it was an easy job with mindless work."
good,Target management was good. My manger had a good vision of what he had in mind for the store and inspired his employees to work with him. When it came to helping solve problems in my department he did slightly struggle and left me blowing in the wind. Overall the store was ok.
good,It's been good it's been bad  its just change to much going in the wrong direction. They dont stick with anything that is actually working. Very discouraging
good,"Target had a very friendly environment, very nice people to work with. Great hours and very flexible schedule. The people are great. Loved some days and the culture there, however many days were stressful and pay wasn't great even if you did well on yearly evaluation"
good,"Target was a seasonal job for me. It was a very easy job to me because I had experience in picking/packing. The pay was decent but by it being seasonal, there wasn’t many hours."
good,Typical day to day with projects you choose from to work on. management is good. in this work must. Ask to get promoted and work hard and stay focus on it.
good,"I was able to be cross trained for multiple departments which I liked."
good,When I first started it was an amazing job but over the course of the last few months there has been a very high turnover rate from top to bottom. Upper management doesn't seem to know whats going on in all departments.
good,An overall good place to work. They work with your school schedule but some management issues. Paid bi-weekly and hourly pay is fair. Fast paced environment.
good,We learned how to sell and promote the Target Red Card. We had daily goals on how many we need to sell to reach that goal and we would play fun little games to reach the goal.
good,The team leader is fun and easy going but will make sure work gets done. She likes to have a clean work area which is great.  She will communicate with the store manager on your behalf.
good,with the right managers it is a good place to work but low income at least when I used to work there. I left because there was no career advancement and I was looking for a better income and position.
good,"It wasn’t horrible but I probably wouldn’t recommend working there. It was just a temporary job for me so I didn’t need it to be perfect, some people might enjoy all those people but I personally would like to see less people in my day of work"
good,"This particular store was top 10 stores in volume for the company, with not adequate store size. There were a lot of constraints with freight flow into the store. The processes made it very hard to complete job/tasks in a timely manner. It was defeating most days. Lack of support from HQ and Upper management teams made it hard to focus on other tasks during the day. Loved working with a great team and helping guests."
good,"A typical day at work is a very fast paced environment. There is an extensive amount of workload to get done with not enough hours in a day to accomplish them. "
good,"Overall it is a good place to work, but I am looking for more advancement. Management is great and understanding also. I also learned that it takes a passionate person to work in customer service."
good,"Management does not listen and wants people to forget about continuing further education for better paying positions. Days at Target would be faced pace on the Holidays but, during regular days they were slow. I would walk back and forth on the self check out lanes. Assisting customers with there items of purchase if the self check out register would give them a problem."
good,"My experience so far at target can be summed up in one word."
good,Prefer not to answer these review. There are pros and cons to working this type of retail environment.  Everyone has their ideal position.  I would like to promote.
good,"it was very stressful and the food they served or that you can buy made me sick"
good,"Target is very good about scheduling for students.  The company is highly interested in hiring young people, perhaps to promote its Trend Forward image, or to train for future managers. However, there are plenty of older employees working at Target as well. You will not get a lot of hours working for Target except sometimes working during the holidays."
good,worked 3 days a week 12 hour shifts back to back and was required to move at an ungodly speed or else you were fired right there on the spot. It was really unnecessary the way they treated their warehouse workers and the pay they received for what they did was laughable.
good,Get to meet great people everyday and work with some really cool people. Target gives people the opportunity to progress very quickly if you are interested and motivated to work hard.
good,"As far as work life balance, compensation and extra benefits, Target is great where this is concerned.  I would recommend the company to anyone in this regard.  They also have a great location."
good,"The work is easy so the pay is low"
good,"A typical day at work consists of many tasks that should be completed by the end of your shift. First and foremost, within my position as a perishables assistant, is making sure the PFresh market area is full and clean. Guest health and safety is the most important part of the job. We dispose of any bad product that we find on the shelves and bring out fresh new product to replace it with. I've learned a lot working with Target. Target has really helped me learn how to manage my time and how to tackle large workloads without overwhelming myself. I was also given the opportunity to learn how to manage a team through this perishables position, which was wonderful. The hardest part of the job for me, was being critiqued. No one likes to be told they're doing an okay job, but could do better. In the end though, that's how you grow with the company and yourself. You're never going to be perfect, and there is always room for improvement in everything you do. The management in Target is excellent. They really do care for their team members, and are willing to be flexible with any requests you may have. They also are very good about addressing a problem that may have been brought to their attention. Overall, Target has their moments when it's not going to be the best, but that will happen no matter where you go. You just have to take the good with the bad. It definitely is a great company to work for, and you meet all sorts of new and friendly people."
good,I enjoy working a Target you can advance in the company. It’s generally a fun place to work at lots of changes and it very fast pace. They treat there employees great and offers lots of different discounts for the team.
good,"A typical day at Target is to give a excellent customer service to the guest. Help when they as to be assisted. What I've learned is that Target is a place for high school graduates that want to grow and become adults to start building a career. The hardest part of the job is to always have patients customers need to feel well treated. There are moments we enjoy are job when we receive respect from are customers, team members, and are Store Manager."
good,"I liked working with Target. It was fairly relaxed; the only problem I had was, with my class schedules changing, the employer was not very flexible in adjusting my work schedule."
good,"While the job was simple and the pay and benefits were good, the management was poor. Managers did not care about the happiness or loyalty of the employees. I know many people who were promised promotions or movements within the store, and were then ignored for months to years. There is much favoritism."
good,You get cross training by other team members. You are trained in just about all positions . There was an on-site life counsellor. LOD where caring and concerned for their team members.
good,It was a great job just no getting in higher places not enough work in a 10 shift but overall a great place to be at and environment just wanted to try and reach management
good,Friendly place to work with good employees and management.  Communication between management and from management is very hap-hazard.  Limited advancement opportunities.
good,"Keeping may assigned work area clean.  I was hired in after the Holiday season"
good,"Target offers great benefits to full-time employees (32 hours or more weekly). You get a 10% discount, also with you have the target redcard you get an 5% off. Cartwheel is a great app with more discounts/coupons as well."
good,"Regular employees complained to me “why I was so"
good,Can't say I had the best time working at target overnight but it was a great learning experience. It taught me how to apply conflict resolution and to push myself to greater heights. I am truly glad for the experience.
good,"The job was very sloe paced and you kinda stayed in one area for hours. The people that worked here weren't that nice and they made it hard to fit in with them, which also made it hard to work as a team. Management also had their own possy with some to the team members and they were treated different and if you weren't in that clique you often got attitudes from the managers."
good,"It was a friendly environment my co workers were friendly and nice. Managements was bad, supervisors did not know how to talk to workers in a respectful manner"
good,Great place to earn some extra cash while going to college. However we were heavily underemployed and my schedule expectations for a work/school life balance withered away shortly after.
good,This was a really good job but the pay wasn't there. I enjoyed everything I did. I worked in every department. The staff was really friendly not only to each other but to our guest as well.
good,"Had to leave for family reasons. Understanding manager, Easy work environment, provided enough hours, training was provided, Good co-workers, provided answers."
good,Overall good job. Management needs work with people skills. Good hours. Three twelve hour shifts. Good home and work balance. All employees from all departments are willing to pitch in and help regardless if its their department or not.
good,the environment and the workers were awesome people. at times things would get really busy and were not enough workers to meet the demand but the experience is worth it.
good,Good place to work very fast paced and if you do your best it is a very secure job I would recommend Target to anyone willing to work at a fast paced well paying job
good,"Enjoyed throughly but not enough hours to make a living. Staff is nice and friendly. most enjoyable part of the job was coworkers. Hardest part was dealing with unruly customers. And they make you call customers, guests (lame)"
good,"An Overall work environment. You can learn awesome skills. Benefits, are offered, and 10% discount for employees. Fast, Fun, and friendly place. Very reserved, and balanced,"
good,Enjoyed Working Here. The Job was stocking shelves. I could have my headphones plugged in the most of the shift and I could listen to my music while I worked.
good,Very fast paced. Once your inside you cannot leave before your shift is over. Feels like prison. One 18 minute break and one 28 minute break. By the time you sit down it's over. You will be lifting heavy boxes and product for ten hours straight 12 if overtime is on. Pallets come with 15 different products on it when you unload the truck and you have to separate each product to a different pallet. So one pallet can turn into 15. They want you to keep your numbers up at a percentage above 90%. Which is not always attainable. They have a section called ART which is h e double L. No one likes it and it's why most people quit. You have to constantly make pallets for ten hours straight removing stuff off of a conveyor belt. It's hard on your body and your mind but they don't care. All they care about is numbers at the end of the shift. ART is very unorganized. People won't work as a team. Some will work and others will do what they can to not do a thing. I.e.: ride the fork truck all night or stand around on their phones. Target pays very well but working there isn't worth it. The only good thing is the paycheck. And being off on sat sun and mon if your on the weekday shift. Some very good people work there and then you have some who have a major attitude problem.
good,Target was a good company to work for Until the changes came that they don't work with you when you have another job. Back in the years i have work 2 jobs. I love what I do there but the managers don't really listen to the team members at all. There is favoritism toward other also I.ve work there for 14yrs.
good,"im at cashier there and its a great place to work, you just have to ask for more hours because they are sometimes low on them. all around good place and people to work with."
good,"Target is a fun company and they support a lot of organizations but they are very strict about time and ""brand"". If you don't mind working a lot basically giving your life to Target then this is perfect for you and you will definitely be rewarded in both pay and job advancement."
good,not a vary stable job the hours are never consistent and constant schedule changes. The management is very easy going and pay is pretty decent compared to other retail stores.
good,"I found the 12 hour shifts to be brutal, but at least I have experience working long hours now. I don't have much else to say so hers are some random thoughts to get me to the 150 letter count............................................"
good,It was a great work olace.. I enjoy working there.. I learn alot of things from working there.. It help me with my commutation skill and handling a cash..
good,Everyday is nothing like the day before. This is the perfect job for someone who dislikes routines. The workplace is fun with daily recognition huddles and monthly events. There are fun community service opportunities. the hardest part of this job is picking up after rude and disrespectful guests.
good,I started as a part time cashier and was able to be promoted to my final position of Guest Service Team Lead within a few months.  I was able to learn the daily operations of maintaining the check lanes as well as the customer service area.  Scheduling the staff the maintain work flow as well as supplying a productive and enjoyable work environment.
good,"Professional environment."
good,There was minimal resting time outside of breaks even when everything was done there was still something else to do. It was an energy-draining and strict environment that thought me discipline and what the workforce was like for a first job.
good,"I like working for Target. I work with some amazing people and really liked helping our guests find what they are looking for. Working in the grocery department has been both challenging and rewarding. In the course of a day I would have to divide my time between helping guests, which was rewarding, and dealing with about eight food vendors. The team members I work with are some of the best people to be around. The issue I have with Target is that I never got a 40 hour work week, and if I did, it was very rare. Financial ends were being met, but with hours fluctuating from 38 hours one week down to 21 hours the next it caused some financial instability at times."
good,"It's a very fun, fast paced, and young culture. The benefits are great and the people you work with have bright minds and lots of passion. The biggest hurdle is how people are treated based on their job title. Exempt team members exist in a different world from non exempt team members in terms of perceived value by the company. Exempts typically get better quality benefits, high pay, more frequent recognition, career advancement opportunities, etc. than non exempts do. Overall, there is an artificial barrier that separates the two. Another major setback is management is inconsistent and really plays a role in success at Target."
good,Target was my first job and it allowed me to see how to work in retail. It made me know how it feels to be on the other side of the table when people go shopping at stores. I learned a lot from there so all in all it is a alright place to work
good,Target is a good company to work with but the management was lacking. I found most of the people who worked at Target liked the company. I think the management changed a lot and this made it harder for the workers.
good,Great hours. Paid well. Wish they wouldve been more considerate to their employees personal lives and matters. Other than that they were wonderful. Friendly staff
good,"Working at Target requires you to deal with people on a regular basis.  Target also refers to its customers as guests. You will help guests find items throughout the store. If you cashier for target you will be required to keep your survey scores up. For example, you will be expected to sell one red card a shift. A red card is a debit or credit card only to be used at target. It is also important to make sure if possible your guests are satisfied with their visit when they leave the store. It is also required that you keep your work area clean. Bringing carts in is also another responsibility for cashiers."
good,Target was an excellent company to work for. The challenge is to find a partner pharmacist in your store that will work with you on scheduling. The amount of hours is a lot for just two people to share and this created a lot of frustration within our store.
good,"The working environment is great, personality is key, being yourself in this type of working environment will help you a lot. The hours are convenient, and the schedule varies, if you're looking for a part time job for extra money I would recommend applying for a Target job."
good,"My coworkers were okay, mangers were fine, work is simple as you gain more experience. Eletronics is the best plce to work in or in stock room so you don't have to deal with bs customers"
good,great company i like the work area my computer is ok some time some sistem uissue both reaolved  later but eveey is ok later my lead is ok great help wend i need help
good,"I liked he job on some days but some days it was unorganized and all over the place , the managers we're never serious and showed lots of favoritism towards the workers ."
good,"Left to move to a new industry. Decided the retail environment was not for me. Target has many different locations, however, working for the customers is extremely exhausting."
good,"A lot of work to do but, your costly moving around doing different task so the time goes pretty fast, and you learn each department , and learn how to work with tools to get your work done."
good,"Target was a great company to work for. Everyone at the company was super friendly. However; working nights was not the easiest, but eventually got used to it."
good,"Upon working at target, its been normal, nothing too fun and nothing too boring, when ut comes for relaibitilty among supervisors it can hetic and also very stressfull. Overall target is ok"
good,"I enjoyed helping people, It brings positive vibes. You meet some of the nicest people you'll ever meet. People love to shop there, so it's going to be busy all day everyday. While your ringing hundreds of items, You can hear about how your customers' day is going."
good,Fun atmosphere. Hard working staff. Great management. Busy throughout entire shift. Best part of the job is the hours and benfits
good,"The workplace was fun & productive management was wonderful the pay was good the job was also easy. I never had any type of problems with anyone at the workplace it was a great environment to work in , hoping one day i can work back there I learned a lot about target in less then 3 months"
good,"typical day at work is nice"
good,"It was cool first starting out but time passing it became difficult to work there. Not enough hours, nor was i able to get a higher position requested while working for the company, though I did have a few good times made some cool friends with co-workers and a few managers"
good,I have been contract for Target. Very good place to learn new technologies.Best place to explore new stuffs and have lot of space to learn business.
good,they had high expectations and were always busy but the other staff made work fun and enjoyable. they were all very friendly and welcoming when i first started
good,"Always a commadating, "
good,The early morning work schedule was hectic but well wroth it you basically have your whole day after you get off. Fun work place with a lot of staff contest and give a ways
good,always something to do... you learn something new every day...management was on top of everything...staff was always there to help...sometimes under staffed but always manageable...
good,It fun to work there and help customer to find what to look for. I came in and clock in and walk to the back and the three guy unload the trailer and the team restock the shelf.
good,"Never enough time to get things done. They'll either need you in the cash registers when it's a busy day, or out in the isles cleaning up when it's slow."
good,Fast Fun and Friendly work place.  Friendly co - workers who you can depend on.  Great 401k program and benefits.  The only down side is the holiday hours.
good,"I really enjoyed working there ..nice people. Teamworks cooperate good. Helped each other "
good,"Target is going thru a lot of changes right now as they shift their business from store focused to store and digital.  There are quite a few growing pains right now, but it should get better soon.  Target has great talent."
good,"An environment that generates strong team building, while also encouraging employees to be independent on the salesfloor."
good,"The team is what inspired me to come to work everyday. You quickly learn how to work as a team and become a family. I loved that. The management worked hard to create an amazing work/life balance for the team as well. You will always work with some challenging people at any job, what makes the difference is how you manage it, you always have to be your own advocate and be the better person."
good,overall the job was great the staff was good. whenever I needed help there was always someone there to help.The hardest part was around the holidays because it was busy eveyone was everywhere tryna help all the guest find thing call other store if we didnt have it gettng price check making sure the store still was looking presentable.
good,Human Resources made days fun with various contests and prizes to keep staff positive. Seeing customers get what they wanted with our help was most satisfying.
good,Exemplified leadership role by obtaining a position as a mobile protection ambassador while meeting and exceeding company quotes.
good,It was decent place to work but great culture and environment and good learning and manager provide good support and team leaders are understanding. Open system and anyone can raise/discuss issues about anything
good,Nice Job But My Supervisor Was Terrible She Would Yell At Her Employees Instead Of Encouraging Them I Was A Stocker And Loved Doing It
good,I absolutely loved to come to work here.Although i worked 2 jobs during my tenure at target i was up for this job.To know your actually helping people is a very good therapy for your soul;employees and customers.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart, because I got to know great people while working there. Walmart was a fast-paced job, where there was always people shopping and asking questions. The problem with working at Walmart is that their pay is very low compared to how much work we do there; I think they should raise the pay so that it is worth staying and working there (because generally there is too much work at Walmart so it has got to be worth it)."
good,"A lot to learn regarding how the store operates, company culture, and the human resource department. Very interested in personal leadership growth and development. Decent amount of politics, but that is expected in any big company. The person-job fit is important in this job -- don't go into it blindly. You must be the type of person who can handle a lot of curve balls and be in charge of your own training and department. The team relies heavily on each other - this means that vacations must be planned ahead as to not affect the overall business and there are weeks where you will put in well over 60 hours and other weeks where you may only put in 40. Also, having a good relationship with other employees is essential to operating efficiently."
good,"A typical day at work consists of clocking in , grabbing a walkie talkie and mydevice and signing it into your account. Heading to the fitting room and more than likely doing a zone for the first part of the day. Zones included shoes, active wear, kids, maternity, juniors... ect. Start by picking up and moving things around to make the store pretty and efficient.  around six there will be a team meeting in the back room where the trucks pull in. Management will talk to the team about the good and bad of the week and probably hand out free snacks (saved my life many days) also rewarded certain team members for hard work and accomplishments. Personally I enjoyed the team members over the management in the Suburban Ave  store. The hardest part of the job would be running from the fitting room the the registers every two minutes to help cashier when you were scheduled in the fitting room to be answering the phones, Also maybe the hardest part was having ten different people above you, telling you the same thing and not knowing who has authority to keep bothering you; management was very obnoxious one person would come tell you to zone shoes then another would tell you take the phone another would tell you hop on a lane and then they'd all yell at you so that ""killed my vibe"". The most enjoyable part of the job was, don't be mad but, clocking out. Now that I think about it that job was too annoying. I think they needed to be more clear about what they wanted from me. As if they needed someone in the store to run around and help everyone do random things and be overly happy about"
good,"Pros:"
good,target was a good place to work at until hours got cut dramatically and would only work for 12 hours a week not even worth it but i guess that how it is.
good,bien je devait me presente au bureau de la securite chaque matin ouvrir le système informatique qui est relier au camera du magasin prepare ma feuille de routine et ensuite aller punch pour commencer mon quart de travaille l aspect le plus agreable c est de pouvoir aider tous l equipe et eux aussi en vous donnant des informations pour contre le vole et tous agression verbale avec un employer
good,"It's retail so it's pretty much what you expect. The teams are awesome and so are most of the guests. The pay, hours, and holiday working leave something to be desired."
good,"Target, Inc. is a young leadership company whose excellent salaries and room for growth and advancement make it appealing to recent college graduates. While it provides great benefits, they come at a cost to work/life balance and career silos. "
good,"HR is a typical busy department. Handling team members concerns on a daily basis. Processing weekly payroll for 600+employees among other various job duties."
good,Must be able to multitask and willingness to learn multiple departments is a plus but no extra compensation. Little room for advancement within the company.
good,The hardest part  about my job was trying to  get my boss to understand  what I was saying. But overall I enjoyed the Co-workers I worked with and the task I had to do as my job.
good,Its pretty smooth at target only bad thing is that I cant ask to come in the days I want to work it sucks getting your hours cut. Employees are pretty cool though I am always about my business. Too bad I wont be staying there too long.
good,Good company to work for with advancement opportunites. Good coworkers and supervisors.Remodeled to include some produce.
good,Fun place to work at. I lived in the area so it was nice knowing everyone who walked through the doors. Working directly with other people really sharpened my customer service skills and helped me get over being shy.
good,"The team that Target employed was phenomenal. Everyone was sharp, accountable and fun. I looked forward to being around them and working with them every day. Was constantly impressed by my peers and my managers. Unfortunately the policies that Target has for advancement aren't very motivational. It is solely based on timing rather than merit."
good,Target is place where i gained extensive experience and expertise in sales and customer service. healthy environment helped me to work effectively and efficiently.
good,Bonne compagnie avec de bonnes idées mais une planification sur le nouveau marché qui a échoué
good,"A typical day at Target consists of generally helping ""our guest"" (as we would refer our shopping customers) find what their looking for and provide the best shopping experience. What I learned working for Target? Well this company really has been my foundation for my dedicated work ethic I have today, began working for the company at age 18, straight out of high school for about 2 and a half years. Management was overall easy to work with but at times expected the impossible from their associates and the pay is definitely not equal to the work."
good,"Unload truck, separate boxes into isles, stock shelves, place restock in stock room."
good,"A typical night start at 6 p.m. ends at 6 a.m. A fast-paced, environment also a little tough due to the, heat and poor circulation. Temperatures can get as hot as 110! The pay is good though."
good,"Target has a unique culture branded as fast, fun, friendly.  While the FFF culture certainly rings true, Target has a bit of a reputation for being a homogenous workforce and a culture that can be difficult for outsiders to adapt to."
good,"Communication between co-workers and managers is key when working at Target.The good thing about working at Target is helping the customers out and helping them find what they need, the bad part of the job came at night when returns had to be done and products were not properly sorted"
good,"We introduced the Target Sustainable Product Standard and launched the Simply Balanced product line to meet customers growing demand."
good,"Presentation team members did resets in the store."
good,Working with guests most of the day. Pretty busy at all times so you  always have something to do.
good,"A typical day is usually good and content. Things that I learned was how to work in various departments to help other co-workers in the store. Also communication is a big factor in the key part of the job. The management team were really helpful and flexible to any questions or concerns of my knowledge. My co-workers were very fun, friendly, and I loved the diversity of them all. The hardest part of the job for me was the early morning (4am) shift I liked the time but it could be a little tiring. The most enjoyable part of my job was my schedule, co-workers, and the appreciation shown for my ethic."
good,"There was a lot of different things to learn at this job because it was a general retail store.  It didn't sell a specific category of items such as groceries.  This was my very first job after I turned 18.  This job helped me learn the fundamentals of a work life.  I didn't have a whole lot of responsibilities, but I didn't work there for very long.  I didn't learn a whole lot about the benefits, advancement, or even the management team because I wasn't there for very long and didn't really understand the concept.  The employees, at the time, were great to work with and the customers were great to assist.  This was an interesting place to work as a first job."
good,The hiring was a bit of a pain but overall when you get hired its a great place to work.  There is always growing room in the company.
good,"A typical day at work for myself includes keeping the parking lot clear of carts as much as possible as well as doing the same for the store while keeping carts available for guests while having other duties such as keeping the trash and bathrooms clean, assisting guests and cashier duties."
good,Very stable place to wok and typical retail business and culture.
good,"I was a stocker, so it was about 15 of us half unloaded the truck and half stocked the floor, very fast paced but fun because of the people I worked with, learning the locations of products was the hardest part."
good,"I loved working for Target Co. Being part of a team for all intents and purposes was something that I hadn't known that I would benefit from on a personal level. The work environment was comfortable for the most part. And I loved that you could always feel safe there. I learned a lot about customer service and how to better multi-task. The satisfaction of our customers always came first and that made my job easier to do, as I love to help others. :-) My only major issue is that hours are hard to come by most of the year and since your schedule is ever rotating you don't really have a consistent schedule."
good,"I only worked at Target for a Month because of extern. My typical work day would consist of filling prescriptions, stocking medication and cleaning. During my month at Target I learned the skills needed to be a pharmacy technician."
good,learned work work in a very faced paced environment and independently.Also learned to help a teammember when needed.
good,"From the day I walked through the doors here everything has changed. Myself and co-workers are here to identify and find solutions to maximize our building prod., accuracy, and where our company losses are. Every day is a different experience with something new being thrown at you. Communication plays a huge role in what I do. High levels of team engagement as well as parntering with other departments is a must to be able to continue the growth at which desire to see. The things I like most about this work place is watching the company perform based on decisions that I as an individual have a control over. As an individual within, I am required to be able to work and engage independantly on a day to day basis. I am always looking 2 steps ahead to try to illiminate down time and or company loss."
good,"I enjoyed working at target, but there was no room for growth at the store i'd transferred to."
good,"Fast paced environment that is committed to guest satisfaction. The culture of Target is Fast, Fun, Friendly. The down side to any retail position is the crazy schedule."
good,Enjoy customer interaction. Co-workers and management are all pleasant and very easy to work with.
good,"All employees in the store, as well as managers, give a really good ""vibe"" showing professionalism. All managers are very friendly yet can be stern when necessary. The company and management itself is well-run and well-organized. I was very pleased to work for such a positive company and would recommend employment to anyone."
good,"a Typical day as a target security officer included investigating theft cases, acting as a deterrent, providing guest service, and maintaining a safe workplace. I learned how to deescalate situations and how to look for suspicious shoppers. Management and co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was keeping a low profile when we were investigating somebody on the floor. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to recover stolen merchandise."
good,It was a big place so a lot of people really friendly but i managment could of been a little better.
good,"Must be a retail person who is willing to give up spending time with family and enjoying holidays."
good,"I enjoyed working at Target,for almost 25 years.I would work in the fitting room cleaning what was left over from the previous night which was very little.I would start answering the phones and helping guests.I would walk the sales floor every hour and do pick ups to keep the floor clean.I would put the go backs(reshop) away."
good,"worked with guest with pasgt due accounts"
good,2nd shift at target distribution sucks because you have to work till the work is done and that could be 5 or 6 in the morning even though first shift comes in at 6 in the morning
good,"•	Involved in Analysis, design, development, testing and all     technical interactions with client."
good,i loved working here but it got to the point where the managers would get all the credit for what we would to and go on outings and do fun things while we had to sit back and do all the hard labor... and all we would get is a high five... once i started school and couldn't work to many hours they decided to demote me and cut all my hours to 4 a week if that so i had to quit...
good,Target was i joy to work at. From management to the co-workers everyone was really fun to work with. 
good,"I worked full time. The people I worked with were always so much fun and helpful. I feel I was not trained properly though. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers! I loved seeing the same faces every weekend there, and it is nice when you actually get to know the customers!"
good,"-A typical day at work usually starts with reviewing sales trend, operations and compliance reports to analyze store productivity. This is followed by delegation to assistant managers around daily, weekly and monthly goals and strategic planning as well as having face to face statuses with various employees around development and accountability. Then one will typical spend a portion of their day reporting and conversing with superiors around personal development and analyzing staffing and scheduling. Then will come follow up routines around goals set for staff and overall store."
good,A typical day of work consists of me arriving at work and helping out guests ( customers) at the store. I am in the upstairs clothing department so I make sure everything is neat and tidy. 
good,"Went to work at target with high hopes that i would have a long standing job there... However Shortly after meeting my manager who looked like she was about 16 with no clue... I realized my time was going to be short."
good,"During a typical day at work I would help customers find what they were looking for, help the front end ring up the people that are buying items at the cash register, and if needed I would help load heavy items in their car. I have learned how to operate a cash register, organize and stock shelves on the sales floor, and some backroom logistics. The management can be tough at times but fair. Co-workers are always helpful with everything that goes on during the work day. The hardest part of the job would be moving around heavy equipment around the store. The most enjoyable part of the job would be when you realize that you have made a difference in someone's life by helping them find what they needed."
good,"Good company to work for. Generally great people to work with.  Could use some improvement in communication at store management level. Good work life balance in general.  Chances to grow and learn new positions.  Short term plans are very solid, slightly worried about long term. Company being increasingly lead by the human resouse team, rather than a marketing team. Retail hours. Trending towards the worst, eperimenting with being open on all Holidays.  Now have expectaion of even junior leaders/department heads, having college degrees.  Pay rate generally good but increases are slow and bonus structure for junior managers is non-existant.  Benefits good but getting a little worse every year."
good,"A typical day included clocking in then going out to the floor and clean any mess that is left from the pryor night, then put back any abandons that are there. Assist customers find everything they need and get them checked out as fast as possible, & make sure everything is zoned throughout the store while assisting customers."
good,"A typical day would be working in soft lines, assisting customers, and zoning the area. My co- workers and I worked as a team to get all of soft lines looking beautiful by the end of the night. I enjoyed working as a team.The hardest part of the job was dealing with swim suits."
good,"Days consisted of tallying logistics, keeping customers happy and enjoying the work atmosphere. I learned how to work solo. Management is really hyped and organized keeps everyone on their feet! Co-workers always busy, not much time to chit chat. Hardest part of job would have to be learning how to drive fork lift! Most enjoyable team effort!"
good,"awesome,most relaxed , not as much heavy lifting, good co-workers"
good,"While employed at Target I worked as a cashier. In addition to working as a cashier I worked in customer service, worked in soft-lines, covered shifts at the in-store restaurant, and managed over other employees during supervisor breaks. I really enjoyed working in retail because there was always opportunity for growth. I had enjoyed helping and having direct contact with customers. However, I did not enjoy the low compensation and low hours while working in retail."
good,"The job was a routine based on practices followed at all times. I learned how important it is to be a team player along with puncuality and reliabilty. The management was terrible as they didnt promote from within the distribution center. They solely let people with degrees or military experience to run the floor when most of them had no knowledge or experience of running a production/warehouse environment. Management personnel also were prone to ignoring suggestions made by the actual crew members. The coworkers were always team oriented, respectful, patient and courteous."
good,"I trained employee's in customer service, floor displays, sales and meeting daily goals."
good,"Seasonal position that I wasn't getting enough hours in. I worked in the Garden Center where I got to operate a chain saw and cut X-Mas trees. The hours were good in the beginning bur slow down a lot. Also, they cashed our paychecks which was a real plus. I didn't get the chance to know anyone but the overall atmosphere was good and it is a nice place to work."
good,"era proprio bello lavorare a stretto contatto con molte persone, soddisfare le loro richieste, e riuscire a strappare un sorriso ad ogni persona."
good,Good place to work. Large store with alot of employees. Just depends on the management and you. Nothing special
good,A typical day for me depended on what area of the store i happened to be working in but for the most part i worked in the food court which was enjoyable because ive always enjoyed assisting in making our customers visit more enjoyable.
good,"Fast paced environment, Target is a great company to work for"
good,"I was only there for a short time, but the management was good and the pay was very worth it."
good,"A typical day included a hard work unloading trucks, nice management and freindly coworkers"
good,"typical day of work your doing the same thing what you did the last time and i learned how to use the pallet jack, how to assemble a bike, how to work the recycle box bin. the management it was nice but when they get pressured by the store manager they blame us for not doing our job right and keep telling us that we work to slow."
good,"I would start my day by making sure our cake display was full, from there I had to work on the special cake orders that we had for that day, what I learn was different ways to ice a cake, how to save time and still make cakes look beautiful. It was fun working with my co-workers we all were on a different group age, so we would learn from each other. I really enjoy working for target I loved seeing the customers face when we gave them their cake specially the kids."
good,"Target has good intentions, but lacks the consistant communication skills it needs to keep the team members motivated. Ex.: Some TM aren't as confident as to what their actually role is. When given direction, they don't feel as confident to ask for more information when the direction is unclear to them."
good,"Typically dealing with hundreds of customers per day, with the goal being to get them in and out of the store with a smile. I learned to work well under pressure and handle situations efficiently within a short period of time. Management were not so flexible with advancements, coworkers were very nice and encouraged each other. Hardest part of the job was long hours on your feet with few breaks, all whilst keeping a smile. The most enjoyable part was the customers, they were interesting to talk to and always very appreciative when you helped them. The regular customers who got to know and recognize you were the best."
good,I love working at Target. From the first step you take in the building there's this general feel of happiness in the store. The management team is superb and they take your feelings into consideration. the understanding the exude is phenomenal.
good,"I've worked for Target for almost 2 years, & I've learned so much while working for Target -- Exellent customer service is a must. Never a slow day."
good,Its a great company to work for if you are a teenager. The managers are great. But the pay isnt. There are no benefits.
good,"I worked with this company for a long time. Typical day in HR team member (HR TM) was checking email to see what tasks were left from the closing or opening HR TM. I was in charge of new hire paper work, training and compliance reports, scheduling, and entering in sick pay or vaction. My typical day would be checking Job Application System (JAS) and reviewing all employment applications sent that day and submitting them to the proper steps in keeping them as potential or turndown. Assisting the staffing and development manager in setting up interview or orientation, maintianing and updating JAS. During the Mid week I would help the HR manager in schedule edit; making sure we don't go pass our forecast hours for that week.I also manage the phones lines because I was the telephone operator of the store. My other task were basic filing, entering in pay or sick vaction, tracking training and labor compliance report. Target is a terrific corperation to work for the benefits working there gave me better oppertunities to work else where and exceed, Favorite part of my job would be using my creativity for all our moral events and the fact that my managers gave me full responsibility and control in coordinating our charity events like :"
good,"I worked there for a year and a half. I liked the people I worked with. I didn't mind the job, but I didn't want to remain there forever."
good,I enjoyed working at Super Target. It was fast paced and it was nice how it was such a variety of people working there.
good,"When I first started target it was amazing and fun, because of the hours I was getting and how energized I was working there. The down side I of working at target would be the hours, because no one is full-time. There is always lack of hours and communication when it comes to their employees, since it’s a small store. Going into target you will gain hours and you will lose hours, if you are looking for a full time job, this store isn’t it."
good,"Good job many opportunists to make money. Easy to help costumers find what they need with the target app, it is very useful for the employees and I am sure the costumers don't mind."
good,"Target is a great place to work, although they get really mad at you when you need personal time off and or get sick. If you have health issue I recommend not working at a target"
good,Working here was cool. Only thing that was wrong was the fact that you have to be cool with your managers as I just wasn’t. They are very flexible with schedules and calling in/off
good,Loading trucks using equipment to do the work on time. Pallets loaded to trucks closing out trucks timely. Direct contact with supervisor. Open to new ideals of how to get the work  done faster and accurately.
good,"Working at target is not as bad as you think , but lately my store have change leaders and the store is going to some changes . For the Christmas instead of hiring more people they gave twice the hour which is not bad but is too much work to be scheduled 6-6"
good,"Great time working at target. Kids start off at $12 or $11 an hour. You get a 15 min break every 2 hours if you reach/exceed 6 hours. And on the 6th Is a 30. Very proper rules, just fairly strict. A lot of walking, obviously. But may be worse for you if your department is hardline. Causing you to walk back and forth across the building from time-to-time. But Overall, great place."
good,The work environment was reasonable to deal with because of the coworkers' pleasant attitudes. Work at times would be difficult due to some of the workers quitting and forcing the workload to be distributed amongst those who are left.
good,The job was wonderful until they started cutting hours but It was an easy job. Everyone was friendly and not a lot of drama was there. It’s decent there.
good,"The job was fun, i enjoyed the work especially when i was working with others. The management was always there to help if needed and everyone did their fair share so it didn't feel like all the work fell on one person. The work was simple mainly loading and unloading pallets of food and stocking the shelves. All and all good job"
good,"It's a very good job to have, they work well with the hours you want. As well the management is very nice and makes you fit right in right away. The plus side is getting a 15 minute break and a 30 minute lunch break!"
good,Target offers many great perks for employees including tuition reimbursement which is a big plus for students that have to work and attend school. They offer flexible schedule opportunities. There is a great opportunity to promote to higher positions and a lot of room for growth as long as you're willing to learn.
good,"Target in Marlton New Jersey has the potential to be a great job, but lacks this potential because of the Management. While some Team Leaders and LODs are actively fixing issues, some complain about daily struggles far to often and waste time discussing irrelevant topics, while pallets of products remain on the Sales Floor. The employees at  this Target are wonderful and actively help guests while managing the stressful environment of a poorly organized district. This still however is a great Company and Organization to work for, as they provide a great salary, benefits, time-off, and much more."
good,"There were a few hours to work, too many people being hired, and the employees and some of the team leaders were impolite and working in the back room with no Air Conditioner"
good,come to work at 5:45 pm start work at 6 stretches to make sure no one gets hurt go over the workload for the night then pick your assignment for the night and work till 6am
good,It was a safe and convenient place to work. I would recommend someone who needs customer service skills or parents. Target have really great benefits that could really help support young parents and single mothers or fathers.
good,"I worked at Target for 3 years. There’s multiple job assignments in all departments with different levels of difficulty especially if they’re understaffed. 10 or 12 hour shifts. 10 hr Mon-Thurs 6a to 4p or 4p to 2a. 12 hr Sat-Mon 6a to 6p or 6p to 6a. Ability to flex down (schedule off) or flex up (OT) call in line tells you daily schedule. They also offer VLE (voluntary leave) can back fill with vacation hours if you chose one of the schedule off days or VLE. Very tough job but good pay, patient management if you’re an established employee when it comes to health/family. I say tough b/c  2 surgeries knee/shoulder. Only a job for healthy/ very determined individuals."
good,I worked at target I was a seasonal electronics team memeber I was nervous for doing retail for the first time. I learned a lot. I believe if they explain and show you how to do stuff the way your supposed to it’s easier to learn. The cash register was pretty easy. You get a 15 minute break a 30 minute break and another 15 if you work a 7/8 hr shift
good,"I worked at Target for just over a year. Good pay and nice employee discounts. Work is very fast paced, and the scheduling is not very flexible. I was scheduled during some of my college classes, as a matter of fact, and I had to call out for that reason. Other than the not-so-flexible scheduling, I only have good things to say about this job."
good,"Fun eneviroment to work in. Can be loud at time. Your get to meet new people often, and sometimes the hours can be really long. During my time there, I worked the registers as well as guest servicde"
good,"Working at Target was a great experience. Very friendly Coworkers, Great team to be apart of. Learned some new skills. Had a lot of fun working for them."
good,My experience was a little bit different because I was completely new to the supply chain industry and had to re-teach myself everything I learned from college. Their training was very thorough and provided lots of opportunities for shadowing/asking questions and gaining knowledge and experience to do the daily tasks. The easiest part of the job was to get along with everyone because they're all very welcoming and down to earth. The hardest part of the job was to determine ways of impact for your businesses and how to explain that to others.
good,It was a good place to grow and hone skills. Most of the management was amazing to work for and understood life and work balance. The hardest place of the job for me was slow and non-busy times and trying to find tasks to stay busy.
good,"Working at target was a big learning thing for me. It was my very first job , so i wanted to be good at everything. But as time went on customers was so demanding, but i got the swing of it"
good,"A Nice place, a lot of younger people now. Work for by fast with all the great people you meet. Managers even give out prizes for the best employee of the day."
good,Working at Target teaches you how to manage difficult situations. You will gain a lot of patience by the guests that you handle on a day to day basis. The team as a whole will treat you like family. It is honestly the best job to have as a beginner in the workplace. You can join Target knowing absolutely nothing and leave with a lot of experience. The management team are very kind and friendly.
good,Fast pace and in your face. Target was a great place for a first timer in the work field to learn the skill set to advance and fine tune their intellect to handle problem solving and develop character.
good,I honestly hold no opinion on the work placement at Target. The team members were great people and were really kind to one another as well as their customers.
good,target was ok the pay could have been better but it was a job th managers were very understanding at times but i liked it overall it was a chill layed back work place....
good,"During the week it is very slow, and you're kinda just there. During slow times i like to fix the area around me and zone the checklanes to make sure closing goes smoother and faster on the cashiers duties. During the holidays it is very busy and very fast paced but it is more fun and times goes by faster. the hours are very little but you can always pick up shifts, the people who supervise the cashiers are really cool and nice and don't hesitate to help. Sometimes though when all the cashiers are done fixing the front they send them off into other areas like softlines and sometimes leave very late when the store usually closes at 11pm."
good,Worked as a distribution operations supervisor. Competitive compensation and benefits. Enjoyed the leadership development experience and building culture. Hardest part was shift hours.
good,Worked in shipping loading semis by hand and forklift also worked in Stocking Department stocking product by forklift and pallet rider also picked orders for stores using order picker
good,"Great place to gain customer service experience by helpin out guests, fun and exciting with friendly team members. The management is excellent and help you achieve your goals within the company."
good,Working over night was very cool and laid back. Even when  interacting with the customers was nice as well. Drama free work place.  Communication could have been better.
good,"I enjoyed working at Target because of the friendly team atmosphere and the emphasis on customer service.  The pay isn't great but several employees who had worked multiple years at Target had gained many promotions.  In addition to the opportunities for advancement, Target offers an array of benefits and perks.  Unfortunately most of the positions are part time- which may seem attractive to students and employees with other jobs- excluding the potential for maximum benefits."
good,"The main reason why my review is as it is due to my position. While Target CAN BE a great place to work for most of the people there. The fulfillment department is extremely challenging. It has daily deadlines, and the goals for achieving green status on picking on time and accuracies are extremely high. The 1 to 2pm hour every day is extremely stressful. "
good,"A typical day at work for me is to come in start pushing carts in for like an hour, then we do bathroom check ups which is were we clean up spills and  papers and what not off the floor. Then we do trash and take care of hangers from the front end of the store over by the cashiers and then we go back to pushing carts and help with additional back up at the cashier,"
good,An okay job for anyone familiar with stock/merchandising experience. Here you'll learn how to use store-wide catalogue systems and store layouts. Decent management. Friendly and helpful co-workers. Hardest part of the job was Occasional heavy lifting. Most enjoyable part of the job was little to no micromanaging.
good,when I started work for target it was great but over the year it was making me unhappy and it got harder and the management was changing and people was leaving because of it
good,"As far as first jobs go, I would strongly recommend Target. That's it though, entry level jobs are supposed to be temporary. In the back room, it is just mind numbing work with no real goal or feeling of accomplishment. Just clock out and get ready to do it all over again the next time."
good,"I learned a lot at target, there's a lot of opportunity to succeed in the company, with many different position that you may cross  trained in order  to help out. it does get really busy on the holidays, and weekends, the company over all is great, but the people working there is what makes it a bit challenging to love working there."
good,"Great first job to pick up introductory skills and training. Great people to work with, great culture. Advancement and growth opportunities aren't great."
good,"High workload and very demanding job. A lot of stress is put on the body and being in great shape is a must to be able to keep up with the demand. People are great and benefits are too. Bosses try and encourage instead of beating you down, but they do expect alot out of you. As long as you work as hard as you can they will work with you."
good,"Honestly, the work-place culture is very rigorous, as Target has a structured system where workers below management face a burden with sales associates at the very bottom. The job as a cashier can be quite stressful, as management will keep pushing you and threatening you in losing your job if you don't sell a certain number of red cards per week. But aside from that, Target will work with you on flexibility of schedule, and the pay is usually above minimum wage."
good,"Waco Greatland Target is noted for being very flexible with student schedules.  They have some pretty good benefits as well, for instance tuition reimbursement if you're majoring in their line of work.  The work is not mentally difficult but can be very physically taxing from Back-to-School thru the end of December.  Management team is very stable with decades of experience each so you will have no worries working under anyone that doesn't know what they're doing. They're very efficient."
good,"The hardest part about working overnight stock at target was staying awake because you worked from 11pm - 7am. This job was okay but i needed something better because although the pay was $10.50/hr, it was only a part time job."
good,you learn the difference between target and walmart just by working there and you realize that just because their clothing items are not as cheap as walmart because they have better quality.
good,Hours become very scarce when the holidays have past . The managers are pretty easy to get along with . They don't hound you but they also make sure that work is done
good,"Target has many opportunities although its like many other places you have good and bad things. Your training depends on the type of supervisor you have, the area you are working in, etc. I had a great General Manager who cared about His employees. I had an okay supervisor who just threw you to the wind and expected you to get what you needed. Luckily I was a self starter and picked things up quickly. Each store is different, each team is different. They do alot of team building. There is always something to do, and something to learn. I enjoyed my time there. I still keep in contact with all of my old colleagues as well. If you don't like interacting with people on a constant basis in all aspects of your job, from stocking, guest service, cashier, down then this is not the place to work. Because everybody is hands on at Target."
good,Great first job to learn sales and logistics.Management depending on the store could be great or not great.Great job to learn to communicate and help customers.
good,I've heard stories of people working at other Target stores & they weren't good. That wasn't the case for me. Everyone was nice for the most part. My main issue with Target is the fact that they rarely keep people past the probational period. It's definitely worth the experience though.
good,Nothing interesting about it. It wasnt fun or anything but the people were nice and managers worked well with us. Aside from the ocasional bad customer experience it wasnt too bad.
good,Target is a friendly job community. It's very clean and organized. Team Leaders are very interactive and very helpful. They keep target organized and in control
good,My experience at Target was very open and always had a new task to keep me working and motivated me from being trained in the food department to being cross trained to work at Starbucks and handle cashier duty when asked on the job site to volunteer
good,"I had the best time working at Target. I learned allot of how the retail business works on a daily basis, how to please customers, making sure shelves are stocked. Made allot of great friends, I had the BEST supervisor EVER.."
good,"Working for Target is like any other job. The store that I work at stays busy and the time goes fast. Target have customers, who are very kind, whereas; Target have customers, who you cannot please. Overall, it depends on each employee performance, productivity, and being aware of how the store is operating."
good,"I did not work there for long as I was only a seasonal worker. The time I did have there though was fine. The people were nice and things ran smoothly. The only issue I had was with the red cards. Cashiers are required to push target red cards, and if we are unable to sign up at least two people a week we are scolded for it as if we are not trying hard enough. Also, we have to tell people about the surveys on the receipt and if people don't take it, it looks like we are not telling them about it."
good,"Lot of work still needs to be done, but great culture and colleagues, depends on your group."
good,I enjoy work with people and help them to meet their needs. My job gives me an opportunity to work with a diverse variety of clients and coworkers. Find it rewarding to help coworkers to prepare for a new job position as well as help clients to find a product that  brings them satisfaction.
good,"great atomasphere,,great community  of people,,fair beneafits an equal opportunity to grow with company,flexible work hours,very great company to gain an sustain employment"
good,"on a day to day basis work would be smooth most busiest during special events i learned how to get more involved with the guest and how to properly assist someone when  in need. i work with a diverse  group of people and very friendly. to be very truthful there wasnt a hard part about my job, it actually was easy because it was well explained before i started working there. the most enjoyable part about that job was the fact that the guest could make me laugh and i could do the same for them and how all my co-workers were like my second family."
good,The money was good but some of the people I worked with were not. There a few people I liked working with but most of the bosses weren't good to work with.
good,working at target can be stressful very stressful. and sometimes you work harder than your employees. depending if your managers like you then your safe on your job but if they don't they will get you out asap anyway possible
good,productive and fun workplace environment. I learned what it was like to do price changes. I also worked very well as a team with my co workers on a daily bases.
good,It was a great job but need to offer more compensation for all of the work you are required plus doing other employee work.
good,"A typical day at work there was very easy, too easy. Its a laid back environment and everyone is nice. Management is amazing and they are great to employees. one con is that it is a low paying job without any intention of raises. when applying i was promised more hours than i actually ever got scheduled which was frustrating."
good,Fast pace environment with a focus on customer service. This position pushed employees to exceed the needs of customers and provide fast and friendly service at all times. Job duties included answering telephone calls from customers and vendors and routing calls to appropriate personnel and departments. I was also in charge of monitoring fitting room usage to promoting customer service and the reduction of shoplifting.
good,This Job is a job that you have to have to want to do. It is very good for someone that loves to work with people ans has the drive and passion for work. I would not recommended this job to someone that is looking to work a lot of hours because at the location i worked it was very inconsistent. The work environment is very busy around 5 pm aand aslo on the weekends
good,"I was a cashier and greeter while working at Target. I also travel to work I live in the Bronx, however work in Mount Vernon."
good,"easy going job, lots to do"
good,"Work, Work, Work, as a floor team associate you are always moving."
good,"I would come clock in, grab a walky let the team know i was there and ask where i needed to go, they would tell me and id go grab a cart and start zoning my areas until i was needed somewhere else. Management was alright some of them were rude and showed favoritism. Some of my co workers were the same as management a lot of them were stuck up. i just stayed to myself. The hardest part i would have to say is zoning an area and never having enough time to get it done or working reshop and not knowing where anything goes. The best part i was by myself and could organize they way i liked."
good,very busy place you have a lot of people that ask question and that need help i love working here i handling money from people
good,"Assisted customers with expedited check-out process for purchases."
good,the long lines in guest service the rude customers that always fussed about sales items and pricing .also the rude co workers that wouldn't helped look up item  most likely helping the elderly with finding item in store . but helping customers with  returns
good,"Handled many credit, checks, and cash transactions, provided great customer service, assisted customers  with their merchandise selections and how to locate items they needed."
good,Working at Target was a great experience working in retail. I worked in restaurant for more than 5 years and it was great to experience something different. The team member were great to work with
good,"Fast pace work enviroment (Logistics, Operations)"
good,"travaille actuellement aux target, le travail ne était pas très difficile. très simple et parfois amusant. employés sont amusantes à se entendre avec les faits tant d'amis. la gestion a joué un rôle énorme à laquelle il ne était pas très amusant. très désagréable, irrespectueux patrons que je ai jamais rencontrées."
good,Great pay and benefits. Lots of room for growth. Not great work life balance. For those that only want to work in store operations for the length of their Target career.
good,This company is a great place if you're just starting out. Everyone is very hardworking and management tries their hardest to work with your schedule. Being able to help people find what they need is probably the best part of this job.
good,One thing that I can say about Target stores and ive work at several locations they really do value they're employees just as well as they're customers.
good,"At typical day here required me to interact with many customers, whether it was answering questions, or selling an item. i also was a cashier in which i handled cash and helped customers check-out their merchandise. Fitting room duties, and recovering the sales floor was also apart of my daily routine. Management was very helpful and my co workers were very dedicated to their job as myself. The hardest part was keeping up with the department when there were a large amount of customers at once. However, the most enjoyable part was helping and interacting with new people everyday."
good,"The days starts with showing the manager your identity to get in, with your red card, then go to dock and unload the truck to unload then pile the boxes in their area. After unloading, the products are put in their isles and areas belonging, with a short meeting inbetween loads. "
good,it is  a great place to  work at   friendly  people   and  employees  you can  help  a lot  of people  look for  stuff  they want to  buy
good,Nothing short of a great company and a great place to learn leadership and work life balance
good,My typical day was very productive and friendly. I was only worked for a season so I didn't get a chance to get the full effect of working there.
good,daily routine at Target would be to ensure the organization and cleanliness of the salesfloor while attending to every guests needs. helping with all cashier backups and operator duties. answering all phone calls the store received by helping the guest with any questions or locating of a product.
good,"I love my co-workers! Great Company to work for. I like what I do, and did i mention I love my co-workers. Really the only bright spot. Just being Honest."
good,"As a cashier , you make sure the customer feels like they made the right decision by shopping at target . The customer is always right , a typical day is ringing up merchandise , helping the custumer find anything they may need and to make sure the merchandise is clean and in order . I learned great customer service skills . Hardest part of my job is when the merchandise might not be in the system and takes time to find the price . Most enjoyable part of my job is working with others and helping the customers find what they need ."
good,"Tasks, workload, and goals are achieved by working together as an executive staff."
good,Fun fast paced friendly environment. Awesome discount and holiday bonus
good,"Acompanhamento e monitoramento das entregas."
good,"Good place to work if you don't eat the food all the time. Working with food all day, the people are great."
good,there was a great management always busy and a very fast passed work environment. They were very fun and exciting jobs.
good,Target is a great company especially if you want to get to the higher echelons of management. Good pay and good benefits.
good,Good company but not the best company unless your a manager or some sort. work and life balance wasn't so good you will be tired working this job but if you have a good team then you will be fine and you have to give your all to this job or else
good,"Using our data system to pull items for the sales floor.  "
good,"Target is a good place to shop, but working is too complicated, because the employees are not given enough time to re-fold and straighten up and then they wonder why the store looks like a thrift store.... but it needs more employees anyway."
good,"A typical day at work includes interacting with Guests , Folding clothes , and promoting Target Red Cards. I have learned the way that Target Operates , What is expected of you , and how to interact with others . Management is very helpful , and lets you know their expectations for your positions . My co- workers are very helpful , understanding , and friendly. The hardest part of this job is learning a new department such as Hardlines . The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to interact with others , and making the store look very presentable."
good,"Target seemed like a extremely friendly place going into as a new employee but I found was a lot of talk and no show. They try to give you food, to sound rewarding, and to be friendly but fall short. I was informed that they have WII competitions, help out with society, and try to reward for excellent behavior. The rewards are for cashiers who get Target guest to get ""red cards"". Ultimately they have a quota that has to be filled and so every card counts as a profit so to speak and wish to encourage for more advertisements. At first many employees talk to you as in ""Hi, how are you?"" but as you are there more than 2 days they ignore you and keep walking to the break room or even to their section of the floor. If you do not work in their ""world"" or part of the store then why are you talking to me is the attitude given off by employee to employee. I recently injured myself and they have been more than understanding for the situation and they also thoroughly explain your training to make sure you understand every aspect of your job. Over all Target has ups and downs but I would recommend someone to this job if they are a social butterfly, extremely hard working, and don't expect much praise."
good,One of the female managers is a complete moron who doesn't know how to manage a store to save her life. She play favorites among her workers and try to make others feel like they aren't doing their job fast enough or correct. The rest of the management are very back and forth about what they want accomplish for the day. If you are a drug user no worries you can get away with smoking your pot on near the store. Workplace bullying and disregard for other people are also present. If you are in the need of the pay and have a high tolerance for these actions then go ahead and apply. The pay rate is good for this type of job and the tasks are simple to do.
good,The paid is good...and the hours are good for wanting to go to school
good,"A typical day at work consists of making schedule edits, inventory managment, and team building. I have learned more about coaching my team effectively and leading by example. My immediate manager helps out in anyway that she can, providing both constructive critism and praising feedback. The hardest part of my job is dealing with conflicting personalities within my team and trying to make the most of it. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking to my customers."
good,"working at this company was very greatful for me i was able to get an understand on the job and get learning skills as well. A typical day at work is very relax nice customers and lovely employees, My management is was nice and understanding to they employees as well. The hardest part or the job, there wasnt a hard part of a day because a job is a job and its not easy, I enjoyed working at my job and the best part about it was that i was able to work well."
good,My typical day at work was basicly punching in and going to the sales floor and starting a sale... greeting the customer with benefits of making them have a great day and inquiring to them about the sales. I learned alot that the corrpret world in sales is no joke but i even like it because it makes the time fly and you injoy helping and saleing the merchandise to your customers. management was great n my co workers wher fabulous we all worked together as a team always. the most enjoyable part of the job was that i was able to work side by side with some of the managers and learn new technics in how to sell merchandise that any customer was instrested in. the hardes part of it all was that i had to leave because i had been their for a average of 6months and they had promisted a raise and with all the hard work and smart enfferts i put in they where not giving anyone any raises.
good,Really enjoyed my job and the great guest service I was able to provide as well as the friends I made with the guest and fellow team members. Very flexible with scheduling requests and time off as well as family time. Very diverse place to work and nobody is treated differently as far as being equal.
good,"Worked here while I was in high school and some of my college life. They will accomadate your school schedule and they have full and part time positions avaliable. During the holidays they prefer you to work 30 to 40 hours. There is no overtime so your end shift is your end shift and if your under 40 hours there is sometimes shifts to be filled in other areas when the store is busy, Pay is under 10 excluding lead and exec postions. Benefits arent the best nor worse."
good,a typical day at work is helping guest as they come in to find what they are looking for in a timely manner.
good,First we'd have to get the truck unloaded which typically took us 2 hours. After that we would have to start stocking which was easy due to the large amount of staff members.
good,"Working in the Photo Lab has been one of the best experiences I have had. Not only did I enjoy my job, but I was able to work with amazing people who have become close friends. Through my department I was able to cultivate lasting relationships with customers who treated me like family. The most enjoyable part by far was meeting new people and hearing their stories of family, life, and love all while taking me on a visual tour with their personal photos."
good,I enjoy working at Target. Management could be better but not the worst I ever exprienced. The hardest part of the job is that it takes a while for you to accumulate vaction hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is how flexible they are with your schedule.
good,It was not busy to many tasks at once. Co-workers were bossy and rude.
good,Learned how to locate items fast and efficient for customers using electronic device. Very helpful co-workers. Typical day at work was just walking the floor making sure there were no items out of place and clothing areas were neatly organized. There was really no hard part of the job. Very enjoyable part was interacting with customer face to face helping them locate items throughout the store.
good,"It was a really good place to work for, however, my passion belongs with the healthcare profession."
good,A typical day at work was staying busy which made time go by very quickly.
good,Great management
good,"This a great place for first time workers, high schoolers and college students. It's fun not over whelming and you still have time for fun after work."
good,Try it for seasonal learn as much as you can. You also get to meet different people customers and employees alike. Try moving around in different departments as well to learn a little of everything.
good,"At this particular store, I would have to ask 5 different managers to raise my hours before it would only get raised for one or two weeks.. then it would go back to me having no hours. I followed up many times and never got an answer back or they would give me 'false promises' of giving me hours which never happened."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and being able to think on your feet."
good,"I think they’re a great company would love to work for them again "
good,"Having 5 to 7 different managers (one per day) can be very frustrating/confusing as each of them have different standards and ways of doing things while other say you can make your own schedule of what you do during your shift as long as you get everything you have to get done, finished before you have to clock out."
good,Good job for people who like customer  service and  working at their own pace . The pay is fair for the amount of work given . Overall rewarding job . I felt appreciated.
good,"This place was wacky, I didn't really feel connected to any of the other people that worked there I kinda felt like I was just on to do my own thing. I was only buddies with two of the cart attendants I worked with. I learned that you gotta do what you gotta do to meet deadlines when I was at this job. The culture is family influenced, so you will see mothers with their children every day, sometimes they get loud. The most enjoyable part of the job was the pizza hut that was downstairs, plus i got a discount."
good,The management was great my hours were only maybe 14 a week if even that because i was seasonal but everyone was nice and welcoming and the job was very easy and self explanatory.
good,"The work is very hard at times & the pay is very low.  Lots of employees seem to be unhappy.  However, for part time work its great. "
good,"Everyday my location would be packed with customers"
good,"I love working at target it was my first official job as someone in a wheelchair. The coworker are great love it. I came in with a set schedule I was giving that for three years almost four.  I  really like working with electronics team, the pace is not to fast. For a person in a wheelchair it's perfect because nothing is to high or to low."
good,Target is a great place to work. Have to have a good personality and attitude when dealing with customers. Your co-workers are usually nice and want to help out as much as possible and also the managers
good,I enjoyed the 18 and half years I was there. I worked 3 different and every position you could possibly name. Fast fun and friendly is always the goal. My work family was  like my family.
good,Target is a very calm collected workplace. You don't really have to  be rushed or worry about somebody always on you 24/7 but you must try to get the work done and make it very presentable. The management is very laid back but also very stern and how they want they're work done and how they want things to be. Target has its kinks but its an ok place to work.
good,The company has put an emphasis on customer service and has taken away payroll hours from logistics processes to accommodate this. This has created an impossible work environment for any operational or logistics teams. The work load has increased and become more complicated for the logistics process but payroll and resources have been taken away to give to the sales floor teams.
good,it was a good job for when i was on summer break. good hours and pay. It was just hard for me to balance that with a couple emergencies that happened.
good,"fast past call center ,team inviroment t very culture team work ethnics. hands on training 60 calls  or more must have customer skills in verbal speaking"
good,"The environment and the people you work with make the long hours just as easy. The company is excellent to work for with great pay and benefits. I would recommend this work place based on the benefits and excellent pay,"
good,Working the busiest hours gave me the necessary experience to be competitive in sales. This work was more so focused on a positive experience for every guest shopping.
good,very open minded place to work all of the other employees are friendly and willing to help coworkers.Mangers are also willing to listen and try to help you with issues and achieve goals. I also enjoy that the company allows you to cross train as well has having everyone be register trained. My only issue was that I don't feel pay was enough and hours were often cut.
good,Great place to work flexible hours and the management team is great. However the pay is not all that great. Staff is friendly and makes for a great work environment.
good,"Great place to work at and really build on customer service skills. Moved up quickly to management, did great in sales. Won several awards for outstanding sales performance. Managed a team and set goals. Made schedules for team weekly. Full time employee."
good,"It was a decent job that got me by. Could've made a little more money but it was okay with the hours I received. I was a picker, and I did so in a timely efficient matter."
good,Well we always have a certain plan to reach at every meeting they will let you know the plan. Our goal is to reach that plan very fast pace always work to be done.
good,"I loved working for target, i loved all of my co workers and regular customers. but i do get sick a lot, and at target you have a 90 day probation period and i missed 3 days due to having bronchitis ( i also had a doctors note) and the floor manager Emily said she sent my sick days to HR and it would result in a termination on my 90 days so i decided to quit and continue to focus on college."
good,"Target is a great place to work if you are looking for a job that is going to introduce you to the retail world. If you are looking for a place to learn, this is the place."
good,So much to offer from job advancements and promotions to those who are willing to go above and beyond. Great health care benefits paid vacation when you have enough hours
good,"The one I work at is not the greatest and things are going downhill, but I have worked for Target in another state and it was great. So I can't speak for every single target. But I would recommend Target in a heartbeat."
good,Target Distribution center involved working long hours. The shifts are 10 to 12 hours either day shifts or night shifts. The management does a good job at making sure the employees are safe and productive. It was a fun work environment. There I learned a lot of skills when it comes to communication. Communication is key when working on an assembly line when errors occur.
good,Busy during season but overall a fun place to work. Management is great and coworkers are friendly. Great employee discount and health benefits are so so.
good,I loved working here. Everyone worked great as a team. Management was very organized. I was a cashier at the target I worked at and I had a blast ddoin so.
good,"Had to start by opening draws up every morning.statred out as a seasonal help and they kept me o. After a month working on registers they put me on service desk and i was there for the entire time i was working at target.Learned how to do returns/exchanges,how to look up stock,relieve lead cashiers on there breaks,which means i was in charge of watching lanes and getting cashiers whatever they needed"
good,"Bel environment"
good,I have worked for Target for two years prior to quitting. I enjoyed working there my only problem is that they wasn't giving me enough hours or they wanted me to come in when I was unable to. The work atmosphere overall was fast paced and you got a chance to work with people. The scariest part to me was when there was people coming into the store stealing and so at times the employees and customers would feel unsafe. I overall enjoyed working at Target.
good,The average day consisted of helping customers in any department they needed help in and filling my produce area up. I learned how to multitask in a hectic environment. The hardest part was when associates would call out of work and leave us short handed.
good,This job starts off slow the it gets really hectic in the end. Nights are really long and the demand off you coming in on a day off is even worse. But they pay pretty well so I guess that makes up for everything.
good,"Hard work and dedication will get you far with Target. Because Target first priority above all, while being a cashier, is to convince the guest to sign up for a Red Card, Guest Service will not be where it could be. But if you work hard, and show that you have the drive, Target will help you develop personally and professionally."
good,"Fast-paced workplace. Great team to work with and help you accomplish your job. Chances to move up in the company are available, but they expect too much from you for a minimum wage job."
good,this company in Canada was wonderful . it was definitely filled with employees that were FAST FUN and FRIENDLY ! the hardest part of the job was dealing with the guests during liquidation . other than that the store ran smoothly
good,"They required a lot from me and they were not very organized. "
good,If you looking for a hard working job with a low wage then Target is for you. But I wouldn't really work for them unless if it's a management position or higher.
good,I really enjoyed working here for the first couple months. When they hired me they told me I would be getting 35+ hours which is exactly what I needed. I got those the first couple months but then afterwards a lot of us were getting 10 hours! You can not survive off of 10 hours. Many of us were promised a certain amount of hours and still haven't gotten more after asking for more shifts.
good,"A typical day was pretty steady, just stayed on my register most of the time, I found it a little boring at times because I like to do a lot of different things. Their management could be better, always on different pages. Hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with all managers demands when they were all telling you different things to do. Most enjoyable part of the job was the friendly staff."
good,Very nice place to work enjoyed meeting new faces. Stock is a easy job I love doing detail work and stock was a job for me.
good,Wonderful customer and good co-workers and good company benefits
good,Typical day would include processing and filling over 300 prescriptions while also answering the phone.
good,"A typical day consist of anything. You must be ready for any and everything. Though very fast paced, it is a great place to learn the basics of business."
good,"I worked overnight unloading trucks and stocking the store. My co-workers and management were very sweet. The hardest part of my job was lifting heavy boxes,other than that I loved working at Target ."
good,"A typical work day is usually fast paced, professional but still fun."
good,Fast paced place. Must be a go getter. Great salary but the insurance was not great. Team environment.
good,"A typical day at target was alright. Nothing exciting. Basically my job was to make sure the Health, Beauty section was straight and neat. The hardest part about my job was to put back abandons. Sometimes I didn't know where things went and would have a difficult time finding it. My co-workers were rude and mean. That's why it didn't last that long."
good,"Working with this company was very fast and fun work place. The average day is very busy, your always doing a project down to sales floor and the management was very strict because it was so much stuff to do and they wanted to always but customers first. I enjoyed setting up different projects for employees."
good,a typical day at work is helping out customers and organizing items.
good,I honestly loved my entire experience working with Target there's nothing I can really complain about I just wish I could have stayed a while longer.
good,I enjoyed my Target employment I opened new stores and received great training in Human Resources. My role as Executive Team Leader of Sales was great advantage in next as
good,I had fun for awhile  while I was  there too bad it was seasonal position to work for at target. Working in the back rooms was cool until some people started to change as co-workers.
good,"Throughout my time working at target, the only thing I found frustrating was the customer service. I found, at numerous times, myself calling for confusion or an error about my job; and my calls never go through. The phone will ring for minutes and ill never get an answer. Multiple people claimed to call me and i am to this day still waiting for that call. But other than that, it was a good experience."
good,I used to check people out and really just help where I was needed . It was a really good experience overall I enjoyed working there and the people were really nice.
good,There is always room for advancement within the company. The benefits outweigh the sometimes difficult work environment (which is with most retail companies). Hard works pays off here and great relationships are made. It becomes a second home.
good,Help guests out at the floor when needed. Pull items from the shelves to the front. Go backs are to be sent back to location(s). Respond to requests from cashier when needed.
good,35 hours every 2 weeks. Pretty much gave hours to the favorite employees or known ones otherwise it’s a great company with great pay 11-12.00 an hour.
good,"It was great working for target, when it was seasonal. I learned on how to unload freight off a trailer, and separated from different departments, it was very tough during the holidays."
good,"Working on flow team, the day starts with a running pace. We start with unloading a DC trailer full of freight, which goal time should be about an hour. After this, we 'wave' through the isles as a team to stock up shelves from the boxes unloaded from the trailer. As for my store, the hours given to team members have ups and downs. After Christmas is where you might see a dip in hours. Overall, they truly do cater to team members at target and go the extra mile."
good,Target was actually great to me it was the first job I got when I moved here. The work isn't bad I always got my 40 hours plus more if I and also I enjoyed management and my coworkers. The only thing that sucks is the pay
good,"My experience working for Target.com was actually a great one. The only downfall for me was that I tried to apply to work for another department and my supervisor declined my request. At that point, I felt as if the only role that I'd have was the one that I was in. I have a degree in Criminal Justice and I applied to work in the fraud department. Being that I have my degree I felt that working in the fraud department would give me the opportunity to utilize my degree while learning and utilizing my investigative skills."
good,I liked target you got a 30 minute brake for lunch and two 15 minute brake that were paid for if you worked 8 hours I would work that daily. The only problem was i was in hillard and it was on olentagy river road and I had to take 3 cota busses I talked to the manager and he was very understanding the next day I came in and was fired.
good,"I loove Target. It was my first job. I advanced quickly. The hours were great for school. Depending on the store you're at HR is not very helpful when providing all the tools and knowledge you'll need to grow. Benefits aren't explained, making it difficult to choose a plan if you've never had health benefits. "
good,Management was pretty good. Training was key to the success i had at Target. I worked with some very talented individuals that really cared about the advancement of my career.
good,working at target is fun but no one can grow at target it is staying the same for ever . I want  to grow that is why iam looking for a new job to start a better life and better job.
good,"Interesting place to work.  A lot of good work going on, for a retail store.  Great group of people to work with, and are willing to support any ideas that will help their customers."
good,people were great to work with some supervisors had favorites and thats not good and they demand you to ask for red cards which is ridiculous.
good,"A typical day at Target was very eventful. I learned several different departments of the corporation. The management team really cared about their employees and made sure that we were comfortable. The hardest part about the position at Target was the day after Thanksgiving because there were a crowd of aggressive shoppers on that day, which made the day difficult but not unbearable. The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting customers."
good,I really enjoyed interacting with guest and helping them have a wonderful experience at my target location. I really enjoyed the environment because they were very accepting of everyone and their  uniqueness
good,Fun place to work during school with many advancement opportunities. Target takes care of it's employees and rewards them for their hard work as a team. Not always sympathetic of time conflicts and schedules but that's nothing uncommon.
good,I loved working at Target because I started at the store before it opened. But slowly all the original staff left or was fired and got replaced with terrible people who gave us no support and was completely fake. It was disappointing because I really did love that job until everyone left.
good,there is a routine from the start of the day to the end of your shift.  You are told what area you work in and you are required to balance your time in order for everything to get accomplished.
good,The overall job was fun and busy. The RedCards were kind of stressful because they wanted you to do a certain amount each day and most of the people who shopped there either already had one or they wasn't interested.
good,have to clock out for lunches but get some paid breaks. I like the management and the customers but I don't like selling red cards.
good,"Me considero um grande profissional, não coloco dificuldade em qualquer trabalho que me for colocado, sempre faço minhas tarefas dando o melhor de mim em tudo, busco respeitar meus superiores nunca passando por cima de meus superiores, tenho sempre iniciativa própria para o crescimento da empresa, procoro sempre me dispor dos meus colegas que de alguma maneira precisar de minha ajuda, não tenho dificuldade de aprendizado em qualquer função que me for designada e me sinto muito bem trabalhar com uma equipe compromissada e transparente para todos sem atropelar ninguém faça sucesso na empresa e com isso a empresa brilhar."
good,"A typical shift at work would be arriving at 4am and heading to the backroom to unload the merchandise from the truck for the day and sort it for the different departments in the store. Then bringing these items out to the store and stocking the shelves and returning any extra merchandise to the backroom for storage until needed. From target I've improved my spacial judgement, and learned how to think and act quickly when the situation demands it. Management has always been friendly and very fair about the amount of work we have to undertake. My co-workers come from all walks of life and are very easy to work with as well as provide insight on many different topics. The hardest part of the job is really just the extremely early hours required. The most enjoyable part of the job is the new connections i make with the people there."
good,Long hours but very worth it! The only thing I didn't like was standing all day on the cash register. I like to move around more!
good,Job was ok 👍 first job and was able to move up to a Guest Service Team Lead when I started out as a seasonal hire. Great work ethic and good work culture
good,It was very easy and well organized. Everybody was friendly and staff were helpful. The pay rate was much fair . Only problem I had was that I didn’t get a lot of hours.
good,Was a very fast paced environment on the sales floor but all in all it’s a very fun place to work at. My coworkers were all very respectful and very genuine. They give you a very nice start to your day
good,"it was a good place to work in but pay could of been better ,but beside that the environment was great , co workers were professional as possible ...."
good,You would come in to work and start your day very rushed. Day to day experiences vary due to extra work usually being stacked on top of daily routines. A lot of days I have left work with a very sweaty T-Shirt only to come in the next night and hear about how our team is not trying hard enough.
good,"Target is a great place to work, but the hours and type of work can be very strenuous and fast paced. Other than that, management is great and professional and compensation is fair."
good,I would recommend only if you’re going to school but they don’t offer full time I guess because they don’t want to give their employees benefits. Managers are nice
good,Very helpful  good with giving me work experience having great team members love my manger and very nice and clean working pace great with hours to help
good,"Fun place to work with all people respecting each other."
good,"I have 1 year working in target and I enjoy helping guest , communicating all the information that the customer needed. The team member in target are friendly like a family, everybody have the opportunity to growth in the company and we have different schedule every week, all member of target are eligible for Credit Union account and Direct deposit . Our store is a nice place to work."
good,I personally loved working at target. Great Employees with great customer skills and very helpful. I Highly recommend And encourage people too work for this company.
good,"Good place to work, long term, easy to pick up hours, good leadership, busy work environment, quick ways/ methods to learn new routines, constant changes for the better, etc.."
good,"*The days are mostly busy with a lot to do."
good,"A typical day at work involves the smooth operation of the building, performing corrective and preventative maintenance, following up with any 3rd party contractors for existing work orders, report housekeeping concerns to the manager on duty  as well as housekeeping crew and communicate to the team topics of concern and give an update on health and safety concerns and work on schedule in the building."
good,Iam a hard work I was never late to work I never called out and this how they treat people. When I got hurt I still work and didn't call out. Overall it's a great place to work. I got four kids. I wish things could have been better.and I would go back to work there if I had a chance.
good,"Have casual conversations with the guest"
good,everyday was hard and I learned to work a cash register. the hardest part of the job was trying to move fast and get everyone in and out. the most enjoyable part was meeting new people  
good,For the most part I enjoyed working for Target. The only thing I did not like was they asked for a lot and gave very little pay. Sometimes I felt taken advantage of and felt used.
good,"I loved working for target, due to school issues, I had to exterminate my position there as a team member."
good,"Target was a good place to work at. But after a week or two of work, the hours went super down. Barely worked and at one point I quit because they never gave out good hours."
good,"Management is great, co-workers good... but job is just soooooo boring... I have worked retail before, but this job was just extra boring for some reason."
good,A typical day at Target was always fun although dealing with difficult customers is no one's favorite thing employees were always their to keep a smile on your face and keep you going throughout your work day and realize with one bad customer a thousand positive one's will come by. I learned a lot with the company as long as you're yourself people will appreciate who you are and you don't have to pretend to be someone along with realizing that holding a cashier position is actually a lot of fun. Coworkers at the location I worked at are amazing majority are withing my age range so getting along with them was fun because we were able to be who we are along with our front bosses who always kept us going and made the work environment just as fun cracking jokes with us along with customers having them realize you can have fun at work but also be professional  while doing your job. The hardest part about this job is finding where things are along with your boss because there's so much going on it becomes a hassle to juggle everything and it becomes stressful; although the most enjoyable part of the job is being around the coworkers because they all have their own sense of humor and your able to blend in with one another and find something new and different in someone.
good,To make sure that we get the truck unloaded and backstocked at a timely fashion.
good,I love workin over night at target it was fun while workin upset when i was laid off
good,"A typical work day for me would be to come in an start on the assembly line, stack pallets, and put the shipment out on the floor."
good,"VANGENT was very productive during its peak season. For a temporary, seasonal position I learned a lot more on computers. Potlucks are the most enjoyable  pay is great for customer service and friendly people over all."
good,"Get keys open door to snack bar, warm up all appliances, start warming food that need long cooking, for closing turn off all appliances, clean all utensils, clean all counter areas, tables and stock all foods and drinks"
good,Making sure my station was clean and organized. Getting carts from outside and making sure every customer left with what they wanted or needed.
good,"it is fun,i learned a lot at target.my co-workers are so good and helpful,i love target,"
good,The managers treated their employees like they were stupid. Always talking behind their backs on the radios. Never helped their employees. Everyone was caddy. The store manager and HR refused to change people’s availability or accept any of the changes made to their availability. I went on maternity leave and came back and I submitted my availability 3 times. And was never approved. They don’t pay attention to their Military members drill schedules.
good,"Very stressful to work in, You are put under pressure with poorly behaving managers. I do not recommend at all. They are known to have new hires and mysteriously never showing up ever again."
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work, I enjoyed trying to reach my goal each day with credit cards.  It was alright. Managment was a bit tough but other than that it was good"
good,cashing the guest out making sure they had everything the needed. I learn to smile more . the management was ok not the best. it wasn't the hardest I knew what I was doing. I enjoy seeing the guest come and leave with a smile
good,"I can’t speak for all target, but the target In flushing New York, store 2451. Its all about a  click. If your not in the click, mangers,  supervisors  and team member will make your life Unbearable"
good,"Normal day at target starts with clocking in at 4am. Then grab a PDA(handheld computer). Head to what area the boss sends me to on the day. I’m trained in many areas so when people don’t show for their shift I fill in for a while till my work centers work load has piled up. When I get to electronics(my main workcenter) there are several things to be done, case stock that are big boxes large items that go on the shelves, then DVD’s/CD repacks, next I would go to the fright repacks(smaller accessories items). About the time I get one of these done, the truck has been unloaded and I’m able to get my security cage. This contains on any given day 3 to 8 repacks from $50,000 to $1mill dollars in merchandise. I check off every item make sure it’s in the right repack, also push to all lock up cases and secure peg hooks. This is about 8am and I take my 15 min break( if the whole doesn’t get send out the door). When I come back there are 2 more repack carts to do and most of the time DVD/CD repacks. If I finish before my 6 hours are up and we didn’t get sent home, I always go an help other areas around the store. For example toys/ sporting goods area, or even back stocking in the backroom."
good,"look a job and look more experience works and works on overnight stock on the aisle and put items on the shelf and Duty Assistant to check items on the shelf,"
good,"Typacally it was a good job. I loved the fact that I was helping folks find daily needs whether it was for their home, a personal item or something for a friend or loved one. The pay absolutely sucked for the amount of work that was required. Way too many mangers if ask me. But all in all it's a pretty decent job."
good,"While working here for a short time (seasonal) I developed my first ""customer service"" skills.  While the work was tedious and sometimes difficult ( working in the outdoor garden) I felt energized by helping customers with there home and garden needs."
good,"Management are a group that is near impossible to become part of, and very exclusive of others.  Team Leaders (Managers) are inappropriate much of the time, and are never concerned about Team Members, only the bottom line and monthly/weekly analytics.  Target as a whole is a great company and I believe there are people (either in executive level or occasionally at store level) that do follow the priorities Target aims for, but not the majority.  Speaking as a Human Resources Manager, Target would improve if it offered higher wages for team members, additional budget for staffing, especially sales floor, and reign in the autonomy of each team leader in paths to success in each department to follow the mission/vision that Target laid down."
good,"Company hires for certain hours, then reschedules. No advancement. Hours cut frequently. Never enough help on hand. Job description for the day changed last minute all the time."
good,"Must be a hard worker, productive, and accustomed to working in a fast paced environment."
good,"Truthfully it was not the worst place in the world to work, however, the Lexington SC target is the worst target I have EVER been to. The management was terrible, the hours are terrible except in the holiday season. The HR was two faced, spread rumors and other peoples business. Most of the higher ups don't care about the workers, only the fact that your getting your job done in a timely manner despite how busy the store is. When there is complications with other team members they always pick favorites and even when they say they are working on the issue they really just blow it off. If the higher ups in this target weren't terrible it would have been a great place to work. I learned most of the essential retail etiquette and generally liked helping the guests that came in the store. I also learned how to work in almost all of the areas of the store however even when officially I was trained for other areas, I never received the raises you're supposed to."
good,"Target was a good work environment. The management and managers weren't so good. For example, one day we had no front end manager and no manager wanted to cover so someone jumped but they had no clue what they were doing."
good,It was a good work place and coworkers were very friendly and helpful a very good environment and you learn a lot but management wasn't the greatest..
good,The management was not so great. They were always getting upset for doing a task they asked you to do. They did not want to give me less hours because I just started college so it was hard to balance both.
good,"I started to be seasonal and stayed on, the scheduling is horrible and the management is poor. I am working only on weekends and by myself at all times, often staying an hour after I am to leave for the day to finish my duties for the day."
good,"Working for Target was fun, adventurous and hard work. I learn so much and it pushed me to become a smarter worker. However, management was not professional."
good,"Most of the stuff that i did for that store as a lead i did alone. They thought with everything i had going on i could do it all alone, but that is totally wrong. Not much i can learn about a job if i dont have 0 support on anything i did."
good,Management only cares about themselves and managers and team leaders don't care about you only about themselves they will insist on something getting done by a certain time and just watch instead of doing something about it
good,Enjoyed working here. Very friendly staff. Very easy to learn everything really fast no pressure whatsoever. Plan on going back someday really soon hopefully.
good,"Bosses are unhelpful and bullying, no room or opportunity for advancement, sick days and any time off for any reason are looked at disdainfully no matter the circumstance."
good,It was fun to work there but keep in mind that this is just a job temporary for a person who doesn't have many bill to pay. on the other hand you might be able to obtain good skills as well some knowledge in certain areas
good,"the guest were nice "
good,The job is ok just not enough hours if u have a family its bascially a student job
good,"A 10hr day of production, with a 15min, and 25min break. Making rate for each job was a challenge daily. My co-workers for the most part where outstanding. The management for the most part was good, until they were rotated. The hardest part of the job was the expectation of production versers reality. The most enjoyable part was my co-workers,and the opportunity to travel,and train at other DC's,and being abe to assist, and problem solve on a daily basis."
good,"A lot of customer complaints on the return policy, Not a very good steady work schedule. I learned how to process returns and exchanges."
good,I worked there for about 2 1/2 years and at first I loved it. I got paid well and enjoyed work. As time went on and management changed the “bosses” because mean and gave their employees attitudes.
good,"Management sucked. "
good,Target has a lot to offer like guest interaction experience and growing to get comfortable around stressful working environments I do believe targets management needs improvement.
good,manager was very against having a female sft in his store.  it made my job and those around me harder. i willingly left before things got worse.. thats it
good,The HR is racist (she is African American)and unfairly judges people. They keep you at Part time so they don’t have to give you benefits. Change is your schedule without notice and put you in other departments when you’re not scheduled to work there
good,"Working for this target was the more stressful job i ever had. MY co workers are fun to work with but management just sit around all day and do nothing, and fuss at you just to fuss at you for."
good,"Target was a decent place to work. We were never that busy aside from the basic peak hours. Even so, we were not allowed to leave our register to stock the small displays around our registers although it was required daily. We also were threatened with termination if we didn't meet a certain goal for the Target RED cards."
good,"This job requires standing for very long periods of time. I do love the way they do their breaks though. You don't get the oppurtunity to leave your register during your hours, it stays very busy. I do not recommend working here if you're a minor."
good,Target was a great starter job for people getting out of high school. i worked there a little over a year and it seemed like i was going nowhere. I personally didn't feel comfortable with management there because it was inconstant and it seemed like they didn't know how to run the floor.
good,Target is a great company to work for as a first job or looking part time. I wouldn't personally want to stay here as long as I have if I was able to find a better paying job.
good,Ok company. High turnover. Difficult management. Inflexible work scheduling. Underemployed in the section I worked. Working alone at peak service hours.
good,"a great place to work but it can also be draining,and overwhelming."
good,I worked a a facility manager at one location for about 6 months after that i worked at 3-4 different store locations working on the quality of the buildings.
good,The company use to be great to work for but they seem to care less about there emplyees and the load of work is overwelming. No longer are managers feeling like we are respected by the company any more.
good,"Target was a great place to work. It was very organized and clean, great staff to work with. I learned many things like cashiering and stocking and customer service skills. This job gave me the opportunity to excel in my people skills."
good,I helped customers with their products and helped the save money with a Target Red Card. I liked working for Target I just wish I could have gotten 40 hours a week. Management was great they were really understanding.
good,"The environment was fast paced and always had something to do. I only was there for my internship, didn't actually work there. co workers were very helpful and always trying to help."
good,"learned how to stock a store and help customers out , hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks because of the time limit . most fun of the job was when we had meetings but other then that it was really boring"
good,"I applied for a part time position, but they swamped me with full time hours. I was told I would have christmas eve off, but when I inquired about it again they told me I was not allowed to take it off. The Ladies in HR were wonderful and friendly. A couple of the managers were very nice, but a few managers were rude. I had a decent experience. I dont know if i would work there again."
good,"Being apart of the target family taught me many things. Everyday wasn't great, but I always showed my fast, fun, and friendly attitude. I was eager to work around people. The best part about the Target life was meeting all sorts of people. I will never forget a guest that would come in everyday and speak to everyone. One valentines day she bought everyone that was very nice to her each and everyday she came into Target (yes, including me) a box of chocolate. This is one of my most memorable times at Target."
good,"typicall retail nonsense. do the impossible with next to no resources, don't say you need anything then because your the problem. don't look for support from superiors, there isn't any."
good,"I learned supervisor duties,Enjoyed becoming the Instock Team Trainer."
good,managed sales floor and display inventory of shoes and related products assisted customer with merchandise inquiries in the photo and shoe department.
good,"co workers friendly, lod not very friendly, management was friendly, busy fast paced enviroment, they had hired 120 people so i didnt get alot of work hours like i would have liked."
good,It doesn't matter how long you have worked there the pay is the same.  Advancement is by favoritism - who you know or if you are a minority that can check the boxes.
good,"My time at target was very stressful and I had a difficult time completing tasks at work because of unrealistic timelines, every day at work was stressful, you had to pretty much hustle all day long and I was always worried I would get written up. I was a pretty fast worker but I was always put pressure upon about finishing the work much faster than I was doing. I didn't make it past my 90 days and to be honest when they let me go I was relieved because working for target was really stressful to be honest and I feel like I didn't live up to my leads expectations. I am a perfectionist so I pride myself on giving a job my very best and because I am partially sighted I had issues seeing certain things and doing the job as efficiently done as a sighted person could do it."
good,"Target was a good family centered store where i learned skills such as leading, communication, and customer service.  I would recommend anyone to work there."
good,It isn't the best place to work at. Don't work with all the time. Enjoy helping guests find what they need and enjoy being able to have some independent duties that I have to do.
good,i learned from working here that there isn't to many women working hardlines. they treat you sometimes like your always doing something wrong. I did like that they sometimes had food for us.
good,"If you have a problem they don’t care enough to try and help you. Also co workers are rude and don’t do their jobs fully, but never get called out on it.. but they love to pick on people who actually come in everyday to work.. hours are never consistent. Managers are rude and show favoritism."
good,"They will make you feel like you are doing very well in your position and allow you to feel comfortable with your job, and then let you go because “your season is over” but they will also be hiring new people when they let you go. It’s very difficult to keep your job there for more than 3 months because they cycle people out. Managers are also rude and don’t care about their employees. They made me feel like a failure because I tried and loved my job and was still let go for no given reason."
good,start out by saying this review may not be a good reflection because I was only seasonal. but I got hired after my friend got fired and none of the workers gave me a chance because they assumed I'd be like my friend who got fired. needless to say I kept to myself. a friend came to visit without me asking and I got yelled at because he was nearby as I worked. LOD didnt like me because of the friend that had worked there. they give you hours like they own all of your time. they dont care they will schedule you for whatever they want
good,"the workplace is very calm and beautiful but the leads are ridiculous. they do pick favorites and show favoritism very often. The leads and managers do not do their jobs , if anything they goof off and sit on their butts and talk about their personal lives. The labor of this job is not the best , they expect too much out of you in a 3-4 hour period. The scheduling is not flexible like they claim to be. I go to school full time and they still want me to work 5 days out of the week. Oh and if you try to close your availability on Sundays they wont approve it , even if you're religious . Other than that HR reps are friendly 2 out of the 3 that work there."
good,"Generally, Target is a fast-paced work environment that varies in experience based on store-level management. At Target it is necessary to learn quickly with little training and be very adaptable to a changing work environment. Certain work centers are more stressful than others, but most people can find job satisfaction in at least one work center at Target stores. The workplace offers an intense but friendly environment, but work friendships may seem superficial and forced, especially when involving team leaders. Target, like all retail jobs, is very transient and often sees old team members leaving for different opportunities, and new team members joining the Target team. The hardest part of the job is being able to adapt to each individual's leaders' needs and expectations, and being able to meet them in a timely manner (especially if your department has a small amount of hours allotted to each team member), specifically in work areas such as the Backroom. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of completing a lot of tasks in one work day, and being able to work as a team to complete tasks. The satisfaction of knowing you have worked hard and given all that you have is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,working at target you get a good hourly pay but they don't give you enough hours a week to take advantage of the pay. Plus they don't put enough people working at once so it's easy for someone to be overwhelmed with guests.
good,My experience here was okay. They didn't schedule a lot of hours so it was hard to get the hang of the job. I didn't stay long because I wasn't given the opportunity to really learn the business.
good,"As I have been working at Target for a little over a year now, I have noticed a decline of enthusiasm on my part to work there as time has gone by. I really liked it there before because all the managers were polite and made things fun smoothly; ever since a handful of managers left, I, along with. few other coworkers have begun to lack enthusiasm for working there. We are disappointed with how it is run now. Target as a brand is a great company and I would be more satisfied working at a location that is well-run."
good,"Stocked shelves, cleaned up end caps, cashiered when needed. Restocked returns from customer service booth. Seasonal position for Christmas. Fun co workers. Customers were fun to help."
good,"Was a fine job for a part time job. Some of the management did not enjoy working and threw work onto the lower people. Half the management was good, the other was lazy."
good,"Since Target schedules on a rotating schedule, it was difficult to go to school and work for this company at the same time. I talked with HR Team Members and Management multiple times but I was always scheduled to work when I was suppose to be in class. Always the team culture was horrible, most of the time it felt like I was in High School all over again because all of the drama present."
good,"Target has the view that you need a 4 year degree to be promoted.  They only hire managers directly out of college and brainwash them into their way of thinking.  They do not like any ideas to be challenged.  They don't listen to their employees that have worked there for 17 years who have seen what happens throughout the store history.  The managers can't think for themselves, they are programmed like robots."
good,"i have nothing to say, it was a part-time, seasonal position. Little to no room for advancement and sales expectations unreasonable for the amount of training recieved."
good,"Target is a busy place you must always present yourself in a kind manner. You must be a team player, present and ready to work. "
good,Boring and not fast paced enough for me. They also had people stay over for not good reasons. Like even when they had enough employees they always seem overstaffed. Which then results in them letting people go.
good,"Terrible management , terrible treatment , very disorganized breaks were never given on time or sometimes not at all. It is a clean workplace and only the management needs improvement"
good,"The work is extreme to be in retail, target is an amazing company but has so much room for improvement, benefits are poor at most they give you is a 4 hour shift unless you are management. The styling and organization of clothes is not functional, Its why the stores continue to look like trash one cant shop nor work in that environment without feeling severely stressed and or overwhelmed."
good,them having favorites . not giving fair hours. only to favorites working whole week with 1 day off while other have 1 day work and whole week off. NOT GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,"I was hired for electronics and then we as thrown into a cashier position. Once they saw that I was efficient as that they started putting me as a produce section and then moved me into clothes and other things. When management thought I was all set with that they moved me into the toy department and then into electronics later on, where then they still proceeded to take me away from that and then blame me for leaving my electronics area at times. the management team also was talking about me negatively in another language and I got the jist of it and reported her to the management where they then stuck up for the other manager that said that and didn't do anything about it. They also had a book you put your requested time off in, where 3 weeks in advanced I put my time off so I wouldn't be scheduled and once that week came up they didn't allow me to take the time off and also said I lied that I never put that into the book. The management was awful and I almost reported them to HR"
good,Great training program.  Management had a high turnaround. The management training they had though was par none. I still use what I learned from these fundamentals.
good,I worked with people my age if not younger that were lazy again that is super annoying when you have the potential to do their job because you actually care!
good,when i started i noticed that they just wanted anyone to work. i was just thrown out and not trained on what and how they wanted things done and was barely given a break. worked till very late!
good,I went through some hard times not long after starting to work at target and was fired without being talked to first or given chances to improve. It was really difficult when the management wasn't willing to work with you on things.
good,I enjoyed the people i worked with. Made some life long friends. Enjoyed the work environment as well. Fast cashiering training to give our customers the most pleasant experience.
good,"nice place for first job, very fast paced, helps with customer service skills, you learn a lot about being professional and you meet a lot of new people."
good,love the team and guests management wasn't experienced. sometimes its about who your friends with and not how hard you work. most of my co workers were awesome the best part of the job is the guest interaction and the community service
good,"Working at Target was enjoyable, and the co-workers were friendly and easy to get along with. "
good,"Coworkers were the only thing that made this job fun.  There really is a sense of culture and family at Target.  I miss my coworkers dearly, but not Team Leaders or ETLs.  They tended to micromanage, worrying about if someone's pants were the right shade of khaki, or if their shirt is burgundy not red.  "
good,"Fast, fun and friendly. But the down side it no room to grow inside the company. They will hire somebody outside the company before they allow a worker to move up. No job advancement."
good,it was ok got to meet a lot of people whole working here. unloaded trucks in the morning time
good,"This was a part-time position, I had the pleasure of working with very helpful staff and management"
good,Was a fun place to work. Good communication throughout from GM to Team Leaders most of the time. Very fast paced.
good,Verify and pack merchandise. Most difficult partof job was handling the weight of the heavier items.
good,"Well a typical was folding clothes in your department straightening racks make sure the hangers are finger spaced apart with two fingers. Answer customer complaints,needs,and concerns. My co-workers were like family loved them. The hardest part of job was keeping the clothes on the tables folded in the way the Target the company wanted it throughout the day being that I was very busy multi-tasking."
good,This is a good job to have simply for resume purposes.
good,unload truck stock shelves learned nothing management was ok co-workers were cool no hard parts.
good,a typical day at word is non stop. learned how to stock in hardlines and softlines. learned how to cashieer.Helping the customer. First job cashiering. learn to prep the sunday ad. learned the pda. took the test for some food handling intormation. The hardest part of the job at this particular location was the way managment talked to you on the floor. pulled back and forth. from one assignment to another. not being able to finish an assignment and then critiicized and written up for such things on your annual review. or downgrated because your on one job and not the other they say you dont know that function anymore. the most enjoyable was the work and co-workers and working with the public
good,"Very Interesting, to say the least. I had fun WORKING THERE!!"
good,"There is never enough time to accomplish the work that is needed to be done. I constantly have heard that I am not going fast enough and there is no praise for when I take the initiative and clean up area after area that are a disaster. Training needs to be handled differently and every team member needs to be doing things the same way, which never happens. It's a physically demanding job with lifting heavy items down from high shelves, pushing flatbeds loaded with products and navigating through guests without getting in their way. I love helping guests and that is the highlight of each day."
good,"The job definitely pays well over the typical workload. Also, the employee treatment is pretty good too, including things like food or snacks in the breakroom and announcments congratulating individuals on an exceptional performance. The only issue would be that the employee relationships are a little too entangled therefore lots of gossip. Overall, it was a good job that I genuinely enjoyed"
good,"I really enjoyed working for the company but once ETLHR had left, it was all on me to take over the department which i really did not mind at all since its what I loved doing but at a point they did not want to work with my school schedule anymore so I had to leave."
good,"great part time job. the time would fly by, great lunch/breakfast during the holiday season. culture was based on current manager.  some did not want you to talk while working. but overall great night job."
good,"Target was a nice place to work when management wasn't around to criticize your efforts. Due to the fact that our department was understaffed we were often expected to perform more work than our strictly part time schedules would allow. If you're lucky, you'll get called on your day off and asked to work a full shift or perhaps asked to stay later during a half shift. Although, you should expect some complaints from your Team Lead if you decline these offers more often than naught. However, despite the problems with scheduling and the unrealistic expectations the management had, Target was a fun place to work and often times team members felt like a tightknit family and the work was easy but time consuming."
good,"The pay is pretty good, some of the managers are amazing and some not so much. Our store manager wasn't understanding about getting sicker getting seriously injured, very passive aggressive. They are how ever great at working with your schedule and making sure you take your breaks. The do how ever put you at part time but want you working as close to full time with out the benefits"
good,"It was a good place for a high school student to start working at. They are flexible with hours. Once you are there for a long period of time, you start to realize most of the downsides to working for a big retail store."
good,"Slow paced "
good,Very fast paced environment. The training wasn’t very helpful and it made it hard to get things done . Despite having my availability they still scheduled me on days I wasn’t a single z
good,"its a good place to work but the hours are inconstant , they say they work with you but complain about it afterwords, some of the team leads take this job and look at it as a career when its not"
good,"shipping out items to customers, loading trucks, working at target I was in a lot of different department that help out skills and help me out on growing."
good,"Management was okay, but you do receive poor training.  They expect you to do a lot in a short amount of time.  The location of the store is in a bad neighborhood so the customers are rude and disrespectful."
good,"This was the most boring job I've had, not much to do on slow days with made the shifts feel twice as long as they were. if you like a relaxed work place with not a lot of responsibility then target is the job for you."
good,not much to say really. if you have worked in a retail store its the same as most. it does seem like the managers change a lot. not all targets are like this but that was at least mine
good,"Target wasn’t a horrible place to work, I had a great deal of fun there. However, there was an issue in trying to communicate with management about any issue I had."
good,"I loved the team/department I worked on. I did not like too many of the managers. They had a tendency to micromanage, which felt silly because our team knew our role and what to get done. But to constantly have people checking on you to make sure you were accomplishing your tasks. Or it would be that they would constantly change their directions or not give you complete directions. It all became frustrating the number of managers that would contradict each other in the time I was attempting to accomplish my regular tasks. Our department had a lot of people quit because we all felt under-appreciated by all the managers and departments we supported."
good,I believe that the job is good but there are many different things that they need to work on. The management needs a little help and they need to learn to give employees longer breaks for the amount of work we are doing.
good,"I enjoyed my time with Target, however; it was time for me to leave. I needed to leave because of school, therefore i decided it would be best for me to leave."
good,"The pay is not worth the stress you receive from some of the management or customers.  You are given tasks from TL to complete on top of regular tasks without their help (most of the time).  only certain TL or managers actually are seen working as hard as regular TM."
good,"I'ts difficult to say how working for Target as a whole is, as it all differs store to store, and even department to department. My personal experience In Largo Mall Target was a mixed experience over the 2 years I worked there. There was a lot of turnover and some management worked better than others. I had amazing coworkers and my team-leads were all wonderful, and in that respect I could not ask for a better work environment. Though overall I had some very bad experiences (who doesn't in retail) and ended up leaving due to higher-up management cruelty. I will say it's a great job for young adults who need a well paying job for their age, and don't mind working hard for it!"
good,Working here is fun but getting hours is a pain. Never enough hours. The pay is decent for retail but not nearly enough considering the low amount of hours. The team is very upbeat and friendly.
good,"A typical work day at target was usually stressful. It was the holiday season. The other employees were great to work with. I would love to work for target again, but not during the holiday season."
good,"While I love what I do at Target, I am not fond of the management at my store. I think they favor certain team members over others and sometimes take out their stress on the team. You can talk to a person without throwing your weight as a manager around. That being said there are a few team leads that are exceptional at looking out for the company and the employees interests. A typical day at Target involves anything from truck unload, stocking shelves, picking and shipping online orders, making the store look clean and presentable for our guests. At times it can be stressful but overall it is a decent place to work. Team members are always willing to help when needed or asked. The most enjoyable part of my job is working  hard to provide our guest with the best customer service I can so that they walk out feeling as though their every shopping need was met!"
good,"I worked with this company for almost 6 years and I never felt more unappreciated as I did. I was a Food Service Team Lead at my store and it was never acknowledge in any team meetings or HUDDLES. My team felt so separated from the rest of the store. The management cared more about the ""floor"" of Target than anything else. Last I remember Starbucks and the Café were part of Target, In which my team NEVER felt that way. The hardest part of my job was having to work both the café and starbucks at the same time due to only one team member at each department at one time so one had to cover each others breaks. So it left one department without someone for a moment. I cant say I hated this job only because the ""misfits"" of target as we called ourselves became a family and had each others back! The one thing I would change about the whole company cause this is the second Target I have worked at and it was the same prdeal is...show the food service team the same RESPECT you shouw the floor!"
good,"Fast paced job is enjoyable along with meeting all kinds of people."
good,"Hours would change based on season ie back to school, Thanksgiving/Christmas. Management took initiative to do things to boost morale. Helpful to employees and friendly work environment"
good,"I worked with several young people, which gave me a good view of the present-day culture but also worked with older individuals like myself so it was a good balance and very fun..  I liked my job, but although the hours were only 24-30 a week, they were different every week which made it hard to balance out family time and activities."
good,Target was an ok place to work at. The store I worked at was not the best store to work at. Some of the managers were great at what they did. Many of the coworkers were good to work with as well
good,when I worked there it was great for a couple days then I saw that there was tons of favoritism so you have to be on you're own because if you don't have a good relationship with anyone there you're going to have problems
good,"at first I liked working at target. But when I became sick, it was obvious that it was every man for himself. I had cancer and basically my hours were cut until I was only scheduled 8 hrs a week to work."
good,"Was an okay job experience, Was not able to maintain a healthy work/life balance. Was never given full time hours so I did not receive full time employee benefits."
good,"the work is hard ans faced paced, they are steadily pushing you to do more I learned how to load trucks.  the pay didn't match the job. we worked together"
good,Target helped me to grow into an awesome worker and a more responsible woman. It’s a great company to work for after working there for as long as I did I recommend target as a first job experience for young students.
good,"Early morning hours of work starts with opening up the receiving doors and verifying the daily truck of merchandise has arrived. The unloading crew works to unload the trailer while the logistics coordinator checks in unloaded merchandise and proceeds to locate storage and stocking locations throughout the facility. There is a hurry up and get it done atmosphere because the management expects the work to be done from start to finish in approximately 5 or less hours, usually this is before the business opens. That is the hardest part of working here. Getting together for a party or having a staff potluck is the most enjoyable time because you feel at ease."
good,Nothing too bad to say. Employees are all kind and wanting to talk. Like a family. Never a dull moment in customer service. Always something new to deal with on a daily.
good,"Good place to work, enjoyed the people and the energy. Didn't really like the way managers abused their power but nonetheless it is a good place to work and I would recommend to anyone looking for a simple but fast paced work environment."
good,The hardest part of this job is that no one takes it as seriously as you do. Coworkers could be better as well as managers. I think the best part of this job is being able to work the early morning shift and still be able to have the rest of the day to do anything
good,"Target is a good place to work. Has a nice discount that can be used on top of coupons, cartwheel, and the red card.  Down side to working here is that they are understaffed most of the time and will ask you to over work yourself with little appreciation."
good,A typical day at target is stressful because unless you are a lead you do not know who the LOD is on schedule. The team is not made aware of changes being made to company policy. The workplace culture is terrible because people gossip and they always tell people false information.
good,"I found working at Target to be frustrating due to the number of disinterested employees (including management). For this reason, the work time dragged and was not as productive as it should have been"
good,"Target is a store that will work with students and their available hours. If a department has extra hours and has work that needs to be done, you can be given those hours, if you are cross trained."
good,"It started out as a really great job, but we had several changes in Management and team members in a short time period, nobody was on the same page, hours were cut and benefits were cut."
good,If you have a college degree you can advance quickly but if not then you will be stuck at the lower levels until the company deems you worthy to take on more responsibility
good,"Great company to work for if you have a management staff that cares about the team and their growth. Training, when done right, is excellent and the knowledge learned here can be used anywhere."
good,It was good working there it was just something occurred and I was actually unable to work so I decided to quit. Only thing I could of done in my situation.
good,"Overall great place to work, friendly customers, great co-workers, great location.  Offered benefits to full time associates and were willing to cross train anyone that was interested."
good,"Typical day is going in from night to a.m hours.  Worked well with other co workers, always kept communication n dedication on the job at hand, making sure all is completed for day."
good,"Overall, Target is a good place to work if you're a college student. They give good hours around the holidays, but after that, everybody's hours drop so low. There isn't a chance to get promoted, so wherever you got hired on for is where you will stay. Co-workers are okay, it's just a lot of drama on my side of the store (softlines)."
good,"Target has great team members it's just the management needs improvements..I love working w public, working in backroom, sales floor, receiving.  Target really is a great company to work for. I work for the first Target express which I love but there's no room for advancement. You could work.there for years and still be in same position at the Target expresses."
good,"Work day's usually went by fast, would some times pick up extra shifts because I would only get scheduled for 4 hour work days. To work this job you have to have self control."
good,I remember most of the supervisors being nice but a few having unreasonable expectations given the limits of the machine required to do my job.
good,I did not enjoy working for this company it was nothing but drama. I had people employed after me and was making more money than me. I had been with the company almost three years and during those three years moved up in ranks for quickly.
good,It was a great opportunity to have at such a young age. Business is something I have never thought about but I do now. The pay was not great for what I was doing and had to deal with ($8 an hour).
good,"While I do enjoy working at Target mostly because of the other team members, there is unfair treatment of employees. Certain employees are paid more because they are ""brand team members"". Basically they are paid more for simply having the title. There is a glass ceiling in the wage difference between men and women."
good,Very high-volume store so there was always a lot of work to be done. Assisted customers while handling inventory control. Also managed front lanes and customer service department.
good,My typical day at target is being sent to one of the registers and ring all the guess out.  If a guess can not find the item they are looking for we can call over manager for help to see if we have it or maybe we have some in another target.
good,target is a great opportunity to work at I feel very safe but the one thing that I don't like is they don't give enough hours for those that work hard. Management there is great they do care about the product and there quest and how they are provided for alone with the questions that the guest answer  from day to day.
good,Fast Fun and Friendly that is their saying. I wish management was more supportive their sonority employees. they should have them train new employees.
good,"this is a fun place to work, but not a job to make a career out of it, unless you are in management, but there still isn't any job work/ life balance."
good,I excelled in many areas in Target I learned a lot of new things and got to work with the public which I love. I would recommend Target to someone who is looking to start off but as far as advancing up in the company there werent very many opportunities.
good,"Team member follow direction"
good,"I loved the job but did not get enough hours, pay or advancement/recognition of any kind. The scheduling is done by a computer now and it is just as bad as it was when people where doing it so you constantly need to correct them. Ocassionally during the holidays they give free meals."
good,I pulled stock from the back warehouse and brought it out to the front of the store to be put on store shelves. I learned how to use equipment and what retail was all about. The management was out of touch with their employees. The co-workers kept to themselves for the most part.
good,"I have enjoyed working for this company, but there is no benefits to my awareness of development with my degree. I have learned many valuable work ethics and experiences. Working as a team, organization skills, and even time management. All these experiences will be beneficial for my future career."
good,It was great working there. Getting up early to go to work was fun!
good,"Management is ok, pay is awful, the people you work with are great, it isn't a hard job."
good,"Bag customer items"
good,"its ok but i want something better, so my life can change for the better. i have goals in life an working at target wont get me there."
good,Well I had to start out as part time because of school. I told them that I could see my self making a career out of Target if I could advance and move up. That never happened. I am going on my 6 month mark. I have been trying to find other jobs but since its winter work slows down and not a whole lots of companies are hiring. The management is ok sometimes. The HR also likes to try to schedule me when I am unavailable on school days or management likes to get angry at you for not coming into work when the snow gets so bad you don't have a snow plow on your road. But liken I said its ok if you want to get worked to the bone for $170 every 2 weeks.
good,"A regular day at Target is doing pulls, backstok, truck unload, checking out guests at the cash registers and hoping none of them yell at you.  I learned that retail is a field I would excel gracefully in seeing as though I am a ""people person.""  The managers are good at listening but not at trying to improve the store.  All my co-workers did was complain about how much they didn't like the job.  The hardest part of this job was trying to make irate guests happy by going above and beyond and them still not pleased.  Most enjoyable, hands down, is knowing that you made a difference in someone's life when they find the perfect gift for their child at a perfect price."
good,"greeting guests making sure customer service was presented to the guest giving information about red cards."
good,Target employed me when I needed a job to help me pay for school. Convenient also for discounted items I and my family would need. I enjoyed meeting different people and talking to individuals of different nationalities and ideas
good,"I love shopping at Target but the store where I was employed was mainly hispanic personnel and it would make me uncomfortable where they would speak their language between themselves in the breakroom.  Most of the upper management were of hispanic decent.   I grew up in So.California and have lived, gone to school, church and worked with all races and ethnic groups and tend to get along with everyone but somehow, I was uncomfortable with the people I worked with.  They weren't friendly towards me even though I tried to be social and do my job to my best ability.   I didn't care for the hours I was working because it was always late at night.   I don't mind working evenings, but I would like to work some days so I could have dinner with my husband.  "
good,"If I wasn't greeting, seating or training someone there was always something to do."
good,A typical day at work was going to work early in the morning gather for a team group discussion and then everyone does there part to unload the truck and load merchandise on the proper pallets to be pulled to the sales floor where it is stocked and all merchandise pulled forward for the customer.
good,"im on a 90 day probation,pay is a lot lower than what i usally get,but a great comapany to work for."
good,"My typical day at work is all business for me, I come in and do what I have been train to do. I enjoy helping the customers when they come in needing help. I am very fast and friendly as they ask us to be. My job is very hard, but I do it, and finish my task. I help those who need helps when it comes to my co workers. I even train those that comes in that needs to be trained in my dept. My enjoyable part is help others, and encourage them to do their best."
good,"Daily routine is doing go backs which are items that guess return and we have to put back, I've learned patience and working extremely well with co-workers, the management is fair and co-workers are great, the hardest part is the work load can be a bit overwhelming and stressful."
good,"Target builds great leaders. I spent ten years there and I learned a lot. But if you speak up against a store manager that is mistreating another manager that is friends with a district leader, here in south Florida at least, your career is over and they will plan to get you out of the company regardless if you are the only person working in your Family with a kid."
good,"Target was a fun place to work, you got to look at all the clothes and other items first. They were understanding about my schedule and scheduled accordingly. They didn't really tell me I was ""let-go"" the just stopped scheduling me and said I was only seasonal so it should have been understood."
good,Overall good company to work for. Needs to improve on vetting Executive Team Leads. Management doesn't value hard working team members. Didn't like the fact that there were high turnover rates in the stores. Sometimes management expectations weren't realistic. Loved interaction with guests.
good,"I enjoyed my time there. But turnover in management allows for people to judge you, when they don’t even know you and haven’t worked with you. Part time and seasonal people are brought in and do to the time of year, will be making the same or more per hour as someone who has been there 2,3,4,or 5 years. All because the company wants to be paying all employees some much per hour.  You earn a raise but then you get bumped up in pay to the base pay that was raised.  It isn’t like you get bumped up to the company minimum and then they add the raise that you earned to that, so it makes your time with the company a waste. I left and I am glad I did. I feel less stress now."
good,It's fun. But no benifits. Lots of turnover with young people. Probley the best paying job for what it is. I never got fulltime and I dont always get the hours I need.
good,This was my first seasonal job that I have had since being a stay-at-home mother. I worked the front end of the store and I was able to achieve the goals that were set out for me during the seasonal time of Christmas.
good,"I enjoy interaction with people, this is a great opportunity to advance people skills. The company has employee appreciation on a weekly basis."
good,"Must love working with people."
good,"A typical day was easy but i was not there long so !"
good,"I got a job at Target mostly to see if I could join the workforce after a long absence. It has been a good job, but there is no ability to advance or get better at your job. I STILL love shopping there, and will for the rest of my life, so my job there has not turned me off of their products...so I think that is a good thing."
good,"They’ll find ways not to give anyone more than a 15 cent raise. If you work hard, but an ETL doesn’t like you they’ll find a way to fire you. Very good job to get by though."
good,"It was decent working at target, softlines, however they don’t really have much hours to give out making it difficult to keep up with whatever payments you’re dealing with."
good,"It was my first job and was going to school. Cashiering is never ending, always busy. Cafe area, there was a little bit more down time and you were on your own."
good,"Wish the staff was more supportive "
good,Worked with great people and had a good time working here but felt very under appreciated. Corporate tends to be the spawn of under-appreciation but in today's society that's hard to get away from.
good,Really fast paced environment. Bosses are really rude and treat employees poorly. Very disrespectful in groups. take breaks as they please and yell at employees when using restroom.
good,I felt that the supervisors all kinda were a clique. I did not play politics or join in on the drama and gossip. I was disappointed to be let go at end of season when during interview was told I'd have choice to leave or stay on. I am pretty confident if I played the game I would of been asked to stay.
good,"Going to work wasn’t really a wake up and be excited type of thing but it wasn’t terrible. We had team leaders so there was always one that you liked over the others. I learned how to keep a conversation going even when I didn’t want to. The world place didn’t really have any culture there were maybe two Hispanics, three African Americans and everybody else was white. I think the hardest part about the kid was standingall day. The. Most enjoyable part was working when my friends did it always made the time go by faster"
good,"I loved working here. It is very fast-paced sometimes, and can be very slow on off seasons. Team members were friendly and helpful when needed, there were fun to work with."
good,Working at Target your always busy so your day will fly by. The hardest part of the job was the amount and quality of work expected in a very limited time. I really enjoyed pushing new product out and zoning my department to look its best.
good,ok job met a lot of great people pay wasn't where I needed it to be the pushing of target credit card was really the downfall of my time there the discount wasn't terrible
good,"Ok , if you are single.... Harder on older people and those with family. Have to do more now that there is a 13 an hour pay. No over night pay or work."
good,"I loved the co workers I had, the fast pace environment was great. The management was very disorganized and very poor scheduling. But besides all of that I did overall like my job."
good,"It is okay. They give you a lot of work and expect too much of one person. Leadership at my store has problems communicating things to the team, which leads to a lot of confusion."
good,they hire you on and tell you they are gonna keep you at full time but then they kinda tweak your hours and then you have a hard time keeping hours from aug-jan cause they lay people off or they quit. i started in july and was working 30hrs a week and then went down to 8hrs week it really cut me back killed my expenses and income its great pay if its a part time job. If you live with your parents and dont have alot of expenses to pay you will be fine but if you live on your own and are not in a high position or have a 2nd job you will stuggle a little bit
good,"Working at Target is fun for the first four months, but the low pay, demanding management, and overall lackluster work environment will quickly humble you. Management will always value the company more than the workforce and are very unsympathetic towards employees. Hard work is expected but not rewarded, and unless you get lucky, hours will be hard to come by. It as an abysmally average retail experience, improved only slightly by the potential to make friends in your work area."
good,"Great job for teenagers or someone who needs full time and benefits. You deal with coupons, and cartwheel app on a daily basis. Mornings tended be slower and late nights. Overall was a great experience to work as a cashier."
good,Great place to work but the managerial system is confusing and unorganized. There was a lack of diversity and the company can be very strict. The hours are long but the job is fairly easy.
good,I worked in the Starbucks at my store for almost a year. I enjoyed it some days but others gave me full panic attacks. The management sucked they couldn’t do anything right. They knocked me down to part time hours when I took 4 days off when I was sick.  They also never had multiple people working at once so it was always overwhelmingly busy. I loved the people I worked with though. Everyone was wonderful and so kind which was definitely why I stayed so long. It had its good days and bad but overall just okay.
good,Working for Target was never dull. I personally loved when we had customers that truly appreciated the employees and the hard work that was performed to keep the location looking great.
good,Target is a great company in which I have enjoyed being apart of. They require a lot of work and give minimal hours. I often find my self feeling stressed and overworked due to the requirements they have. Management is not the best nor are they very helpful and understanding.
good,"The job was really straightforward! Some of the personnel were approachable, and easy to work with. However, if you want to move up on the company you have to kiss up to the boss. Even if you have no clue on how to work on the department. That will produce counterproductive results. One of the main things I really loved about the company was you were able to meet different kind of people; by working at different stores. One word of advice, if you want to promote capable people. It is suggested not to promote flatterers. Promote people with capability, and knowledge. If you promote flatterers, you chase capable people away. It is also suggested to keep job openings available to all people, not just the flatterers."
good,The time I worked there was short I didn't plan it to be like that but it happened good pay and good hours at first but at the same time The schedule and was pretty bad for the fact  You had to have somebody to Cover your shift and No other way to get a day changed or if something comes up that day
good,"The job itself was great. It wasn't too physically demanding and was easy to comprehend. The problem with working in such a big company and store is that there are many employees between the ages of 18-24. Sometimes a lot of people in that age range could be immature (I'm probably included in that) so simply talking to people and getting work done became such a task sometimes. It's hard trying to get work done when people don't stop talking. Other than the immature behavior, this job is a great stepping stone for those who are just starting out."
good,Incredibly unrealistic amount of work to do in a small amount of time (6-8 hours). The store looks nice but that's all the management really cares about when i was there. Not the employees they were forcing to stay 2+ hours after expected shift at night.
good,"The hours are not reliable, and there’s no way to guarantee more and stable hours unless you are in management. It’s not a bad work environment to be in, but not having a reliable paycheck takes a toll on anybody after awhile."
good,Target has been making a lot of changes in the past year. they bring in people off the streets with no experience over the people that have grown through the company over the years. They lie and make positions up so they won;t have to pay you. The managers and district managers in my district are snakes and liars. HR is sad!
good,You have clear goals everyday to accomplish. Freight and zoning. mediocre management but great people work here. i don’t regret working here. Easy money.
good,"You can definitely learn alot in the retail environment but also you can be taking advantage of, so you need to set a pace for yourself and maintain a pace while working productively and efficiently."
good,Needs better communication. Team members are very friendly and are like family. The workload is very heavy and the compensation does not add up yo the daily workload.
good,Poor management at the Uptown Albuquerque location. Incredibly stressful work environment due to lack of communication and overall under trained management.
good,I worked at the remodel team and did a lot of heavy lifting and moving things around. Had to redo the entire inside of the store with my team and continually follow commands and listen to my bosses
good,It’s a good first time job. Aside from the management being garbage the job overall is pretty nice. The team members are welcoming and always willing to help. The job is also pretty easy.
good,I work there as seasoning work for christmas holiday. They told me if i worked hard at my job. They would think about hire me part time. But then they let me off because they didn't have that many hours to give me because they gave them to a another person. When i was there every day and expect for one when i was sick. I really loved work at target i did my job and plus some. I helped every department that need help.
good,I have learned a lot from training at target and cashier experience and also working with new people and training them was a wonderful experience for me
good,i would not make this job a lasting job. it will put strain on you body. working hours are crummy. not a whole lot of room for advancement. i left for better working conditions
good,"Target, as with many other companies, has its pros and cons.  Each store is different and many of the cons come from management at store level.  The main benefit I gained from Target was the friendships made while working there."
good,Quite easy going environment with no conflict or tension of any kind amongst the coworkers. Can call on the spot to come in while they are shorthanded. Turnover rate is high. Little to no advancement or appreciation even to those who have been there for 6+ years. Lots of help if needed and loads of free food to take home in the break room.
good,"Its fine for a temporary job but personally I do not want to stay here for the rest of my life. Most of the people are awesome to work with but there is one manager who is the major reason I want to leave, he talks to everyone like they are children and it is beyond infuriating."
good,"I loved working at Target however, I didn't like the hours that were available. Sometimes working from 3pm to 11am then 4am to 12pm. The work environment was fine, sometimes fun, but they're unrealistic in their job goals such as making sure isles are neat and in order while assisting guests also watching the floor. Can be difficult"
good,I only got paid $7.25 an hour and rarely got more than 30 hours per week. I had two kids at home to take care of and was scheduled often for shifts that kept me from getting home until 12 am.
good,"Target is a wonderful company! A typical day involves helping guests and pushing out as much new product as possible, while making sure the floor looks put together and shoppable."
good,This place was good while it helped put me through college but its not a job i could have to help maintain a family for the rest of my life if you are looking to stay on your feet on your own.
good,I do not want to write a review but this website will not let me go to the next step if I don't so I am just going to write this. I have met a lot of wonderful people working here
good,"Overall, the workloads are manageable for the most part. Started off the day with reshop, then price audits, followed by zoning and shooting outs, and then pulling itms or research batches from the backroom. A heavy emphasis is placed on customer interaction and satisfaction so most of the time you go out of your way for the guest. "
good,"There is always a good atmosphere going into work. My coworkers are very nice. However, the employees in charge of creating the schedule for Starbucks, have no experience with the Starbucks work flow. Work can get very stressful and busy when there is only one person working the whole day. On top of those issues, we recently received a new manager who is unable to understand how to order supplies on time. Their lack of understanding reflects on the entire store. We are losing customers as well. I am overall  very tired with the entire situation. Perhaps working at Target is good for others, just not for me."
good,"Really enjoyed my time here as a teenager. They did sometimes take advantage of the employees and schedule then right under 40 hours so they wouldn't qualify for benefits etc. "
good,"Target was my first job and I loved it. At 19, I didn't have too much to worry about financially. Now that I am older, I feel that it's not worth the stress nor the little bit of money that you receive for how much you actually end up working."
good,They have socialized the work culture. Anybody who gets hired will be paid the same wage as a team member who’s been working there for years. Absolutely no incentive to work harder as they have taken away pay increases and being promoted to a management type role is basically a joke as they give you the same amount of pay for more responsibility.
good,"if you like having a menial job with really no chance to advance, then work here. Although target did shut down in Canada they were a decent place to work but the pay was horrible"
good,I would recommend it for a starting job. This is not a job that should not be for many years. I learn about cleaning. The managements is unusually nice. The culture is of a team work. The overwork and stress is really hard.
good,I miss seeing team members mature as they had gone from being high school students to becoming parents. Even kids run up to you in the register stall wanting hugs and stickers.
good,"Strict environment. Managers do too much most of the time and definitely show favoritism but I guess if your an ideal employee, you shouldn’t have a problem. Target pays their employees more than the other surrounding companies but they definitely expect the same respect to the company in return. Overall, it’s super easy and great pay but you spend a lot of time In there."
good,"I typically unload the truck in the morning. The team then moves the merchandise to the sales floor, where we then proceed to stock the merchandise. They gave training for employee safety, cleaning chemical spills, and customer safety issues. The hardest part of my job is stocking merchandise with the same intensity as unloading 2400 pcs at 6am. the best part of my job is management gives us breakfast for breaktime when we meet their allotted time to clear the truck."
good,I love working here and making friends with my co-workers. Very easy to get along with everyone. The hardest part of this job is being patient with the team leaders and LODs.
good,When I get to work  I had a name tag and a red jacket they give to wear that was mandatory to wear. I go to my register and key in a code that they give you to use everyday. You start assisting the customers by ringing up there items. Then you ask them if they found everything that they needed and if you can assist them in finding anything else they might need. It is always good to be polite and nice to customers. I think the management could have let stay there longer but I only got hired for seasonal work they told me I can come back and apply in the summer. The hardest part was not able to stay. The most enjoyable part assisting customers on a daily basis.
good,"Working at Target has opened my eyes to be grateful for the cashiers in every store I walk into. Target has taught me how customer service is supposed to be. Unfortunately, Target did not give people with potential a chance to succeed."
good,"Decent pay for seasonal, training makes it seem like the work environment is fun and full of benefits yet when you are on the clock it feels like a prison camp. Employees are rushed, pushed to the limit and treated with little to no respect. Management does not care. If you cannot unload the truck within one hour, and get sales floor stocked in two, then you are looked at with disgust. Despite inclusion of disability within application, managers push you beyond what you can do and do not care if it hurts your body."
good,Not a bad place to work at all. Not easy work but simple. I only worked Christmas seasonal and that is all I was looking for. Would recommend for short term work.
good,I enjoyed working at target. Every target has their own experience working there but if you are personal and willing to work it should be a great time.
good,"Store management could be more on hand with there overnight    team "
good,"Target was a great place to work at until certain managers were hired. Then everything went south and it was a horrible place to work. There was no consequences or accountability. Employees would talk back to managers and there was no consequences. Work load was very demanding and the managers promoted who they liked. If you were not one of their favorites, then you were not going to go any where with the company. Certain teams were held to different expectations than others and were not required to do tasks that everyone else in the store were required to do. I would definitely go back and work there if certain managers left, but until that happens I would not recommend working there due to lack of management, communication, and favoritism."
good,"Target seems to be a good company with the intent to take care of their team. However, this is not implemented well at the location I work at. The management is awful, and while I will recommend Target, I will not recommend the store I am at."
good,"It's an okay place to start off if you're fresh out of high school. Overall, I've worked at two targets and it's not too professional but they do take care of their team members well."
good,"management wasn't always the best "
good,"Target was a fun but a non beneficial workplace. There is no advancement, although the hours were flexible the schedules were always late or inaccurate."
good,I enjoyed working there and the 10% discount on products was great. I would have kept working there but I went to college and had to leave. I still cry every time I walk in to a Target.
good,"It's a job that can help provide some financial relief. I like retail, but the industry needs a lot of improvement. Their are some people in management positions that do not like to give back positive feedback, only negative. There can be teamwork among the team, but some managers in the store may not have an idea about what it takes to bring about team work. Even with the lack of management support, from some not all, the team still pulls together for the greater good of our guest by providing the ultimate guest experience. The hardest part of the job is the under staffing of it because it makes it hard on the team and the guest. The most enjoyable part of the job is all the guest you meet and the team members who make it worth the wild!"
good,a typical day at target was heavy work load.  I learned how to unload stock merchandise. management was good. work place culture was okay. For me there was no hard part of the job. the most enjoyable part of the job was learning my job title the discounts as a employee and the coworkers i worked with.
good,"Target was a stressful place to work, and the managers are very hard to work with. They still expect you to work even if you are sick, and if you say you can't, they ask you to do a half shift at least and if you dont show up, they mark it a no call, no show. Very unfair."
good,"Management admittedly told me that my hours were reduced, because their management needed hours more than I did. This was following a promise that my hours would not change. This was following events where I trained peers in my area and they received promotions info the same management positions that I applied for. I also had over 98% on customer reviews in my department and expressed interest in management positions over multiple occasions."
good,It was very fast paced and a very heavy work load everyday. managers were very understanding and always ready to help. When the whole time starts flowing together the warehouse would get backed and they would have to move us back around.
good,"Worked in Logistics, faced paced. Hectic during peak seasons! Keeps you on your toes. Enjoyed working with my co-workers. Target Corporation really needs to step it up and provide adequate material to off-site logistics workers such as safety working equipment, and holidays off! Reasonable work schedules."
good,high stress jobs as u progress into the logistics area.need to be fast paced stocking shelves per Target's standards not enough people for the amount of work placed on the team members every day
good,"Target was a great place to work, but management was poor. They should keep track of their workers + leads. Getting along with guests was fun sometimes, but you would always get one guest that would make you feel a bit stressed. Overall 2yrs working with Target was great!"
good,The management is terrible. I would see new faces every weekend. Fall season often require 56 hour weeks for 10 weeks strait. Scheduling vacation was tough.
good,"All in all, working there really wasn't all that bad. Some of managers/employees at Target are nice, but what isn't nice is that they seem to have lost sight of what really matters (customer service) and are willing to focus on how many Red Cards the cashiers get rather than the level of customer service the cashier delivers. This can be rather annoying for those employees that go above and beyond. There is also the lack of equal treatment for all employees."
good,"Great place to work but maybe a few team building exercises would've helped, I thought. A lot of the people were kids that weren't serious about working there and that was aggravating because I was trying to make a living. The bosses knew what they were doing for the most part but I would've been able to do there jobs. Not being conceited but I would've like to have their jobs. I didn't think I was paid for my skills set."
good,Target was a great place to work the pay was just to low. I would recommend this job for someone fresh out of school. If the pay was higher target would be the perfect place to work.
good,"From them I have gained numerous retail skills and one on one customer service skills. At Target I learned how to back stock and stock items, scan the store for product that was needed or to find locations, use the PDA/My Devices they provided. I also know how to use a pallet jack and am familiar with how to unload trucks to the line and to the pallets. They tought me the proper way to build a pallet and how to clean chemical spills. I have learned a lot of new things working at this job"
good,"Not a bad job for someone fresh out of college. Great pay short work week, but real long hours. Very little balance, however that's the industry not the company"
good,Didn't like the fact you have to have a open availability in order to get decent hours. Overall it was a ok job. I enjoyed my time working at Target. Still shop at Target.
good,"It's not difficult to get them to work around a college schedule, but this job does not pay much. I really recommend looking for something with a better salary if you need something to pay the bills."
good,"my boss called my girlfriend a hoe, I felt pressured to not go to HR, I've been moved to FOS, lied to there, told I was in so much trouble and it was always lies, I went crossed trained in service desk and sales floor, and was there for 3 years and was still lied to ."
good,Its fun to work at Target. Less Hours can't pay my bills. Overall people are very fun to work and we always work as a Team. Our Work is Easy to accomplished.
good,"It was great in the beginning but there's no room for advancement unless you brown nose your way up, at least at my store. And there's not much flexibility if you have a second job or want to go back to school."
good,"This is a fun environment to work for if you pick a good target. I've worked at 2, got fired from one because management said I was late when I wasn't. and it was a whole thing but the other target I worked for was great, never really had much issue with management, and the job was fun and people were great."
good,They are very organized and competitive and have a lot of work and usually are busy but they have poor managers and all they care about is getting people in and out of the store and I mean the workers. They give no chance to advance unless you are a favorite and they like you.
good,"work is good, you stay busy, there is always something to do. it takes a while to start earning benefits. the management cares about your breaks if you're a cashier."
good,Unorganized night shift.  Things change frequently and at the last minute. Supervisors were never around to get matters under control. You were timed to get your product on the shelves in an unreasonable time frame.
good,"My experience was OK. I was framed by my manager and lost my job but thankfully I found a better paying job. This store is nice but most guests are stuck up so most days you'll get rude guests that'll treat you like you're their servant. Management was changed about three to four times I worked there. Great hours but low pay, even as a Team Lead which is a floor supervisor/manager, the highest pay you'll get is 9.76."
good,"Target is a great place to work if you're looking for retail experience. Hardlines, softlines, guest service, cashier, you name it and you'll do it all in one shift. Coworkers are great and management is encouraging. There is always a helpful hand."
good,"Every about working here is average. It is what you make it. There isn't much to elaborate on except, like with any job promptness is key . Also have multiple red shirts"
good,"i feel like the only hours that you would get is working the mid day through night shiffts , which is kinda hard to do when you try to be home early and have a long drive home. we would get out around  1 or 2 in the morning"
good,"Typical work day was unload and receive product, learned a lot of warehouse knowledge, management was great at first but they go through managers left and right all of which come in with new ideas and try to change things up even if it doesn't work or help, hardest part was being in the freezer and cooler all day as it was a food warehouse, the best part by far was the coworkers."
good,"This is a great introductory retail place to work but the hours are often scarce and management promotions often seem to be based on popularity, not ability. A typical work day for the non-management worker is somewhere between 3-10 hours. No matter what your position, life/work balance can be difficult as your schedule is constantly moving around from early morning to late evening. The best part about Target is the people who work there. The hardest part of the job is trying to accomplish everything required of you within a very limited time frame."
good,"Job is easy just need to not mind moving all the time, but as for the shift your always working so the time goes by fast. The management is the reason i quit the managers were over doing it and i couldnt work with him anymore"
good,It was a fun place to work a lot of great people great friendships the the group leaders were good to work with they were fare with the work load our accomplished was always notice .
good,"Picked up shifts any chance I had work over 7 days straight. I worked food ave prepping cooking and serving food. Ring up customers, helped check out customers if front lanes got too busy."
good,"Where I worked it was really fast paced and busy. You had something to keep you busy most of the time. But Target in general isn't too bad of a place to start off. They have procedures and specific training that you do. You have set task to do but like all stores, you will eventually start doing everything and stuff out of your pay grade. Most of the time its friendly but you will always have off days and bad people. The only thing I did not like was the appreciation. Back when I first started, when you worked above and beyond, you would get free breakfast or a drink. Your bosses cared about you, or at least they tried. Now a lot of the good bosses have left and you have new management which are instructed to ""reward"" you by telling you they appreciate that you just did a 5 person job by yourself. Every now and then some one gets a free drink but a lot of the hard working employees are getting overlooked and they just stop putting out the extra work. Few people are noticed but most are left behind."
good,My Target leaves a lot to be desired and doesn't treat all employees the same. They do not allow flexibility in the schedule.
good,Target is a good company to work for under the right management. Enjoyed helping people with disabilities and making customers smile.
good,"I enjoyed my years at target but I believe its time to do something, I am not leaving for any bad reasons I do believe Target has future and I just need something with more hours and full time and retail is not always known for that."
good,"a typical day at work is from 8am to 3:30pm. you pick ur gadget and grab ur orders and start ur day at picking toys off shelfs and laying them out on the orders that's scattered on ur cart. I learned how to enter the toys and machines into the gadget, and how to read lables and enter them on the orders. management really was low class. theres only a couple people that supervise. your coworkers come 50/50 percent of the time most of the time u do other peoples job and still only get paid for what u do. no more and no less. the hardest part is always on ur feet and its a concrete floor. so hard on ur back. the most enjoyable part of ur job is u get to see every toy that target has and u get to see the new toys first."
good,Fast paced environment. Friendly co-workers. Not much room for advancement. Unloaded trucks in extreme weather conditions. Responsible for stocking shelves. Management was inexperienced with handling long time employees.
good,It was an okay job. Cool management and co workers. Short pay and seasonal position so really did not have a open experience.
good,"If you work at Target, you get schedules every week but never over 40 hours. To get the hours, you may have to work every day of the week to get the most hours."
good,"Target corporations taught me the foundations of team work and driving results. Great company."
good,"set up cash register check. Learned about sales management was good co-workers i got along with very well they made it enjoyable. Hardest part was selling credit cards to customers."
good,This place it not good for a person who is willing to do their job to their best ability and be recognized for it.They suck at promotions
good,"Typical night is unloading truck and push them into the assembly line for your fellow Team Members to pick them up and place them into their respective department pallets."
good,"Target's motto definitely adheres to the guest experience, but not the employment experience. I wish my tenure working there was MUCH faster than it ended up being. "
good,90% of the day is spent making sure product is front facing and everything is neat. Also when you are fixing everything on the shelves you are responsible for about 16 aisles and you are timed.
good,Never knew what your hours would be only 2 weeks in advance. You had to work holiday's. During the holiday's time off was very hard to get and you weren't always approved for time off. I love to shop there but it wasn't the workplace for me.
good,Working at Target was easy going and the employees were great and a typical day was dealing with money and customers. The hardest part of the job was learning how to do returns.
