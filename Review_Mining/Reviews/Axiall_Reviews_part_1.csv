rating,review
bad,"Long hours, management expected you to have no life outside of Axiall. "
bad,"I worked there for 20 years and never saw any women advance in my Dept except one, was never given the opportunity to test for a shift supervisor position. The management was unprofessional, and it was a place ruled by the ""Good-Ole-Boy"" mentality and nepotism. The pay was low, no retirement, no bonus, terrible 401K. "
bad,lack of management and order. it is not what you know it is who you know. also lack respect for the black operators. you numerous guys who work jobs that the company doesn't pay them for.
bad,Indeed is a great site for professionals and those seeking to expand in the job market. One should always keep their options open. It's a tough market.
bad,"Management struggles with direction of company, very high turnover. Not sure of the long term vision, poorly communicated to employees."
good,"We are and have been in a transitional state for over 5 years.  It seems as if the experienced employees are being passed over and ignored during the transition.  The plant is over 70 years old and can be very profitable however trying to follow a ""scheduled"" weekly priority list isn't very productive since the main objective is to keep things operational while being proactive in improvements.  Many new faces, lots of inexperience and plenty of sharp knives are present.  No room for upward movement unless you want to be status quo and nod your head yes when the answer is not yes.  The plant manager is from the steel business and I don't know if he is being told the truth about everything.  Seems like a focused guy but may not have the correct focus if he is not being told the truth."
good,Chemical plant environment hazardous. Good paying job but was hard on family life. I provided well but gave up quality time with my family.A means to an end.
good,There are opportunities in IT to be more forward thinking. There are also opportunities for better structure around IT processes and development.
good,"Lack communication, "
good,There is absolutely no clear direction in which we need to take the plant. Our plant goals are very unclear. Everyday is working on putting out the fire of the day.
good,"Fun and productive places to work. Great compensation, and an equal opportunity employer. Upper Management was very knowledgeable."
good,I gained valuable experience in chlorine manufacturing during the five years I worked at Axiall Corporation. Axiall had some of the best people to work with.
good,The facility has become a training ground for other industries. We are in a decline in experienced supervision and it shows in the production totals.
good,It was alright. Was hot in the summer and cold during the winter. Drive a fork lift. Charged materials into hoppers. Made plastic pellets and cvpc powder.
good,I like the job for the most part it was competitive and that's what type of work I like to perform. Everyday and all day there is something to be doing and that's what I like when Im on a job
good,Very good job. Supervisors were very good at helping the Staff and training workers on their machines.Co-Workers very friendly and helped with getting used to the machines.
good,Good company to work for with various acquisitions over the past 15 years that created challenging opportunities for myself and subordinates.
good,growing company that is great to work for. things are changing rapidly and opportunities exist with the company to grow
good,"I work in a chemical plant where very hazardous chemicals are made. I always need to be aware of my surroundings for my safety and the safety of my co-workers. Safety is of utmost importance in my position along with wearing and using the correct PPE for doing my job. Every day represents new challenges and new tasks depending on the plants maintenance needs. A typical day could consist of rebuilding pumps, fabrication off of drawings, replacing and installing new equipment, problem solving, carpentry and welding skills, pipe fitting and installation, daily PM of mobile and rotating equipment, working closely with a different partner every day. I look in advance at upcoming jobs to pre-plan for parts, manpower and equipment needs.The most difficult part of the job is dealing with the extreme heat in certain areas of the plant. The most enjoyable part of the job is completing a task, of high quality, that was assigned to me in a safe and timely manner."
good,"Annual bonuses, although we were just acquired by another Chemical company which pays quarterly bonuses, so we should be transitioning to that model."
good,Good company to work for.  Long 12 hour shifts.  Lots of overtime if u want it. Pay is good. Great people to work with.  Good stable job. would definitely refer a friend
good,Each Day Starts With A Brief Safety Meeting. Typical Guys Coming In Late As Usual And It Will Always Be Made Into A Big Deal So Don't Think Life's Sweet.  Do The Right Thing Work Learn & Experience To Elevate In Life. Be Careful Who You Allow To Have Access To Your Energy.
good,Great place to work. No stress and really family-friendly.  Great benefits program.  Kind of lacking in training department due to lot of people retiring.
good,Great environment to work in.  The employees enjoy the work they do.  Management is hands on with their people. Overall great place to work and enjoy.

good,The most satisfying aspect of working for Axiall was the friendly co-workers.The company structure emphasized interaction between employees and that supported idea exchange.Management at Axiall encouraged all employees to be active in working toward the common goal of making our company a success.
good,I started working at Axiall in 1995 as the Receptionist. I then got promoted to Administrative Assistant to the Sales Manager. In 2004 I was promoted to Legal Assistant. Axiall is a company that will promote within the company. My 18 years there was a very pleasant time. The company is growing. I had a great Management team in every position I was in. Co-workers were great and when I retired I still have contact with them. My job was never hard because I had great people to work under.
good,"pay is not good u learn a lot work schedule is real good. people are easy to get along with, easy to move up not a lot of overtime."
