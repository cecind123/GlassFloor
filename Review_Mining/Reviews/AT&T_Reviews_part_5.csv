Very fast pace so I had this ""Make things happen"" attitude to make sure all projects were completed by the designated timelines. The ""Team"" concept has always stood out for me. So, if a co-worker need help on projects, step up & help out because if he or she fails, it does effect the whole team. The hardest part of the job is someone get's hurt or killed on one of my projects because someone forgot that safety on a job comes first. No matter what!!! The most enjoyable part of the job is that the job was completed without anyone getting hurt. Project time lines were met. Customer satisfaction rating hopefully goes up."

good,I found working at DIRECTV to be a great place to work. An 8 hour shift seemed like a 5 hour shift. From my first day in training to my last day working there I never had an off day. It was one job that I really enjoyed. If your looking for a job with great pay and supreme benefits I suggest you consider a career with DIRECTV.
