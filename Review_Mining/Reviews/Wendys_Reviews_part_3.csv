good,"typical day at work consisted on multitasking, talking to customers, cleaning, cooking, etc. i learned not to be so shy and speak up when something is wrong. The coworkers where very united and we made a good team work."
good,"I don't regret working for fast food because the foot-traffic volume always kept me busy and prepared me for work environments like it. Was never really a fan of working for fast food because of the smell that latches onto you and your clothes, and the job becomes worse if management sucks. Most of the time, the treatment and the wage are not worth the effort you're required to put in, but it is a great prep job for the working world for those who have no experience."
good,The people here are very nice to work with and always has fun. The company is always looking ahead and wants you to succeed within the company. This company is a good company to work for
good,come in and start working i learned hard work the managers was mean all black people the hardest part is maintain a positive vibe enjoyable part is getting all work done

good,Gave me a place to work and a experience as a young adult in the work field. I would recommend this job to anyone starting in the work field. but not a place to stay at for the rest of your life.
good,Fun to work with other crew members. Agree that the salary is low and some people deserved to be paid more. Some do nothing and get $8.25 while others do a lot and get the same amount which is wrong.
good,It was fun working there because the team that you have there is very diverse. People help out each other when it gets very busy and hectic. The management is a bit unorganized but they're nice enough to tell you when you're not needed anymore.
good,You're being underpaid for a lot of work. It will be better if employees was getting paid at least $10 an hour. Dealing with irate customers for minimum wages is not right.
good,Wendy's prides itself on promoting from within. They have developed new programs to be fast tracked into a management position and earn promotions. Very understaffed so a lot of room for overtime. Not the best place if you have anxiety.
good,"Perform a wide range of duties; customer service, cashier, bagger, cook, clean, inventory, etc. Followed established procedures, works with team member as needed to promote a smooth operation"

good,Treat people like you would treat your own family member. Have compassion at the same time have order and discipline. Show the good employees that you appreciate them more.
good,A typical day at Wendy's is for the employees to go in and know what they are going to do. You are greeted with a friendly staff and people who will help you during your working shift. Everyone is capable of completely their daily task while also being able to assist with maintaining the restaurant.
good,"wendys is a fast food restaurant the require well cooked food.. well customer service .. and quick hands. the hardest part about this job is not reaching the customer satisfaction.. and the most enjoyable part is giving the customer just what they desire.here i learned its not about the work that you do, but its the pride that you have in your work."

Know how to serve the customer, have a good team and enjoy and have the passion for what you do."
good,Supervisors need to pay attention to what is going on within the store at all times. lack a communication and lack of respect.
good,Wendy's was a great job to work at and i think it would be a good fit for anyone who is looking for their first job. They are really caring and collaborative as a whole group.

good,It is a great place to work. People are like family there. They have incentive programs that really help the moral of the company. The management will help you if you are ever in need
good,I worked at wendys for over 10 years and the lack of hours and pay caused me to leave the company I was not treated fairly when I was a manager and when I was a crew I was always in the window and never got a break from it at all it caused me to ask for extra days off so I could rest
good,They stay on tract and focus what’s important. They treat everyone with kindness and respect. They  were always there if you had a problem. Very flexible schedule also.
good,"It was busy all the time, crew got along well, had a great manager, opened and closed the store, and expanding my skills while I was there, but had to relocate."
good,"You learn a lot about what people like and how they like it. This job also shows you that you cant always go off first impressions. Nobody is who they say they are, some people are more into just the job and not the customers."
good,"It is stressful sometimes but its fun to just see the customers happy, the crew you have to work with dont corporate with you sometimes. The manegers are cool with you and chill"

good,Well me personally I am not the cashier type. So I would recommend this job for people who love working with cash registers. Other than that I loved the work there. They give you discounts. The food is great. & it's busy most of the time. If your working in the front or by the drive threw.
good,it was a very balanced place to work for a person in highschool. i would recommend the job for a person only who it andvacing through their years of adolecence only .
good,"I worked at Wendy’s for over a year. I started off being paid $8.25. After a year I got a very minor raise. I liked the managers and my coworkers were great, I just felt that I should be paid more for the work I did there."
good,"Loved it, taught me hard, fast & time management. Awesome bosses & easily completed tasks. Most other fast food places are seemingly dull & mindfully boring."
good,It was a fast paced fast food company. Set hours with hourly pay and minimal wage. The management there was good for the most part. They handled problems internally and externally very well.
good,Every job has its bad workers and it's great workers. This restaurant had two or three bad workers and dozens of great people. I would recommend Wendy's as a first job for anybody because you will learn hard work and friendship.

good,It is a family friendly restaurant.  The people are always happy and smiling. I like great customer service. Always service with a smile. Blast is the best way to handle an upsetting situation.

good,"Days at work can be stressful with always having to rush and every so often a rude customer coming by or complaints, but what I enjoy is meeting new people and seeing the usual customers because the nice ones really brighten up my day. Also a good manger will ease your shift; either easing to a smooth or hectic day."

good,I never had any problems working with Wendy’s. Always felt like I was apart of a family while working here. Loved the fast pace and upbeat environment when working here.
good,Had a wonderful and eye opening experience working for Wendy’s I took away from the job many skills not only that will even used in my future work experience but also everyday life.
good,Liked the people that I worked with. Was a easy job to do just very fast paced and very hot. The GM of the store was a good hearted person. Training was very boring though.
good,I was doing the weekly stock take and ordering and answering the phone and managing the store when the boss was away or on days off. I had the role of keeping all the daily taking off the premises of at the end of the day
good,you have to do sandwiches make them right working in pick up window make sure you get the right amount cook buns wash dishes make bacon help the front counter.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's was very quick paced and busy."
good,it was a great start and I always stayed active and I enjoyed meeting new faces and over the time a lot of faces became very familiar I loved the work family
good,"Wendy's is a great place to work. The staff is great and the customers are great as well. The day is what you make of it. The hardest part of the day is lunch. The lunch rush is crazy, but when you have a great team it gets better. Being able to interact with customers, and being apart of a team is enjoyable for me."
good,I really enjoyed working for the company. As I advanced in my career I was given the chance to go for the assistant manager which allowed me to travel to different stores.
good,"Not the best job in the world thats for sure, but it is a job. I felt unappreciated at time, but i did my job anyways, its fast food and you just have to keep moving. I say some good management because some manegers were easier to work with than others"
good,"as my first job it was great. I made a ton of money at a young age, I learned the company and how to build myself as a hard dedicated worker for further employment."
good,"I loved the job, but the only reason i stopped working here was because I ended up moving far away from the location. Management was awesome and very understanding."
good,"I did learn a lot about myself in my time working here, a lot of my customer service skills started here when I worked on the front counter or in the drive-through. The co-workers I had were always great in fact I still keep in touch with a few today. Besides the lunch rushes because the Wendy's I worked at was just behind a school, it was relaxed work, just a lot of upkeep."
good,I started working at Wendy's when I was 16 years old and worked my way up to assistant manager when I put my two week notice in. The job was just not stable enough and lost my desire to work for the company once they were bought out by corporate.
good,I love working I cant go a day without working  I am looking for a new job to get back on my feet and help my wife out with the bills I hope god bless me with the right job .
good,"Wendy's was more about the people then the job in itself. My team was the most lovable people you would ever meet. A typical day was pretty simple, assigned a position and then you do what you do best. I think the hardest part of the job was running out of stuff in the middle of a rush and thats about it. Like I said the most enjoyable part was your team, you got to bond with and grow together. If you are in need of making/meeting new, amazing people then Mission Wendy's is defs the place for you. You should be able to multitask pretty well if I may add haha."
good,"Buen empleador, cumplen con los pagos como corresponden, tienen un buen sistema de integración, mucha capacitación para lograr comprender su metodología de trabajo."
good,"A typical work day at Wendy's is to clock in have a small meeting to see who is doing what that day, go to your assigned area, stock and clean your area. I was always a cashier so I would restock the dinning room and the front counter and I would also clean the table, counters and the bathrooms. I would take orders and I would handle the money."
good,It had a good workplace environment as long as certain managers weren't around. A manager had a habit of leaving at random. Another would intentionally shut down the system just because he didn't like the pace or wanted a break. These actions would sometimes put huge stress on us because it left us with angry customers to deal with.
good,its okay to work I enjoyed it they gave me  more hours freindly people most of them   if you call in  they will understand less right ups organized schedual
good,I loved working at Wendy's. The company relocated due least number of sale also of location. I wish to find jobs more like Wendy's hiring Managers role positions like Wendy's
good,"I enjoyed my time working with the company, we had great employees and management. Good clean working environment and I would definitely refer anyone to work with the company"
good,"wendy""s is fair company,and i will not dissrepect them.i know i will help any company grow or at least get compliments.with that said i have patience manners and respect"
good,More knowledge about the company gives you opportunity to he promoted right away. Proper work attirement and following work schedule is important. Team work is the key.
good,"Food prepping and rotating of food and produce in inventory.. Preparing of food to company requirements, and customer service.. Work was customer based and important.."
good,i like food a lot really chicken so making it was not very hard. I work evenings so that was dinner for me almost every night. i would like to work here again.
good,Fast food is very fast pace and the crew doesnt have much space to move. so you all need to pretty much work together. No and do customer service and to be kind to all the customers.
good,they want to be a very hard worker and you have to learn alot of positions its not very hard you get to work with all types of people and you get great customer experince
good,I happened to run the strip location which was fast paced but a lot of fun. I enjoyed working here for the past 11 years but the location is closing in the end of September
good,"While working at Wendy's, I learned the importance of always being focused, especially when it comes to the specific area your establishment is located in. My workplace was located within a college living area, so the important thing to remember was to always be on alert for any customers ranging in various groups sizes at different times of the day."
good,I enjoyed working with everyone from rush to no rush. Taught me a lot like cleaning and patience and collaborating with my peers. The management takes a little  to get use to at first but everyone helps you along the way. The hardest part of the job is getting a yearly raise after your first year but the most enjoyable part is meeting new people everyday.
good,It was a great experience! Would suggest to anyone needing a job. The store manager was always understanding and very helpful to any problem. She always made sure her employees were took care of.
good,Working at Wendys was a good experience . Although it could be a little busy at times I was able to manage to make sure the customers were satisfied. I was 16 working there so i wasnt allowed to prepare food so I worked as a cashier and I was able to greet customers and make sure customers would leave happy with a smile.
good,"Wendys was a cool place to work at while I was still attending school, after school it just felt highly unnecessary to work somewhere that wasnt helping me reach the level i was trying to get to."
good,"A typical work day is showing up ten minutes early.Ten minutes gives you enough time to use the restroom and do what you have to before clocking in for your shift. Clock in and open grills, make sure that all cooking appliances are washed and sanitized properly, stock, wipe down grills and make sure there's enough meat stocked in both refrigerators. Cook meat on time and be sure to help co-workers out if they need help. Team work is a way to get to know your co-workers better and with team work it is the most enjoyable part of the job,working together improves everyone and it is helpful."
good,"Wendy’s is a great place to work. It is fast paced, challenging and rewarding. The pay isn’t great but the job is a lot of fun. The management is great and co workers are like family."
good,People worked very will under me and took instructions will written and verbal. Wanted to get into something different and wanted to get my own stores
good,"Over all, Interesting fun people to work with, faced paced busy busy busy, opening at 4 Am, knew both Breakfast and Lunch menus and worked between 4-10 hours in a day."
good,"Ran the cash register; cleaned the lobby, bathrooms, vacuumed the lobby, swept and mopped the lobby and bathrooms, grill, fryer, took orders through the drive thru and made sandwiches."
good,Wendys was my first job and was a very good experience for me for a first job. There were good people to work with and easy to work with. very good and caring store manager.
good,my day would consist of greeting customers making sure they have a clean dining area to enjoy their food. There were many pros and cons but the best part was i loved the environment interacting with customers and the unbearable part was the cleanliness in the store.
good,Working at Wendy’s was very relaxed it was one of the chillest jobs I have ever had. The pay was low and all and overtime wasn’t always given but the managers were so good they really worked with you.
good,It was very open and everyone always was nice and polite until the drug addicts would come in and become very annoying because of there habits...sneaking in ngvthe bathroom to get high.
good,"Perfect for a first starter looking to build a career and enhance a little education at the same time ! Managers are always looking for the next promotion ready crew members, and has fun while doing it!"
good,"This is a good comoany to work for. The General Manager was very dedicated to the company, and strived to have the best restaurant possible. The District Manager was also very dedicated to company policy."
good,Job is really nice. They have good set of managers although something that are done aren’t fair. But it’s very nice place to work as a minor or just a place to work to earn easy money
good,"everyday we had something new going on. we was always laughing and playing around but when it got time to gwt,busy and do our jobs we all worked really well as a team."
good,It was fun for my first job very easy. Learned people skills. I was able to learn how to work with others and how to start conversations. Good way to meet new people.
good,"Grill cook, also prep food, customer service, "
good,"Always come in full uniform  before you clock on At any job you should always come in with a great attitude , and a smile. Always think positive no matter what your outcome of your day."
good,fun work place. The salary was just not enough. i do recommend young teens to work there if they are still in school. the mangers there are fantastic.
good,It’s was a good job for the time being. They started cutting down my hours. So little by little I was get less pay to where I was working 3 jobs at a time. But overall you get 50% off meals and if you’re a first time worker it’ll be a great job for you.
good,Good work environment  a lot of responsibilitie would learn a lot about people and yourself prep good door for people meet a lot of good people learn how to speak to people
good,I wish I could have stayed but cause I had pregnancy complications I had to quit. It was a great experience for me. They are very good at team work and helping me out when needed.
good,its not a bad company it is perfect for someone in high school or in college and the pay is ok for just getting started in the working world. i dont have anything bad to say about it.
good,It definitely was a good job for an teenager but I had to move on and find something I could see myself doing for a long time and I'm still looking...
good,i enjoyed working at Wendy's it was job friendly and was excellent in team work i enjoyed the communication within the company and the employers to care of their worker's and educated them on safety.
good,Wendy's have great food. Sometimes it's short of staff so you have to move in a faster pace then usually . You have to keep calm and stay productivee.

good,"For me a typical workday would be coming threw the door and fixing all the mistakes, that were made or not previously done the night or day before. I was a Co- manager so I was responsible for counting the draws, ordering product, hiring and firing employees and trusted with cash policies and procedures. My highest priority was customer satisfaction and cleanliness. Making sure the store meets its highest standards on a daily basis. I think the hardest part of the job was all the hours that was required with a salary paying Job its unpredictable."

good,A typical day at work was usually busy around 12pm to like 2pm because it is around the time people take their lunch breaks. I learned how to work the front registers.
good,This job is perfect if you want a career in fast food. They give raises about every six months. You also earn paid days off which is great in case you are unable to work for some reason.
good,i would start by taking orders to the customers. making sure that i gave the right order and greet them and become friendly with them. it gave new possibilities in finding new jobs.
good,This was a good experience to learn the food industry and the many different protocols required to be the best in the job position that I held. Learned the importance of customer service.

good,Wendys was my first job and i had been working the for a month when out of the blue they decided to cut my hours to less then ten hours a week. i was very displeased and went to find a new job
good,Working in a fast food place you have to be able to do multiple jobs and if you mess up you usually end up doing the dirty work and managers sometimes don’t care
good,"My coworkers and management are very positive, fun, energetic, have a good work ethic, and we work in a clean friendly store. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the training of new people and working double shifts. I love multitasking and  being busy on my feet and alert."
good,Working at Wendys is very enjoyable. It's a fast pace environment as well as it is diverse. Management is good for the most part. Hardest part would be to actually have a hundred percent of happy customers. the easiest i would say would be actually trying.

good,I worked at Wendys for a year and a few moths. I was in highschool when i worked there and the job was not hard. I flipped burgers and took orders. It was first job and helped me learn how to work.
good,"My managers were very rude even when I was being nice, This was my first job and it was not a very good experience. The managers ate on the clock and were mad when you disturbed them. They said they wouldn't work with me if I got a second job to make up for the lack of hours and they called me names if i messed something up"
good,"I worked with my family so some days were hectic, but it was fun while I was there. The shifts were good and the hours were excellent as I always had a smile on my face after recieving my bi-weekly pay cheques."

good,I've worked here for a several years and it is basically everything that you'd expect from a typical fast food restaurant. Though the turn over rate is high its still a decent place to work.
good,"I would go into my work place, clock in an approach the shift manger so that I could be assigned to a position for the shift I was working. I learned how to communicate with others and how to work as a team. The hardest part of the job was when we was short an employee or two and we didn't really have help. I enjoyed learning customers names and greeting them as they walk through the door by name. I also enjoyed working with people I didn't really know."

good,"Working the cash register of the drive thur window was a bit of a challenge, having to multitask taking orders in one ear and grabing money, and haning out the right order was a bit rough. But with the help of my fellow coworkers we got the job done."
good,There was never a shortage and of great people to work with but there were quite a few who would just stop a well oiled machine because it wasn't to there liking for what ever reason but other than that amazing people to be around every day
good,"A typical day at work would consider me of doing my duties of a cook and a cleaner. I would cook on the grill make burgers, cook chicken, operate the fryers and make drinks. I would also clean work stations thoroughly, serve orders to people at tables counters and drive-thrus."
good,"typical fast food environment, ""What can you do for me today."" I bring a consistent work ethic and have fun while @ this company. They offer fair wages for what is performed."
good,"it's ok to work at, the crew is close and the management is like family.  Just feel like you're there all the time and there is a lot of favoritism in stores as far as promotions."

good,"Co-workers are always friendly and want to help, but there isn't always time to learn the necessary skills to move up in management. A lot of times, you will be tasked with more than one position at a time, which leads to a very exhausting shift. Breaks are also somedays not always fleshed out and may skip a 10 minute break. Minimum wage, with a 2.5% raise upon promotion."
good,"good place to work, learned a lot of customer service skills. good for someone in high school , closing shift and dinner rush is high paced . first job as a kid."
good,A typical day at Wendy's is fast paced but with great customer service. I have learned leadership skills while becoming an open manager. Management is flexible with schedules for work hours as well as time off. One of the hardest parts of the job is when a fellow employee fails to attend work which leads the store shorthanded. However one part that is enjoyable is they give me my complete 30 minute break.

good,customers at one point did get very annoying. some would shout and not be patients which got hard to deal with. overall it was close to home so i was able to walk to work

good,"Typical day at work pretty much consists of making sandwiches and helping customers in a friendly way. I learned how to deal with customers. Hardest part of the job is probably working in rush hour. Most enjoyable, meeting new employees and interacting with customers."
good,"A typical day in the life of an employee working at Wendy's, we would prep all the salads to have enough for lunch.  We would cut lettuce and many other mornings routines, and when it was time to open we would drop the chicken, fries and other morning items."

good,"I would come in to work, clock in and then go to the back and see where I'm located. If I am at back cash I count my drawer and make sure it has $150. Once I calculate the amount I put it into the drawer by the back cash window and then get to work. I take people card or cash and make sure I charge them the right amount and give them their right amount of change. When my shift is over I print the receipt of how much we made and then take that amount out I have and put it in our drop box and make sure I have $150 in my drawer again.

It can be challenging when there is a lot of people going through the drive through and you have to make sure you give everybody the right amount and make sure everybody pays."

good,A typical day at work at Wendy's was very high paced but very simple at the same time. I didn't mind the pace at all however it did sometimes get repetitive at times. At this job I learned patience. Upset customers can be very demanding. The hardest part of the job is when your fellow co-workers don't show up. Also even though the customers can be tough to deal with at times they are definitely the best part of the job.

good,"The atmosphere is very inviting, the employees are the best part. They make your shifts better because everyone is friendly and always cracking jokes. The work can get hectic and difficult but it becomes easier the more you do it. I learned a lot about multi-tasking, time management (since I was in university at the same time).

good,"I loved my shift managers, they were very understanding and gave me a shift of 11-5 so I could at least have some family tyme.  The workplace dynamic is hectic (like any fast food restaurant) but fun if you have a team that is willing to work together.  I worked fries often and the worst part about my job was when I would need to drop fries/nuggets/fish and I would get five people yelling that they needed a bunch of things all at once from several different registers and drive through.  The hardest part of my job was knowing when to just go ahead and make them wait so I could drop to keep up with the demand.  I was the only one on fries most of the tyme so I had tymes when I couldn't be in two places at once.   The best part of the job (for me) was when a customer would wait until my register was open so they could see me.  I wasn't on register often but when I was they knew it and they loved me.  It was very rewarding that way.  I like making people smile."

good,The work is good but you will not be subject to the labor laws and break regulations at this employer. I was blamed by the manager for not getting my 30 minute lunch per 5 hours of work. It is not the employees job to do the managers job.
good,They are very flexible with my hours. I have learned a lot about customer service and improve my communication skills. A typical day a Wendy's depends on the school season activities that determines how busy Wendy will be for that day.

good,"Basically everything was good working here. I enjoyed the team and even the managers were nice. Only thing I had a problem with was that I was apparently hired as a summer seasonal staff member but was never told that so when it slowed down, they said they didn't have a need for me so I was out of work after 2mo."

Management was always present. The hardest part of the job is the fast pace you must keep up with. Yet, the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to have the work day over quickly."
good,Working there was fun most of the time because i had very friendly coworkers who were willing to help when you needed it. I learned how to run a register and how important customer service is. The management was good and understanding when you may need time off. The hardest part of the job was working with extremely difficult customers
good,"I worked everyday typically a 3-12, which is considered night shift. extremely easy place to work at I caught on to everything quiet easily and had awesome trainers to teach me how to do the job correctly. I learned cash handling, costumer service, and food handling. Management was great, I never had a problem with any of the managers, even the district manager was great. they were extremely reasonable people. and when there was a problem they wouldn't address you in an improper was more of a leadership way of addressing an issue. My coworkers were great with cooperation and we managed to work together quite well. the hardest part of my job would be the stress when we get rushes, because some machines do break down or maybe we have a coworker who is having an off day and it can be pretty stressful trying to meet every costumers needs. most enjoyable part of the job were my employees, I always enjoyed coming to work and whomever I was working with that day."

good,They were dedicated to providing customers with quality foods. They always were willing to work with differing schedules which made working there great. It was a good environment to work in.
good,"Fast paced environment friendly coworkers and management.  Expectations that are set are realistic. Most days are uneventful you will work hard and need to be a team player.   Long hours and flexibility with your hours is always helpful due to unforeseen staff shortages. You will not always be able leave at your scheduled times. Working with the same crew members you become a family. Hard work, fast paced and in drive thru we have time goals that are set for the hour to ensure customer satisfaction.

good,Wendys was a very organized and well productive company with so many things to do. Wendys was a company were your customers became your priority.
good,A typical day at Wendy's was usually a intense rush. If you wasn't ready for all to come you would mess up the rotation on the shift and potentially get sent on break. You had to be quick an prepared everyday and be willing to work as a team.
good,"Just like every fat food resturant wendy's has its ups and down. The typical day consisted of greeting customers with a smile, making sure that each customer was taken care of, and that they were satisfied with their customer service that day. I would do so by offering them the opportunity to fill out a survey letting me know i how i did that day online which would in return get them two dollars off of any big salad or sandwich."

good,"I'm always assigned in opening shift because i'm also studying in that time. I learned how to communicate and how to work in a team and how to manage my time in studying while working. My co-workers we threat ourselves as a family, and it help a lot for being a productive in our store. The hardest part of my job is when one of my co-workers will resign to find other opportunity.

What i have learned is how to deal with angry costumers while remaining calm and collective. All of our managers are good hard workers that treat us with respect. Other co-workers always make work fun and enjoyable, they are always so kind to customers and I. The hardest part of my job would be the pace of the work, I have to get the food out in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of my job would be getting to meet new people everyday."
good,"A typical day of work consists of making sure correct procedures are getting followed and keeping the customers happy."
good,"My typical day at work consists of clocking in and washing my hands, say hello to everyone, smile and enjoy my day. I've learned a lot of patience and responsibility working here. We have great management, but my co-workers need to step up their game. Hardest part of the job is getting a big order and having to get it out within a sufficient amount of time. The most enjoyable part of my day is seeing everyone's smile, knowing I satisfied them."
good,"Each day was always different, but my work duties always remained the same, co-workers were all good people with uplifting moods, energetic environment.

Shifts are a decent length and cleaning is not that much of a hassle, I loved working at my Wendy's."
good,"A typical day at wendy's would be me coming in and the managers letting me know what position i was to work that day. usually i would be put on grill or on drive thru. When i was on the grill position my duties were to drop the chicken, the strips, and the meat for the different sandwiches. When i was on drive thru a typical day was taking orders and making drinks while someone else would put the orders together and give the food to the customers. I think the funnest part was getting a good time. Every day was a challenge starting with a time of 132 and having to bring it down to a good time of 90 or 100. the best time i had was 82 and my boss was really happy about this. If i ever worked night shifts my duties were to close the grill station make sure everything was nice and neat for the morning and if there was a new person i would train and evaluate them for the managers and boss."

Otherwise, it was fun to be at work interacting with co-workers and customers. People were very nice and it felt like a second family."
good,This is a fast paced business but is committed to training the Management staff and employees to handle the rush. They teach you to maximize your staff to get the best for every rush hour you encounter while not blowing labor. In this business you have to be taught food projections and when to increase drops and when to start slowing down and not over cooking food as not to blow food cost.  There is a strategy about this and it is a numbers game.
good,"A typical day working at Wendy's was, productive. I always felt like I got in and kept busy so the time went by fast. I stocked the stations, took orders in the drive through and at the front counter, prepped the line and cleaned. Working at Wendy's I learned how important time management and production is. You have to know the most valuable  things to do when you have down time so when it gets busy again your ready and confident. I would say the hardest part of my job was trying to see eye to eye with my co-workers and their point of views of what we should be doing but I enjoyed being motivated and energized to just get things done."
good,Good place to gain your customer service skills. You get 50% off purchases for an Employee discount. Offer good hours for the people that show hard work.
good,"Wendys was a great job. Good management. Good enough hours, not enough overtime. The people were friendly and helpful for the most part."
good,I like how are the managers. the are really helpful. I have learn some much at wendys specially multitasking. they are super organize and we always have one goal which is to make our costumers happy. We always want to offer the best costumer service to them.
good,I was very happy working with my coworkers. I had a great time while I was there. My only complaint was the lack of hours. I learned what working for a great team was really like
good,"a lot of friendly faces at the location i used to work, fast sometimes but not impossible, good management and good food, good breaks but could use a better pay rate"
good,I actually enjoyed working for this company. Met a lot of nice people. The pay was okay. It was what I expected it to be. You got free food on your breaks and lunches.
good,"The work environment was wonderful, my coworkers were great. They always made sure work was fun for me, there was no bad day. Working there was a breeze when you do what you're supposed to do."
good,"My typical day at work was at the fry station making fries , nuggets , etc. "
good,"A typical day at work was very exciting and busy. We had the very funny co-workers and then we had people that were very quiet. No matter what happened though , we were always able to get the customers in and out and provide them with great service."
good,Definitely one of the best fast-food company's you can work for. I especially enjoyed the customers or at least most of them.
good,Had lots of fun working for wendy's. Seen an serve a lot of different people who came there every day. Lots of people love to eat at wendy's management was great.
good,good place to start your first job like I did. You grow and make friends with different people who you can make family. You learn a lot about customer service
good,"This job was pretty good as far as fast food goes! Managers were great! They worked well with any schedule, very flexible. Coworkers oftentimes weren't the best of workers. The shifts could be quite long, but this was good for gaining hours. Breaks were lacking most days unless you worked more than 8 hours."
good,"I learned so many interpersonal skill with my employment at Wendy's. As a crew member, I learned all positions. As management I learned to work with team members of all ages. I was able to adapt quickly to any task and think fast on my feet."
good,I worked full time for Wendy's while I was in school. It was a good balance from work and school and I was able to accomplish all I needed to without difficulty.
good,"Although I enjoyed working here, management was ehhh. I was fultime and in school. It was very hectic. management sucks"
good,I worked well at this location the fellow employees were hard working and enjoyable company and the management was attentive to the needs of the staff. I enjoyed the opportunity.
good,"Enjoyed working here, there were nice employees, overall nice customers and a fast-pace working environment. I would honestly not eat there again, and i haven't since i quit working there after i witnessed some of the things that had happened there. But that was just mostly the employees that were working there at the time."
good,This was a great job. I learned a lot of customer service skills at this job. And also I learned to be a team member. I enjoyed cooking and making burgers and making sure that each customer left with a smile on their face.
good,I've worked for Wendy's for 3 years and enjoyed every minute of it. As I learned new things I was able to pass it along to other new people that were new to the job.
good,i loved working here. the night shift was easy and laid back. i enjoyed coming into work. the schedule was flexible and the work was easy.
good,"Everyone gets alone and work as a team to get the job done. "
good,I liked it because you constatly worked and there wasn't stopping you had to make the customers happy at all possibe and i really liked my manager because she was relaxed and layed back
good,"The first in Waterford, WAS GREAT! great people, great management that only con was the A-rate customers but that wasn't that big of an issue. I loved it here and would have stayed if I didn't have to move and relocate. The one in Detroit however, coworkers sucked, management sucked, I didn't have direct relation to the customers here."
good,"Fairly simple work once you get the hang of it, can be very fun as long as your crew is fun. i was a closer so getting off before 2 wasnt a guarantee."
good,some flaws but that bad.  lots of fun.  good people but not food..good starter job for the young people. mad Asst. Manager in 2yrs.
good,i enjoyed the brief time i was employed with wendys it was def a differnt expirence from working in nursing home i just wish i had more time to grow with that paticular company
good,"On a typical day at work you can learn how to do multiple things and still manage to have fun. You can learn how to take orders, prep food, work the cashier and so much more. The co-workers made working there even more great there was never a problem. The hardest part of the job was washing dishes, the most enjoyable part of the job was taking orders and making the customers smile."
good,On a typical I would come into work and make sure that the lobby is well taken care of and sauces and straws/ napkins are stocked. After clocking in I would clean up any messes that needed to be cleaned up and taken care of. Once this was complete I would take care of customer needs at the front register or the drive thru register depending on where I was placed for the day. Towards the end of my shift I would double check everything that needs to be stocked and prepare the items for the next incoming shift members.
good,"Everyday was a great day. I loved the customers and my co-workers no matter what Wendy's store I worked at, everyone was super friendly!"
good,I had a great day at wendys  everyday of the week and I learn alot of differnt ways to make sandwhich and the co works and management was great to work with and there was no hard day at wendys cause everybody did there jobs and we all had the best times working at wendy
good,everything is fast you have to be fast the pay is ok for first job but it could be better management is great and everyone make you feel welcome
good,"When I first started at Wendy's i was very timid and wouldn't talk much. The staff there really made me feel welcomed. However, during my time as a Wendy's crew member, I noticed there were certain people who enjoyed stirring up drama which is one of the reasons I'm looking to leave."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's is very fun. Work comes first, I am mainly on Grill as the cook or on sandwiches as the sandwich maker. This is a great company I've learned how interact more so many different people at all times. I have also learned how to help other when help is needed or just when things is getting a little out of hand as far as work. The management is not the best , but i would say that Wendy's have great managers,m very active, helpful, and patient. My coworkers love to work because its a different place everyday , as far as a different team , customers , and different orders. The hardest part of the job which I find myself doing so many times is Grill. Its the hardest because you have to prepare fresh , quality product for our customers. Also, is any sandwich maker needs something on their station you have to try your best to get that as soon as possible, Basically everyone in the store depends on you, which I personally love because I have a big leadership role at my job . The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers, they are great nice, caring , respectful and more!"
good,I wanted to work at this job to get experience of the fast pace environment. I got the to work as a team with other to accomplish our common goal which was to take care of our customers needs.
good,"- As soon as I clocked in I would make sure everything was in line with the fryer and chicken nugget's. My manager would bounce me from the cashier to the fryer through out the day. At the end of the day I would wash dishes and mop the floors."
good,"It was my first real job while in high school. I learned basic food prep, customer service and general job duties. Everyone that worked there was so nice, helpful and friendly. The hours were kind of rough but not too bad."
good,"I would clock in, speak to everyone with a smile, start my position, it gets really busy but I always could handle the pressure of multi-tasking. Get a lunch break for 30 minutes. The managers were compromising. I love a challenge everything I learned was a good experience."
good,"I worked here for over a year and it did not really have much incentives. Only got a raise because it was required. Hard to get hours, but overall had fun crew members."
good,"A day at Wendy would be me coming to work and being greeted by co workers and smiles. Throughout the day it got busy but as a team,Me and my co-workers handled it. We were a Wendys family. Moving on, Wendys taught me always think positive and keep a steady work place. I learned how to move quick but still provide quality customer service. The hardest part sometimes i guess would be if the store didn't have enough product to make because then we would have to explain to costumers and sometimes  they get angry but those who do stay still get the up most service and respect. So overall i enjoyed Wendy everyday and i really appreciated being apart of a Wendys family."
good,Its a Fast Food Place. I really enjoyed taking orders helping Customers. I learned how to have very good patients dealing with angry customers. The hardest part of the job was keeping it cool when your getting cursed out.
good,"I do not have much to say about this place of employment as I was not here long because I was young and wanted to focus on school. From what I know, the managers treated employees well and gave out plenty of hours to those who deserved them. I have no complaints about this restaurant."
good,"work around your school schedule"
good,"A typical day at work was waking up around 8am to get ready for work, I would open at 10am with 5 others in the building. We would laugh and get the restaurant ready for many customers. As a floor employee a name given to the grill cooks, i was responsible for performing multiple tasks at once. So the hardest part of my job was probably just timing and finishing all my tasks given to me. Examples of this would be grilling beef, frying chicken and stirring chili all around the same time, I also worked the back window for drive thru orders. My job was very enjoyable throughout most of it,my favorite parts being my employees. I was very sociable at work but was able to finish all my tasks on time. I found the difficulty in being a friend to everyone while trying to get my tasks done. Keeping a healthy work environment with all your peers is important after all for stability at the job. There were approximately 3 rush periods a day where it was constant work and on the days it was slow I would spend it cleaning the restaurant until 6pm when i would be free to go."
good,"Overall, I liked the people I worked with. I can't say I liked the job I did, let alone the wage. I'm in a financial struggle and Wendy's can't provide for me, hence me looking for another job."
good,A typical day at my work is pretty fun but also stressful. Almost all the employees are fun and very nice. I have learned to have better responsibilities. The hardest part of the job would be keeping a god fast pace to make people happy. The most enjoyable part of my job would be the other employees there.
good,I got my work station ready whether i was making sandwiches or working register. Made sure the orders were right. I learned how to work well with others. The managers were polite and helpful. My co-workers were nice and helped each other out when it was needed. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with lunch hour rush. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and helping the customers.
good,"physically demanding ,long hours ,minimul pay for services.hourly wise they give you plentyof them if your goal is a job while in school or just to supplement income,THEN it is for u"
good,"If pay is what your looking for you are in the wrong place. There is a good chance to move u from employee to management if you please, but the pay grade does not change very much. Not intended to be a career for most."
good,"*I usually work from 8-9 pm to 2-30 am."
good,Everyday was excellent getting to meet with the customers and the regulars who came in! It was truly a friendly environment!
good,"The management team really works well with the employees and make sure they hire hard working staff members. Being in the mall, it is very fast paced but not very stressful because the team worked well together"
good,Every day we served hundreds of customers and worked in a very fast paced environment. I enjoyed the relationships I developed with my co-workers and customers. The job was always rewarding.
good,I was a cashier so I would run the till make sure their was correct change given to customers and clean the store pretty easy job that was my day there

Management is friendly, easy to talk to, and very understanding. All my co-workers are great to work with and we all get along. The hardest part is the lunch rush, but I find it fun because it gives me a challenge. The most enjoyable part is just working in a good environment."

good,"concentrates on customer service to assure each customer has a very satisfied visit each and every time, very well organized . Makes sure each employee is also satisfied and capable of performing each responsibility handed to them,"
good,A typical day at work is making the customers happy by preparing and getting the order out in an accommodating manner. I learned to be a people person and team player and how to work various areas of the kitchen. Management was great they were always there if you needed assistance or more training. The hardest part of the job was actually not being able to satisfy a customer after you have completely tried to do everything possible in your job title. The most enjoyable was the co-workers they are a great team to advance with.
good,"There were always specific guidelines and rules that needed to be followed and the managers were good at enforcing them while still keeping good relations with the employees. This was helpful because then all the tasks would be completed without any issues, keeping things run smoothly. The environment was fun and I enjoyed the people I worked with."
good,"being able to wear a uniform and clock in and help customers with there needs, as far as cashing them out and helping them with their order, helping out the business with keeping the business clean and looking presentable to make the customers feel more pleased to be there and eat at a clean table was very warming. managers were very friendly."

good,"A nice place to work with good management staff, room for advancement, and flexible scheduling. Hard work is appreciated by management and rewarded. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the rude customers and when coworkers do not work as hard as they should. The most enjoyable part of the job is the comradeship of the workers and the laid back atmosphere."
good,"A typical day at work would be constantly multitasking, for example cooking burgers and cleaning something at the same time. Always listening is also important so you know what guest are wanting to order and being able to get them their food a quick as possible."
good,"Cook "
good,this would be a good place for anybody to get there first job at. You get to meet a lot of people that you wouldn't normally talk to.
good,Working in the fast food service was a whole different environment. I enjoyed the fast pace team involvement. Not everyone contributed to their responsibilities because they did not take their job serious I didn't mind the hard work not everyone is bad I made more friends then enemies.
good,"At first it was hard to communicate, like an ambiance, and culture. But as time goes on the work is getting lighter and lighter, because the more you know the person you are working, I am getting along with them. And even attach to them even their personal problems were talking. The work is getting stress if I  didn't enjoy it, but as long as I enjoy my work I didn't felt too much stress."
good,I liked working with the customers and the employees here and I always had a great time working with them.  We always had a great time working with them.  I also had a great schedule when working here.

good,"Work cashier, Usually driver thru,"
good,Helped me advance in management They need better management. The job is fast paced and good for starting out.
good,"Working at Wendy's was a good place to work, the co-workers are great. The only thing about working there was that the gm was quick to threaten to fire employees for getting overtime without hearing the employees side. She could be cruel when criticizing the employees instead of talking to them about something they needed improvement on she would go behind their backs and talk about them loud enough for them to hear sometimes."
good,"A better bonus plan for managers."
good,great service and working with a team with the great communication
good,I worked the night shift and it was alright but my younger associates would depend on my efforts to keep the store clean before closing. The extra emotional attitudes was hard to bare with.

good,"I was working lunch hour rush. Very busy from 11:00A.M. til 2:00P.M. I was a cashier and dinning room cleaning person. The management they we're very stressful their selves and not organize at all. My co-workers were fun and friendly to be around and made the day go by faster when we had the good crew working. The hardest part of the job was other co-workers complaining on how you was doing your job or wanting you to do their job and yours at the same time. I enjoyed the job because now i have so much respect for workers in the fast food business, there was a couple time i wanted to flip on my customer but i remember that the customer is always first and right."
good,Only working there a month I was moving on up to be an assistant manager. There was always a wonderful atmosphere and good cliental.

good,"My typical day is 10-12 hours long. "
good,"Wendys was the fist employment I received. A typical day began with training on the food board, the cash register and eventually to the Drive thru window. I learned a customer is always correct and in order to keep my job, I had to make customers happy. The management team was nice although it took me some time to adjust to the rules, policies, and the exact way work should be done. My coworkers were very easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job was learning the exact temperatures, and food handling. The most enjoyable part was making the customer concerns a priority."
good,A typical day at Wendys is very relaxing and knowing your there to help others enjoy there day by giving them the best quality of food. I learned that some customers just cant be happy or be in a good mood but as long as you have that wonderful energy and smile maybe just for the second you can have them in a good mood. My manger was very understanding and always made sure us employees knew what was needed to be done and knew exactly what was being asked of us. My Co-workers were very exciting to work with they all had different personalities and different ways of making you have a good day. The hardest part of the job was having a customer not be satisfied no matter what you did to make them feel as comfortable as possible. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people having great conversations about their lives in the matter of those little minutes we have to talk.
good,enjoyed it. Multitask doing ur job and others. management was good as well.
good,"Trying to find different ways to balance a good home and work schedule to due that when I work at Wendys, it can be from 7am-4am next day depending if I'm working a dayshift, mid-shift, or a closing shift. I enjoyed working at Wendy's, just wished the wages were more than what we get paid for to have so much responsibilities on our plate. The overwhelming part of being a Manager is running a shift and being short handed and cant find others to replaced. I always seem to do what is right and put the stronger ones in the positions that I need them to be in to run a short handed shift good."
good,"serving the customers,  getting their food order done in a timely manner watching them smile and happy"
good,Great coworkers and flexible schedule. I was trained on all positions.
good,I liked working at Wendy's.  I cleaned the tables and worked with customers.  The hours were good and my managers were nice.  The only thing that I did not like was the amount of money I made.

I trained multiple employees and made great friends.
good,This job always at a fast pace. We have a time frame to get the customers in and out and we make sure that is possible. We always have help with our coworkers.
good,Everyday was always a positive and exciting day. I learned how to run shifts alone and how to handle angry customers the correct way. The management was a blast and cared a lot about their employees. Co-workers were great. Hardest part was learning to handle angry customers.
good,if you were willing to learn they were willing to teach and that is always a plus.
good,"A typical day at Wedny's involved me managing various shifts, filling out product orders, stock organization and crew/manager training. I learned a lot of things at Wendy's that I am still able to use in other industries today, such as how to effectively train someone, how to interact with employees, and how to effectively increase employee productivity and morale. I enjoyed working with the majority of managers in the company, and I worked at several stores across Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusets and Colorado. The hardest part of the job was trying to run an effective shift while being understaffed due to call outs or heavy sales. The most enjoyable part of my job was managing store record breaking hours without anyone getting overwhelmed."
good,the Wendy's I am employed at is enjoyable to at we are like a family there.

good,I absolutely love my job at Wendy's. You couldn't ask for a better group of people to work for or with. We had a great time together and worked as a team to get the job done!
good,"Wendys took the time to help me learn considering I have Learning Disablity Comprehension , It takes me a little longer to Comprehend things It has to be repeated and drilled in my head before I catch on , I still know some of the order that the sauces they use such as Mayo , Ketchup, Pickels, Onions, Tomatoes, Lettuce , Mustard  in a W on the cheese if there was cheese  aand meat"

good,take to many demanding orders but it was decent after awhile people where somewhat friendly
good,"My time at Wendy's was mainly on food prepare and working the grill. Management was helpful in training and helping with whatever task that was needed. At times I would work the register dealing with customers, that was a good learning experience because I enjoyed greeting and talking to customers, also helping when needed."
good,I Enjoyed working at wendys. its really friendly and fun place to work. co workers are really helpfull and good management.
good,"youll switch up positions"
good,"My first job was working for Wendy's. A typical work day was hardly ever dull. Working here taught me as well the importance of working together as a team. If we aren't together, our customer service will reflect that. Working here taught me that I could adapt well. Will the right tools and training I was able to complete multiple tasks so that I could be a better asset to my team."
good,"A day would be clock in get to work at the cash window and wash dishes or man the grill or work the front register while maintaining the dining floor. I learn how manage money and how to deal with and keep our customer happy and the importance of teamwork.The work place is organized but during rush hour it can get a little bit unorganized, My co-worker are always work at a fast pace with quality in mind. Some of the hardest place about the job was deal with difficult customer while trying to maintain a cool head. some of the enjoyable part about the job is the teamwork that go in to the work we all do."
good,"Great place to work for in the fast food industry. I like Wendy's. Their food is usually fresh and I prefer them to other burger places. One thing I've always appreciated about Wendy's is that they always seem to be one step ahead of the curve when it comes to offering food to the public. They were the first to have a 99 cent menu, the first to have fresh salads available, and the first to offer side salads as a side instead of your typical fries."
good,"good place for a first time job, I really enjoyed working there."
good,at work everything goes productive and easy because of great team work.
good,"Very nice co-workers, you get the odd rude customer that didn't get the right order and they get upset so you end up making them a new burger or whatever they ordered. I enjoyed working in that environment, going to work in the morning and doing food preparation and then opening the store for 10am and then seeing all the regulars come in for lunch and coffee. you get to meet customers that want to come to you and make them lunch, because you have made a good relationship with them."
good,"Wendy's was a wonderful place to work at. My typical day consisted of making food for our customers greeting them at the door as well as processing the transactions for the exchange of food and money."
good,"My supervisors were mostly respectable and fair to work under. My coworkers came from very diverse walks of life. I was always kept busy, never found myself bored with nothing to do. I had good job security and hours were plentiful for the most part. It is a good place to work if you are in school or just out of school and need to save up some money, but as far as a long-term career option, your best bet would be to advance into management instead of staying at crew level."
good,"A typical day was about 6-7 hours a day, to keep customers happy and coming back was the goal, make sure food was cooked to the best Quality. The management was excellent. Co workers were like family."
good,This job made me a grown up. I worked their for 3 years. It had its pros and cons. But overall I loved it.
good,Positive experience with this company mainly due to the friendly co-workers and management there. Can be physically demanding depending on the amount of customers that day. All requests are taken seriously by managers and all employees are given a chance to make a difference in the work environment. Also very flexible around a personal schedule.
good,Working at a fast food is like being part of a machine when everyone works hard at their own stations and does their jobs correctly you can move a large amount of food/product to a large amount of customers in a short amount of time.
good,"Since working at Wendy's there has been a lot of enjoyable moments. The learning is unlimited and there is always chances to become promoted. I have seen the company and their leaders will help in any way they can as far as training an in real life.  Of course this has been my first and only job and I would like skills in other areas and in different environments. "

A typical day has a rush at the same time everyday. It can be a little difficult because of the amount of people that come in at one time but it's enjoyable to see a satisfied customer."
good,"Great work environment, there is nothing more satisfying knowing that you put a smile on a customers face."
good,"the work environment was professional but fun."
good,"Though I grew very close to all my coworkers here and will never forget all the fun I had at this company, there was a lot that made it not enjoyable to work there. Though the company was founded upon respect and positivity, there was a lot of attitude and condescension. Managers were very negative, and unprofessional. The simplest of tasks could not be completed properly due to lack of training, which I witnessed often being blamed on the employees rather than the lack of managerial supervision. I did grow to love many of my fellow coworkers, but the negativity became so frustrating that I had no other choice but to leave to seek better employment opportunities."
good,Good co work good manager good job i learned a lot here the pay was all so good never miss a day of work

good,perfectc ustomer service work management was great i loved working there
good,"A typical day at work would be very busy and productive, always on the go, from me experience I've learned how to cope under stress and deal with customers in a quick and polite way. The co-workers at my previous job were very polite and positive people, all who've I've enjoyed being around. The hardest part if my previous job was dealing with upset and unsatisfied customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was having customers compliment the way i have dealt  with them."
good,"The workplace and the people was nice. The managers were nice but they would yell all the time, and the typical day was easy going some days busier then most. Most enjoyable part was the nice slow days where you can get everything done quick."

I deal with distraught customers to the happiest of them.  I have a great personality and am willing to learn new things.  The hardest part of my job is trying to make everyone being the customers happy when sometimes you just cant.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the diversity of the days.
good,A typical day at Pilot Wendys is very busy they are the second busiest Pilot out of 50 companies. What I learned I would say patients while 90% of the customers are very friendly the other 10% can be a task you have to have patients when you have an impatient irate truck driver who has been on the road for hours.  As far as management we went through several GMs while i was there but they all taught me something different which helped me be a better manager. I would say the hardest part in working there i was promoted in 2010 to a team lead and then again in 2011 to a supervisor and i worked every day i was scheduled as a supervisor but with out the pay because they delayed my official training to avoid paying the supervisor pay which meant more pay quarterly bonus more vacation time and more holidays covered. the most enjoyable part of my job would be the people i worked with and that 90% of customers.
good,I love going to work with people I consider family.We work as a team from start to finish everyday!
good,Pick up a lot of communication and customer service skills. Open the restaurant as the front register operator or either the grill worker. Management was very solid nice  organization skills. The hardest part would be the customers. Most enjoyable part would be the workers and the friendly environment
good,"A typical day at work was me going, clocking in, jumping right into what I had to do. When ever it was slow, I would stock up everything I had to such as sauces, napkins, straws, cups and so forth. Also, on spare time I would clean the dining room or help another employee if drive-thru was busy or go in the back room and help clean up or wash dishes if the manager asked me to. I would have to say that overall with employees, I got along with 95% of them. There were time where we had disagreements but for the most part, when we needed each other, we were always there for each, more like a family. The hardest part was at the end of the night when i had to clean dining room and also close front register but I got my work done no matter how difficult it was. The most enjoyable part of being at Wendy's was the laughter, the close bond most employees had there amongst each other and when ever someone was going through something, we were always there for each other. Never was there a dull moment and if I could go back, I swear I would."
good,"A typical day at work , is showing up getting in uniform and working."
good,"Very fast paced environment, you have to be able to do many things at once. The staff is generally very friendly, as are the customers. The only complaint I would have is the hours I get, not as many as I would like."
good,Wendys has a fun enviroment.  I quit because I went on a LDS Mission.
good,A day a work was cooking and serving the community food. I learned how to cook and fast pace of work. We worked as team. The hardest part of the job was cooking with the grease. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning a new experience Jpb
good,"I greeted customers when they walked into the restaurant. On top of receiving and disbursing cash, I also maintained cleanliness in the restaurant. Management was friendly and professional at all times. I enjoyed working one on one with my customers and making sure their needs were met."
good,"Some people say that Fast Food = no good, I would be inclined to agree had I never worked for this company. Its been nearly a decade since I've left this job and from time to time I still look back on my days with the company in awe."
good,Great place to work at. Friendly managers and a great atmosphere.
good,"Working at Wendy's, as soon as I enter in the building I feel a sense of welcome and hard work. The employees build their entire work concept on quality and teamwork. If the quality of the food is poor, we don't serve it, and if there is any complaints about the food or product, we try to satisfy the customers needs as much as possible. Working here, I learned how to ensure that I get things done on time because if I don't keep up then it slows down everything else that is going on. The most difficult part of the job isn't just being punctual, but really being able to multi-task and complete all of the tasks well. The most enjoyable part of this job is seeing customers happy and satisfied with quick, quality food that they can enjoy."
good,wendys is a nice place to work with nice people to work with. you get pretty good hours. if you are a hard worker and love to go fast this is the job for you. the atmosphre is great. the management staff is great and they will try to help you if you go to school or have another job.
good,"Throughout my four months at Wendy's, I learned things I didn't think I ever would. I met people, remembered who they were and what kind of service they enjoyed, and gave it to them. I, overall, loved my job and the people I worked with. We always had a great time, but business was business; It came first, we always made sure our duties were done before light conversation picked up. The hardest part of my job was working the headset. I eventually learned it, but it took me awhile, but once I got it I was good. Work was the most enjoyable part of my day because I got to go into a new environment and make people smile and laugh. I loved working for Wendy's, I loved the people, and my coworkers."
good,"Customer relations. Cook on the grille, order taker, finances and management training"

The crew members were nice and friendly and the management was well maintained. the managers treated me with respect and accommodated my work schedule. the hardest part of the job was having to learn all the procedures in a week. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to learn and experience new things like working with customers and co workers.

The managers that I have worked with in the last nine years has been great.  I have had four General Managers during my time at Wendy's. I have learned something different from each one. There really wasn't anything hard about about my job. I go to work everyday ready for whatever challenges may come my way.

I really enjoyed my management team and crew. We always like to have fun working and being positive so the day would go good. The hardest part of my job was letting go of someone.

You really have to be great at multitasking, every customer is needing something and its your job to make sure they leave more than satisfied.  Co-workers were sort of friendly, but the managers were great. The hardest part of the job would be working alone at the register when the lunch rush comes because you have to make sure you quickly and accurately process the orders and at the same time keep other customers who have already been helped, satisfied and served in time.

The most enjoyable part of the day is seeing everyone and helping and doing my job for work and serving my customers.
good,"Overall a great company to work for. You do have to put alot of effort in order to get promoted. It is worth it. Wendy's is not looking for lazy people. They wanted dedicated and hard working individuals who are customer oriented and are friendly. Especially if you are planning to be in management. I personally enjoyed working for them and would do it again if I had the chance. The Dave Thomas principles the company applies to their employees and managers to this day. That is what makes it great and when it comes to fast food it is a 5 star restaurant. Products are great. You will grow with them, yes it requires effort on your part but it is worth it."

My management was very encouraging and enthusiastic to work with, and taught me various hands on duties. The most enjoyable part of the job was receiving customer compliments about how happy they were with the service I provided."

good,"I really enjoyed working here and the days here are never dull to say the least. Everyone works together at all times to get through the many lunch and dinner rushes we had. The management knew what they were doing and always had people where they were strongest on the line. My co workers were smart, funny and very diverse and know what they were doing. The hardest part of the job was getting through the lunch and dinner rushes because they required you to move extremely fast and efficiently without any slip-ups which lead to stressful times. The times after the rushes was the most enjoyable time because it gave us time to unwind and relax while enjoying each others company."
good,"Get team organized and ready for work day, being that it was my first job I learned so many skills that was needed and the workforce and I use with me today on the job, management was very pleasant, co-workers were awesome, hardest part was lunch hour rush and the enjoyable part was working with my team and the amount of fun we had while getting our jobs completed."

good,"I loved my job in management from all aspects. Handeling customers, paperwork, invetnory all wonderful for me. I am very detail oriented and organized and in that apect it was wonderful. I enjoyed working and teaching my employees. The only concern I ever had was the saftety policies not being enforced. Preventative measures should have been taken on numerous occassions for a number of incindients."
good,A great place to work. I like working at the company. I've been there for 4 years. It wasnt my first public job so it has helped me learn more to have patience. The co-workers are great. The hardest part of the job is learning how to do everything at the job. For the most part i did everything and enjoyed it.
good,"I enjoy working with the public, very fast paced and demanding enviroment"
good,I've learned the importance of working as part of a team. We would get extremely busy at times but we worked together to get the job done.
good,"This was just a beginner job for me, I was doing this while i was going to school and trying to make a career for myself."
good,Order intake register
good,"sometimes it can be very busy and some days very slow, i enjoy the days that are busy because it teaches me to become more quick with my work and its just more exciting. the hardest part of my job is being able to switch shifts due to my circumstances at home, but the most enjoyable part is being able to react with different people everyday."
good,This was a very fast paced and conventional job. Everything was done in a timely manner yet professionally and controlably.
good,"Productive and gave me knowledge on food safety . Being a manager was a great experience how to deal with my co-workers, and learning how to manage cash procedures and product for the day. I liked that it was my responsibility to ensure we had enough product and fresh prep everyday. It was also great to be busy most days"
good,"they hire within the store, your able to grow into a management postion if u wanted to."
good,"A typical day at wendys for me was coming in and opening the store at 10a.m. preparing the buns and stocking preparing food and checking for complete uniform. I thought this would be an wild experience because this was my first fast food experience but i really enjoyed myself. I have learned so much as how to cook meat and dropping fries, nuggest to even multi- task and taking orders withing 2 mins. co workers was great was very helpful with alot we were an team and i fit right in im a real good team player. The hardest part of this job was breaking down the equipment a the end of the night and cleaning it the right way. I can say i enjoyed each and every day at this work place would I do it again yes."
good,"I did everything fore counting the money to cleaning to scheduling, traning, to serving food. Management was good. My coworks were like a second family. The hardest part of Wendys was being rush ready. the most enjoyable part of my job was talking to our regular customers. and getting to know my fellow employees."
good,-Lots of opportunities to grow

good,Go in at 5:15 In the morning to get ready for crew members to come in at 6 a.m. So we could prep food and get ready to open at 10 a.m. Co-workers were great to work with when they would show up. The hardest part of the job was finding someone to fill in if a employee didnt show or would call 30 minutes before there shift. I learned how to be a manager there.
good,Take on daily tasks. Learn to work with new people and serve the public. Great managers that help teach you better ways to do things. Nice co-workers that helped when I was new and would show me things. Hardest part of the job is to learn everything. Most enjoyable part of my job is work with people and serve the public.
good,"Able to provide customer satisfaction regarding the quality of the product sold. To train incoming employee at any position in the work place, such as the cash register"
good,"The work environment is great because of the people you work with. As far as the work in general, its not hard just time consuming. and thankfully I have been blessed with Patients because I can look over the fact that someone might be having a bad day and can give off and attitude that makes you want to scream; but I love that fact that I have the opportunity to maybe turn their day around."
good,"Taking food orders, attending to customers. Every single customer is different, therefore I have learned to problem solve with different types of people, even the impossible ones. Management was great! Such a fun work place, everyone was friends with everyone. I looked forward to work. Hardest part of the job was I would say the income, People think fast food tends to be easy, Its very demanding and fast pace, for how hard I worked I didn't think the income really pushed me to want to keep going. I have met amazing people working at Wendy's from my co-workers to customers that are my friends even outside of work. I enjoy people."
good,well when youe some where for a while you get to know the people that come in and thats what made my day all the time i love to talk in get to know someone and what they are going through
good,i loved my managers and enjoyed going to work. had great coworkers whowere positive
good,it fast pace but if you have a cool manager the time will fly bye. it is a good place to work for good pay.
good,"A typical day while working at Wendys is either helping the customer at the register or making there food and taking orders. What i learned from Wendys is how to do something at a fast pace. The Managers there are good, they are always helping someone do something so that the time is good. The hardest part about the job is getting everything perfect. The most enjoyable part of the job would be working with people you get along with,"
good,"A typical day at Wendy's is simple and easy. I learned more about the fast-food industry. Managers are easy to talk to about anything, and my co-workers are very easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job was running the entire store alone on some nights, the most enjoyable part was spending time with my co-workers and having fun while being productve."

The most part i like about this job is the whole part of being a Wendy's Crew Member. Their was not a hard part about this job. The co-workers at this job made you time at work faster. Listening to them talk, laugh, and still get the food out at the right time was awesome. The environment was great and clean."

good,I would have to say the customer. I enjoy the regulars that came thru. They knew you by name and ways had a store for you. They made you feel like family.
good,"A typical day at work included taking orders through the drive thru and preparing the meals. I also helped clean the store and assist those who were working on the front cash. This job taught me how to serve customers within a couple of minutes and how to effectively talk to customers and manage any problems with their order. My co-workers were all very friendly and it was always a great environment to work in. The hardest part about the job was trying to take part in all the positions in one day and the most enjoyable part was the fact that I was trained on all the positions, therefore I got moved around each day I worked and got to experience different opportunities."
good,"It's okay, Not the career for me! Its easy if you know what ypu are doing,"
good,*start off the day by walking in and washing your handsbefore touching anything and stocking your area which you'll be working in whether it's cashier or an cook
good,"I would go in around 6am, I would make all the salads for the day and I would work in the office for a couple of hours counting drawers and making sure we have had enough change for the day. Throughout the day I would make sure that everything was stocked, and that the employees were doing their jobs and count drawers making sure that the employees did not steal any money."
good,I enjoy any job that i work at. I go in and do what i gotta do long my work is done. I leave my area nice and neat for the next person.
good,"I work as close to 40-hours a week as I can get. The managers are really great to me and work with my schedule. I am a student and have classes on certain days. The hardest part of the job is remembering all the procedures, while the most enjoyable is knowing I have impresses a customer and made their day. I have learned to multitask while working at Wendy's and to step back and look at the bigger picture to operate the store (and any other place I go) more smoothly."
good,-Typical day would include taking care of customer needs while maintaining your work area.
good,Wendys was an excellent job for me. I love being around people and helping customers. Every one that worked there was very friendly and they quickly became my family.
good,The day goes by so fast because the job is fast paced and busy most of the time. You have to work fast paced and get everything in two minutes for each car at the drive through. It can be fun but you just work on your own
good,it was a great experience and i learn alot with this restaurant
good,The store I worked at had good values and bad one good was that all the crew members got along and was always prepared for big orders the bad things were not enough hours too much work for small pay one person would pick up slack for many others and some of the managers were not very responsible
good,A typical day at work was to clock in and take orders at the drive thru window in a great professional-like manner. I handled money and made sure the customer always came first. I learned how to multi-task. The management was very fun. The co-workers were very fun as well. The hardest part of the job was trying to balance it with school. The most enjoyable part was having 50% off whatever you ordered.
good,They gave me the hours I wanted . The workers was great to work with everyone did there job.
good,"Stable, good hours but low pay unless moving up in company. Managers are very nice."
good,great way to help with your communication and people skills
good,"I started at the bottom and worked my way up ,but great company, great values, great starting point for college students and entrepreneurs for learning curves on proper business handling for the modern world."
good,"The work shifts are around 4 hours, so not terribly long. You get breaks when you need one. Sometimes you have to deal with rude customers, but you will find that everywhere. If there is a mistake we learned LAFT which is Listen, Apologize, Fix it, say Thank You."
good,training wise i have learned how to do crew schedules and ordering of food items which has to be balanced and not over or under order.
good,When I worked at Wendy's in Kentucky I loved it I wish i was still working there but i had to move back to Michigan. Wendy's was a good place to work for me i loved every minute of it
good,"Management tought me how to use the skills i gained working for this company for use in the jobs i have had. Such as puntuality, proffesionalism and kindness."
good,"This job taught you how to deal and treat the public. As you were being developed, you could pass the knowledge along."
good,"This is a wonderful company to work for. It has great opportunities for growth. If you are looking for a career, this company is a great place to work for."
good,"I like some of the methods they use for their grills, very efficient.  Other than that, it wasn't as team oriented as they could have been.  The hours weren't that great and I didn't really get that much room to expand."
good,"Working at this company is a little stressful, but over all I enjoy working as a Wendy’s crew member. I learn new things everyday, and it sometimes benefits me when I’m not working. It also built up my confidence as a person."
good,"Wendy's is suitable as a first job. The management and crew are friendly and willing to teach you what you need to know. The interview process is easy and fair. Whatever your age or race, management will hire you as long as you're willing to work. Consistent good work will also earn you raises, so working here can be very fulfilling. However, the high turn-over rate will leave you short-handed and tired a good chunk of the time. The schedule changes weekly and without your input, so you may end up with full-time hours even if you applied for part-time, and vice-versa."
good,Some time we have up and downs some was good some was bad we get alot of costumers  yes they was rude sometimes but you just have to be nice to them and we have really good workers
good,Wendy's has awesome managers who have been extremely kind while working with a teenager in high school. I am in search for a job with more hours and a livable pay  wage
good,"I loved working for Wendys, my crew was very easy to work with a lot of the time. The manager will train you to make sure you know how to succeed at your job as well"
good,"If you're someone who is willing to put in the work, you'll probably find this place very rewarding. People are very friendly there, but because it's such a 'team' environment if you're not willing to pull your weight you might not find yourself clicking."
good,"-  Fast and friendly service"
good,"Must understand that mangers won’t play around as much, if there’s a big line out the door focus and work hard. Once that line is gone perp and restock your product if needed. just relax and have fun with it."
good,"Found a company to be reliable, enjoyable to work enjoyable people to work with management and staff. Really would like to go back to work for them in the future because I have learned so much from my days as a part of management experience at Wendy's."
good,"Wendy's was a good place to work part time, I felt secure at my job and it wasn't stressful to me. I worked in the cashier station in the front and drive thru."
good,In my 2 years of working at Wendy’s I’ve learned a lot and experience a lot. Starting with how to stack supplies that is needed on a daily. And also learning how to manage food serving with the way the day is going. It’s a good work place to start off as a young adult but you also have to grow and that’s  what I’m heading towards.
good,"good job if you have a good manager at a busy location, and the manager can be flexible about the schedule although the compensation is also lower than usual. It is boring without customers."
good,"Wendy’s was very first job while I was in highschool. I stayed there for 3 years. I worked the drive thru, the front counter cashier , and prepped food , and cook the food."
good,Do drive threw window run front register train people in kitchen do chores dishes trash grills etc do grill cook food make sandwiches etc do bank runs filter fryers clean floors do dishes assign posi
good,"I worked at Wendy's for 2 years exactly. Had no interview, they pretty much hired me on the spot on a walk-in after filling out an application. They worked with my availability really well and would always have fun in-store or even district competitions which I found myself doing really well at. Unfortunately, the GM got promoted to a DM and the new GM had a hard time adjusting to the new position. I tried to stick around, but I sought out a new job because everyone became unreliable. They had me work the drive-thru window by myself and expected me to keep up the orders while people would sit back in the office if the front wasn't busy. Sad to see them go, but the bond I still have with my coworkers I'm grateful for."
good,I loved getting the opportunity to work for this company especially the Franchise I worked for in LeHigh Acres Fl. Great people and an awesome General Manager!!
good,"Didnt plan to leave,  and wouldn't have if certain issues wouldnt have came about ! Definitely miss it , and the people. Some days are good and some are bad but that's part of a job. Would reccomend to someone needing a job with guaranteed hours if they would work to get them. Worked from 2011-2015, left and came back for almost a year. Also kept very CLEAN!"
good,A good place to work. Can be stressful during rush. They work with your schedule. A fun place to work at. There are some that love to gossip and back stab you.
good,I worked there and had no problems. Just did what was required out of an employee and didn’t have any problems. Yeah working fast food is fast paced... hence the word fast paced so of course if your moving slow or your team is going slow management is gonna be on you. So I repeat just do what your suppose to and no problems.
good,Wendy's is inclusive to all people. They have many tasks that have to be accomplished but they have different difficulties that make it better to have people who aren't as skilled still get things accomplished while working. You work as a team with your co workers and this makes it more enjoyable.
good,"if your looking for somewhere to start with your job experience, THIS IS PERFECT. A learning experience dealing with food and cash and credit transactions."
good,"At Wendy's, the crew member and the manager work as a team which gives us the possibility to provide an excellent job based on our performance. This is a triangle combination that can survive without one and another: The grill person, sandwich person and the fries person each of them have a specific job but sometimes jump to help others when it's really busy. A typical day at work is 10 AM to 2 AM, the day has already started for the staff.  Everyone is busy laying out activities, preparing the craft tables and making sure everything is ready for the coming day."
good,"Working at Wendy’s was an ok experience but it’s a lot of things that could and should be different for the look of the company, being that it’s an fast food business"
good,"When I first started working there I was at a younger age and for me than the only things a 14yr old can do cash register, drinks, and clean tables. which wasn't the worst but during busy times you kind of feel useless because you are not allowed to touch to hot areas of the food."
good,"I was robbed twice and my life is more important than a job, even though I love my job. I work with a great team and love my staff. The customers are enjoyable"
good,"A place where I learned a lot, never worked in a restoration before but adapted quickly with the help of my coworkers. I loved helping the customers and always wanted to give them the best services"
good,"The job was okay, very challenging. You definitely in need of lots of standing and communication. Have to work at a maximum speed to get things done! Good for starters"
good,"On most work days I spend time setting up the shift, and making sure everyone is in an appropriate position. I also give them their duties for the day and keep track of them completing it. I am on line doing different positions for the day, and then count and change drawers at the end of the day."
good,Fast paced environment along with many improvement opportunities. Many promotion options within. Great friendly crew to work with. Management willing to work side by side with you.
good,Work life balance was a struggle at times as GM but I loved my job and my team. Upper management was very supportive. Excellent training materials are provided.
good,"Great team work. Good environment to work in. Flexible hours. Good management. Fun,enjoyable place to work. A great first job to start at for teenagers."
good,"I started in Jan, there was a lot of management changes. I feel it was for the best. I loved working there, met a lot of awesome people. I highly recommend working for Wendys."
good,Works with scheduling if you have a family. Room to elevate in a supervisor or manager’s position. Everyone easy to work with. Starting pay is decent.
good,"I loved going to work at Wendys. The people were always fun to work with, there would never be a dull moment. During rushes you'd never be doing things alone."
good,It is a very stressful workplace not to mention customers from the underworld that are just always trying to ruin your day and the smell of food you'll have at the end of the day.
good,Trabajo que requiere de velocidad
good,I enjoyed my time working there up until the end. The staff was nice. I got along with everyone and the management was really good. The grills were clean and everything went according to plan when i was there.
good,I learn how to do everything in the store.I ! Made a lot of friends and I enjoy working there.if u like fast food jobs it's a great place to work for .the people are friendly
good,It was fast paced which is good because I hate standing around.  I enjoyed the other employees. I loved waiting on customers and serving quality food.
good,"I worked at Wendy’s in St. John’s, Newfoundland And had an excellent experience."
good,The job was a great experience. When I started this job I was in school and they worked around my school schedule. The managers made sure I kept my grades up and passed my classes. The managers were pleasant to work with and made sure the shifts ran as smooth as possible.
good,"Working over there i have learn many new things like maintaining the news ways of management , greeting the customers like their family.   Culture in their was quite memorable may things i had learned from it,and the last the most thing i enjoy over there is to help each and every people whenever they need me."
good,"I didn't always have fun working at other places, but Wendy's it was a whole new ballgame, it was fun, everything was productive, everyone has Smiles on their face I mean yeah there's just occasional stress but other than that it's fantastic"
good,"The restaurant was very popular so most shifts were busy. I learned how to handle fast food as well as customers. Management was excellent as they worked with us throughout the day. The workplace culture was laid back, but seriously at the same time. We were able to reach our numbers and achieve high productivity while still having a fun environment. The hardest part of the job was having to close and clean everything. The most enjoyable part was making sandwiches due to the variety of things needed to be done."
good,"Very busy and a lot of work that needs to get done for closing shift. As tiring as it is, but always have a fun shift with the co-worker. Everyone helps out everyone and the management is Great!"
good,when i first started working there it was hard to get used to. But i made friends an they helped me with everything that i needed to learn. everyone is like a family.
good,Team members are great! But can be very tiring work place especially during summer. You need to be ready working a lot of hours but they give discounts for your food.
good,Fast pace work environment. Sometimes other managers do not help out or just stay on a position the entire shift. Flexible hours and most of the time a friendly environment.
good,"The people are great to work with, they really feel like a second family, very friendly and willing to help, However at times it feels the very opposite. "
good,i loved working there and if i didnt have to move states i would still be working there. the days working there were amazing and a good learning place.
good,"It was My favorite job that I've ever worked, but one of my managers made it horrible. I loved my coworkers and always had a good time with them. It did take awhile to remember everything I had to make, but was so fun in the end. It's very fast pace but everyone helps out. You always have something to do so time goes by really fast."
good,Great work environment to be a part of. The managers are really nice and maintain a healthy work environment by getting everyone involved with work parties and raffles.
good,"It was a very stressful job especially, while going to school but the employees were very comforting and respectful, it just wasn’t were I personally was comfortable at though."
good,"It's a nice place to work, customers are nice along with employees. A typical day looks like cleaning and making sure the restaurant looks nice and clean, packing orders along with taking orders."
good,"Variety"
good,The hardest part of the job was when we got busy. I was trained very well. My manager was very informed. I was given free lunch. I learned how to work with money. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.
good,"The day starts with walking in and seeing who was at my station, making sure it was stocked. It was my job to make sure that they stocked it before they left, and that they had finished their cleaning tasks. Then, i would go through out the day, taking care of guests and making sure things were running smoothly, even if it was not the job of my station."
good,It was a good place to start off in and great job to get some experience. The management was great. They lead the work environment in a good hardworking way.
good,It’s hard job but that’s only cause the teamwork is trying to improve.Lunch times can be tuff when you only have three people in that’s including the manager.
good,Relaxing in good work.cooking on the grill.learning how to do Fryer's. Management there cool calm in collected.making sure you do it the right way. Completely the job I'm making sure that the two uncles in 4 oz of separated before you put it on the grill.
good,"I learned management, communication and proper work skills. Hardest part of the job was adapting to it at first. I had to have a lot of help to get things going. In the end, I learned a lot."
good,Is  Nice too work it wendy   Wait Employees Manager  Everybody is nice it is  Easy to  Everybody the food is good I  Help other employees to  Finish So we can open on time
good,"I learned so much behind the counter at Wendy's. It taught me how to work under stressful conditions and how to multi-task. Lastly, the work environment was extremely welcoming and I enjoyed talking to all the customers."
good,Wendy's was a great place to work staff as well as guest were very nice and friendly. staff took time to answer all questions no matter how big or how small. guest always said thank you no one had attitudes and everyone worked as a team
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy's an I was always busy and workers hard but sum magers weren't handling things right. So I ended up leaving to work for a cash job in landscaping
good,It’s cool working there with cool people and getting to know new ones. They helped me with a lot and it was easier to get things done when I’m struggling.
good,"My time there was typically great. Being there taught me much about life and the workplace. My managers were great, teaching me everything I had to do, and being patient and understanding with it. The work itself becomes boring in time, but it wasn't too stressful or awful. The hours were bad for me, it being rather random and always changing. The pay was as low as it gets. But, for it being my first job, I'm glad I worked there."
good,"It can be a stressful environment to work in, you have to multitask  when it gets packed and quickly try to please every customer with how fast you've been, and customer service."

good,"If you want a job where you can advance if you work hard, where you can work with an amazing team that gets along next to perfectly, then Wendy's is the place for you. The customers are not the best or the brightest, but that's anywhere you go lol"
good,The days I worked I’d go in clock in and then I’d check everything so that I knew stuff was in place an I’d let the the other person leave. I learned that it’s not that hard to work at a fast food place but you learn quick. Management was very cool. The hardest part of the job I could say was drive thru on dinner time but I pushed myself an got through it. I enjoyed meeting new people an going to work everyday.
good,Wendys is a great place to work. They are very quick-paced environment. It does get stressful at times but if everyone is working as a team then the job gets done quickly.
good,"It was alright, another fast food job. There was nothing bad about the job, just handling customers could be a bit much sometimes. I enjoyed working there."
good,I personally loved working at Wendy's. I was in my early 20's and had just given birth to my son at the time and they worked with me as well with my hours.
good,"I had set hours and days. I really enjoyed interacting with the public. Being able to meet new, bright, shinning people. Everyone worked as a team and things went smoothly."
good,"While working at Wendy's everyday I would be put in a different position, which taught me many different skills in the fast food industry. The managers there where all nice and polite and treated everyone fairly. The schedule was very flexible which was great for me and I got to work the hours I wanted. Overall it was a great job that I enjoyed having."
good,I really need a new job too much drama and I need a better pay rate..... I need more hours and I’m tryna to find a better work environment I’m very reliable and I take my job very seriously.. I learned that customer always right
good,Very good and clean store to work at. Also fairly easy for teenagers who are in need of a job or are looking for something simple for their first job.ya ya
good,"It’s a pretty laid back job, coworkers are friendly and so is management , everyone treats each other like family, they give good discounts on your meal, work as a team, and the work environment is clean."
good,"Wendys is a good place to work for a first job , you receive a 50% discount as an employee when on duty , the only bad thing really is the short shift ranging from 3-5 hours commonly"
good,It was a good fast paced working environment. Had daily goals and production to meet. Organized and helped the manager. Overall it was a good experience.
good,It was my first job. I made great friends. The pay was minimum wage simply because a bunch of high school students needed their first job to get by. The managers made sure we had a fun shift every day.
good,"Working at Wendy's every day is always something new. I never stay on on position ,because I was willing to learn all of the positions available at the job. Every day is stressful, some more than others. I learned a lot about food safety, cleanliness, meal prepping, prepping fresh produce,taking orders with accuracy, etc. The management at the Wendy's I work at, I believe could be better. That is my belief. However, they do their jobs and get the required work done. The work place all together is a very family-oriented place. Most of the employees get along with each other. The hardest part of the job  for me is keeping the restaurant clean at all times and in order. It can get really busy and messy all at the same time, and we try to stay on top of everything. The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure every customer who comes to my job leaves happy with everything."
good,"Wendys was my favorite job, I had to leave because of pay but it was great the managers, employees, and customers were all super awesome, I had a blast working for this company."
good,"Kinda easy job, very outgoing coworkers. Manger was so kind and willing to help with anything. So much love and kind energy at the work area. My best first job experience."
good,It was a good environment. The management was really good. The cared slightly about the employees and the company. Any fast food restaurant is not a career but good for teens.
good,"I enjoyed working here quite a bit, everyone made sure i was where i needed to be. I found the manager to be excellent. I would work there again if i needed to."
good,"A day at work would be a moderately paced environment. I have learned customer care and team leadership. The managers at this establishment are laid back and wonderful people. The hardest part of this job would be communication with fellow employees, but the most enjoyable art would be delighting customers and meeting friends."
good,"My typical day at Wendy's drive-thru was first scanning my thumbprint to check in. Then, putting my hair in a hairnet and putting a hat on, and then grabbing my headset. I would wait in the drive-thru area for a car to arrive. If there was no car, I would stock up the area to make sure we had everything when the car arrived so it could be quick and easy. When the car arrived I would collect the order and money, and lastly hand the food."
good,"In my time in the Wendy's fast food industry, I manage to learn evrry position in the restaurant. It was fast paced but it wasnt something intolerable. When you have your set permanent workers, it becomes seco d nature."
good,"Very organized and detailed management training program with competent Trainers, at least mine were.  Excellent benefits and good compensation for management.  It's hard work but really worth it.  Fast paced environment no matter what store you work in. Staffing was a bit of a challenge depending on the area. Until recently the starting wage for a crew person was minimum wage which was rarely negotiable and involved too much red tape when requesting to raise it for a new hire with experience.  They have since realized that method wasn't working and have made some improvements.  Wendy's has very high standards when it comes to food quality and restaurant cleanliness all the way down to making sure the lettuce cutlett does not have any remaining lettuce on it after its been cleaned.  Food safety is top priority, as it should be.  They are like no other restaurant I have ever seen and that is one of the things I loved the most about the company.  I always compare any other restaurant I'm in, whether on my own time or for work, to Wendy's.  I haven't found one yet that meets or beats them.  You can tell me ""My pleasure"" till the cows come home, pun most definitely intended, but when you are just putting old fries back in the fryer and calling them ""well done"" or taking the ""clean"" slicer and putting it in the dish area when the inspector shows up so you don't get marked down --well then, you really don't have standards."
good,they offer vacation after a year whih is great but just like any store its only as good as the management that takes the time to care for the establishment
good,"I am a cashier on night shift most of the time so its not super busy and I can take orders and bring out food in a timely manner.  The managers are great, they are firm when they have to be but are also understanding.  The people I work with are good to talk to and we all help each other out.  The hardest part of the job is getting all the cleaning done on time to go home."
good,"Team members are outstanding, very enjoyable serving others, managers were very professional. Show new employees all regulations job position step by step."
good,I worked at this location for almost three years!  I no longer work there any more this is by far the best Wendys I have worked at by far! What makes this experience enjoyable would be the Management Staff and how well the store was managed while working there. A typical day at work was pretty busy but at the end it was all worth it! you would normally end up with a smile on your face! The only hardest part of the job I can say is how busy it would get on a daily basis well that's because it was located near the HWY of course which is quite understandle. If I could go back to working there again I would!
good,"Wendy’s was a fun place to work, while same time could be stressful at times due to poor management and customers at times. Overall it was a nice experience."
good,The staff is a real collaborative group of people. Our manager is excellent to work with.  It is fast-paced as are all Fast Food Restaurants.  We received a 50% discount for our food.
good,I learned how to work at a quick pace regularly. Along with being able to deal with difficult customers in a professional way and learning how to be leader in a work environment.
good,Since it’s inside an airport menu is limited but lots of customers good jobs as a second not first. We are fully staffed except during the shift change. Great environment friendly staff. And manager that knows how to run her store. This review may not be about the corporate itself but this is a good store.
good,I had to leave the job because I was still in school and it was  far distance from school. I like the job and it also help me pay for school fees. I love the work
good,"Wendys is definatley a great place to work and i would definitely recommend it. There is a lot of friendly competition and we always strive to get better. None the less, it is still a job and not a place to go if you are looking for somewhere to get paid to hang out."
good,"Hours are very flexible, management is very understanding, raises every 6 months & also the chances for promoting are very good. Rather promote within company."
good,It’s was a cool place with a lot of hard working people and everytime I was there I made new friends and loved to do what I do and that’s help people because that’s just me
good,I loved working here and most people can say the same when talking about Wendy's. Although there is hardly any advancement opportunities and the pay always starts at minimum and goes up by a quarter every year. I really enjoyed this job but is should not be used as a job to live for.
good,Wendys was a good job just some employees had some problems.that was the only bad part of working there anything else was ok and the management was awesome they kept things n line and help round the store.
good,"it was so fun working there, the managers were very cool and i had free food sometimes long break and fair crew workers. The hardest part of the job was when i had to do multiple tasks, the most enjoyable part when we be joking around with the manager and when the store is not packed."
good,"Cleaning and stocking. Taking orders and making sure the orders meet customers expectations. Working with the people there isn’t like a competition, we’re all family."
good,Usually fast-paced. You have to be able to deal with high stress situations. The management team is 100% focused on the customer experience. I have not had any issues with any of the team or any of the practices that they follow.
good,You have to go in there with mindset of I'm gone do whatever it takes to show these managers that I can be the best employee if you put your mind go jt. You don't want to come to work being lazy slacking off I mean you can make jokes but as long as you're still making sure your task is done.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Wendy’s!  It has a fun-loving, pro-people atmosphere that I loved.  Most of the workers are very down to earth and friendly, and the restaurant is clean and well lit.  The general manager there is friendly yet firm on making the restaurant run smoothly.  She is an incredible manager!  The other managers all do a terrific job by working hard and also knowing how to have a good time, which boosts the workers morale.  All in all, it’s a terrific place to work and to eat."
good,Very challenging place to work one of the hardest jobs I've had keeping up with payroll hiring firing and managing shifts as well as making schedules job knowledge was very key to this job all the while maintaining maintaining customer service at the highest level
good,My experience with Wendy's was great. I learned leadership skills. I learned how to control inventory and  control labor. Having good communication is a plus for working in fast foods.
good,"I enjoy working there sometimes but I get tired of the customers with bad attitudes. Sometimes it’s fun going to work but some days you run out of things customers want, them they catch attitudes with you. You have to be a tough person because they will try to get over on you and say they’re missing food but they really be lien."
good,A place that is life a second family that works very well if you like fast paced work I would recommend that you give wendys a try. The management is great.
good,This is a job to work while in High School. Decent pay for that age group. Management is very good and the flow and pace helped me for my future jobs that I have had and still work now.
good,"They give opportunities to those who want it. They will promote people, train them and ensure they are successful. Very good company culture followed in the steps of the founder Dave Thomas."
good,"Working at Wendy's has shown how to deal with difficulties situations when dealing with a guest complaint, as well as when dealing with co-workers/employment staff who are not friendly to management. There has been many good times working at Wendy's and creating good friendships with co-workers/employment staff, and guests. The most enjoyable part of the job as a Manager was creating guest connections and meeting new faces everyday. As being a Manager there were a lot of responsibility that was learned and to become one at a very high-end fast food restaurant was very over-whelming, but a great experience."
good,As long as you do your job and don't break the rules its a great first job. Its always busy so being trained correctly will help you in the long run. No short  cuts are allowed. Following correct procedures are extremely important and attendance is mandatory.
good,"Very nice workplace, good teamwork and nice benefits. Good management and training, hardest thing is too do it all by yourself but that's never a problem."
good,"Working at Wendy’s I can say had me very opened minded. Also working at Wendy’s has opened more doors for me such as managers positions, shift leaders"
good,"Great working experience.Everyone works good together.Its a hassle sometimes, but everyone finds a way to make it go smooth. I love working as a team member."
good,"They started out on drive-thru, but let me watch someone else for about the first two hours before making me try it. I'd say the most enjoyable part of the job is working with a friendly and helping staff."
good,"I enjoyed working for Wendy's. Had a few ups and downs but no biggies. The GM respected employee's. Always had food at its best. Was a fast paced environment, but never seemed that way."
good,"nice team to work with and nice place "
good,Wendy’s was a great start for me I was working there since 9th grade year in high school so for my first job it was a great experience  .i loved my upper management
good,"worked with good team members, easy work, everyone was friendly, cooperative,the only thing that was when we get a rush and had to hustle a little  more"
good,It was and okay place to work every job has good n bad days. It was a friendly place to be if you love working with people and you can work any time of the day
good,overall it was an amazing experience and environment. I'm glad I got to learn from this. the manager was amazing and my co-workers were inspiring to me.
good,"Working in a fast paced environment with everyone ready to work. Learned how to be a better leader and had to give it my all when working each and every day. Management worked hard and came in on days off to help out the store in any way possible. We all tried to have fun while working to make the day easier and that was the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part is when the customer is not satisfied and comes in upset, then the shift supervisor comes to you and it all could of been avoided. Overall it is a great place to work with great people helping you the whole way."
good,"A typical day at work was coming in and relieving the workers before of their duties and making sure that you stay on top of the tasks at hand be it cleaning, prep, or stocking."
good,"Wendys was my first job , I loved it ! from my managers to my actual job . I worked drive thru which is  a fast paced job, I took orders with great customer service"
good,It was okay job while in school to make a little extra money .It will be a very or hard to stress to have as a income to live off of.I do think it was a fun job my manager was great at leading co worker were good team worker's
good,Great place to work great people always fun and smiling faces sometimes stressful but co workers always try to lift your spirits and make you smile I'd recommend it
good,"I wouldn't say that i enjoyed working here but for some part i did like it. I did various jobs including, food coordinating, cashier, and food prep. If i worked in the front as a cashier, I would also have to clean the dining room but i enjoyed cleaning it. The hardest part of the job was probably trying to get the order right while coordinating it as fast as you can!"
good,really don't have to much to say i constantly work hard  there to proved customers they deserved and to make it up the ladder of success. Unfortunately had to relocate but other then that the job was easy going non stressful i recommended it  for h.s student looking for their first job
good,"It could have been a nice place to work, especially for beginners if management had showed respect to there crew. There was too much going on with the district and general managers that made it difficult for anyone to  work there."
good,"I worked in one of the more busy stores of the district, so the majority of the shift you are kept very busy.  Management is alright for the most part they know what they are doing, however when mistakes are made or when you start to fall behind, regardless of how long you worked there, raising there voice at you sometimes feels like the only way they can think of to motivate you."
good,"I enjoyed working in a team atmosphere.  While working with Wendy's, we had team dinners and holiday team celebrations  when we accomplished a monthly goal for the company. I also enjoyed the satisfaction of every customer as I watched them smile and walk away with their food. I also learned how to respect higher authority and to address and respond to  customer dissatisfaction. Most of all I learned how to listen, learn and adapt to any situation."
good,"Another one of my  first job experience. Just loved the work environment. Although therevwas no plan for advancement, i probably wouldn't mind running of such restaurant."
good,"management was great , fast paced , good staff , very diverse culture . majority of everyone gets along , and for a fast food there is room to move up."
good,"working at Wendy's was a fun experience. I learned how to communicate with customers, greet them how they should be greeted and also help elderly when times was needed. The work environment was excellent and fun. The hardest part of the job is when i'm finished my task and the restaurant is slow. The most enjoyable part of the job is my coworkers made me feel comfortable, and they made my working experience enjoyable."
good,"50 hours a week, 5days a week most holidays off. sometimes working long hours without any break, managing 20+ team members and other managers, training new staff and new managers."
good,"It is a good place to work. You can meet many different people and get connected with people you work with. It is fast-pace and at times stressful. The most enjoyable part is the connection that can be made with people. The hardest part is motivating people to move faster when they are having an off-day. All-in-all it is a good place to work with friendly service, great people, and nice pay."
good,"I liked working at Wendy's it was just the management. Working was fine as long as you did your job and got it done when asked. The managers are disrespectful. If your an teen, managers that are older then you will step down to your level and talk about you behind your back. The managers will be disrespectful to you and the customers."
good,Great place to work for teenagers have to move fast and orders have to be right u can't just hand out wrong orders u also have to a good management cause the job will be stressful of not
good,Management isn't that bad at Wendy's . Customers go through drive through rather than coming inside so that's a plus so you want have to keep cleaning the lobby.
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy's.  It was fast pace and I got along with all the staff. I worked for Wendy's almost a year.  I learned all the ends and out of the work place and leadership was my destiny
good,I work at a great location with several people who have also worked at wendys a long time. some of them about 20 years. Its like my family away from my family.
good,"fast pace taking order's from customer's, fun place to work got to see a lot of people work culture was good, busy place to work was the hardest part of job. enjoyed the customer's"
good,i love wendys just had problem with previous manager. would love to work there again. very friendly people. get the job done always trying to satisfy customers.
good,the goal everyday is have awesome guest service when guest leave with the feeling was in his own home day by day is really joyfully keep the guest in tourism area back to see us again and feel welcome back home and have the quality and fresh plus the quickly service with a big friendly face
good,When it is the beginning of the year it is face pace. There are times when it is slow in the morning. The staff work together as team. Supervisor work just as hard as the workers
good,"At first it is a little challenging , Once you learn the basics , you'll have it all down pack. Respectful employees. Team Work and Everyone is helpful."
good,It's an great place to work and I would recommend other people to work here. The times are flexible and the employees are people friendly. The pay is also good as well as the benefits.
good,"Wendy's Int. I worked at was located in OK, right on the interstate through a tiny town. There were many different walks of life that passed by, but the locaĺs were the best part of the days."
good,the company was good to me but did not want to pay me for what i was worth and i did every thing they asked me plus more i just don't understand why i wanst getting raises
good,"Working at Wendys was a very good experience. It was easy to learn new things and grow within the company. My fellow co workers were amazing. Everything about working at Wendy's is great, but i just need to find a job that pays more, gives me more hours, or both."
good,"Always a similiar day to day job, nice people, better than other places when it comes to compensation, the benefits were extremely nice in my area, and I loved working here til my store closed."
good,"Working here I learned quite a bit and is was a pretty decent experience, especially with all the awesome co-workers I've met. It was challenging at times but nothing I couldn't overcome."
good,"Typically, I would set up interviews when I first arrive. Then I would check over the entire store making sure I am ready for my shift. I would then manage product drops, assign cleaning tasks, and fill out nightly paper work. I learned how to connect with the customers and my crew. The culture is very positive and the hardest part of the job is trying to balance the flow of business with the cleaning tasks that need attention. My favorite part of the job is my guests and crew."
good,"The work here was easy to catch onto. I was able to know my schedule ahead of time and was able to work the hours I needed. Working here taught me how to communicate not only with my fellow employee's, but with the customers as well."
good,Must arrive early than shift to prepare for the day. So many charts and tools and tracking has to be done on a daily bases. It is easy to fall behind if 1 person is late or call off and can't get a replacement in soon enough or if at all. everything is based on sales how many people you can staff with a day or cutting ours and sending people home is not fun. For the most part I have a really good hard working staff. If they don't show for work you as the manage have a long day or sometimes work double shifts. The enjoyable part of the day is when we all show for work and work as a team and satisfy every customer that we can that come in to eat and get a great survey score. And my team fells good about there day. I always praise them good are bad day. It is the efforts they make. I love to coach and teach the next person to be great.
good,At the Wendy's I worked at it was extremely busy during the weekdays but on the weekends dead as a doornail. most of the employees and managers were great to work with. one thing that was a struggle was that when short handed it was very stressful but we still were able to do the job efficiently because of the great training and system we had.
good,"Although the compensation was not the absolute best, the amount of hours you can get make up for it. It was truly a lot of fun to work with most of the people I did. If you want a place that will always have you laughing for some reason or another I would definitely say go for it."
good,"Working in fast-food was not what I wanted out of life, but when I became a part of the Wendy's ""family,"" I saw that there was a need for organizations of this venue.  Not because it was a food service, but because it provided a sense of belonging."
good,"Wendy's was, in my opinion, one of the best places to work. I loved the environment, the management team, and general manager. I was taught so many things that have helped me in other jobs and even in life itself. It was very refreshing and helpful to have a general manager believe in my potential. The hardest but also most enjoyable part of the job was being taught new responsibilities and tasks. It was hard because of all the information but enjoyable because my general and the co-manager were beyond helpful and supportive."
good,"I was a greeter, trainer, and shift manager. I enjoyed working at Wendy's because the surrounding was so positive. Meeting and greeting with new people could be a good opportunity to better things"
good,"Great company to work for people are very outgoing. While I worked for wendys I have learned to become a great manager. I enjoyed working with people that work hard and are focused. Overall, working for wendys was a great experience."
good,"I enjoy working at Wendy's because they are flexible with my schedule for my school. It is a good location and the customers are generally nice. However, there is a limitation on career choices and I wish to use my school studies to build my career."
good,"Wendys taught me to continue to work fast pace , handle money , and improve my customer service. The hardest part of my job was very fast part was having to do every position when we were low on employees. The most enjoyable part of my job at Wendys was interacting with our customers."
good,"This was a good position. I enjoyed my management staff and coworkers. Unfortunately, the management was somewhat stifled by owner expectations and limited resources. There is no insurance for hourly employees, hours were limited to under 30 a week, and raises were once a year and for minimal amounts."
good,Since this was my first job I was eager to learn. Where I was hired they were not eager to train me. It was plenty of back and forth and I got yelled at a lot.
good,A typical day at work is steady. When they are busy everyone jumps in too help others. No one is ever called out and we are respectful. During a school week you will most likely get off around 10:00 to 10:30 which could use some improvement but overall steady. Easiest part of the job is greeting customers and helping others out. Hatdest part is trying to stock after you just got busy for 30 minutes or longer.
good,"- Typical Day includes managing, preparing, and serving any food considered fried to the customers while cleaning the place during overnight shifts."
good,"Its a great place to work that will balance your personal and work life. The compensation and benefits could be better but overall its a great, fast paced environment."
good,Great job to work at i love to work back at Wendy's when the do rehires love the customer. The music in the quality of the food is amazing. They is alway on time with customer order ready before the order is taken loving the moment...
good,the workers are nice. the store is clean. i do not wait long for my orders. friendly people. I like how the store is easy to grab the thing we need for the customers so we can serve them.
good,Fast paced. Customer service. Quality product. Good company. Secure job. Job advancement opportunities. Must be able ti multi-task. Have open availability fir schedule
good,The pay is pretty good and you have a chance to work a pretty good amount of hours if you want. It requires a lot of patience and they are always short handed
good,"getting the set up ready for the day. Making salads, prepping, insure good customer service. Made sure everyone was trained. working with the public is always great."
good,"Personally, I loved working at Wendy's. It was super fun. I didn't really learn much except to be a little bit faster at multi-tasking. The job overall wasn't even hard. Just take orders, get them out, make sure you have FRESH product up, and make sure the orders are ACCURATE. The most enjoyable part was working with people... They really do grow on you. My management was the best compared to Burger King. They truly care and treat everyone like family."
good,"Easy job, not too good of a pay rate but the work environment was great. Very clean, organized, management was GREAT. They care about their employees."
good,"As soon as my shift starts it's straight to work, its actually very fun, and fast paced which is something i look for. Nice people great plact to work."
good,"Each day brought a new challenge to the table, which I personally enjoyed. I learned how to work a new computer system. which is always a great skill to have handy."
good,"Great first job for a teen getting a $10 per hour wage. Mostly easy and relaxed besides rushes. Corporate is pretty relaxed when it comes to scheduling at the start; however, at my particular location scheduling was the reason I had to end up quitting due to them sending me to a different location each day."
good,Great work environment! Friendly staf and are understanding that it may be your first job. There a high turnover rate but you make friends quickly do to the small crew sizes that you will work with on a regular bases.
good,buen ambiente de trabajo rapido de adaptacion para aprender
good,"Great place to work I love seen the elderly came in every morning An the kids An the staff was kool, boss was kool very understanding An love working with us ."
good,"I loved the General manager and most of the staff. It felt like working with family and they really do believe in helping each other. If someone saw the need to help their co-worker, they did just that it was a really great place to work."
good,I was very pleased with my entrance to the food industry and I am glad to say that it was done at Wendy's. It was a pleasant hiring process and a wonderful first experience for my first official job. I was comfortable talking with my managers and was able to express myself and situation and circumstances freely and openly. I felt like I was given the tools needed to do my job to not only their company standards but my own personal standards as well to improve my work and improve it in a good manner and efficient progression.
good,"Great place to work, best cheeseburgers ever, and the saltiest fries on earth. The management is great and always helpful with any problems you might have."
good,You're always on your feet when working and it was fast-paced and stressful. The people there were awesome and fun to work with. The work hours were very flexible and training was simple and easy to learn quickly.
good,Like to use my knowledge.. To advance my self at my employment.. An ready to learn more.work stills..And be happy at where I working.also enjoy the daily customers..With a happy atitute
good,"I've worked here for 3 years now and there's really not that much stuff that I myself find bad, There's always stressful situations but nothing bad that you cant handle,The pay is good if your'e willing to work the hours,Advancement is very possible."
good,"My placement was either at cashier or drive thru. I enjoyed my work being able to communicate with customers. I learned how to sell and communicate with all types of people, I learned how to handle a register and money; also how to multitask in a fast paced environment and have better memorization. The management was very friendly, kind, and understanding. Not the best with scheduling some days because at times i would be the only one working the drive thru alone during a rush or the front during a rush. Everyone was kind and helpful to each other we all wanted to keep the work environment peaceful and friendly. The hardest part of the job was when a customer would speak to me in a rude manner and belittle me as a person. Also just having to be alone during a rush and an incident come up in the lobby. The most enjoyable part would be when i would get that once amazingly nice and generous customer who can change your whole day with kind words, and being able to visibly see how satisfied and happy you made someone."
good,Overall is a nice place to work if you need a quick job for awhile. The staff is usually nice but sometimes some riff raff get into the ranks. Overall most of the managers are always nice to work with.
good,Became a manager  super fast. My potential and work ethic was strong for my gm to notice me. Opening was super stressful. Every morning was stressful because I did the paperwork set up the line..did all the teas. Did the frostys. Fill up the sauces and bring up the soda cups and fry cups. This was due to our walk in and kitchen being on sepeerase floors and going up and down the stair wad time consuming.
good,"Its a typical fast paced work place, you do your job get things done, deal with good, fair, and not so fair customers and co-workers however thats to be expected."
good,Wendys is a geat company. I have been with the company for a while and has enjoyed my time here. Ive been with wendys from a crew member to a general manger and its been great!
good,"A typical day at work would be challenging in terms of varied customer service. Everyday is a new challenge. You are challenged to excel in customer service, while focusing on Speed, Accuracy, Taste, Friendliness and Taste."
good,Great job for thoses new to the work force. For those looking for a good part-tine job or looking to get hired in the customer service field! Awesome opportunity.
good,"Wendy's has decent management positions you can advance in, great food and great staff. There aren't many downfalls for working here other than a low starting wage."
good,"The job isn't that bad. You get to meet a lot of rude or friendly people. But don't worry, they are mostly friendly, depends which ever location you are working at, lol Overall, its a fun place to work with. Flexible schedule, Great management."
good,"I spent my entire childhood since I was 14 years old, very fun.The job is very exciting you never know what your day will be like the next day. Has its good days and bad days. But in general its a job that pays well."
good,Wendys is fast pace fast food you have to be quick on your feet you have to be able to multitask doing 3-4 things at the same time you have to be good with food safety and proper procedures fast learners and a hard worker's move up really fast if you prove yourself reliable and hard-working or you can get 40 hours within three weeks of starting there is insurance optional for people who can hold 40 hours a week.
good,I loved the people an my teammates I loved interacted with customers I was very fluent in my position as a shift leader. my only concern was my pay I was looking for an hourly rate that I could live off an also I was looking for more career stability.
good,"About Walmart Marketplace Retailer Reviews"
good,"Work normally goes by pretty fast since I don't mind being there, Customers are normally enjoyable to talk to and are kind. Along with co-workers and management. Both are very patient and understanding but push one another to do the very best we can at providing great customer service. Would recommend as a first job or side job."
good,"En un día típico yo realizaba póliza, facturas, entregaba depósitos de efectivo, contrataba, veía checadas de los empleados."
good,"A typical day for me as a shift super is come in joke with the crew, go to the office talk management talk with the other manager, count the safe and make sure Im ready for my shift and get to work.While working there I learned that everybody has a different way of reacting to others its up to you how it is going to affect you. Even though some customers where rude or some employees would like to try their luck you still have to remain clam and put on a smile cause the next customer is not going to be rude and the next employee is not going to be insubordinate. As long as all the managers are on the same page the store will be in smooth running. The stress fullest part of the job is being responsible for a store and your already short to begin with or when you dont have everything that you need for your shift and dealing with the angry over the top angry customers. The enjoyable time happen when you set goals for your team give them a dead line being the end of their shift or the end of the day part."
good,Buen trabajo es poco el salario y un mal ambiente de trabajo muy presionado
good,I like working there but I just don't like being worked too hard. They are working me too hard. My mangers say that I'm a good role model & a hard worker.
good,"Wendy's was a highly productive and fun place to work. It is a fast-paced work environment, and the management staff are welcoming. I developed great team work skills with this job."
good,"The job wasn't horrible. I enjoyed the people I worked with, and the work wasn't too easy or too hard. I was just bored. Constantly doing the same tasks everyday, with nearly the same customers over and over again gets old quickly. Management was decent, but not as professional as they should be. I enjoyed the hours and the schedule was catered to my personal life."
good,"Work hours are great, they work around you going to school and giving you actual hours for your pay check at the end of the week."
good,"I really enjoy working at Wendy's. The typical day at Wendy's can be easy at time and ruff at time. It all depends on who you are working with, if your co-workers are in a bad mood or putting you down its not very exciting. I really enjoy being on front counter interacting with the guest. They always seem to make the day go better. The hardest part of the job is the make the guest happy when something got messed up, but i away seem to make them happy some way or another."
good,"i learnt to work hard,waking up early,meet targets and deadlines,discipline,being in charge,loyalty and self motivation"
good,"Well its been a year at wendys restaurant and i really love wendys. However, staff members are very friendly and mangers as well. Hence, the most difficult work in wendys restaurant is handling customers like drunk they are so disrespectful but still i always have smile on my face and serve them properly."
good,I absolutely loved working for Wendys. The environment was amazing. I always wanted to go to work and had a great a enjoyable day most days. If i could go back i would.
good,My most enjoyable part of the day was rush hour because that was when we were at our busiest and everyone really worked together to successfully facilitate the influx of customers in the least amount of time possible.
good,Great first job opportunity. Flexible with scheduling. Good place to learn communication skills and it's enjoyable.
good,"Enjoyed working here because it teaches you basic skills such as cleaning, cooking, and interacting with other people. Also, how to multi-task and handle money."
good,Enjoyed the culture of the company.Became easy work during a week time period.Overall would work here again.Learned how to cook and manage time between stalls. Came cashier to start off then learned how to make burgers and fries.
good,"Working at Wendys was a Good Job for a young and friendly person."
good,"I enjoy wirking at wendys because all of my co-workers work as a team, tje managers on duty also are team player amd thats what makes fun to go to work."
good,"I continue to work although the amount of work that is piled up on this specific job can slow the employee down and not get all of the services finished in time for the end of the shift. I, myself, feel that I do not have enough hours due to the amount of co-workers and possibly the time of year."
good,"This was an ok job. One of the managers was kind of rude and a bully, as well as the female coworkers. Can be stressful at times, but not too bad."
good,"At this Corporation everyone works as a team , everyone has an assigned section whether it may be  Sandwich Making ,Grill, Drive Thru , Front Line Customer Service, Dish Washing, Etc. At Wendy's corp everyone gets a chance to learn each section of the store ,giving everyone a chance to try a new position everyday . This has  been the most enjoyable job experience although it was my very first . Your co-workers come together and not only do we feel like a team we feel like a family. Management is Very organized and understanding when it comes to a certain work schedule their willing to work with you . At Wendy's Corp they also offer excellent Dental, Medical Benefits depending on how much hours you work with the week/year. This would be a job i require for anyone."
good,"I enjoyed working there, the pace was fast, the people were nice, I learned all sorts of skills. It was a bit chaotic when lunch rush came but we got through everything. It was a great experience and I was glad it was my first job."
good,Its always a good fun well rounded day. Monday threw Friday. I always stay busy its sometimes a very high volume high speed day. I come in every morning at 8 a.m. n start to open my pick up window line. I stock everything I need for my work day and prepare my station for a face paced pick up window. At the end of my day I restock for the shift change.
good,"The typical day was very busy and fast passed because we were located in a business park. Doing this job, i learned to have patience with others, how to multi-task at a fast pace, customer service, etc. My management was very supportive and helpful and for the most part co-workers got along or worked to resolve any issues. The hardest part of the job was the rushes we encountered daily. The most enjoyable part of the job was working together with those around me and helping each other."
good,"Taking A lot of peoples orders and deal with crazy people. It gets easier as you go on. Once you get used to the flow of everything, the job becomes a piece of cake,"
good,"Busy and full of surprises."
good,"-A typical day at work is moving at a fast paste, getting orders in, and satisfying the customers."
good,I would open the restaurant by counting the tills for that day and setting them up in the tills. I would do a cleanliness checklist from the closing shift the night before just to make sure everything is clean before we open. I would turn on all the equipment to prepare for the cooking. I would set up the break plan and the floor plan so that the employees knew which position they were working in that day. I would check to make sure that outside was clean of garbage and debris. I would also assign cleaning tasks to the crew. If it was a certain day of the week then I would place the food order or have a health and safety meeting or being doing the crew schedules. The hardest part of the job is making sure that the customers get their food in an accurate and timely manner.  My manager was great when I worked there.
good,"As a manager in Wendy's you always have to make sure your shifts are ready and good for the shifts so my day at work would be making sure everything is ready and great for good customer service. Best part about the day would be is knowing that not only myself but the crew as well did a great job. Hardest part about the job is making sure everything is ready for rushes, most are somewhat easy but just depends on the level of staffing as well."
good,I enjoyed my job at Wendy's.. However it was a part time job...my full time job was with my uncle..the other empolyees were very helpful helping me learn the job...
good,"A typical day at work for me was just greeting the customers that walked in, always have a smile on your face, bring waters to the table, clean off tables when customers left, assist servers with whatever they needed."
good,"But strict isn't bad. Gives a sense of order, straightens you out into the fast paced lifestyle of a fast food worker. Management is just fantastic"
good,"Offers a raise every year you work there."
good,"Working front line or the drive through, taking care of my customer, the lobby, handle the orders, and stocking. My managers were great same with coworkers. Got to talk with people from all over the place and learn so much."
good,Great staff. The people there are s awesome. The customers can be cranky. A little advice would be to smile and handle each one with care. You don't know what kind of day they may have had so just try to leave them as satisfied as possible
good,This job is not easy and it takes time to learn the necessary skills required but I have learned so much during the time I have worked there. My customer service skills have definitely improved and the speed I work in have also improved since I first started. The hardest part of the job is time management whereby the pace I am working in  needs to increase in order to serve the customers waiting in line while serving quality products.
good,"An average day at this establishment entailed cleanliness and sanitary practices, food preparation, stocking new product in the and most importantly, ensuring that customers were satisfied. The people that I worked with were all very friendly and we would all just pitch in to assist one another when it was needed or someone looked like they could use some help. I learned how to be fast and effective at getting customers what they need and back to their lives. My supervisors did a great job training and instructing me,and made sure that we were all aware of what the work day was going to look like. When we had new product to sell they instructed us on how to sell that product and the tactics we should use to sell it. Sometimes customers had complaints, but not often. When people did have an issue we did our best to address the situation and resolve the problem. If a sandwich was made incorrectly we would remake it at no charge, we offered free frosty's along with this, free drinks etc. I enjoyed just being around everyone, they were all very humorous and we all just had a good time."
good,"Wendy's was my first job with pay. Working at Wendy's was a great learning experience. I was able to develop better listening skills and come out of my comfort zone in order to interact with customers. The hardest part of the job was just being new and having to get used to my surrounding and co-workers. At first I had very bad anxiety so I found it difficult and terrifying to interact with customers, but after some practice I became more confident in myself and my work ethic. During the summer I worked full time, approximately 8-9 hours a day. Whereas, during school time they were very flexible and understanding of my school schedule and I was able to work 2-3 days a week. The best part of the job was once again just finally gaining work experience and being able to learn how to interact with different people and personalities, whether good or bad, and learning how to handle different scenarios."
good,It was a new experience for me.  The owner was always there and he cared for his employees with an amazing passion.  A lot of the customers were travelers stopping through and it was a nice opportunity to talk to someone new each day.  I learned that having a positive attitude can change the performance in not just myself but my coworkers also.  The hardest part of the job would have to be during rush hours in the summer because we could get three or four buses in at once.  The most enjoyable was seeing returning customers and also meeting new people.
good,The day at wendys would start out always fun and we always work as a team no  matter what and you dont see that much these day on that matter
good,I always enjoyed working for Wendy's. they hire a lot of hard working people and are all about there customers day in day out.everybody knows the menu and knows what they want.
good,"In my two years at wends it was tired but really fun, because bein a cashier is responsible of making the costumer happy.  Not everybody comes with the same attitude, and you had to be smart about it, because you didn't want the costumer to leave upset."
good,"I've learned a lot working at Wendy's: Communication Skills"
good,Typical days at work would be very fun and heart warming. It felt as if everyone was family at the restaurant. Even with all the seriousness I enjoyed my stay working here part time. Managers are very serious about their job but don't come off too strong on the crew members which relives stress. Learned about taking the initiative when other crew members weren't so sure about a certain problem. There was really no hard part about the job...just a little trouble adapting to working multiple positions when members would call out.
good,"always on my mind"
good,"On a typical work day It was really busy because I worked at the location next to Hershey Park. I always made sure that the customers were satisfied with my service and their food. I learned how to handle difficult situations by using good communication skills and putting customers first. The management was very helpful, and went out of their way for crew members when needed. I got along with all of my co workers and we helped each other out to get the job done.The hardest part about the job was when it was really busy during the lunch and dinner rush. The most enjoyable part was being able to meet new people and communicate with the customers. I had to leave because school was starting and it was a 30 minute drive from my house. I am looking for something closer to home since I am still in high school."
good,"I would arrive and be welcomed by my managers and co-workers I'd get ready and go onto back window most of the time everything was ready and where it needed to be for shift change other times it wasn't sometimes it was really bad as well but nothing I couldn't manage and my co-workers and managers were always willing to help me. Some days were busy others were not when I was new it was a struggle but when I got used to it sometimes they'd ask me to slow down if we didn't have everything we needed to finish an order. Nothing was particularly hard about the job except for when my location closed and I had to meet a lot of new people and didn't have anyone I used to know and the new people weren't as accepting or helpful so I ended up quitting. The most enjoyable part was feeling appreciated and that I was actually making an impact there and getting all kinds of compliments from co-worker, managers, and customers."
good,"The hardest part of the job at times would be dealing with unrealistic expectations.  I was able to perform my job duties but sometime the unexpected would happen. However, through these situations it has helped me become more tolerant, understanding, and more aware of and how to deal with the unexpected."
good,I love the interaction with the guest having the best customer services the excellent team work that the employees gives the great opportunity the company offer to excel in the company
good,"My job here was precictible in the since of which position I was working that day. The position varied according to where they needed my skills the most or if they had the time and personell to sharpen the skills I needed improvement on. I learned how to explain things to anybody. I could communicate via broken Spanish, a picture menu, pencil and paper or simply re-phrasing things so that the simplist thinkers could understand them.  Management was great, they knew how to utilize talent under any circumstance including runing ""short-handed"" with only their ""less-than-talented"" employees. My co-workers were a blast! They knew how to take a good joke. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the stress of a fast-paced environment as fast food can, and should offer. I would say that the free soda and the discounted food was one of the best parts of the job, but the ejoyable parts out-weighed the bad ones."
good,I really like working there the staff was great didn't want to leave but my marriage was falling apart and had to leave due to personal reasons
good,It was a nice job and hard. I did a lot of work but the people i worked with were nice and so was the manager. Overall enjoyed making friends and enjoyed making food.
good,"Opened and closed store, supervised three to five employees at a time. Assisted with food preparation and completion of orders. Daily cash flow maintenance and sanitation duties also required,"
good,I could never say I didn't have anything to do.  I was always doing something on the floor or in the office.  I really enjoyed being a shift leader at Wendy's.  I would put this job at #2 on my list of great jobs. I really felt like a leader.
good,"Most days where fun  "
good,it was my very first job it was hard in the begging but it became easy it taught me a lot they showed me the ins and outs of working and how to be responable the bosses was loving and respectful and treated me like a family
good,"A typical day includes preparing for rush, handling customer orders, taking money, and providing quick service with a smile. I have learned great customer service skills and how to work better as a team member. The management is great as are the co-workers. Everyone is willing to work together in order to get things accomplished. The hardest part of a customer service job is being patient with customers. The most enjoyable thing about my job at Wendy's is my co-workers and management because they make the job enjoyable and fun each day."
good,I loved arriving at this job and starting my day here. I learned a lot about cash handling and food safety. The management team was wonderful and really on their A-game. They were assertive but knew how to make the job a good place to be. My co-workers were friendly and easy to work with! The hardest part of the job was getting everything clean to the expectations they had but I always got it done. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting customers and making sure they left happy and satisfied so next time they came back they were happy to see me again!
good,"I Thank Wendy's for the opportunity to work for the business . I started from the bottom, working as a crew member. Wendy's is my first job. I know many people couldn't say that they are still working their first job. I'm currently the youngest shift manager in my area. I'm proud of myself."
good,"Everyone was really nice and welcoming. I was really happy there and sad to leave, but I had enough of the fast-food world. It's crazier than most expect."
good,"I have found that the individuals working at Wendy's really make the job experience. It has a team of compassionate, hard working people that work together to get things done. Nobody is left behind."
good,I have been enjoying the working culture and the business. Co workers are good team players. Hardest part is long working hours
good,"I usually worked day shift, running the register and dropping chicken, potatoes, and bacon. A normal day ran smooth with our lunch and dinner rushes. A stressful day is when we got a bus and was forced to make our customers wait while we cooked the food. The management system was good. The general manager kept everyone looking as neat and professional as possible. She ran a tight ship but it was a decent work environment. It was difficult to deal with customers who were just not happy no matter what you did to ensure a satisfactory dining experience. My co-workers and I would do our best to keep the kitchen tidy and running smoothly."
good,"Fun to have a nice work place and good crewmate in this company,"
good,"Working at Wendys was a fun experience, I worked with many of my high school friends and even some family. The only problem was that some of the management showed favoritism to some of the employees, this caused a lot of tension and a lot of drama between some of my fellow co-workers. Many of the employees were also on drugs and when they came in to work they were ""zombies"" and could hardly even move or stay awake."
good,A typical day of work would consist of hard work and fast pace. Every customer mean different experience. It was hard but empowering.
good,Wendy's is a very fun and active place to work at. it is very busy but rewarding at the same time. You get to make the food the consumers order and get it to them fast and take pride in it knowing that you made it. the people are very friendly and the management is grade A.
good,"Fast pace and intense environment with interaction with customers. High speed environment to promote for sells and positive attitude with customers. Learned how to communicate with variety of customers, become patience with consumers, and provide a positive atmosphere. Job was to keep a clean environment safe to sell foods, stock and restock working areas, operate cash register, maintain a healthy environment. Positive atmosphere with co-worker encouraging working together as a team to meet goals. Co-workers and I have a wonderful atmosphere. The hardest part of job is trying to meet drive-thur goal with co-workers who does not have same strive as you. The most enjoyable part is my wonderful co-workers."
good,"working at wendys can be alot of fun if everyone works as a team,we see a different varietyof people and see that there are alot of friendly people that choose to come in"
good,working at Wendy's was hard but throughout the time I worked there it became really easy. I learned how to become more responsible. I got along with all my co-workers there. the hardest part was probably having to learn how to make the burgers that's why I liked being cashier better you get to know people and communicate with them.
good,"extremely  busy some days"
good,"i went in. checked to see who I had working.. Make my goals for the day, look around make sure i have everything I need to get me through shift. cash out registers, assign crew jobs, make sure clean, make bank runs. enter in deposits, and enter in truck orders,"
good,"the skills that I had learned was "
good,"I work as a cashier and crew member. A typical day at work would include me assisting customers, working on cash and making food. My co-workers are really nice and I get along with them very easily. The management is understanding and works really well with the workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is being in a fast paced environment where I always have something to do and I'm always busy."
good,"A typical day at work is dealing with food and dealing with diverse group of customers. "
good,Great place to work as part time. A typical day includes dealing with a constant rush of hungry customers and providing them with quick and excellent service while enjoying a few breaks from the traffic to discuss how well each position worked. One thing I learned from working here is that pleasing the customer and teamwork are the most important things that should be maintained. Co-workers can get distracted a lot with personal problems in and outside of the store but come together well in the end when it's time to work. Management has it's ups and downs with how each manager operates their shifts but overall are great leaders. Hardest part of the job is trying to keep up with customer's needs while also not clashing with the management's opinions on how you handle your job. The most enjoyable part is speaking with the customers about how they are enjoying their meals and seeing how their day is going.
good,"*typical work day upbeat, fast paced, and happy"

good,"* A typical day at work is taking care of the necessary tasks that must be done to complete the rest of the work day or accomplishments needed to proceed to acquire learning in such environment."
good,"Daily inventory and safe counts; utilizing, working alongside, and interacting with the staff; maintaining a good environment and managing the restaurant; Hardest part is to appease the store, which results in compromises; Most enjoyable part is making a customer smile or leave in a better mood then how they came in."
good,"it gets boring sometimes but lunch hour is no joke, and your co-worker can be awesome since they feel you pain of dealing with rowdy customer so you have to have a strong will to not act impulsively when situations get high"

I learned how to balance my personal life with work, as well as with school, I learned what full time hours were like to work during the summer time, and most of all I learned the importance of being a hard worker. I gave my all everyday at Wendy's, striving to provide the fastest, while still accurate, service to customers."
good,The people you worked with were great.  They were always enthusiastic to be there.  Very nice people and great management. Everyone worked as a team.
good,During this time I learned some good lessons about the future of work places.
good,"My typical day at work involved taking orders, talking to customers, preparing food, all while cleaning and stocking up throughout the day. I learned the importance of listening to others, patience, keeping calm in stressful situations, and working fast yet efficiently. Overall, Management was good. My co-workers were just as hard working as I was, and we all came together and helped each other out when necessary. The Hardest part of my job would be Multi-tasking. I feel the need to get everything done on time and for the end result to be perfection. With 5+ tasks on my hands, It got hectic at times but I always succeed with determination. The most enjoyable part of my job would be carrying conversations with the customers, making them feel welcome and giving them an ""at home"" feeling."
good,"I typical day would be that after i clocked in i would go up front before we opened and stock everything. I make sure everything was in order and neat. I enjoyed working  at Wendys. It was fun at times and other days it could be overwhelming. All my co-workers were so nice and very friendly, felt comfortable working around them. The managers all seem very caring for their employers. they would help anyway they could. There are not really any hard part of that job that i didn,t seem to mind to do.They all hating seeing me go, i had complications with my pregnancy in 2007. The most enjoyable part of the job was just being around people. I liked putting smiles on the customer faces."

The management and co-workers are fun laid back and easy going, pretty enjoyable to be around. The hardest part of the job would probably be the cleaning chart and cleaning the fryers. The most enjoyable part would probably be the slower times during the day. You get to your fellow co-workers much quicker that way."
good,"taking orders and making food"
good,a typical day at work was fast paced we found new was ever day to make our service faster and more efficient our management stressed at time due to the fast paced nature of our jobs tried to keep the moral up and all their team happy they have seen lots of people (crew members) come and go and that can be hard when u trying to build a good solid team the hardest part of the job was having to leave I really liked this job the best part of the job was being able work with a team of people that were eager to learn and grow in the careers .
good,"I did all the operations of the business because I owned it.  That included keeping accounts current for the state for requirements, accounting and collections.  I also did cleaning, meal prep and the care of the children."
good,"Managers are young and can relate to your problems, will teach you about responsibility and teamwork, workers are flexible and free so there will always be help when needed, customers can sumtimes be rude or stubburn."

good,"Wendy's is certainly a leading company in the way of training their employees.  The incentives for completing in house training, as well as out of house training were incredible.  The company as a whole, offered very in depth training, with hands on experience during every aspect of the training.  The more you learned to do, more opportunities for promotion would open up.  Self improvement was always encouraged and rewarded."
good,It was one of my first jobs and I'd say it was a very good learning experience. The ups and downs of fast food can be very tiresome and at time very tedious. Working with a team was a new experience when coming into the working world and people soon find out that there is no I in team but in dedication. Those dedicated to hard work and wanting to better themselves in the company stayed. While others slowly moved toward their own goals. I myself enjoyed this company and wouldn't mind working for them again if need be.
good,"I enjoyed my experience working at wendys, it was a fun place to work at. Flexible scheduling and the co-workers and mangers all worked together to achieve a common goal and we each made sure that customers always wanted to come back and eat at Wendys"

good,At this job it required patients and physical requirements. I loved working at this job with my fellow co workers and providing customer service to all of our regular customers. This job required me to put away truck loads and maintaining restaurant maintenance. 
good,"Ive learned how to work faster and better with people , im better at smiling , a typical day at work is fast paced and fun and strict! i love all my co-workers they are all very nice the management is very strict and they make sure everything is done right , the hardest part of the job would have to be the fumes , but i manage .

good,"Running a store and training managers.  This is where I really learned that I was good at training and loved doing it.  Management was great to work with and my co-workers really seemed to care.  The hardest part was the hours and ever-changing schedule, but that was mostly due to training needs.  The best part was seeing people learn and grow as employees."
good,"A typical day would be taking orders on front counter, keeping lobby clean, and closing up at the end of the night. My favorite part of the job were the people, both customers and co-workers. The hardest part of the job was when there was a huge line of people in the lobby and I was the only one taking orders."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is i see people from all the cultures as my co workers or the customers
good,"Everyday is a very nice day working for this company, I have learned to have patience with others. The hardest part of the day is when it was a big rush for lunch."
good,I was a floating manager for the district I worked in. I could run 3 different types of stores. I started working as a minimum wage hourly employee and made it up thru the company in a very very short time frame.
good,"I waorked as a Customer Service Supervisor, Department Manager, Supervisor & Training of employee's"
good,wendys was a great place to work fun surroundings meet new people just all and all a great place to work and the manager really cares about her employees and customers
good,"Delegating task, inventory control, money management, and customer service."
good,"Coming in at 7am to set up the store for it to be open at 10am. It was a lot to do in just 3 hours. Management was okay. They were nice people. Hardest part was doing the fry station and sweating like crazy, especially in the summer. There was never a dull moment at this job."
good,"my work in the wendys Philippines is to trained the new manager and manage my store .I learn to control all the foodcost , labour and increase the sales , the management are so cooperative to improve the store and develop the new manager we trained , the co workers are having fun , the hardest part is when we never increase are sales , and the most enjoyable part of my job is we increase our sales ."
good,"I learned alot from working at Wendy's, like team work, customer service, values and patience."
good,"I learned a lot from working at Wendys' throughout the years, I learned how to work under stressful situations, as well as adapt to others. I dealt with some very unpatient and rude customers from time to time, but I learned to work through their attitudes, and remain the great employee that I was. I enjoyed seeing the smiles over every customers face, as well as their appreciation of my services that I provided. I am the type of employee where if there is a will, then I will find a way, in regards to doing whatever it takes to ensure that the customer is satisfied."
good,"A typical work day would be described as very productive unless we are slow. My daily routine would be is that I would count my money in my drawer and jump right in for drive-thru cash or taking orders for all the customers. I would usually take cash from the customers or coordinate their food and hand it out through the window. Throughout my experience in Wendy's', I learned many things like being responsible and coordinated. The management was very hard working and my co-workers were very talkative. The hardest part of the job was really nothing, I have worked there long enough to know how everything works and to make sure our service time and customer service is pretty good. Making new friends would be the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"My typical day at work was shift manager-payroll, scheduling, invetory, training and assisting employees"
good,I was one of the main closers for Wendy's. I would work about 36 hours a week. The pay wasn't all that good but it was the first job i got when i moved here to main so i made a lot of good and awesome friends there. There was nothing hard about this job. This was probably one of the most laid back jobs I've ever had in my life.
good,It was a fast food resturant yet they made sure every customer was happy and served to the fullest. Their rule was that the customer is always right no matter what.
good,"I would get to work and start coffee, and help to prepare everything for to open up for seven. I would serve customers in the best way that I can. I have learned that although the job is hard you have to keep on going. The management is good but it needs improvement in some areas. They are nice here to the job done on time no matter what it takes. The hardest part of the job is to serve customers who keep on changing orders. The most enjoyable part of the job is to go home to spend time with my loving family."
good,Its a great place to work. My problem was the general manager wasn't doing his job right. He let people get away with too much stuff
good,"Making sure the store is open on time, goals are set and made. customer are taken care of and managers are there to help in any situation. your team members are working together. hardest part for me in my job is having more than one team member calling out and no one to fill that position. the happiest part for me each day is to make sure my customer leave with a wow on their face just because of our service."
good,i really enjoyed woriking there. they worked around me and my family and me being in school
good,"I have been here since i was 17 and i loved the job at first but now it""s time for me to find a career. Wendy's is very friendly and it feels more like family then a team to me."
good,"day starts w me going in early and helping the openers with the task they had if they needed help , going to the bank , comming back helping out co workers and new people helping them get started and watch and seeif they needed any help and help them out set up lines getting the store open on time and customer service"
good,"I went to work at Wendy's to get job experience and because I wanted to earn my own money. A typical day at work for me consists of arriving at work around 4 (I mostly work right after school), get there and prepare my sandwich station for closing at 7. The most important thing I have learned since I began working is confidence. When dealing with customers, it is vital to make eye-contact and sometimes talking with them, asking about their day, is always a good way to bring business. The management is good. As they give you ample amount of opportunity for various job positions within the store. My co-workers are incredible, with a few exceptions. We always laugh, have a good time, but get a lot of things done! The hardest part about the job is dealing with customers and ensuring 100% customer satisfaction. The most enjoyable part is the opportunity to meet and greet with people from different places."
good,- Cooking & Cleaning
good,"If like working with the public, hard work, and never getting bored, this is the place to work for."
good,"The location I managed was attached to a truck stop so we got all types of customers. Everyday was an adventure. I would probably still be there, but I moved back to Michigan to be closer to family."
good,"I loved working at this job. Almost everyone here was fun, motivated, and just great to work with. If I lived closer I would definitely go back!"
good,"I really enjoyed the fast place and the customers, I wasn't happy with management I quit because I found certain standards were not met and I did not want to represent a store that I was 100% proud of, I am a hard worker and try to go above and beyond to make my work place enjoyable,"
good,Wendy's provide a good work experience. There entry level thru General manager progam is the industry best. The menu section offers a wide variety of multi cultural dishes.

good,"Everyone was friendly and inclusive. The working environment was professional but comfortable, management was very stable and helpful. They always made sure everyone did equal work and no one was upset about working there."
good,I believe this is a great job for somebody that is putting a foot in the door.  They do look at work ethic pretty well.  I believe people can build up to something better in the company and help the company become a better place.  I do believe if you want to work for the company in the long hall its a good opportunity to go into management as long as you build the leadership skills.  Fast-pace environment that can be grown while working for the company.  I believe that anybody can do it that can set their mind to it and work great as a team player.
good,"It's a good place to work.  I worked for almost a year now and most of the time it's stressful  here's my  Pros And Cons."

good,It functions well with proper team in place fast paced work friendly environment people friendly customer satisfactory place fresh delicious food relaxing setting for all
good,It was a lot of fun working here. Some times it was the co workers or the supervisors that made it worth working there. It was a good job for starting out.
good,"Overall it was a great learning experience, though we were out of stock quiet often and recieved complaints from customers, it was a great first job for a high school teen."
good,Enjoy working with the crew and management. I really enjoy the customers. A typical day at work would be come in and do Target and then get in the safe and do registers. Then everyone go on break by 930 come back and have a little meeting with the crew and then go about the day
good,At my time I can say I had an ok experience working for Wendy’s. And  at the time I worked there this company was one of the highest salary paying fast food place. Had a good manager and an ok shift manager.
good,Not a bad place to be. Good atmosphere and employees. People are awesome to work with. Any problems that arise the management team is right on the issue.
good,"Generally a chill working environment, plenty of kind people and excellent management, free meal on saturdays and sundays, as long as you let them know ahead of time you can get plenty of time off"
good,It was great as a second job. Couldnt afford to just work there and provide for my family. Great management. Worked with me on schedule to be able to work two different jobs.
good,"Cleaning stations"
good,"Very flexible with maternity leave, always opportunity for in company advancement and paid training. Unfortunately they only offer benefits for management and maternity leave is not paid and no earned PTO."
good,The customers were happy most of the time. The managers were always helping and making sure the customers were happy. It was a great experience working there.
good,"The staff were great and most did their part or more, but management was lacking and didn't know what to focus on at times."
good,"Typical day at work was always busy and fast passed. Learned customer satisfaction. management was normally always great to be around.  Work place reminded me of being back in high school.  Hardest part of job was really nothing,  Most enjoyable part was meeting all the various people and building friendships with the regular customers."
good,"Everyone worked together nicely, even though yeah there were days i was tired. Easy to handle type of jobs. There was no problems when it came to majority of the team, besides the young ones who just started there first jobs; I was there once too though so no hard feelings."
good,"Great experiences, great oppurtunities. Being a young female I've learned how to give authority without being disrespectful and I've learned how to understand customers problems and provide a great solution for the both of us."
good,A good a at Wendy's is when you have everyone on the same page and getting the job done. What I learn at Wendy's is that you are not there to make friends you are there to work and make the guest happy when they come thru and the management there is good they are respectful and can help you when you have a problem that goes on at work and what i like about Wendy's is that there was certain managers there that was fun to work with.
good,"It was my first job, I originally had a set schedule but the longer I worked there the shorter my schedule became, my hours were cut, I myself don't know why they were cut."
good,"The job can be a good advantage in your time of working. It is important to be friendly to your workers and customers. The I work at has over 70% ages 16-25 so since are still in school, they may get stress out one with another depending on how there day been. We could get things done faster if people decide not to take the ""easy"" route or have that ""payback"" attuide toward each other."
good,"The hardest part of the job was dealing with stressful customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with fun people. It was mostly busy when I went to work. Management was nice, fun, understandable and they gave me great hours."
good,Is that you haw to make sure your able to do your job fast and not slow sometimes you cant do your own pace and it gets difficult because sometimes people dont do there job.

good,"the workers is what makes wendys, wendys. Everyone here will be HUMAN and not robots when you talk to them. The food here is great as well, they will not accept undercooked food or food that has not been properly prepared"
good,This was my first Job.  It was easy & relaxed.  My co workers were always willing to help if needed.  Never had a problem while working here.  Very professional work environment
good,"This place was awesome, everyone was friendly if I can go back to work here I would but wouldn't at the same time, Management was alright, Check it out."
good,typically the store would open I would get everything ready to go and I would make sure the employees were ready to go have all the food prep everything was straight cleaned up and rare for their new customers to come in first thing in the morning
good,Im a very good person and im experienced in hha 5yrs and i love to take care of people and their lives and time matters and im always on time i can and will make sure their needs are met
good,"Overall, the company gives back what the worker is willing to put in. If you come in with a mindset to succeed and to achieve, you can go far. The pay is decently competitive, and upper management pushes for high standards of success."
good,"Has a very high fast pace, knowing how to count money by hand is a plus, must be willing to stay after day is done, must have a food handler card current."
good,"Working with Wendys was a great experience, I had a wonderful work environment with kind and helpful people. Everyone got along very well and no attitudes ever got in the way of work. I learned many skills in costumer service and food service as well as management that will help me in my future career paths and I am so grateful for the opportunities I was given in my career with Wendys."
good,"The managers worked with me when it came to  all that was necessary to start. Due to my limited means of funds upon being hired flexibility was a need and it was granted which made me realize the understanding that management had to carry out their tasks, as well as me  being able to move forward in training"
good,Friendly coworkers and good managers who were understanding of my temporary status at the company and supportive of my reason for leaving to to pursue higher education.
good,Wendy’s is a great job to work at I’ll prefer for teenagers to work at a fast food restaurant for there first job because it’s easy and fast to learn the process.
good,Wendy's helped a lot with its amazing staff. People are always ready to help and give advice when needed. It helped me learn a lot of new skills including how to better understand people.
good,"Wendys is a great way to improve your customer service skills. It also helps with being multi tasked and coordinate. The hardest part about working at Wendys is dealing with different customers but once you have everything down packed, it will be easier for you to handle customers."
good,"los trabajadores eran simpaticos y muy sociables, se armaba un ambiente de trabajo entretenio."

good,"It was a learning experience, And it was my first job. I learned social skills, and how to deal with the customers concerns and needs. I also got to work with a variety of people."
good,"Depending on the time I would get to Wendy's would depend on what I was doing.  When I would come in, I would put my things in the back, clock in for work, look at the board to see where I was going to be at, then go to my position.  Depending on where I was, I would be getting a headset, cleaning when not busy, preparing the food, putting it in bags, etc.  As we would slow down, then I would have required items that I needed to do before the end of my shift, and that would be determined by the station that I was located in."
good,This was a good job with great pay. The hours were to long. And the position was stressful.  I loved the customers and my co workers the job pay was awesome but stressful.
good,I deal with executive and labors levels so I got a wide view of the business to fulfill my management. I worked closely to all departments to improve the operation. All previous made me feel a fun and happy job performance.
good,It was owned by a company that also had several different types of restaurants.  I was transferred to a full-service Mexican restaurant. This location didn't do very well.  they had two and the other did very well.
good,"I'd rather not speak about the company. If someone wants to know how I like working here, speak to me directly otherwise nothing will be said, sorry for any inconvenince."
good,They are like a little family you never had. They were pretty flexible with hours. Some days you’ll feel not into it but they help you pick up the pace until you get back into the groove of things.
good,"Not a bad place to work. Flexible schedule, benefits, employees are great, and overall experience was great. You are able to move up if you are willing to work hard."

good,while working there the managers were always helpful and found ways to make your schedule fit your need and everybody was really friendly and everyone did there part in the company it felt like you were part of a family
good,"good place of work, fast-paced, good management but you have to keep an eye on making sure you have your 40 hours a week if you care about that. in my opinion, 11$ is a good pay but not enough for all the work and responsabily i had alone every day. overall i loved working at wendys."
good,"Typical day at work entailed food preparation, cash-handling, sanitation, stocking, shoveling (snow). Management is friendly but stern as needed. No hard part of job. Most enjoyable is tending to food."
good,"i enjoyed working there very nice staff and amazing team cooperation, very clean a nd well taken care of. Management was friendly and very understanding. Work was easy to learn and i never git frustrated. i rate overall 10"
good,"Wendy's was the easiest job I had in my work history. The work Culture, what I loved the most, was about Dave and how he named all the restaurants after his adopted daughter Wendy. The only hard part I found about the job was the poor management at times."
good,"I learned a lot in this company first management and take responsibility and achieve the desired goal to satisfy customers"
good,It's a good job and good pay it's just the employees and management was not good at all some managers didn't care about working just on their phones and u only got one day of training and they were sloppy
good,Good place to work at. Lunch rush is the best because time flies and your not just standing there. You actually get to work as a team so the customer leaves happy.
good,"Work long hours, short staffed for low pay, benefits are available at a high rate, do also offer paid vacation time with advancement, the staff is friendly and accommodating to my life schedule. I enjoy the people and the fast paced work environment I just needed a bigger pay rate to maintain my quality of life."
good,I like working at Wendys they are a great company if just the GM was good there he let people push over him and I didn’t like that about him and a lot of people did a lot of thing behind his back
good,"You'll always have something to do, The staff is very friendly and it's a work place that you wont get bored of.  The day goes by fast as long as you stick to your agenda!"
good,"My experience at Wendy's was fun, learned life lessons, and love the flexibility in the schedule. I like my co-workers and management team. "
good,A diverse work place that is welcoming and very friendly that makes the work process enjoyable. I learnt how to be very organized and calm while working and to never stress. Management is very easy to deal with and friendly. The workplace culture is positive and makes you feel like you are around friends rather than people you just work with. The hardest part of the job is ensuring you don't stress out but that is something you learn and overcome easily. The most enjoyable part of the job is feeling accomplished and rewarded.
good,"A typical day at work is coming to work 10 min. prior to the time your scheduled, dressed in fully uniform. In my 1 year and 7 months Wendy's had taught me a lot. It has taught me a better performed to get along with employees and customers."
good,"Fast paced, challenge oriented and fun.  Met tons of amazing people in my time, loved meeting regular customers, was pushed to better myself and taught me amazing self confidence."
good,Good company to work for.  Room for growth in the company. It can be very hectic during peak hours. Being able to muti-task is an asset in this job.  Fairly flexible schedule.
good,puede ser vista como una experiencia personal donde el trabajo duro y la rapidez son necesarios para ser considerado como un empleado apto para dicho cargo
good,It was a great job to have for a short time period unfortunately i had to move upstate so i was forced to leave the job but everything was left on great terms with the manager
good,The management is fun and will always acknowledge your work.slow pace at first but when it's packed it's packed.Easy to learn and the other workers are amazing. If over 18 you can pay for benefits for little money.The hours are amazing and going up in the ranks is easy if you want it to be.
good,Company still maintains Dave's vision of greatness to be served to his customers.  The place and the people are respectful and helpful.  I always felt part of a team with them
good,I've learned how to work in a fast place environment while being employed at a Wendy's that was located in LaGuardia airport. I learned the proper method of wash rinsing and sanitizing. And enjoying the smiles on peoples face once they received their orders
good,If I still live in Kenosha I would still be working there because they where like family I didn't stress it is a stress free job because every time I messed up they told me it was ok and just try again
good,Wendys is a very fast pace work experience with consistence orders coming through that need to be filled. The management is very good and everyone was very pleasant to work with.
good,"I really liike working at Wendy's. It was my first job in high school. The only thing I didn't like about Wendy's was I was always at work."
good,"its a good place to work, the people are nice, the hours are good, and there is always something to do. everybody helps out and is friendly, you'll never feel left out and there is never a dull moment in the kitchen."
good,"I learned a lot from this place. from customer care to take responsibility for a cash drawer. They taught me wore than just cleaning and cooking food, but to make sure we get things done right so that we do not have a upset customer."
good,A typical day at Wendy's would be taking orders and tending to the customers needs. It is very fast pace and there is always something that needs to be done. I would say the hardest part of the job would probably be moving at a fast pace all the time. It is sometimes hard to remain on top of all the work.
good,Manager was hard on us but for a reason. We always had a great drive thru time. We try to make sure our customers are always satisfied. We'd do anything to see them happy.
good,"Wendy's has a very welcoming environment to both customers and employees. They have flexible hours and positive as well as hard working managers. They teach about efficiency and getting the job done well the first time. Sometimes the number of customers gets disheartening, but the team works together and gets it all done quickly and well."
good,"Very fast paced restaurant, just how I like it. We stayed busy and when the rush hour closed down, we still had plenty of cleaning and stocking up to do. It seems like a lot of work, but I feel people should maintain as productive as they can, it's healthy!"
good,It was fun working in wendys! wendys taught me how to deal with guests. I also experience guest complaints and the management help me to solve the complains.
good,Fresh food served in a fast friendly atmosphere.  Teamwork.  Guests first.  Open at 10am closes at midnight.  Work with anywhere from 3 to 12 employees
good,Wendys of Missouri is a wonderful company to work for. I love my managers and higher up staff. Over a great place to work and gear benefits. They care of  their employees and customers!
good,made sure customers were satisfied with there food made sure they left with a smile I learned fast I knew how to work every position in the restaurant
good,"I say it's a mixed bag because you could get a stellar store with great managers and a cooperative crew, who make you love coming to work every day, or you could get a batch of coworkers and managers that make you wish you could just get fired and be done with it."
good,It was very cool to be an employee at Wendy's. I enjoy working there. The management was very helpful when I needed it. The crew members that were there before me were very helpful as well. I would tell anyone who is looking for a job to go search for one at Wendy's. I know they would enjoy it to.
good,A typical day at wendy's would be very busy and co workers helping each other out. I've learned how to approach and speak to strangers In a clam and respectful manner. The management at Wendy's was wonderful . They did their jobs accordingly . When their co workers needed them they were they . They hardest part of the job was satisfying every customer that came through. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday and getting close to the customers that were a regular customer .
good,"Serving the needs of the customer is the goal of this company. A typical work day consist of staying mindful of the serve safe standards as well as store policy. It was a good confidence builder for me, because it was my first job, so with that being said  I learned how to reach for a higher goal. Management was very understanding, and open minded to new ideas, as well as new strategies. The workplace culture was very motivating as a team, each position cooperates together to make the process smooth. The hardest part of working in a fast food restaurant, was trying to three positions at once late nights. For me the most enjoyable part of the job was being praised and relied on by managers, when they needed an extra overseer."
good,I have been there for more than four years . it is a really great start up job but i dont want to make a life style out of it.Everyone and the managers are the freindlist and great to work with.
good,During my shifts at Wendy's my crew members were always friendly and very helpful. A month after I was offered the opportunity to advance to safety marshal and later on advance to a shift leader. Many of my managers were very friendly and helpful when I was training to become a manager. I learned many new things like how to place food orders and handle angry costumers during lunch rushes as well as having to manage and ensure all duties were done before the next shift.
good,It was a decent work experience. Efficient staff numbers allowed proper and successful of execution of sales. Management is efficient.
good,"I got alot of hours working at wendys, it was a good place to work at. I would of continued working at wendys but i had to move to a different state so i quit."
good,It's not a bad place to work. That was my first job and I enjoyed it. Everyone where great. The management was great. My most enjoyable part of the job was working with my crew and supervisor; great people. Didn't have a problem
good,The job itself is quite stressful due to the fast pace environment (especially when working on drive through as it is a lot of multi tasking) however the staff members are kind and it overall makes for a nice work place.
good,"It's a very bitter sweet moment for me, leaving wendy's. The last two years working for Wendy's/PFJ has taught me so much. I have met some very special people, and the restaurant business has really grown on me. The most recent general manager is definitely, by far the best manager that Wendy's has ever had and the employees are lucky to have him. Someone who takes so much pride in his job and working towards the improvement they have much needed. I Love that the managers and employees know the fine line between being your friend and business. I've never worked for any other fast food business that hard work REALLY pays off. Have seen so many co-workers/friends make it somewhere in their life from having the right mind set and never giving up on their dreams and wanting to establish themselves and reach further goals. Definitely a place I would recommend for anyone to take their time to start out to find which path they want to take towards further success."
good,"The work place had many fun and helpful employees and was a lot of fun to work at, but became really stressful working fast food. The experience all around was definitely beneficial when it came to getting work experience."
good,"I feel as though the Wendy's corporation was very prosperous business, they know how to manage and comply with their workers and customers. I wasn't there long but in my time working there i came to realize it was a great work environment."
good,A fast paced restaraunt that mainly focuses on costumer service.  A place to learn and grow while working toward advancement.
good,"a typical day at wendys was slow and busy"
good,Excellent management and opportunities for advancement. I  really liked this job because of the people and management I worked with.
good,"Working at Wendys can be a bit stressful but working with the right people you have a good time. Even after a busy day we still manage to lift each other up and have a couple of laughs. As a manager i have learned so much. I've learned about time management, coaching, being an example, and also how to handle money. The hardest part of the job is when you encounter a problem and cant find a solution. For the most part the job is fun and everything we do is simple. My co-workers and I always  have a good time during our shifts we make the best of it."
good,Wendy's was a great first job experience and I would recommend it to anyone. The environment was friendly and fun while maintaining professionalism in front of customers.
good,I loved working there the management is very good the people are very nice they get their service out really fast and it is a good environment to work in
good,Easy to get along with people on job training skills management was friendly hardest part was working back and forth with no car but have car now
good,Consistent work which would vary from working with customers to teaching new employees as well as cleaning. I learned a lot of life lessons that I know will serve me and others who I work with and for. All in all most of the managers have been wonderful to work alongside. Much like the managers the co-workers I have worked with have covered all aspects of life and have taught me many things. The hardest park of the job is during a dinner or lunch rush. The most enjoyable part is always helping customers.
good,"After noon job 11-5 "
good,wendys is a very good company they dont skimp on quality and treat there customers right. its just very fast pace and the night shifts where not working out for me
good,When i work i usually get along with the people i work with. If i ever had  a bad day my co-workers makes my day better. I'm am a very hard worker and likes to move around.
good,when i worked there i was due to move up to shift leader but they gave it to a new worker over me cause she had a kid the workers were fun to be a team with
good,Wendy's was a great place for me to start..I really enjoyed the time I was there...They treat you like family..They very organized..The crew member was very respectful and helpful.
good,Best part of the job was food preparation. Some of the other employees were what made the experience bad. Management was great and really listened to costumer complaints and suggestions.
good,"I liked working at Wendy's, I learned much about the fast food industry. Though it was very busy and sometimes it was hard to work with others, I still got the job done and was rewarded with the experience. I am not a very big fan of the idea that I might work there again, but I  wouldn't say that it's an awful place to work, in fact it's quite nice."
good,"Dealing with customers"
good,I learned never to panic and to never be scared to ask for help it is alright. There was always something to learn and a new challenge to face every single day.
good,"i loved working here, along with other coworkers and managers who were very kind and fun to be around. Great work environment and nice place to have as a first job."
good,"Work is fast-paced and rewarding."
good,"A typical day at work was busy one day then slack the next"
good,"fast pace"
good,"It was a fast pace environment which I like because your shift didn't drag out, and I liked the people I worked with, I liked the facted they had free uniforms"
good,"Running a good restaurant is quite literally an act of plate-spinning. You need to manage the supply of ingredients, schedule all of the staff, prepare the facilities and more, all before the restaurant is even open."
good,"I learned a lot about running a store in a high volume environment."
good,Great place to work. Very friendly towards staff and easy to work around personal life. Most days you serve guest that come to the restaurant. very fast paced.
good,It was a pleasure working at the company. It's a great fun place to work at with cooperative and friendly co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you recieve a compliment over your work.
good,"Having my first job at Wendy's was not disappointing at all. My General Manager was  kind and  motivational. I learned every part of the store  so that I had the ability to be promoted. Everyone helps to give  customers great, fast customer service. The schedule was very flexible and mangers did their best to put me on the days I was available. Extra hours may be earned if people call out  but it is optional. Although the pay is little, the job can be fun and enjoyable for students in high school and college."
good,"I was a general manager of that location and was responsible for managing sales,accounts,maintenance,payroll and labor etc. In this job, learned that cutomer service and treatment for staff is the most important part of the business.The hardest part of managing a restaurant is to have long term employee due to low pay rate and no benefit coverage. I really enjoyed my job because it's my passion to meet new people and work in a fast phase."
good,"good service"
good,"It is fun and enjoyable. I learned to effectively communicate with various people, an ability to run and lead a successful team and an ability to perform an excellent service under pressure. Well trained in executing store action  plans, set communication structures and procedures to enhance team success. I enjoyed the part were you solve customer issues and receive or give feedback to a follow coworker, manager or from a superior manager. If you are like me used to work 45-60 a week, then you will know that co-workers literarily become your family. Co-workers represent more than 75% percent of the work , so in order to lead a successful team. It is very important to assist and co-workers through out the shift. I believe something is hard, if you want it to be hard or not train well on handling it. If you are trained on leading a successful team under pressure and trained your employees on performing under pressure then you will be good through out the shift regardless how busy it is. One thing that is effective in such circumstances is to train your employees in all position and that will give you flexibility on  scheduling and managing labor."
good,Learning about the job from co-workers. Taking time to learn the proper way to do things. Fun environment. Safe place. The absolute best part of working there was that the management worked with my school schedule.
good,"Wendys was my first job. It taught me alot of skills that I still use today. Management was flip flop, meaning they were cool one day and the next, you didnt like em. Customer were usually respectable and understand and of course we had the other kind of customers"
good,Fun and safe place to work. Learn new things. Everyone was was equal. Was like family. Love meeting the new  people that come in.
good,A typical day at Wendy's was basically come into work clock in and get the food prepared for today. Start serving the customers until it was time for me to clock out.
good,"It was a good place to work, with cooperative coworkers and helpful management.  I learned how to prepare the different toppings for the foods, prepare chili and fries, as well as properly labeling start and end dates on foods.  I learned how to organize the inventory by date of arrival, and how to operate much of the (simple) machinery in the building.  It was a rewarding experience, save for a few unsavory employees and occasionally impatient management."
good,Exciting workplace with great management. Looking forward to something new everyday can be a thrill as well as the help from management.
good,"Wendy's as a whole have my heart. I love the food, the atmosphere, and what Wendy's stands for. Wendy's was my first job. I loved and took my job so seriously I got promoted within a 6 month time period of starting there. I would mainly run the drive through window, where I could interact with customers in a timely manner. I enjoyed speaking with each individual and making them aware that we truly appreciate and care about them. I also, sometimes, would dress up as the actual Wendy girl. I would interact with customers, especially kids, and hand out balloons to ensure the quality of our restaurant.Our staff was exactly like family to me. I would never say anything negative about Wendy's."
good,"It's a fun job depending on your location, closing is HARD work but other than that pretty fun people. Only get a raise every 6 months and the maximum raise you can get is .20 cents"
good,"Working with Wendys taught me to get specific task done quickly and organized. Fast food services are timed and almost always organized. The management team was always trying to better employees, I moved up quickly become a manager within a few months. I enjoyed meeting the wide range of customers, and serving them."
good,Wendys is a really good restaurant to work. Very flexible hours and having fun working with people around me. Not really a hassle job once you have some experience.
good,"I loved working at Wendy's "
good,"Fast pace, fun, and great work environment to work in. All the employees are great but very young crew. More so of a first job type of place."
good,"Working as an assistant manager at wendys has been very beneficial. I've learned a lot of great and valuable skills and lots of experience in customer service and management. Each shift i work i successfully run the shift, meaning i manage the product levels, waste control, managing the productivity of the staff while meeting sales and service times. My shifts are run at a 90% or higher level of success. The management is very helpful with training and making sure the staff and other managers have the tools and skills they need to succeed.  The crew and my co-workers are always friends and easy to get along with. I am a people person which helps create good bonds with my other co-workers. "
good,"Overall, i enjoyed Wendy's. There was always something to do, so everyone was kept busy. A busy workplace, is the best workplace."
good,"The experience taught me so much about time management skills, money handling, people skills, and professionalism. This was my first job while I was still in high school and it gave me skills that I could use when acclimating to the university life (communication skills and the ability to ""go with the flow"" if you will.)"
good,"During the day, I would work with all of the machines in the kitchen, the grill, oven, fryers, and stove top. Multitasking at its finest, it was.   Communication with the manager was needed often to maintain a good Customer-Food ratio. We were always preparing for the next rush, or family to come through our doors."
good,"One of the greatest parts of the job was being able to communicate with other people and customers, the managers were great as well"
good,I enjoy that I get to help train others. I enjoy management and all the steps they take to being the best. Easy place to learn how to improve work ethics.
good,"Yes, that's about what I experienced.  To me its fun to carry a hot pot full of beef vegetable chill, press burgers and take orders.  Cool staff members as well."
good,"Lots of young workers."
good,"In foodservice the hours are long and can be stressful, you definitely have to have a certain type of personality to be successful in the food industry."
good,Everything that a average fast food restaurant occurs from harsh customers to unexpected situations but the co-workers at the location make working there much easier and enjoyable. The work schedule is flexible. The only bad side of this job is the advancement since you might get a salary increase after one year of working then the next increase might not occur after more than a year.
good,"I believe my experience for working at Wendy's was  a good one."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be working as the grillman and as the drive through cashier so it was a very fast pace environment. Also as the grillman there was a different area to clean for each day of the week and I also had to make all sorts of food. I learned the most at this job because it was my very first job so I learned how to use the cash register and how to appropriately use the stove, grill and so forth. The management was very helpful towards my learning and I picked up on my work fast. My coworkers are all very friendly and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was to clean all the oil and grease of the products. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the things I learned and how great it was as a first job."
good,Although I have only worked for the company for a short time they have consistently demonstrated that they are attempting to do the right thing for their employees.  The upper management carefully considers their decisions and tries to reward their management and crew members for their hard work and dedication.
good,"This was a newly remodeled store and many people were still in training, including managers; however, it was a great place to work. We had to reteach and retrain our customers as well as the staff because expectations and standards were much higher. I learned how to interact positively with others despite any negative attitudes that were displayed throughout the day. That skill really helped me improve within myself, how to interact with others, and as a manager. The hardest part of the job was getting others to buy into the new concepts and motto. On the other hand, watching everyone grow and change overtime was the most enjoyable. It showed you that all your hard work, determination, and dedication paid off"
good,"- 8&1/2 hour shifts, 40hrs/week, different shifts week to week. "
good,Wendy's is a good place to work if you love working with different type of people from the customers to the employees.
good,"Typical day at work consists of stocking up if I'm on either cash or sandwiches. Stocking up before dinner and lunch rush and stocking up post rush. Making sure my work station is clean and has no clutter or mess. Closing down the station after the store is closed. I learned communication is an important tool in order to create an easier workplace for you and your co-workers. Speaking about and bringing up concerns with management is very important in order to help run the restaurant to the best of its ability. Being cordial with co-workers is key to a healthy, positive and comfortable working environment for myself and everyone I work with. The hardest part of the job is during rush time. You need to perform at the best of your ability at all times and meet the store standards including the service timer and food quality. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with co-workers and customers on a regular basis."
good,"I enjoyed work, I enjoy meeting new people and most of all I enjoyed taking care of my customers"
good,"Productive and fun work place with customers who always have a great experience with Wendy's services. It was always a great day at Wendys,"
good,"A typical day at work is very busy and working on a fast past."
good,The work experience furthered my knowledge to running a company.
good,"I was a closing manager, and I made sure the store was running properly. I kept employees working on task, ran reports, handled deposits, and did inventory. I learned that all people are not the same when it comes to work ethics. It was an environment where co-workers were not pleasant. I did my job and whatever else I was told to do. The hardest part of this job was that there was no team work. I enjoyed the part of gaining the managerial experience."
good,"A typical day at work includes taking orders, meeting and greeting customers, stocking up the front of the restaurant, cleaning surrounding area. Learned to be punctual, and great communication skills. Hardest part of the job is when business is slow, and the most enjoyable part is when people get their order and thank you."
good,have fun  and  preparation for all stuff in need for evryday.. working all around
good,"When I showed up for a day of work, I knew what to do, and if i didnt I had other employees to help me, very friendly. I learned customer service and it gave me an idea that i would love to work with customers. I really enjoyed working with people and providing them with amazing customer service. I don't think there was a hard part of the job. Every task i had wasn't easy but wasn't hard either. i really really enjoy working around people."
good,Starboard group (Wendy's) always put customer first  we have to make sure the every customers  leave happy no matter.
good,"I loved working here. I worked at this location for four and a half years. The job is tougher than people think, and you have to be quick on your feet to do this type of work. Like any fast food restaurant, the actual work itself wasn't enjoyable. It's repetitive, tedious, and so quick paced its stressful. The people I worked with made this job worth it. The management is tough, but for good reason. There was no drama that was tolerated. If you didn't want to do your job, they sent you home. It helped the job flow smoother. Problem ares were taken care of."
good,"*A typical day at work consists of attending to customers and providing them with what they need."
good,This was my very first place of employment and i absolutely loved it! I still keep in touch with so many people i met and made friends with here. I was even promoted to management
good,I learned the aspect of working with new people and how to read them. I enjoyed my mangers and co-workers. Hardest part of the job was dealing with rude people. The most enjoyable part is working with great people and getting to meet new people.
good,"Everyone there is polite"
good,"Working at Wendys company is such a nice place,"
good,"I enjoyed working with this company. I was fortunate to have an awesome GM and other managers. Even when my disability started to affect my work, management still tried to work with me to keep me working. I learned that not all bosses are mean and surly. Sometimes you get blessed with real God fearing people who are amazing to work with."
good,"I liked working day shifts better than night shifts because it wasn't as stressful during the day. One specific manager, I did not get along with. I feel like she purposely made it harder for me to enjoy work. I was purposely put on back register when I wasn't the best at it, because I was just thrown onto the job. I was also forced to work off the clock on a night shift, because some things weren't caught up when the closing shift came in. So I had to clock out and work for free without getting paid. It was either clock out and work or lose my job."
good,could have been better but i enjoyed must of my time working there
good,They made sure there was always work along wit the customers
good,"My day starts with cooking bacon, preparing the sanitizer and soapy water used to clean the dining room tables and chairs with, making sure the dining room is clean before opening, stocking to prepare for the lunch rush, counting my cash drawer before opening and then greeting customers.  I take their orders, prepare the drinks and assemble the orders on the tray or in bags and thank the customer for coming and say ""come back to see us again""."
good,"I come in wash my hands, and jump right in to where the manager needs me. I know every position like the back of my hand. I stock and clean anything i can between rushes and customers. I make sure things run smoothly for my team members and help out any way i can, after all we are a team. I've worked mornings, mids,night, and graveyard shifts. I did breaks and counted till. Did safety temperatures,etc. safety marshal duties. "
good,"A great place to work. Friendly staff and managers are always eager to have you doing your best and are willing to help you get there."
good,Working with this company improved my customer service to meet all customers needs.  It helped me to push myself  to the max and help my fellow employees to be  the best that they can be. I was able to meet new people on a daily basics and have some that always came back just to see me.
good,"managers are pretty cool , co-workers all get along some hang out out of work. Very loyal customers most enjoyable day of work is taking orders and being able to serve the customers exactly what they want."
good,Working at Wendy's was a terrific experience. I learned many new skills while there and found the staff and management to be highly supportive.
good,Got to do many duties. Enjoyed the challenge when we had our rushes.
good,It was a friendly environment to work and the co-workers was like family.
good,I learned how to become part of a team and work together. One person doesn't do everything in the fast food business. Some one has to cook and make the food while someone bags it. Also someone else sells the food. With all of the people working together to make Wendy's successful it helped me realize what it means to be part of a team. Also it taught me people skills. Working with customers taught me how to relate and talk to people.
good,"Work environment was great, And the people were somewhat decent, learned same things I learnt at friendlys."
good,"a day at work was fast and fun, i learned everything customer service, working a register it was my first job outta high school, management was great, enjoyed my co workers, not really a hard job, great work enviorment at the airport you meet new people everyday"
good,I love working there cause everyone got alone it was like we were family. we got alone no problems
good,very diverse work place i would get a diffrent work task almost every day
good,A typical day @ work is satisfying the guest. I learned you really have to be humble. Management is constantly changing. Co- workers work very well together. The hardest part of this job is when
good,bad management and very angry work place slow unsanitary unsafe
good,"A typical day here was the same as any as fast food. But this one has such great management, were still friends to this day! It wasn't work with them, yes you knew you had to stock your inventory & wash dishes, but they didn't micro-manage & you could get it done without being pestered about it."
good,"The hardest part of this was getting everyboby to work as a team, but I did like job very much be cause of people I got to know ."
good,"Working here wasn't too bad. It was fun and the managers were very nice. We got free food for staying over late when asked, you got raises based on position and how well you were working. A typical day was on grill, I learned that and people speaking skills becasue i was also put on speaker a lot."
good,"A typical day at work would be keeping our stations clean and stocked as well as our dining room. I've learned many things working hear at wendys, for example talking to customers and being able to make conversation to make there time pleasant at wendys. I also got very familiar with the computers and all the electronic devices used at wendys. When it comes to mangement, we have really good and understanding managers that are always there when needed. My co-workers are always helping out with anything that we need and always do great team work. I can honestly say that I have become very familiar with all the positions at wendys and the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people everyday and always pleasing the customer with our service."
good,"Overall the job was well maintained, but there were alot of angry customers because their food wasn't made correct, due to other co-workers."
good,the management was very good very friendly ma typical day at work was mainly busy. i learned how to do back cash mainly i was always in kitchen and that was my best place at work. i enjoyed meeting new faces so if i ever needed help i have more then one person i can go to and there was always another person helping me to make work go faster and the job easyer.
good,Working in a fast food chain is hard work. It includes in fast pace work abilities and multitasking jobs.
good,• Oversee all employee logistics for a staff of 43 employees and four other managers
good,Objectives and Goals are met at the end of each day operations. Very strong team work.
good,A typical day would be preparing food and setting up to get ready to help customers. I learned customers are always right. My manager at the time worked well. My co-workers were always about their work very good environment. Hardest part about my job would be dealing with disrespectful customers. Most enjoyable part of my job was just being in a good environment.
good,I was on fries most of the time because there wasn't anyone who could keep up with the lunch rush like me. There wasn't any part of the store that I couldn't run. The managers were nice and helpful. The customers were great.
good,i been working for Wendy’s for 3 yrs now but in January it will be 4 yrs Wendy’s has been my longest time working I learned working cashier and somewhat sandwiches but the job was great when I started but it has gotten weak ever since then ready to do something new but the hardest part of the job is for is working around tight place with people and infront of people
good,My wendys experience was really fun and laid back. i enjoyed being at my work spaces and i got along with co workers and managers  really well we were like a family.
good,Hard work but easy to pick up each job. Learn every position and stay at that position untill you can do it well. The pay rate when you start is poor. As you move up the ladder the pay gets better but the hours get longer. I learned alot from Wendys. Went there with little to no experience and left with a great deal of experience in may areas.
good,Very good starting job if anyone is looking. Very good team members and everyone is nice to you. You get to learn how to become responsible for yourself and others.
good,Wendy's has excellent customer service and they do an excellent job at serving food fast paced. The staff and customers are very kind. We work to keep a clean environment
good,"I would go to Wendy's happy to get to work with everyone else and have a good day, the staff would be really nice and communicate and help one another out, very different to what most things I here about other franchise restaurants."
good,It really does give u a lot of skills to apply to different things but its not a career anyone should consider staying in. It eats away at you. 150 minimum
good,I enjoyed working there. I like serving customers and cooking/prep foods. I love working as a team. Great mangers with compassion with their hearts. Very understanding and Professional advice to give to co workers.  Co workers very helpful and friendly. Customers were friendly and satisfied.
good,Wendy’s was a very calm place to work it’s so peaceful in there unless we had a rush then it was hundreds of people waiting to get their food . Unlike McDonald’s their were never any problems with the workers everyone respected eachother and were friendly . It was never a time I felt uncomfortable.
good,Wendy's was my first job.  I learned a lot about the restaurant business.  Working at Wendy's was fast paced and it was hard work.  I did not like working late and cleaning.  Managers kept information to themselves
good,This job is a great job for someone that is in high school and need a job not someone with a child as far as fair income.A great environment and I learned alot.
good,I thought it was really kept up nice clean organized and nobody would slack everybody would do their job no fighting or arguing work as a team never thought I was less or they thought they were better than me at least gotten good stuff positive stuff we had wonderful reviews getting rewards left and right. I got employee of the month. Safety Marshall I got awarded and food handler card got certified again
good,"Fast paced and sometimes slow day"
good,"Overall, Wendy's was a fantastic first experience in the work force. I grew a love for working and began picking up days and taking shifts for coworkers. My managers taught me the value of being on time, being prepared, customer service, and management. The hardest part of the job came when I had to begin learning the ins and out of my promotion. It was a little hard but with team work I was able to get a grasp quickly and efficiently."
good,Working at Wendy's is not a good living job. It should be for starters who want to get their first job. It would be hard to live off of the pay that you get at Wendy's.
good,While working for Wendy’s I made friends for life with some of the employees and still talk since I don’t work there they took good care of you when I had a health problem they helped me and understood I have family emergencies from time to time
good,Great Job it teach you balance and discipline. Meet different customers with different backgrounds. Strong believer treat people how you wanna be treated. Job has great advancement I became a manger less then six months working for the company.
good,"Management: Working as a shift supervisor, I learned that while every night may not go as planned, it is crucial to be able to adapt to your crews need"
good,Very diligent work place. Great customer service as well as great training. Every employee is required in each position. Making it a better and more convenient work place.
good,Trabajo de lunes a sabado en un entorno agradable con los demas compañetos de trabajo.
good,You just need to be well organized and well paced. First time working but it went pretty well if I could do it again I would but Id eed a higher pay that’s all.
good,"Wendy’s is a fast pace job. But it brings so many personal rewards."
good,I love working in the public and dealing with customers.  Wendy's is a good place to be.  I treat the customers as they would want to be treated in their own home.
good,I am a humble person who does not cause any problems in the working place or environment and I will be so grateful if my request is by put in to working.
good,"A pretty cool place that gives people, with records, second chances. Upper management works hard to create a productive work environment. All employees strive for top-notch customer service."
good,Despite being a very stressful industry I had a great experience because I got to work with a great team and our managers were great at giving support and creating a positive environment throughout. It was a very stressful but very positive work experience overall.
good,Overall wendy’s is a nice place to work. It teaches you many things and can build skills for people. It is a fast growing buisness and has nice benefits. It is a nice job to have
good,"typical day at work is taking orders and packing food, I learn that not everyone is nice but you cant take it personally but say sorry, the hardest part was keeping up on orders and not losing your place. The most enjoyable part is the friendly co-workers that work at wendys."
good,"Well organized location for Lawrence"
good,Ive been employed at wendys for 4 years and it has been very fun and exciting just ready to move on to better things. Mangement is good. Customers are loyal. Benefits can be good if you stay employed for a while.
good,"The hardest part of this job would have to the lack of motivation. You could have half of your crew ready, on time and ready to work and the other half not involved at all."
good,All the people there are nice and outgoing. Most people didn't do much and were lazy instead of doing what they were told to do. I loved the environment and the friendly people there.
good,Plenty of room for development within the company by displaying hard work and a great attitude. Also by following procedures and policies. Interacted with many influential people who guided me through coaching and corrective criticism.
good,Starting off the works and pays is worth the time. Do not recommend staying at this job for 2 years or more unless job is to become a manager. The pay is worth it. Needs better night managers. You will get called in on your off days.
good,No review at this time and im not gonna do that anyway because it sucks there. I hate working there because my feet hurts all the time and I cant stand it anymore.
good,"Fun place to work good people to work with. Learned a lot about different people, met a lot of good friends that I am still friends with today even though most of us went our separate ways"
good,Working at Wendy's gave me years of experience that I can take anywhere with me to any job I choose to go to. The management actually cared about the crew and set goals for us to work as a team.
good,The way management runs things affects the whole staff . When there’s not good management there’s not a good team . Management always switched up because the previous one wasn’t so successful .
good,-as  a assistant manager my responsibilities was to ensuring that the company policies are followed. Optimizing profits by controlling costs. .resolving  all customer issues to their overall satisfaction. Maintaining an overall management style that follows company best practices.
good,"Was in early every morning doing my own separate work very proud of my specialty food prep, No Complaints,"
good,The workplace at Wendy's is really wonderful. I have learnt and even learning many new things everyday. The only thin I didn't like is that you get half an hour break only if you work more than 5 hours.
good,the work area is clean and the staff are friendly. and the work area is both relaxed and fast paced at some points. I would definitely recommend working there.
good,There's always something to do even on a slow day. Tend to get busy around the time 12 and 3 is mostly a lunch/dinner rush. Everyone works as a team to get orders out to the right customer in dining room and drive-through. Take care of customers when they call and complain about their orders being messed up and write it down to keep track in what was taken care of or not taken care of. Always promoted the new items that came in and needed to be sold.
good,"So far the work at Wendy's has been a relatively good time, it has been fun and enjoyable. I do have a few complaints for the 2 years I've been here, the process for getting equipment fixed/replaced is far down on the priority list that some issues go for months at a time without being resolved."
good,I've been at Wendy's for 1 year and a month. And it's like being at home but with different people and we're all wearing the same outfits. But everybody is quick-paced and ready to work. Wendy's has a lot of customers that come through and we all stay at the top of our game to make it through and get to the next car. Everybody makes sure their station is all stocked and cleaned at the end of the day.

I learned how to listen to each customers order over the headset and enter it correctly without messing up the order. Management was great, they were all nice and very friendly people. Co-workers were just a bonus of going to work, as long as you have good co-workers you'll have a good time at work. The hardest part of the job is to make sure you get your service times, sometimes it gets really busy and you just have to work at a faster pace which I like better.

good,"I was confused with what to do when i was learning the positions on the computer at Wendy's. Once i got started. I was having fun on the grill flipping burgers. After a while, i was able to pick up the pace to fry french fries, nuggets, and other. Then, i went to stir chilli, refill ice trays, and restock on food to grill/fry. It's very tiresome, but i enjoyed it. The only annoying part is getting burned by hot grease. Once i got in the groove with the team, it was easy to know what meat to put on the burgers for the other workers to finish making the burger. The most enjoyable part was being able to eat for free and taking home the left over food while your getting ready to clean your station.       "

good,I enjoyed working with the company till we where bought out by mpc corp. aand they changed some our benefits.and changed all managers status
good,"my day at work, was a very fast pace day, with employees and customers. Early in the morning get ready for a busy lunch took a lot of prep. I had to project sale for that day, make sure that we had enough employees schedule for the shifts, enough inventory on hand."
good,"Well it does receive a lot of business no matter what day. I took what I learned from Wendy's like different skills that will come to effect in what ever are of work I get. Nothing was horrible about this job, the people, the boss, and the workplace was all and excellent experience."
good,"Always treat people the way you want to be treated. Take care of the customer's needs, after all, they do spend quite a lot of money at your stores. Customer service too, is the key to keep a smile on the customer's face."
good,I love to make my customers happy and to see that they are also please wit my job. I like to make my customers to feel welcomed when they walk thru the door and also leave. I feel everybody should make customers happy first
good,"A High Energy Place To Work, How They Make Frosty's, The People I Worked With Was Very Humble Taught Me How To Speak Their Language, Shared Their Food As Well... The Hardest Part Was Cleaning The Grease Pan.."
good,Great place to work. I would clock in prpare my cash drawer with the manager and settle my self in to the fron register. I learned to take orders at a fast pace correctly and make change. Managment was ok friendly. Coworkers very nice and helpful worked as a team. The hardest part of my job was probley cleaning the grill. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know the regular customers and seeing them everyday.
good,"great learning how to cash in and out making sure its counted right also meeting poeple, taking orders n packing them right."
good,"Very fun people to work with, fairly easy work, plenty to do to keep busy which makes days go by faster, decent raises"
good,"Took orders, fixed food, customer service and wash dishes."
good,"worked hard to satisfy their customers, worked hard to complete orders in less than 2 minutes"
good,i enjoyed working there the peopl are very respectful fun laid back nice
good,"typical day changes."
good,I loved going to work. My employees was always a joy to work with as well as working with. My supervisors was always nice and always help me when I need it.
good,loved going to work i leared how to work all of the store
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy's. I worked with great people and managers.
good,The one I worked at was new so it was very crowded all the time. Which was very stressful. I handled it well but at times you’d feel like just not coming back.
good,I hate working  from paycheck to paycheck. Want something  better  and something that pays more and I can get pay vacations  and pay time off and I could be happier
good,Easy work nice people we all work together as a team. We sure we got the job done an always respect are customers. When working for Wendy's you always have to make sure your have the right order and listen carefully so that you don't get our mistake someone else's order and to rembemer the customer is always right.
good,"This job was not for me at all,you get no hours and they had they favorite, job was unfairly....boss was every disrespectful...you work 23 out a week.."
good,"Your typical fast food restaurant. I learned I never want to work in fast food again. Management was horrible, the boss just sat in the office and slept. Best part of job was when I got to go home."
good,"I love my job, nice plce to work, nice people , i get to meet people every day i learned to give peopl what they want its just a very good place to be  "
good,Good place to learn how to manage a small crew and work your way up in a mangement position
good,This job is a very fast pace job. You have to be quick on your feet and have very good communication skills to work here. But for someone just starting out in the work world this could be the perfect place.
good,"It was okay I would work part time not full time slow paced , good environment it's cool it's friendly some great people who works there I can't complain just looking for a better job"
good,Overall bad experience with the company managers had very poor attitudes and made the work enviorment very hard to be in. My hours were very flexible and worked around my school schedule that was the plus side of the job.
good,"This place was the great I got along with mostly everybody we all work as a team especially when it came to busy days we all learned new stuff everyday all the co-workers were great management was good for this place being my first job."
good,Customer service is okay. Customer compensation is fantastic. Management and team have a tendency to forget the purpose of the organization.
good,"It was an ok place to work. Managment is ok but you have to find tge one you like. The food is good, but could be done better. The way we learn to make the food was done poorly. The general manager could have set a better example for his employees."
good,"My job overall wasn’t hard at all. There was a lot of favoritism in play. The whole store was African American, as a Mexican American, they treated me very poorly and always made racial remarks about Hispanics. Over all it was a very disappointing, disgusting, disgraceful place to work."
good,"Working at Wendy's was not all it kicked up to be. My managers never wanted to help us clean when the night was done. They were always on their phones, even though we weren't allowed to be on the phone. Once you challenge the way of things in the workplace, you're seen as a threat. Which made no sense to me."
good,"It was a good job for high school students. I would clock in, count my drawer, and  make sure front line was clean for when customers would approach. It made days hard when people would not show up for work on a Friday night. Some shifts I would work 11hrs because of people not showing up those were only on weekends though."
good,Wendy's was a good place to start working again and a great experience for me to be able to grow as a person and I would recommend that to any one!!!!
good,we made sure our customers we're satisfied I learned how to deal with computers the hardest part is being a team players when others are not other then that everything is good.
good,greeting customers and taking orders and handling cash Making food and passing out the orders to customers.Making the customers happy and satisfied
good,the hardest part of the job was memorizing all the menu. what I learned from this job was to give correct change to the cosumer
good,i would work 50 hours a week and there was not enoph apprecation for the type of work and amount of hours put in the pay and time for work was not great for the pay
good,"Over all I can say Wendys is a great workplace, but not enough team work, and or pay, but the customers or very loving, helpful, and caring,the reason I say not enough team work is, because I got to do everything by myself as an closer, I’m talking take Orders, collect money, fixing drinks, bag the food, stock, mop, sweep, keep my area clean which is  normal, and on top of that wash dishes"
good,"My day included opening doors to the shop. I then would do the food prep for the day, based on projections for the day. I would clean & mop the shop & bathrooms, empty trash and work Drive-thru window."
good,It Was A Good Work Place For Beginners. At First They Would Help One Another But As Soon As You got The Hang Of It The Would Stop Helping And Ignore Duties That The Were Placed. The Show One To Be Independent And They Toughen One Up But Overall It’s Not A Healthy Environment. It’s Not All Wendys Just One In Particular That I Used To Work At.
good,"Most days that I work, it stays steady and has its times of rushes. I always try to stay busy doing things that need to be done by the end of the night. Sometimes things do get very stressful but I usually try to stick to myself and do my job. Since working at Wendy's I have learned to clean out the bottoms of the fryers, clean grills, make sandwiches and how to do prep.  "
good,"It was an experience. Hard work that will test your limits, but pushes you to be a better team player. An teaches you to make goals based upon time. a good place to work."
good,"counting my cash, starting the pumps for gas, CSR in the store, cashier, etc....Management played favorites. Which I thought was unfair. My co-workers were great people to work with. Not really anything hard about the job"
good,"I had many tasks of getting bacon ready to be cooked, separated the cheese so the ones putting the burgers together for the customers. "
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits."
good,"work by headset and hear what the customer is saying on the speakers and prepare food while, their ordering."
good,The food was good i just didn’t enjoy the people i worked with. The shift leader was strung out on drugs and she always smelled like cigarettes. The manager was always yelling for no reason and i wanted her to shut up
good,the job was very tiring we had to deal with a lot of rude customers our managers did not help us until i had my parents hired at this location so they could see what we had to go through
good,Just way to much joking around on site . Eating on the food while gloves are on and not replacing them with new ones. Do food the way they want them to be done
good,All in all the company is great it’s the management they have in there. I understand they have a job to do but when you want your employees to choose the job over their family I don’t like that.
good,Management was unprofessional rude judgemental tried to make u pay them if customers requested refunds from the cashier. Verbally abusive belittling offensive and not productive.
good,"The hardest part of the job was management not hiring people and constantly being understaffed and underpaid, despire mcdonalds across the street hiring in for $1.25 more per hour. Most of the people that were hired did not stay long, and I quickly learned (this being my first job) that it was not one that you should make a career out of). A typical day would consist of me opening up the store, cleaning everything, preparing chili, etc., in order to get ready for the lunchtime rush,"
good,bad place to work for they tell u one pay rate then when u get your check its other pay rate took its asst manager down from salary to hourly pay now asst make 9.10 and hour and and a shift make 8.00 and a employee make 7.25 now u do the math don't sound right that's why I quick
good,It’s a fun place to work and definitely feels like family when you’re there. Just not enough pay as I would like. Good for a first job or just needed some extra money.
good,In a fast food restaurant no matter what goes on your customers are always right ! Never argue just apologize and make things right. Always smile and make sure customers needs are met.
good,I learned a lot about how to talk to people and how to make people happy it also made me get a better attitude and I enjoyed the work style but I'm ready to stay at home with my child
good,Their only good for lunch their team are very dissrepectful and they are not organized they always out of something this company where i worked bathrooms are always dirty and the dinner area is always a mess
good,I had to learn everything on my own by watching people around me and then I relied on because the staff didn’t want to learn because they didn’t want the extra work
good,People say I have good communication skills when stuff go wrong I don’t panic. I focus on my step by step process so everything can get done correctly and fast with no errors.
good,fun job but lots of drama a lot of people didnt show up which made certin days harder then they should have been. poor managment the general manager didnt care to be there an neither did most the other employs
good,"They recognize good people but do not reward them much with what they should be rewarded with. I feel like they should work with college students and their schedules, as they could have many more employees than my establishment did"
good,it was my first job while being in high school working. it was a great way to start the work life. also to learn how to handle money an help customers get what they needed.
good,"The good managers well 1 left & the other became the store GM, so the new one was a witch. sorry not sorry. she was very rude, demeaning & wasn't nice"
good,"I learned that you have to be eager to want to learn any position because if you do not put yourself out there you are not valuable if you only know how to do one thing. If you can do more than one thing, as for me all the positions it is helpful for when the cook might go on break, you can step in. Or if someone calls off, quits, does not show up you can take their place."
good,I didn't like my time at wendy's I was treated very poorly as if my needs weren't important or as if I was second class. Very disrespectful. Someone assaulted me and the Manager told me just do whatever they ask you to do
good,It's working is Gud they r very nic all my employees r nic  no complaint everyone is hard work or over there on a manager is very good everyone  is honest people they help each other every customer always came happy
good,"An Average day at work is chill for the most part its just that I'm not used to working in an environment where the managers don't put a hand in , other than that awesome place to work."
good,"Call and get estimates on how much it would take to do the job. Usually there the next day to remove any unwanted trees, also clean up and debris in the yard."
good,"It was an okay place just wasnt for me anymore . Its too many teenagers working there. So it became frustrating a little bit, but overall you get your money worth."
good,"pretty much stocking, working grill, cleaning, dishes, learning to prepare salads and run drive thru while doing every one else's job."
good,put fries in fryer and chicken patties and chicken nuggets get them out when the timer went off and cleaned up my work space
good,A typical day at work you have no back up and there is no team effort half the time unless the boss is there. I learned that this Wendy's will never give people that what they deserve and it's time to move forward. Management is not well maintain and there are only a few that really care about their workers. We slaved through summer with no air condition and still continue to this day without air. Fridges and cooling elements constantly break and will not get fixed. The hardest part was never having a helping hand when needed. The most enjoyable was when I see my work down and I receive my pay check on Tuesday every two weeks.
good,"Taking customers Money serving them quickly and with respect having great customer service skills, making sure the order is correct"
good,"swiching positions, keeping busy with doing different tasks throughout the day, working with a good team.  The hardest part about the job is helping a new person that just started working and keeping up with your own work at the same time."
good,"I always stayed busy, Great managers, I learned grill skills and drive thru skills, My coworkers were great and they always had great communication towards other coworkers and customers, The best part of working at Wendys was the hours I gained and getting double shifts."
good,mmm de ke era lavalozaa y al meno0s de 3 semanas me pasron de meseraaa
good,First thing that starts off my day at Wendy's is getting rush ready and then getting ready for the lunch rush.
good,"This was my final job before beginning my college career. They worked with my schedule, were kind and welcoming."
good,"As it being my first job hoping it was gonna be great but they wasn't flexible with me. I was working and going to school left work late, employers lack a lot of training to much goofing around. I learn how to deal with the stress and how to manage school and work with the long hours given to me. The hardest part was when someone calls out and there are no replacement and your trying to handle to different position and to know you can manage that i felt i can manage anything. At the end of the day i was happy making the customer happy that made my day."
good,They will work witj your schedule if you are a student. The staff was easy to work woth an management listened if you had any concerns. A nice place to work if you are a student but not a permanent job
good,the management team wasn't great. I believe that if the managers were better then things could go smooth. the times to work here was terrible as well.
good,It is a good place to work for a high school or college job. A typical work day includes restocking and getting ready for the lunch rush and then cleaning your area. You should always help out where needed if you know how to do the task.
good,If u need to switch shifts or youre schedule you can just let manager know. You have to call them and tell them if youre not coming in. You can pick up shifts.
good,"typiccal day at work was busy during rush hours, the mangement was great the manger there was great and also working night shift was so fun and great."
good,It all depends on the work environment because I work at 4 different Wendy's 3 out of 4 was the same franchise but the management was not always one point but for the most part it was good. I learned how to communicate with other and how to understand their point of view with soft spoken words.
good,"my typical day there was mainly on register helping customers, and cleaning something from tables to bathrooms, it was an ok job to start off but nothing to stay at for a long time."
good,I like Wendy’s because of the environment and the nice customers and the cool 😎 crew members . It’s a nice place to start if your looking to climb the latter of succes.
good,"my typical day at wendys consists of greeting and smiles minimum complains but always a satisfied customer."
good,They need to let managers have a regular break instead of a 5 to 10 min break all day long. They need not to make up stores to get rid of their employees.
good,"I worked here for 6 years. I had a lot of fun. Unfortunately, there was no growth, pay sucked and costumers are not always right. I did gain experience, and self control which was the best thing I got out of it"
good,a very fast-paced job consist all a lot of orders daily and dealing directly with a customer. the hardest thing about wendy's was dealing with some very rude customers
good,"The store manager has her inner click and if your not in it than your screwed. If you are a member of management, you don""t receive the mandatory 30 minute break for working over seven hours."
good,Its a good place to work at its jus not palace to stay because they pay s o lite to me it's for sum one who's n school n jus now coming out of school not some one who has to pay bills
good,"My experience here was awesome. I was promoted within the first few months of being there, hours were very flexable. Only thing I didn't care for were some of the customers being rude for no reason"
good,"Wendys was a wonderful learning experince. However, there is hardly ever any room for advancement and it does not provide enough pay for crew to support a family."
good,As a day of working for Wendy's was as if you where playing ping pong  you have to be ready to take whatever was being throw at you and keep all eye's open at all times.
good,I loved the people I worked with but they refused to give me more than 20 hours a week. The restaurant was well kept and cleaned. Not many advances was offered.
good,This one of the job I like too but the staff was sorry had two wonderful manager did there job right with no problem. Would love work with them again
good,"Working at Wendy's has been quite a learning experience. I've met lots of different kinds of people, listened to interesting stories, as well as dealt with the rudest customers of all with the worst attitudes. This job is perfect for a teenager that's still in school or just someone who wants extra money on the side. There is very little room for advancement, this would not be anything I would consider as a career."
good,Through managers to the wolves. Not following protocol properly.
good,The mangers at Wendy's were fair. I enjoyed my job because i am people person and i love working in a fast pace environment.
good,its a good job if you want to learn different things like plumming you get to learn how to clean toliets fryer French fry machine you get to help customers. you get to be employee of the month. work in a team some times but not every body works in a team
good,"serious job, my manager ran a tight ship. but still a good place to start out working"
good,ok place to work very busy you don't get a break very short handed
good,I was able to learn how to teach a person in a short period of time. I was able to get to know the company.
good,*This was my first job
good,Fun job great part-time job really for students. Enjoyed working here. It was very fast paced.
good,I learned a lot about working at a job after I was let go from this job.
good,Love the food not so much the atmosphere. Managers seem to feel too much right to be mean. Treat employees differently. Not very attentive to food readiness
good,It was good for me while I was going to school the people were nice I love that I got to meet new people and help others when I could it was my very first job and I loved it
good,I didnt really like working here. Management was someone younger than I was and did not really take the job serious. I would not be working in that type of environment.
good,I lived working at Wendys but the pay was not all that great. But i enjoyed the people. The customers really loved my customer service and bubbly personality. I was about to start training to become a shift manager before I had to move away...
good,"Just show up to work and do what you have to do for the money you want in your pocket. This is probably one of the easiest jobs. It's more of a beginner's job, but can be stressful due to lack of training but can be fixed."
good,"great place to work just think the pay could be better  for the amount of work you do, my mangers were great which made the job better  but then they start moving the mangers to other stores and it wasnt great anymore."
good,"Very busy food industry job.  Includes washing dishes, taking orders, drive through, very late hours.  Preparing foods and customer service oriented job."
good,"it was a good job , considering it was my first job I have nothing really bad to say about it  managers sometimes were rude and would have favorites ,..."
good,I really enjoy working for Wendy’s on campus . I love bonding with the students and having a a great time working fast paced.Great pay and overall very clean and fun to work at.
good,"I have learned to love the company in a short period of time.They are easy to go people and very clean workplace.The manager she is fun to work with,She is a very organized manager I’ve ever had.She alwanys want to maintain cleanliness inside the store or out side the store"
good,It was a great working experience . I am thankful for the opportunity afforded to me by this position . They help me work on my skills and become a better individual to provide excellent customer service
good,I recommend this job to anyone in school or someone who doesn't have any work experience at all. I ALWAYS said if you can work fast food you can work anywhere.
good,Not a bad place to work just needs benifets pretty god pay but should be more than 8 an hour they give you good hours to work but some times its busy.
good,I did not working for Wendy’s or or it was a horrible experience for quite a long time. Of course I was good at my job so I stayed for the job security.
good,A person can really do a great job for years and the promotion process takes a long time to move forward within the company. The benefits are not really explained to you also when try to get the help its  hard reaching out to the higher levels to understand the policy.  No employee meeting with the crew.
good,It's a lot to deal with. Just always keep your cool and know how to deal with rude customers . But overall it's a nice place to work at. Managers are kinda friendly
good,"I loved this job, but when I got pregnant and started to have issues they wouldn't take me off morning shift. I was sick 24/7 the whole 9 months but smells didn't get to me that bad after lunch time. I was even pulling 10-14 hour days. My doctor pulled me to go on bed rest and my boss (who couldn't have children) informed me I need to work or give up my spot so I quit."
good,"I didn't like my experience , barely wanted to work with my school schedule. Worked crazy hours all the time . Even Holidays & the managers were disrespectful"
good,"Loved this job, learning new things every single day, stimulating and challenging environment, fast paced and very productive. good pay, nice breaks,etc."
good,I've learned a lot at wendys had to deal with a lot of rude people all the time and learned to stay calm the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know your co-workers.
good,Wendy's was my very first fast food job i did not like working there at all very racist and nasty  it was never a day that i was there and like it management was so disrespectful ill never go back
good,Great place to work cool management team  some days real good and easy but other das busy and gotta put n extra work I learned how to properly clean a girl and floors the most difficult part about the job was n winter time working in hole washing dishes and running to go collet
good,"a typical day at work consisted of cleaning, preparing food, greeting customers, taking orders, using the drive thru, and getting rid of food. co-workers are very friendly."
good,I think its a great job. I have learned a lot. I feel like i have achieve my goals on becoming a productive at my job.this job has brought be threw rushes and to become good at managing my time.
good,"A day at work get there at least 20-30 minutes for preparation, double check on my work for the day. Begin with a great attitude."
good,"It was a really good job if you had never had a job before this job help me get my first car."
good,"I loved my job here."
good,"Wendys is a great first job for anyone, because its easy to blend right into routine, and get settled. the only problem with working fast food, is minimal hours."
good,"I kept very busy here, cleaning a lot and helping, there was always something to do. But management was not good, on manager poured oil on my head purposely and had no consequence. Co-workers were older but seemed to like drama. Worst part of the job was the managers, everything else was easy, easy to catch on and just get work done,"
good,"on this day we receive a bus and only a hand few of us were at work, and we had to work as a team and get the order accurate ion enough time for the customers to get in and out. with the help of our manager coaching, assisting, and directing us, we were able to maintain the drive thru time and clear the front within a manageable time."
good,"A typical day at work was sales. I learned how to strengthen my communication skills. I had no issues with management. I had a wonderful time with my co-workers, they were extremely helpful."
good,"Overall the job expects you to put out more than you can give, long work days with only 30 minute breaks. No promotions to crew members, they rather higher someone from outside."
good,learned alot about work in general was first job. manager was a hard person to work for
good,"Crew Member - Cashier , etc."
good,A typical a day is to prepare the products for the day and make sure there is enough to get through the day especially during rush hours.My working at Wendy's has taught me how important it is to please the customers and to listen to their needs so that our company can meet their demands.Mangemnet was a little unorganizied when it came down to the prodction and meeting cuctomers needs but other then that I enjyed working for them.Some of the co-workers they hired were young and really didn't want to work and I would fill some of the open shifts to help out.There was really no hard part of the job as long as you focus on those customers in getting their orders right and helping them get back to work on time makes a big impact on your store and the workers because we put our heads together to do a team job.Making everyone happy by getting them in and out as quick as possible to get them back to work is very enjoyable to me.
good,"It was fun to work at,they are polite, they keep you busy at all times. The co-workers are nice and polite and so are the managers"
good,moving as fast as i can to give customer the best service as possible i've how to act with a proffesional manner while multi tasking
good,come in work shift go home
good,"I really love working here, I’m actually sad I even have to look elsewhere. My hours are just not reliable any longer. I have bills and a child like most people. You can’t just take someone from 58-60 hours for two weeks down to 32 for two weeks."
good,Management and assistant manager were best friends had been written up for giving attitude whe. I never once gave the assistant manager attitude just said what I didnt hear you and it was all during lunch rush. We constantly ran out of things and was never told by any employee
good,The Wendy's staff is very nice! They treat you like family. Every one is kind and you never feel like you are left out or a burden to anyone. They all help you if you need it.
good,You have to see for yourself.The money is good.Its a ok job sometimes.But it has it days just like any other job.But they are very understanding and willing to work with u at times😉💰
good,"I like working at Wendy's. A typical day at work is busy, and stressful, but I handle stress very well and get my work done as quickly and efficiently as possible."
good,"fast paced, team work is necessary. leave personal problems at home and just come to work mind your business and make that money. being on your feet all day sucks,but it can be fun if you walk in with the right spirit."
good,"wendys is like any other fast food place you run your team properly and follow procedures and you also make sure food is getting cooked properly."
good,working their was fun but at times we would get a rush and set us back if you wasn't working with the right set of people. Even if your part time you work more like your full time so I feel as if u should get paid more.
good,I enjoyed it as my first job other than when we had to get new management after that it went down hill in some ways. overall I would recommend someone to work there.
good,Wendys was an ok job. I think it was more streesful for me because i was pregnant and my feelings and emotions where all over the place. The people there were pretty friendly. The manager was very nice to me. This job taught me to be patient and always remain humble.
good,good for a part time job when I was younger. they worked around my school schedule. abilities to advance were presented but I chose a different career path.
good,a very fun working environment with the team. But the hardest part of the job and the most stressful part is when too many people came at once to order. This gives me so much stress and then I need to make everything fast one my own. I don't understand why some managers shout at me when I am trying my best at completing all the orders right with no mistake.
good,"Great place to work but be careful of those who would take advantage of you and always keep busy never stand around. "
good,I don't really have an opinion about Wendy's. I wouldn't work there at Wendy's or any other fast food restaurant. The food is good and the place is clean.
good,Working there was great while I was there. Overall I wouldn't go back but as a young kid I would.  I developed a great work ethic from Wendy's but just didn't see my future there.
good,The manager there was stealing when i worked there so.. He taught us the wrong way. But this jib also taught me to be on time and it taught me how to communicate with people.
good,Wendy's poineers ways was a nice clean learning and working environment the staff was friendly and I also got to learn new things besides from working morning and night shift overall it was was nice . the atmosphere was healthy and the staffs motivated me to be energetic
good,I love working For this company however the franchise I work for is not financially stable and poorly run my upper management. Things don't get fixed.
good,"I liked working at Wendy's, it was alright. Great people, fast paced, and overall not bad. I've recommended a few people to Wendy's, and have gotten one hired."
good,Do as you're told and everybody gets along. Listen to what you're told and the bosses love you. Never be late. Always help the other employees so customer receives hot meal.
good,It wasn't a terrible place to work but it definitely wasn't that pleasant. I enjoyed my coworkers but the management was terrible. I felt like my opinion did not matter and they didn't really care how their employees felt.
good,"Every day was made fun by the friends I'd made,"
good,"This was my first job, and I enjoyed every part of it. I did no like working with the GM, because she was very careless about her employees, but the overall company was amazing."
good,"someone call out,everyday we always run out of something, the managers talk about each other and lie on each other to get each other firied, nobody comes to work on time or dressed properly"
good,my review is that peole should work at wend'ys cuz they get employes get 50% of discounts on everyday meal and i use to love it very much and i think yout guys should love it too
good,I enjoyed working there but the pay for the work that was done was under rated. Working the back register and running back and forth to do dishes in between customers was very difficult to keep up with.
good,Very fast paced job.  Loved interacting with customers.  Co-workers were great.  Management could learn some interpersonal skills.  Could be quite physically demanding at times.
good,"I'm look for a better opportunity with better pay I can almost do everything I have skills customer service , money handling, organization .. I'm respectful and a nice person to get to know"
good,I hated working here they make up as u go different rules for different people some coworkers were nice some stayed to them selves they need to give better raises.
good,This is great for someone just joining the work force. They are respectful of a family and there is room to advance.I loved working here and would go back if there was no other choice.
good,My Typical Day At Work Was Very Pleasant and Productive...My Managers We're Very Pleasant To Work With...I Loved Interacting With The Customers and I Loved The Environment
good,A typical day at work would be me being on front cashier or drive thru taking orders allday. I can honestly say there is nothing wrong with working fast food but after a while you learn everything there is to possibly learn. You get comfortable with your co workers and watch many people come and go working for Wendys. The hardest part of the job would be picking up other slack but the most enjoyable part I'd have to say was meting different people every single day! I stayed focus and did my job well. I also learned that I am looking to advance myself and put myself into positions with the possibility of being in a higher postiton one day.
good,The most enjoyable part of the day is getting to meet our friendly guests that come through the door everyday. A day at work in wendy's is very busy . Lunch is our busiest time of the day. We have to be fast but efficient . The most important part is to be friendly no matter what happens to bring back smiling faces. I learned how to do drive thru at this job and I like it very much. Staff are all great to work with and management does the best they can to keep employers and guests happy.
good,"There really is not much to say about this employer, definitely not worthy of a 5 star rating but that was the only option. For the pay amount other options are usually better with all that is dealt with at this job."
good,I was a cashier a typical day at work was ringing up orders and greeting customers. Also answering the phone and helping out my coworkers when I'm needed.
good,Enjoyed everyday that I worked. Learned things from different views. Management was nice and presentable. My co-workers were on time everyday. There was no hard part. Enjoyed being there trying new things.
good,I went into work at 0530pm  and worked until 0100am. I learned time management. My co-workers were good people that's how I usually made it through the day. The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers.
good,Meet alot of new people and a fast working enviornment. I enjoyed working with all my co workers helping out in areas that's needed.  The hardest part is when we ever been short staff.
good,Only reason i left there was no room to move up in the company.
good,"This job can be fun one day and terrible the next. It taught me that even though it's a fast food job, I still get customer service experience. My co-workers helped me out a lot when I needed it."
good,"Some days at Wendy's are far better than others, but really it's the other employees there that made/make it worth while. While working there I learned a great deal about team work and self expectation."
good,If you are not ready for a challenge then you should not work in  restaurant. Restaurant business is not for everyone. It is very fast paced and chaotic.
good,I was good experience they treated me like family. I was training to be manager. North port fl store was a great place other then one thing but I loved working there
good,"I learned a lot and I developed new skills, however I felt overworked and stressed out from school so I didn’t enjoy my experience as much as i thought."
good,"While working at wendys you pick yp alot of tools you can use in your life on a more personal level suxh as freat customer service and PATIENTS! I believe wendys is great on pay, working for wendys is a privilege , workin for wendys has been a grwat experience and its a great fun work enviornment"
good,Great restaurant to work at. It help u with a great schedule if you have kids and need at set schedule. Safe environment and it’s like a family when u work there.
good,It was okay at first until the new district manager took over and everyone started getting yelled at for no reason. They have made other managers cry before.
good,"So, it was my first job but freaking yeet my guy I loved it. It was fast and stressful but it was fast and stressful for everybody so at least everyone understood. Managers helped us out at downtown Pikeville, I can’t say much for the other locations but that one was great. I don’t know anybody there anymore but when I was there it was awesome. I only left because of the pay, after high school I needed more than minimum wage otherwise I’d definitely go back."
good,You have to move at a quick pace and know what you are doing. You must remain positive even when others aren't and maintain a balance between work and home life.
good,Wendys was a good job to start with I worked there while I was in high school but once I graduated wanted to move up! They had great work hours was very flexible. Treated people very well!
good,This was a more slow paced restaurant but it had busy times too I got along with everyone and they where all very nice however I was sick at the time and began to miss work and I had a change in store managers and the new manager was not as polite to employees.
good,"This Wendy’s were professional. But the people were so ghetto. From workers, boss, to customer. My God. I still would recommend this job, though, because those people have respect. All that matters. And the managers usually work with you."
good,"You have to be a little off to work here. It is very high demand. You're on your feet all day, it can be stressful, and a lot of work. I did, and did not like working here. G"
good,Challenging place to work very fast past high pressure stressful!! Shifts fly by and I got free lunch to my understanding the management has changed since I left so I hope the are more  patient and understanding and encouraging
good,stressful they underpay workers to me and care more for the product more than their employees and as you progress it become easier. As I was having football practice and other family issues they would make me stay overtime forcefully and would threaten to fire me if i left.
good,It was very hard for me at first but then i got the hang of it i got front register qualified by our top manger...i has a lot of compliments from customers also
good,Wendys isn't a bad place to work for but with all the health issues I was and still am having I had no choice but to leave. They workers and management were very friendly and helpful.
good,Wendy's allow you to have a drink in any size. Size? Imagine that? Aha. They also give you a few free cookies in the morning. They have better tools than home. Enjoy if you get hire there!
good,My last manager was a bit of a gossip who wanted to talk about employees behind their back. Past experience with the company was amazing. the other managesr in this area are great to work with.
good,"Need a change in the direction of my career. Fast food is a great transitioning job. Unless you are planing to make a career in the fast food franchise, it isn’t going to be a suitable long term job."
good,Tips to working at wendys be very out going and dont be afraid to be you and ask people questions or interact with adults or kids. When working at wendys i had a very fun time seeing my redulars on a daily and seeing kids so excited and all the smiles and postive energy.
good,"A typical day was a line in drive thru and a a line on front counter. It was usually hectic if short but overall we made it through, the people were pretty nice."
good,Most management there are awesome; some needs to work on their attitudes. Many people are loyal customers that come back again and again because of service that is provided to them at certain times of the day.
good,"Completely fun, your coworkers are your family. Communication was a must and you could talk to your managers about certain aspects or problems you were having."
good,"Working here was a good experience it was a fast multitasking and fun I enjoyed working as a team I got along well with all management and with all the employees,every day we had goal to meet so it was pretty challenging,.and I enjoyed it when we had new things to learn"
good,Food was fresh and had to be handled as such. Good quality food that is sure to leave the consumer satisfied. Good experience to learn what fast paced really is.
good,Para poder trabajar en esta empresa se necesita rapidez.
good,"Most people were wonderful to work with managers were very rude, hang up on staff. Easy to catch on. Job is simple and pays the bills. first 2 shifts are in the office on the computer watching videos . then you circulate around each station until management sees fit"
good,"my job was easy at Wendy's I did management, cook and cashier when needed met new people along the way, train new employees and helped out a lot, employment is wonderful"
good,I was the best at Wendy and never could get more money or more hours  due to discrimination  and I know every position   I'll be the first one on my shift and I'll be the last want to leave my shift is a very good company the only thing no benefits  when you have kids you need a company that has benefits  and vacations should not determine on the color of your skin it could determine the years you worked at the place
good,other then this fast food  work place it has good food but it did not meet my requirments. it is a good place to work when you need some money in your pocket every two weeks
good,Good work environment just not enough pay. I've been there for some time and nothing has actually really changed. The store manager is really friendly & considerate.
good,This was my second job I had. I  got to interact with the guess made them feel like at home. Some customers are awesome and some were very difficult but you will get to see this every where.
good,Typical Day at work for me was I would clock in stock my station with whatever was low. I would jump in a spot if one was open many times it was more then one and then I would get my day started
good,Wendy's is a fun work place but it is a lot of hard work and can be very overwhelming at times. It is hard to get people to stay due to the hard work involved right off the ripp.
good,A normal day of work meets our manager to explain what new promotions we have. Depending on where I am assigned I do my work regularly. At all times work equipment and taking care of each of the safety rules
good,"The coworkers make the store, it's a great environment to work in. I've learned to balance the rushes and to always make sure the costumer is happy. The management Is great."
good,"I feel bad that it had to shut down. If it wasn't for the far commute to the nearest one, I would have stayed. A typical day at work consisted of the shift supervisor directing each employee as to where to go and everyone respecting the leader and doing as they were told. They never got barely any complaints."
good,I enjoyed working here some management was great ! was always busy and fast paced so time would fly by. I would always leave the dine sparkling clean every night before closing up.
good,not enough hours for high school students and hours were sometimes very late which interfered with school activities.
good,"I work 10 hours en 3 days."
good,this store upper management was very stiff and uncaring. fast to dismiss and unwilling to listen to employee problems or suggestions.
good,"i have been working in wendys long time and i worked hard with no recognition in either way for example in two years i got .25 cents an hour raise and no promotion - the people who joined after me they promoted but not me."
good,"From working fries, cashier , cook to doing prep sheets there is always something they have for you to do. the tasks include simple math, dropping baskets in the friers. The co workers wernt very reliable so that came with extra hours."
good,This was my first job. I was responsible for cleaning the lobby and bathrooms as well as taking order and using the cashier register. This job taught me order and structure in the workplace.
good,"Job was good, however the company had no room for advancement no room for Benefits and struggled with financially committing to compliance with Corporate  Standards"
good,"A typical day of busy hours and busy weekends and late nights. First job, High school job. I learned the value of working and keeping a job. How important job placement can be. The management team was nice. My co-workers were a lot of my classmates which made the job fun. The hardest part was the cleaning and the busy hours. The most enjoyable part was being apart of the team."
good,"Recorded customer orders and repeated them back in a clear, understandable manner. Served fresh, hot food with a smile in a timely manner. Communicated clearly and positively with co-workers and management. Resolved guest complaints promptly and professionally. Quickly and efficiently processed payments and made accurate change."
good,I love this place the customers are so funny and the encouraging.They make my job so easy. I love the managers they made me learn a lot.
good,working here was a lot of work. You have to be very fast and remember to always be nice and smile and make sure all your orders are right and you have processed the correct thing. i had to work many of times with just me and a manager and most of the time the manager would be in office because they knew i could work great but i felt this was unfair
good,I started off as a cashier and got up in position really fast it was an overall good work environment to work in the hardest part of the job was leaving
good,"Wendy's was a ok job, i did learn a lot about fast food and how to handle food. and how to deal with upset customer. the manager was fun to work with. and my co work they all was some hard worker"
good,"i love wendy's food and the process that the food is prepared and stored. i enjoyed working at wendy's, my only problem was that mangaement was not on the same page"
good,"Well a typical day at Wendy's is counting my till before getting set up on the register. Making sure everything is in place and organized. I've learned a little bit of Spanish while working there. Management was fairly alright  it wasn't the best, since it was more of a Spanish speaking store. My coworkers were Spanish speakers and very nice. Hardest part about my job was trying to understand the Spanish."
good,"Very fun place to work at, but at minimum wage, it is not enough to support me and my family."
good,"A typical day at work for me is getting the job done, no playing around. I've learned to not to get upset quickly and not to take somethings to seriously. My management is okay they need to work on they attitudes and they way they talk to there staff but other then that they are great. My co-workers are nice and they are fun to be around.The most hard part of the job is when a customer be rude and nasty to you for no reason but I know how to react to things like that.The most enjoyable part of the job is just having a job and making someone else happy."
good,food is really good but the service can be a little slow at times. Don't go here if your not welling to wait.
good,It was always busy because it was at the BWI Airport and I got to meet so many people.  I was experienced at what I did which made it easier for me.  My co-workers were great.  We all worked as a team.  I really enjoyed being there.
good,It was my first job that I earned on my own. I loved working with everyone there. We were a family and worked as a team.
good,Wendy's is an overall good job. They taught me a lot about how to work with the public and deal with people. They taught me how to consider other peoples feelings and how to control my anger. The management part of Wendy's was a little iffy. They played favoritism when it came to the schedule and hours. All of my coworkers were nice people and fun to be around. They made my days good and go by quick.
good,"At Wendy's i learned to keep your head together in busy times. To always maintain what your job is. Our management was decent it could use a little help. Most of the co-workers were pretty lazy to be honest, but myself and a few other really took our job serious. The most difficult part of the job was dealing with the bosses, the just sat there and gossiped like it was a hang out place. The best part was seeing my store #1 for cleanliness."
good,I learned that it is very good customer service job. My management was okay there. The co-workers always did there best. The most enjoyable was being able too work as a team with people.
good,"I worked here to pay for a car in high school. I flipped alot of burgers, made fries, worked the cashier register, and cleaned up alot. I learned how to keep my first job. The hardest part was having to do the same thing ever few minutes over and over. The most enjoyable part was it was easy."
good,"i was there for a short time before i had my daughter, it was a good place to work a couple of hours a week."
good,"Most day i enjoyed myself at work. I actually got along with all of my coworkers. There really wasn""t a hard part execpt on the busy days when they didn't have enough people working."
good,The only thing that I can say that I didnt like ws that they didnt give rasies and also with prior work experience with Wendys iI felt that iI should have started off with more pay.
good,There good people and good team work. They work hard and get there stuff done there. .. people work great as a team them and work very hard. The managers do a wonderful job and trys to help when they get really busy ..
good,"Job was just fine alot of duties for night shift grill but fun and easy, only lasted 3 months since the general manager was really bad at her job it seemed like she had no clue what to do or how to speak to others, she would say I agreed to coming in for days I was off when I was given no notice what so ever no call or message or even talked to most of the time and the other time I said no and she still said I said yes and would get in trouble for her mistakes. I have two kids and needed to be home when I had no one to watch them for me. She also tried to fire my girlfriend for her money count when the manager was the one who counted the drawer wrong."
good,Its your typical fast food restaurant. Cross training is important for every employee to get you at the position you are best at. The company itself works well and takes care of the employee. Your work life will just depend on the store you have applied to and been hired.
good,I highly recommend this restaurant as the leaders were all great the customers came first they were very understanding of the team members they offered incentive for the employees everyday was a challenge and that’s what made it fun to work for
good,It was alright. Never sure when I would get a break even on a 12 hour shift. Pay was alright for an entry level job. Treatment by management could have been better.
good,"Overall it’s a good job. Even though it’s a fast food restaurant, you can learn a lot of life lessons there. You learn how to deal with all kind of customers. Rude, loud, etc."
good,Working for Wendy's was alright. The work was fast paced but fulfilling. thought sometimes it could be a bit demanding. The store manager was a great person. the younger managers were managers.
good,"Opening the store was my favorite job dutie."
good,"Being able to have customer services. Skills "
good,I got hired immediately after going on Snagajob. I have a wonderful manager who just told me to be myself and to keep my area clean and stocked just like I would at home.
good,It’s a great place to work but the pay is 11.75 and no benifets so overalll not a career I would recommend but a place to make money sure. No 401k so I dunno if it’s a good workplace.
good,"very friendly place to work for ."
good,My experience was more buisness level always appropriate respectful at all costs get manager just incase i could not handle situation as needed i was accurate an flexible fast in learning im quick at getting job done. However im open to advice an criticism to progress.
good,They need healthcare for employees! Could also provide mothers with paid time off after having a baby. Some of the management staff isn’t thoughtful when it comes to people having children
good,"I would come to Wendys after going to school. I would work about 4 hours a day weekdays and 6-8 hours on Saturday and Sunday. Management was nice and willing to work along with you. It would get busy, especially when short staffed, but that's typical fast food restaurant work."
good,I worked there for 8 months and the job was fun at first but then the General Manager started caring less and less about the employees and started to care more about being the number one General Manager in her district .
good,I love working here I have made so many friends everyone is amazing. I would recommend this job to anyone but the only problems are that they don't give you many hours and you don't get breaks.
good,its a wonderful place to start off but being there for years i dont think i could manage but their pay rate was fair and i would always consider going back.
good,I was pushed to my abilities of keeping an A Inspection grade store all the time. Food and service are of high quality standards.It was challenging enough for room to grow. Yet fun as well as professional atmosphere.
good,they expect alot out of you. and the will not work with your school hours. but it was a good easy work place. alot of dealing with the public and technology.
good,"Great work place it’s really was hard at first but when u sit back n just watch it starts to get more"
good,My experience with Wendy’s was a magical ride. There would be days where’s its nice and slow and then there are days where your busy for 5 hrs back to back taking and giving order.
good,"Usually lack of crew would ruin the shift. People wouldn't make the schedule correctly so we'd already be Missing someone then crew would call out last minute because lack of discipline. Managers focused on the wrpng things, and wouldn't pay recognition to the ones that helped fix everything. I loved working there and would always want to go back but I wanted you to explore my horizons and study other careers."
good,"I worked usually closing shift of working as a cashier and I learned how to deal with customers on a daily basis.  Management dealt with my working schedule with an alright attitude and the coworkers were alright, but advancement was very hard to achieve."
good,I really enjoyed working for Wendy's. If I could find another job at a Wendy's I would. I really enjoyed the team effort that everyone put forth and the management was awesome at upholding their open door policy to the employees.
good,I enjoyed working with this company and I loved my the hours I was giving . They worked with me on my schedule and hours . I just felt they didn't give you the opportunity to move forward or no better pay.
good,I worked for Wendy’s from the day I tuned 16 until 2 years ago and it was for the most part and enjoyable job. Management and culture of the staff varied greatly by store.
good,"A great job to work when first starting the work world, they worked around my school schedule and the managers were nice but not enough pay.. Its a great job to start out"
good,A typical day at work would be coming in a few minute before my shift so i can clean and stock my station s it will look good for the guest and so I can have everything i need when I need it. The hardest part of the work day would be when I was about to leave and I would have to decide weather or not to stay and help more or go home
good,Dealing with angry/upset customers but trying to give them a good service. The management wasn't bad but wasn't the best either. The hardest part of job is having to rush to do more than one things at once.
good,Worked there for high school at the time managers were great with being helpful and the employees were great at their jobs. Things are different now there’s a whole new crew and whole new management.
good,"Very fast Paced, Very clean and neat. A typical day would consist of chopping fresh vegetables, before opening. after opening it consists of complying with customers needs."
good,"I loved working for Wendy's so much. I was able to go from crew to assistant manger.  I loved being a manger so much.  However Wendy's is a very stressful environment that is not for everyone.  It is only easy if you learn quick, move quick, and work together.  If you can not do that Wendy's is not for you."
good,Great experience but a lousy company to work for.. They do not care about their employees. They work you to death with no consideration of your life and always short staff at night.
good,A Typical Day At Work Is Busy
good,Management cared about there crew members. Everyone works as a team. It was a great first job for me. It’s crazy at times but that’s what fast food is all about. But you get the hang of it. It really is fun I’d recommend for a temperary job
good,I would show up to work and i would work hard and had a good management that supported me and helped me work my way up to a crew trainer and help other people get to where i was and do as good as me.
good,"The hardest part of the job was working with very inexperienced people, favoritism and lack of hours. Someone supporting a family would definitely need to have another job for income."
good,I like working there we work together time fly’s by also I don’t like the new hiring manager he always leaves early n we never have anything for the next shift n he do how to schedule people
good,Fast food is a great place to learn your strength and weakness. I recommend this job for high school students. A quick way to buy things you need. I don't see any advancement.
good,"Wendys was a pretty cool job easy, simple, and straight to the point. When working at Wendy’s you just don’t do one thing all the time,you are either a cashier, on grill flipping burgers, grilling chicken, making a salad, or chicken nuggets and that’s what I like about the job it wasn’t always the same routine everyday , it switched up . Therefore, I’m my personal opinion it was my favorite first job and it was also, on the Las Vegas Strip so you had so many different faces everyday."
good,"A good job for just graduating high school! "
good,"Easy. Learn helping skills"
good,"Great place to work."
good,"It's sometimes fun, but then again it's frustrating  but that's going to be at any workplace. I actually don't  being a cashier there because the customers make my day. Overall, it's a good place to work temporarily."
good,Overall fun but can get stressful and annoying. Don't get your hopes up because it just depends on who your manager is and how well they like you. So have fun
good,"Clock in go right into the drive thru, take orders fill drinks, handle money, prepare food. Maintain an upbeat friendly attitude,  Clean up in between orders."
good,"The company was moving to a new location. I had to assist in packing up the whole warehouse, cleaning the old warehouse. organizing the new warehouse. I learned how to use a forklift."
good,"It was a pretty fair job. I loved tge atmosphere and the customers were a bonus. The management at the time, however made the job less enjoyable. I expressed the fact that i wanted to gradually move up in the company, especially with my impeccable work ethic. But was denied the opportunity to."
good,"The turnover on Management is crazy and the District Manager and Area Manager could not care less about any of their staff, especially the crew members"
good,"Wendys was a good place to work as the environment was friendly and open. Having regular customers, relationships build and they spread word of the friendly service. For beginners to coffee making, Wendys is a good place to get started."
good,"A typical day consisted of grilling burgers, making chili, food prep, making salads, cleaning my workstation. Occasionally making sandwiches. Making sure there was enough meat on the grill."
good,Front Of The House Cashier Was An Fun Thing To Do Because I Was Cool To Interact With The Customers And To Get Know My Work Place. I Was Able To Interact With My Co-Workers As Well.
good,Again worked there a long time ago and this was my first job and very fun. I had awesome managers and best crew. This is a very awesome first job and I do not regret starting out here
good,"A typical day at work consist of flipping beef patties, and wrapping sandwiches. I learned a great deal of responsibilities and how to constructively utilize my time as a student and employee. The management was awesome they made the job a great place to learn customer service skills and make friends alone the way."
good,It's was fun at first and I liked it but then I felt like they was being alittle unfair I started to feel like they made me do a lot of the handy work and I felt like an outcast
good,I learned how to use cash register  and cash handling. and train others . I learned how to prepare variety of salads and use deep fryer. learned customer service skills
good,"Sometimes stressful, very fast paced, no time for error, very customer service oriented, the management was iffy and the crew was either nonexistent or weren't trained properly. Had to often pick up the slack of others but found happiness in the satisfaction of our customers."
good,I loved working at Wendy's very friendly customers and employees to work with. Good hours to work and they very good about family emergencies and being family oriented.
good,Wendy's was an alright place to work. There isn't much job security because it's fast food but they do make a hard worker feel appreciated. You will more than likely be asked to do multiple positions at one time so be prepared to multi-task.
good,"I enjoyed working there for a little while, the team Wendy's all around was ok. management needs to work harder at harassment and costumer service."
good,You can work full or part time. My co-workers are nice. The management needs improvement. I learned a lot about customer service. The hardest part is taking orders when the company is short staffed.
good,"The most enjoyable part is just talking to the customers and bosses (especially receiving guidance and good and bad feedback as well as compliments) from both, which makes me feel good and somewhat welcomed as an employee."
good,The people were nice and respectable. I had no problems with the boss and the work was fast paced which is the way I liked it
good,a typical day at wendys is laughter making money but overall keeping the customers satified in a timely manner. co-workers were cool and management was awesome.
good,"a day at work is coming in counting my safe doing iventory counting for my shift . i do a walk thru to make sure store is clean and ready for me to take over ."
good,Working at Wendy's was very exciting you never knew what was going to happen day to day. I got to interact with many people and had to handle many problems and had to resolve it. The employees were great to work with.
good,You get to meet a lot of new people so it makes your day go by fast when making small talk. You build confidence when keeping the customer satisfied and the work scene is just fun.
good,I learn something new everyday at my job because that's how people advance higher goals. Some of my co-workers work as a team and the ones that don't work as a team I try to help them to learn how to work as a team. The hardest part of the job is when things get stressful everyone don't include themselves as a team. The most thing I like about my job that it is very organized and professional.
good,"Keep in mind that this is a daycare."
good,I loved working for wendys nice cool and fun place. nxzsfdzgfbhnsf
good,Prepared food for customers and cleaning and sanitize areas and many cashier. The Hardest part was caring the boxes in and out the freezers. The most enjoyable part was cleaning the dinning room.
good,"A typical day at work would include prepping salads and lettuce, greeting customers, making sandwiches, dropping fries and chicken, ect."
good,"Managed to work in a fast-paced working environment"
good,a good place to start to work ethic If this is you first job they teach basic for when you y to advance into another field..

good,"On a weekly basis I would train anywhere from 1-5 new employees at a certain station. I would often come in for cover shifts to train different employees from different shifts. I obtained a multitude of many customer service attributes with customers and employees alike. I was quickly pushed into floor management, putting everyone at a station that knew how to work efficiently in that station. Making sure everyone was on task, also keeping my professional opinion to a minimum. Due to the fact that most employees were hired and fired on the basis of that statement. Meeting numerous amounts of new people, also being able to connect with all of the employees."

I respect those I work with, and never turn down an opportunity to improve. The best part of my job is meeting new people and knowing that I had made someone really happy with the quality of our service.

The hardest part of the job to me was the call offs we were very short staffed and so when my o workers called off it made the job much difficult I never complained because I loved my job. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and seeing the smiles on the customers faces when their expectations were met.

The hardest part of the job was cleaning the ice cream machine.  The most enjoyable part was making food and serving the customers."

good,Its a very nice place to work if your a student. They work with your school schedule. The managers where ok to work with. The only problem were the hours for the rate we were getting paid.
good,This job had potential for me to become a manager. This was a great starter job for someone who was trying to get on their feet. The manager team was very helpful with training me to become better.
good,a typical work day was very fast paced and you had to make sure that all orders left happy and with one hundred percent satisfaction and accuracy was key
good,I'm very blessed to be employed here. This is a great organization that aims to exceed their clients/customers expectations but they also look to take care of their employees as well. They are one of the remaining companies to offer incentives to their employees. Longevity is one of the things I admire about them.
good,This was my very first job and that's it. I'm not sure what there is to say but it was a decent paying first job. I was only 17 so I guess it was good enough

good,"Following company guidelines brought each store assigned to, to company's desired standards vis-a-vis sales and employee development. I was the ‘trouble shooter’ manager for the company. I was sent to those stores that were behind company standards so that they could be lifted up. My success prompted Wendy’s International in asking me to join them; but I did not. I wanted to open my own Indian/Pakistani restaurant."
good,"I enjoyed my high school job at Wendy's. I met many new people and managed to get along with everyone! I learned time management and how to deal with stress well! The management was good and everyone got along and worked well together. The hardest part of the job would be how fast you can do it, but it wasn't that complicated. I will definitely miss making a customer smile knowing they enjoyed their meal and the way they were greeted by me as an employee."

good,"Wendy's was my first job. I worked there for 5 years before moving onto a new career. starting as a crew member at 16 working up to management before leaving. the hours were okay, staff was fun, no company perks. but employees and management would hold potlocks, and organize events outside of the company's funding."

good,"This is a fun challenging environment to work in with people from all walks of life, they are friendly for the most part. I learned how vital it is to work as a team in an environment like this or it affects everybody. I learned a lot about time management and learning how to keep a cool head and a positive attitude when things get hectic. Management doesn't usually feel like management because we're usually having fun while working together to reach common goals in the workplace, even though the job itself can be quite challenging and stressful. My co workers are also a lot of fun, everyone usually gets along, we enjoy working together. The hardest part of the job is multitasking (cleaning/stocking up) during busy rushes. This is otherwise a really fun job, it's a great experience with really nice people to work with."

If I lived out there I would go back with no problem.

good,It's a very friendly place but slow with service and orders most of the time and manager is very nice and it's a good place to work. I would recommend people to them.
good,"One typical day at Wendy's is when the drive thru gets jammed pack during the holidays. What I learn was no matter  the job you have to treat as your profession. The managers were great to get the crew members up to speed at every position. My Coworkers were fun to work with on all shifts of the day I work. The hard part of the job was clean up time, if you were a night time worker you had to clean the day's messings. And my most enjoyable  time of the job was serving the customers with pride and respect"

good,"I worked just a short time at Wendy's. A very busy restaurant, but a not so busy Manager. As her assistant, she was not very good a communication. The manager runs the entire restaurant, and an Assistant can not ""Assist"" if the manager does not communicate the daily happenings...."
good,It is easy to get along with every one within and out of the work environment. The management of the store was well handled and in any and all situations someone was there to give a helping hand.
good,enjoyed my time at Wendy's the general manager was more than helpful to guide me the direction that I needed to take to move to next position up.Work side by side.
good,"I tend to be a  quick learner, so it does not matter if I choose a different field of work because whatever I do learn, it is applied to my daily duties. My typical day is ongoing, smart work is always completed to the best of my ability and knowledge, etc."
good,"Learning experience that helped shaped my career path, the customer interaction was positive. Overall my experience in the fast food industry was enlightening."
good,"Wendy's is a fast pace, but well-organized establishment, well respected with good management. normally when you come in you always clock in first and you always look at the position board to see what position you're working for your shift and before you start your shift you always wash your hands one of the hardest things to do is deal with your lunch rush and dinner rush those are the times where you get the most customers and the job becomes most difficult"
good,"At Wendys , it was great working there even though i had stuggles working there but it payed off whenever i seen that whatever i did actually helped the company out . I was a cashier , i closed the dinning room and i helped out on the drive thru. My co workers were the best they were so nice and they were so amazing like i loved working there.Hardest part was dealing with the attitudes and most enjoyable part was having to work with amazing people ."
good,I learned a lot here I wish I didn't have to leave them you know you find those jobs and the longer you work there the employees become like your family. It was very easy and outgoing personalities here everyday which made the job more willing to come to.
good,little ceasers was a very fast paste job to have the co-workers were very lazy and always called off at the last minute but overall its a good first job to have.
good,When I started everyone in the store were very helpful on working with me to learn everything I needed too. The employees and managers assisted me in learning everything I wanted to about the four positions I would come in and work.
good,"I like to go above and beyound the call of duty. Like helping out customers, making sure there day is okay, making sure all my orders are accurate, cleaning up the dining room and the bathrooms. And wiping down all tables."
good,everyone is happy and says hello. people take there jobs seriously expecially with food and cleanliness. job is fast paced and menus change up quit often but they come together to help everyone out.
good,"New management has really turned company around and improved for better. Fast paced, productive and easy employees. I enjoy working for this company and can see myself work for a while, given that i go up in management."
good,Everyone was friendly and management was awesome. They were definitely on top of it while I worked there. Very clean environment and great staff members.                                                         .
good,love the frosties and all the food. It was a great place to work. I really consider this a great place to first work because i learned many valuable things from the year that I worked here. It was my first job ever
good,"Thanks to this company I gruw as a Manager. Now I have strong skills on multitasking and how important the timefor the customer, I have urgency to serve my costumers at the same time I serve quality."
good,Love to work where the employees love to do their job with no problem.  Atmosphere is always positive to make the days more enjoyable.
good,Helped make food and and worked cash register and coordinated all day and opened and closed store and counted inventory and organized product.
good,it was a good opportunity for me in the position I was in it made me be a team leader something I am great at and achieve so much respect from my piers
good,"Prep, supervise positions, make certain that we are well stocked for orders. End of day inventory and balance out the cash drawers.I learned how to be a great Manager. Co-workers try hard to be good team players and work together. The hardest part is to keep everyone focused on the task at hand. The most enjoyable... at the end of day, you look back on the day and everyone worked together and accomplished what was needed and they enjoyed doing so."
good,"this job will be your life.  barely no days off, bad management, good employees, fun/positive environment and fast-paced.  stay to yourself and keep it work related at all times."
good,"Working for Wendys was very pleasant for me. Each person is entitled to their job, which includes a cleaning task as well. I didn't really learn much from working there. Of course I had to be trained to do the work, and to prepare the food, but other than their training there wasn't much to learn. The management is very helpful, as well as the co-workers. Everyone works as a team to ensure that each customer is served in a timely fashion. I believe the hardest part is keeping up with dishes, and other cleaning tasks while being busy. the mot enjoyable part of working there is the people, and the many personalities you come across."
good,its a fast pace job .. never know how busy it will be. the hardest part of the job is not know what type of customers yu  may get
good,"Great first job experience, and believe that everyone should work in customer service at least once. Gained the ability to talk to customers in a calm manner and help with anything that they needed. Most of the time it was a great crew to work with!"
good,"good place to work for first job. flexible hours, good pay, good benefits, can move up the work ladder, and multiple locations"
good,i learned a lot of stuffs over there managers are cool except for one of them co-workers are nice and friendly the hardest part of the job is the cleaning session but i still get it done
good,I enjoyed this working place very much. The higher management was very helpful in coaching and training. Its a very clean and friendly place.
good,"-Operating drive thru/front registers."
good,"The Wendy's expereince was fun, enjoyable, always buzzing, and over the top. I loved the customers and the workers. I looked out for the days most enjoyable because they were also the hardest days. No one could focus but we got the jobs done while having fun and chiding each other all day."
good,The coworkers were awesome that i worked with. Management was not at all understanding of any family emergencies or if you were sick.
good,I enjoyed this job very much. I worked here for 5 years and loved the people I was around. I became a manager but never got a raise. I was getting paid 8.40/hr. doing a job I believe I deserved more pay for. recommend this job for students...for sure!
good,Loved working at Wendy's first high school job other that a bookkeeping job.  It was fast paced and learned how to deal with different types of personalities.
good,"It was a hard working, fast paced job that didn't pay very well. But it was okay for a first job. I wouldn't stay there long term though."
good,"its mostly costumer satisfaction and teamwork and maintaining a clean restaurant. "
good,Very busy on most days but with the right management its a breeze. Its could be fun at times and stressful and HOT but overall its a good place for beginners such as high school students.
good,"I would come in and grab a headset and start taking orders if there was any, if not then I would stock for next shift. I learned to have a lot of patience. My co workers were friendly. The hardest part about my job was when I ate the food there because I was afraid to gain so much weight. The most enjoyable part was when the customers told me I give good customer service."
good,"Durant cet emploi, j'ai touché à tout les positions du restaurant,"
good,A typical day at work was always busy. The staff and managers there are truly fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was getting the food out in a timely manner without messing anything up. The most enjoyable part was getting to meet new people daily.

good,I would love to work here because it is a very professional restaurant and the employees are very kind and would be great to work with.
good,"On a typical day of work, I would go in and find out what I was doing for the day. We would have a team huddle to make sure everyone was on the same page. This routine improved my communication skills profoundly. the hardest part of the job was to remain calm during the rush periods. the most enjoyable part was working with others."
good,"Working at Wendys was the best job I've had yet. I enjoyed everything about working there. My co-workers were amazing, although some were immature I personally never had an issues with them. I learned my first everything there."
good,"I was working for three hours there and it was always busy during lunch time, I was still in school when I first worked at Wendy's as my first job, and it was stressful for me because there was always something that needed to be done and take care of the customers. I had only worked two months and I had gotten sick."
good,"You will get to experience an extreme fast-paced volume, as you can get hit with rushes, like any other place. You get to work with different people of all ages, so this is great experience to have and a step towards management. Easy to ascend in this type of company so long as you work hard."

good,"A typical day at work is coming in a few minutes before your actual clock in time. I go to the back where we put all of our bags and personal belongings, and set my stuff down. I set myself up with my full uniform which include, belt, hat, apron, name tag, tucked in shirt. After that, depending on which station i will be assigned to that day i grab a headset. Then once i am all set up i go back to the front and clock in, it should be just the right time i'm suppose to be clocking in. After clock in i must be at my station the whole time, taking care of and looking over what needs to be done. This could include restocking, cleaning up, re-organizing, etc. I learned that you have to use common sense most of the time of what is necessary at that specific moment or what can wait. Also i learned that managing a good communication with your team during rush hour or just in general work time is very much helpful and enables you to work faster. My co-workers are very friendly and helpful, when we need something we call for help and always someone who is available or can handle the task will take it on. At Wendy's in Santee we actually have some of the fastest sandwich makers, friers, and grillers as well. The hardest part of my job is being able to remind myself not to take on all tasks myself at once but organizing well what is priority."
good,I loved the people who worked there and the managers and all the customers. the food was great too. we have frequent customers who come in and I know them and they know me

good,"Take food out freeze , prep food , come in 2 hours to prep, prepare food to order as the order comes in on the screen. Dealing with the off peak times and on peak times, when busy and when it is slow. The most enjoyable part of my job my boss keeps me busy. The hardest part of my job is cleaning the grill. I have learned what temp that food should be how long food should be out before have to throw it away. Wendys is a fun place to work. The management was very helpful when I need help.

good,Dairy Queen is very fast paced in the summer time. It is an easy and fun job long as its done right. I learned how to handle dairy products and interact with customers while doing so. The management varies depending on the owner. The co-worker end up becoming life long friends as long as you learn to separate work from play. The hardest part of the job was getting customers out satisfied and fast. The most enjoyable part was interacting with customers face to face.
good,"go into work, check daily sales from the day so far or the sales for that particular day, check the schedule to see how many people were working on my shift, and which positions I wanted them in, responsible for balancing the safe and all tils, jump into positions that need the most help at one given time, while making sure that front line and drivethru were moving smoothly and in the right amount of time, giving my staff jobs to do like stocking and prep, dishes during slow periods to get ready for the next meal time rush, during a closing shift, there was cleaning of the store, cash reports, waste reports for the day and locking the store and setting alarm before leaving. I think the most enjoyable part were the incentives for doing a good job like t-shirts and cupons to movies and things like that, the hardest part is when I had customer complaints, or my bosses yelling at me for slow times, I think 3 or 4 minutes in drivethru is still fast.  but overall it was a good experience, my boss did teach me one thing I will never forget, he always used to say, "" never assume""."

good,I loved the general manager and district manager. I was able to move up in the job and they made me feel like part of a team.
good,"Every day was different and exciting! I kept a 90 day schedule and although every week I had alot of the same tasks to complete each day was still unique and that was what I liked most about the job. I met a lot of people and was able to help many achieve higher levels in the company through developing, coaching and mentoring them. I held weekly meetings with my general managers and monthly meeting with the assistant and shift managers. I would visit at least 2 of my stores each day and was able to interact with the guest which was always a delight!"
good,"I washed dishes,preped food and the stations I worked on,daily changes in jobs meant me working in multiple positions,i.e cashier,food prep,grill,or fries. We were always very busy so cleaning was constant."
good,I worked there for a very long time and learned many good job skills fom this comany.

good,A fast paced environment that allows me to grow and develop with the company.
good,"Cash Management, Crew and Labor Management, Prep/Re-prep, Customer Service, Waste Management, Oversee Daily Shift, Ensure Food Safety and Proper Training. Hardest part of the job is keeping a tight shift running throughout the day when dealing with call off's or being understaffed. The most enjoyable part is creating that ""family"" bond with crew and getting them more involved and excited about their job's"
good,"A typical day at work is busy never resting and always on your feet which is a good thing.What I learned from working at Wendy's is that you can't always please everybody and that patience is the key to everything.Mangement is not detestable but medicore.My co-workers are like family I can depend on them at work and outside of work,they make the workplace very pleasant and fun.The hardest part of my job to be honest is when things are lagging and slow I love being on my feet and hate slowing down.The most enjoyable part of my job is the customers they are usaully regulars and fun to interact with they also make the work place very pleasant.While many people may see Wendy's as deplorable I see it as a peculiar way to interact with people."
good,"At Wendy's my responsibilities were to make, prep, and serve food, run the cash register, stock, clean & count money."
good,It's a fun place to work at. The management looks at you like family. Very easy to be promoted.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's is serving the customers with care. The crew members and managers are like family, they applaud you for a job well done and also extend their helping hands to get the job done."
good,"I was very close to my managers, they taught me very well there was just no room to grow"
good,Fast pace. How to work with different people. The most enjoyable part would be the cutomers.
good,"Arrive at work, go around and make sure store is clean. Make sure everything behind counter and in front is stocked. Wait on customers."
good,"As a Shift Manager at Wendy's I checked restaurant on daily basis to ensure cleanliness,high quality food. Trained employess and ensured proper coverage. Handled over $3,000 daily."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced greasy and hot I learned to multi-task I took orders prepared food and recieved payments from customers maintained lobby and restroom as well.Management was professional, serious and upbeat my co-workers where focused and flexible which made the work load easy .The hardest part about the job is when we had the lunch time rush i enjoyed working with my co- workers they made sure that we all got our work duties done as a team ."
good,As General Manager I was expected to
good,Awesome place to work great boss good upper management great experience
good,I Worked Hard Did Anything My Manager Told Me To Do Im A Fast Learner And Good Worker I Started As A Cashier Then Did Everything But The Sandwiches I Worked There For A Year I Loved Being At Work Kept Me Moving Was Always Happy I Had Good Customers And Mean Onces But Always Stayed Posative I Had A Great Manager Named Mike He Hired Me And Respected Me Never Was Mean To Me He Tolded Me Everything About My Job And What To Do How To Work With People But I Had To Move Beacause I Was Leaving The Place I Lived At So I Wouldnt Be Able To Go To Work If I Didnt Live In The Area I Didnt Have A Car
good,If u like food u will like this job great food and great environment
good,First time working a cash register I did know how but I got better within a month and I started taking people orders.
good,fast paced environment fun and relaxed worked different areas
good,The managers are wonderful to work for and with. Everyone is really easy to work with and get along with.
good,i had worked at wendy's international at a variety of stores for over twenty year and still would given the chance.
good,I enjoy working there the pay isnt great but if you enjoy working with kids and people it is the place to be.
good,"Easy to learn, usually a great environment, but at a different Wendy’s I fell at work they didn’t give me workmen’s comp. very flexible scheduling and they have instant financial as their pay card"
good,Wendys is a good place for work for people looking for their first job. It is a safe environment with plenty of people to teach you want you need to know
good,"It was a great company, Great coworkers and management. Very clean company,  Very respectful to customers. Hard working you have to be willing to work to survive it."
good,I enjoyed working with  the company and employees an meeting the customers. It was a friendly place to be  an clean .I would let people who was interested in  this job to but there application in.
good,Wendys taught me a lot about customer service and to make sure the customer is always happy . I enjoyed it but looking forward to better opportunity now
good,Being at Wendy’s showed me a lot about working with others and communicating better with people. It also advanced my working skills towards other jobs and would recommend Wendy’s to someone.
good,Good starter job management need a lot of work face pace be prepared to work hard abit stressful good for high schoolers management abit chaotic customers are abit weird I
good,Great job been there for ten years just have kids and a wife I have to look out for now needing something  that pay more and that have benefits. I recommend  this job to anyone
good,"It is a great work experience,have learned many things about managing people inventory hiring training and promoting within.Met with each associate to establish realistic sales growth."
good,This store is a really great first job I got my first job here and they have friend people and if you have a weird schedule with another job or school they will work with you if you need it.
good,It was a good job but in order to get a good paycheck you’d need extra overtime. Too many kids working also. There should be more employees 18+ Who can work with open availability so it’ll be less call outs from the younger employees who has school.
good,"Busy day but i learned to be positive at any moment . great staff and mangers . the hardest part was to mange 3 different positions at one time "
good,Wendy’s is a good job but I want to learn and grown and make more money i want to sit with people and make a change for myself I just graduated high school so Wendy’s is not for me no more
good,"Great workers with a high motive to get the job done.  great management, and high quality food.  Job task are easy to fufill with the amount of time provided."
good,"Always have a good attitude, don't be rude, greet customers in a nice and welcoming way. All co-workers will have it rough sometimes due to breakfast, lunch, and dinner rushes, but if you stay positive toward them they'll loosen up."
good,I like it there but they could up are pay just a little I don’t have any problems at any job as long as they pay me good.which Wendy’s does pay me good it gets my bills paid but I do want a job that could let me pay my bills and have extra to do things with my family
good,"Fast work , overwhelming  at times, stress full.. sometimes friendly management,  some times poor management .. great experience.. well trained.. long hour shifts"
good,"Wendys was great, Co workers were fun and friendly.  You had to work fast to give out peoples orders and assist them with great service. Customers were always friendly too unless they've had a bad day."
good,"The people are kind. "
good,The Wendys I worked at was a good store overall yeah it had something’s that could be fixed but all in all it was a good store had all good managers except 2 of them
good,"Fun to meet new people every day and talk with them. cleaning the store according to their requirements, and  serve fresh food to customers. It is very fast and challenging job."
good,I worked through out high school. it was hard because my hours was all over the place but they were able to work around my hours and proved me the resources for help.
good,I still work there I’m just looking for other jobs but Wendys is super stressful and fast so I can handle a lot and I’m a quick learner is took me less then a week to get everything down pat at Wendy’s
good,"i honestly took wendys as a second job, i didnt think i'd like  it at the time but when i started to get to know every one it made the job fun and was nice to work on a team."
good,Overall Wendy's is a great place to work! They have some flaws as most jobs do but the work environment is good! The pay should increase because cashiers deal with alot throughout the day. We don't get paid for overtime that we worked which I think is very unfair! And the dustributaion of hours isn't equal.
good,As soon as Wendy's would open here would always be people coming in to get food. There was never a time when you would get bored because there was always something to do like cleaning the dining room or prepping food for the next shift or the following day.
good,"Working at Wendy's was very fun, informational, and productive for a fresh high school graduate. It taught me a lot about what a healthy work environment looks like. Everyone understood the job that needed to be done and worked as a team to accomplish it."
good,I didnt have a problem working at wendys..it was the poor management...my manager way disrespectful and made my work environment stressful. Other than that i was fine.
good,It was easy but it took to much of my personal life away like I was working alot didn’t really have time to enjoy my life because I was always working and they wasn’t really paying enough but it’s different just really depends on you this was my first job so
good,"It's a great place to work for just wish they would Give me a raise I have busted my butt and don't feel like I'm appreciated, I even come in on my days off when they need help..."
good,working for wendy's is fun and it helps u get better with customers and meeting new people. i don't really have a hard part of the job because i do everything good.i learned that the customers are always right. the most enjoyable part of my job is when we get busy because i have stuff to do. i love my job
good,A fun and team-worthy place. Everyone got along very well. I never wanted to leave. Managers and crew members are very welcoming to everyone who comes in no matter if your a customer or staff.
good,I like working at Wendys everyone like in family we mike in good teen we work together we like the costumers we make they costumes feel like to come back again
good,"A typical day at wendys was tiring but it wasn't bad at all , They taught me alot about the grill and had me washing dishes , sweeping etc. The management was great they had everything under control and the schedules were perfect . The hardest part about the job was trying to please every co-worker and/or manager . The most enjoyable part had to be when u actually pleased everyone and everyone is satisfied on how the day went."
good,I would recommend this job to those who are looking for a starter job only because it's good as a first job and it shows you exactly how you get ahead when working and shows you a fast paced environment.
good,I enjoyed my stay at Wendy's. It is a great way to start understanding what society expects from a employee. It is both easy to learn and challenging.
good,"While I was working at Wendy's, rush hours were the toughest part of the day.It's usually hot and crowded. People are aggravated but the best way you can handle it is byy just being polite. That can be the best part of your day by being yourself and being happy."
good,"Great place to build your self-esteem.  As a crew member, you are required to stay on your toes all day since the fast food industry is mostly fast-paced."
good,Working at Wendy’s is hard when it’s busy and the store manager doesn’t schedule enough people and your suppose to have a good attitude with customers
good,Working for wendy's was a great experience typically fun an fast paced. I learned how to make food and the do's and don'ts of fast food service with cross contamination.
good,"would either open or close store, my staff and I worked well together, I wouldn't ask them to do something that I would have done. I learned that with teamwork our goals were accomplished and I and my team would be proud every day on how we were able to make sometimes a hectic day just better by laughing and continuing to work as a unit"
good,Wendy’s is a good job for a first job but after a while it gets tiring . They expect way too much for minimum wage. Managers often leave employees in charge of a whole team by themselves.
good,"Up-sold additional menu items, beverages and desserts to increase restaurant profits. Took necessary steps to meet customer needs and effectively resolve food or service issues. Correctly received orders, processed payments and responded appropriately to guest concerns. Served fresh, hot food with a smile in a timely manner. Communicated clearly and positively with co-workers and management. Resolved guest complaints promptly and professionally."
good,"I worked the night shift , Work was steady and easy every day the only thing that P. me off was that everyone else except me would go smoke marijuana in the back by the dumpster and leave me in the store alone and I would have to complete everyone else duties plus mine . Overall Wendy's was a pretty good job."
good,The company's general manager is one of the sweetest people you'll ever meet. He cares very much for his workers. The shift managers are all very nice people and care a lot about the public. If anything as far as orders or unpleasant visits occur everyone teams up to make sure it doesn't happen again.
good,I like working whit my co worker there fun i have a great time and do a good job everybody help ad all are friendly the discount is pretty decent and the manager are super fun to work whit.
good,"Though the compensation and benefits are lacking, as is true with most food service jobs, they encourage a positive environment and are very inclusive on changes in protocol and updates to the menu. One thing I did find beneficial was they had you try new products so you could inform customers of the item. "
good,"this was my first job, and was a very good experience for me. i met and worked with so many awesome people and never had any hard feelings towards anybody"
good,"Prepped salads ,cooked food, make sandwiches, packed bags,take orders, complete customers orders, greet customers,clean lobby area, change signs in drive thru,.....all was not done in one day of work but over the time I worked there I picked up everything tbere was to do besides manager duties...."
good,When good smile positive attitude and work hard no matter what try to keep your focus and get along with the managers be respectful to all customers and employees
good,"I did a lot of cleaning around our stations, worked the fryer station, sand which making, helped in the front, cashier, lobby cleaning, a restocking our supplies. I did that everyday."
good,This was my first job. it was very flexible with my college schedule. I felt like we were a family and we all worked together greatly. I would recomend this to anyone starting out.
good,"Great starter job. Works with the schedule you need. Family friendly environment. Would suggest people to work here for first time job. Teaches you how to work with food and food safety, also teaches you how to work with public and customer service."
good,"typical fast food work environment "
good,"Fast paced,quick to learn. Working as team members. Good employees. Great leadership. Great job working with the public. Loved the job Preparing daily"
good,"I loved working here, met great customers, had great co-workers and just overall I had a great experience. Loved my manager, my hours and never had a problem with my schedule."
good,Working at Wendy's has been such a great experience for me. I enjoy working there because I get to meet new people from the community. I also like working with my coworkers. They make me look foward to coming into work everyday.
good,"It was a quick paced environment and you had to be able to pick up and learn things faster, as the menu changes.  Everybody was friendly and did anything to help you out if you needed it.  I learned how to efficiently multitask and work under pressure, as well as work really well as a team."
good,"At Wendy i learned how to be responsible while working in a fast paste environment, while meeting all of the expectations  needed for a successful day. I was a cook so i had to be well trained on food and safety. The hardest part at work would be the environment due to all of the customers coming in all at once making a big order list. Besides that working for Wendy was very enjoyable and all of the co workers were well trained and very  helpful."
good,With a great team the work at Wendy's is a piece of cake. It takes a great deal of unselfishness to enjoy working there. The 401 K is the best I ever seen from fast food if used in a strategic way Wendys could be very rewarding.
good,"Everything was good "
good,The overall work environment is fair so long as everyone does their part there is never any issues. The management could be improved upon slightly but otherwise everyone is laid back.
good,"very hard"
good,fast pace job if you like stuff like that. opportunity to learn how to do  everything not just certain people alot of hours which is good .and work as a team to get it all done
good,The hours were flexible the managers was willing to work with you the pay was ok it is a clean place to work at but you must be willing to do you part of the job the hardest part of the day there is none the most enjoyable part of the job was the satifaction of helping people with their orders
good,I worked at alot of the akwen area wendys. It was really well managed and for fast food a great place to work. Every place i worked at were understanding with schedualing and always helpful and conciderate.
good,I was still attending school when i worked at Wendy's but. I liked it there it was fast paced i could do every position in the store but i never moved up in my career
good,"I love the music, the crew team, the real food products that Wendy's provides. I love how when there is a problem we nail it on the wall and cut right to the chase."
good,I love Wendys and what they stand for.. I'm an adopted child so I love that Wendys is pro adoption. There are so many children out there in need and I'm glad that Wendys helps with that.
good,"I worked the cashier everyday . I also cleaned the bathrooms with my co-workers . On Fridays and Saturdays i worked on the cooking station . I did bacon , sandwiches and chicken nuggets ."
good,Good place for me to work but mamagers had some fallls but everyone not perfect but overall its a good place to work managers did have favorite employees was employed for awhile i wuldnt mind returning to work their overall its a great place to work .
good,"I enjoyed working at Wendy's. It was my first fast food job. I learned how to perfect the ""fast and friendly"" tactic and enjoyed satisfying my customers when it came to the quality and freshness of their food and I maintained a clean, neat, positive eating environment."
good,J'avais 15 et cette emploie m'a apprit  a mieux fonctionner dans ma vie personnelle et professionnelle
good,Great for young teens and elderly people who are in college or retired. Not much opportunities to advance. Overall I appreciate the experience i gained.
good,Wendy's has a great management system. The whole work environment and culture is great for someone looking for their first job. I would recommend Wendy's to any teen look for a job in fast food.
good,It was an okay place to work. you have to be good at multitasking and fast pace. it was my very first job and i enjoyed it. i left due to personal family problems and they gladly accepted me to back.
good,It's a good place to work except they only give you one day off a week.  It would be better if they had longer shifts and less days a week to work.  Thank you.
good,"Pretty Good Environment , Regular Customers , Clean & Friendly . Respectful Manager . Employees Work As A Team . Customers Always Leave Happy , WORK AS ONE ❗"
good,"I liked working at Wendy's, I got along with everyone, we had fun on the whole while still maintaining a business atmosphere. Never had any problems with anyone"
good,I had no problems working here and if the pay was not so low and there were benefits it would be an even better job. The manager is a good manager and not afraid to work right along her crew.
good,"A typical work day usually consist of clocking in, doing the job, and going home at the end of the day. However, I feel that Wendy's haven't given me the free time I needed, not the convenience of working all the weekend and never having one off. I do have some time off, but i have to schedule it to even have time off. Also, the management can be WAY better."
good,Wasok place to work. depending on shift people sucked. managers thought they could do what they want. the employees related to manager thought he could do what he wanted.
good,Management is always improving on what they learn even though it is fast food industry. They cater to their employees. When it come to school and other things that you want to do...the value of work
good,"As my first job, it was very comfortable. All of the coworkers were extremely nice and willing to work with me during my training. I learned fairly quickly and within the first month I was already training new employees. Working there for over a year, I was crossed trained which was helpful for both me and the company because my schedule was more flexible for both parties."
good,It was a great place to work. It always kept you busy but sometimes the management was hard to handle. Although if you are looking for a job that will keep you busy this is the one.
good,My pay checks wasn't adding up to my rate an they wasn't giving me enough hours they always was short on staff An the customer was always nasty An very mean
good,I love my job. I work full-time. I have a really good crew and an excellent work environment! I work in a fast paced environment so being aware of my surroundings is key!
good,"i learned working as a team can fun and also easy to get the job done...the work culture was fun,the hardest part bout the job was keeping up with the rush.the most enjoyable part of the job was everybody was like family and we could talk about anything..."
good,"I loved working here at Wendy's for the amount of time I was there. The crew was very outgoing and fun. Customers were awesome, I even had customers who remembered me by name."
good,A typical day consisted of team work. If we did not flow well as a team then the whole system collapsed. I learned how to depend on others and how to delegate instead of taking everything upon myself. As a manager i had to realize that my crew was the back bone of the operation and if I showed them how hard i worked they would work twice as hard for me and my whole day would run smoothly. The culture of the workplace cannot be described in any other way except a family. The hardest part of the job was when one of your family members was mad at another. This disrupted our flow and did not return to normal until everyone was on good terms again. Being able to witness the strength of everyone working together.
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers and I loved seeing my regulars that came in. I loved seeing all my friends at work and I loved getting to know the old people who would come in every day.
good,"Great place to work! Enjoyed working with these individuals and the company. The team was great, and the atmosphere was very relaxing. I would recommend this place to anyone."
good,I love working at Wendy's. The staff are nice and you make friends with almost everybody that works there pretty much immediately. Having friends in the workplace makes the job not as hard.
good,"Wendy's has taught me responsibility. Our management is great, and our crew members work as a team. The hardest part is dealing with unruly customers."
good,"muy buena empresa para comenzar con tu primer empleo, es un ambiente bien agradable y tiene una comida muy buena y bien elaborada con una calidad excelente y seguridad en todo alimento."
good,"I like working there it's fun and easy to learn, food is very good and the people be really happy the mangers help out a lot if u need the help everybody be on there P's and Qs."
good,"It's okay,  it's not the absolute best. I enjoy working with the people I work with. Some of the people are hateful,  but that's anywhere that you go."
good,"A typical day at work involves staying at your assigned station and either taking customer orders, filling customer orders, making sandwiches, or cashing customers out through the pickup window. There is a lot of multitasking and you may switch stations one or several times during a shift."
good,"It was pretty nice, general manager was amazing and so were my managers . co workers was more less ..some were great and others, not so great? had to do a little extra because of those people. either wasnt done right or not at all and id always go to fix it. Other then those people , there were very helpful and i had a fast sandwich maker so that was a plus. Hardest part of working at wendys for me would be when the registers crashed or when i had to do drive thru . People would ruin the time on the timer . most enjoyable , being a cashier."
good,A typical day was alright. I learned how to run a register. Management was alright wasn't great. I didn't enjoy working with some of the coworkers. The hardest part was working with those coworkers that were rude. The enjoyable part was learning new stuff and making good friends.
good,the work place has lots flys in the resturant and the system keeps going down to take orders and the bun wamer keeps breaking down
good,A typical day at Wendy's is very fast paced and you keep moving throughout your shift.  Most of the management team is good and fun to be around.  I learned that there are some wonderful people in the world.  I have great experiences with a lot of our customers that either come into the restaurant or through the drive-thru.  The hardest part of the job is when you have to run short handed or someone decides to take their bad day out on you. I really enjoy interacting with the customers and most of the other workers.
good,"The teamwork of this company was amazing.  I had nothing but good times and good memories. The management was very confident in there work, always helping the crew no matter how short staffed we were."
good,"Since it was a volunteer job, I can't say if it is beneficial or not, but all I can say that it was fun, and if the pay is good, I could work ( please do ignore the rating, since it is from volunteer view, not working wise)"
good,"Fast paced work environment"
good,"I really enjoy working @ Wendy's Restaurant because they try to please the public. A typical day at work is general busy but fun because everyone pitches in to help each other, and work to produc excellent quality service. I have learned that  We all need each other in a job etc. to help attain our goals in life. the Management are very friendly with co-workers. They treat you like your best friend. They work hard and assist you in every detail. they are worthy of respect.! the hardest part of the job is fast pace orders, when there is long lines . the most enjoyable part of this job is the communication of workers with respect. Also enjoy greeting and seeing people smiling and enjoying good time @ Wendy's.!"
good,working at wendys was a ok place the customer was some time always rude but over all ok the haerdest was the rush my manager help walked me throw thinhs much love
good,"I enjoyed my work area with this company. Everyone was very friendly and helped one another."
good,"I worked at least 60 plus hours a week sometimes more, I did inventory, cash pulls, helped unload the truck, ran the night shifts a few times, I worked a lot. Doubles a lot, I came in whenever they called me, or came in on my days off. We had a lot of fun  on the night shift, hardest part of the job was when we would get so busy, and i would be taking orders, getting drinks, bagging all the food, taking money, and helping on making the food, putting fries down, helping on grill, I did a lot at Wendy's."
good,We would start to make chili and get all the food ready for orders. We would make sure our stations would stay clean after every order. Made sure that we have enough food for the shift.
good,"I worked at Wendy's for 4 and a half years.  A typical day at work was a lot of food preparation and stocking.  I was constantly cleaning and keeping up with the food temperatures.  I was always busy doing something.  I learned work ethic and how important it is to have.  My general manager at the time was a great general manager.  She would always say, ""If you have time to lean, you have time to clean.""  I learned that hard work pays off.  I loved all of my co-workers and many of the younger co-workers looked up to me.  I was able to train a few of them as well.  The hardest part of this job was keeping all of the customers satisfied and given quality food.  The most enjoyable part of the job was to hear from customers or my boss that I did a  great job."
good,"Lunch rush is the absolute worse time to work in a restaurant of any kind, especially next door to a high school. However, the managers and crew members always help each other out, they keep work fun, and they are all supportive of each other."
good,"I was part of the night crew, and worked under less supervision. my role required my qualities as a conscientious person. I have become adept to many kinds of new duties working at night. My coworker are good people with good team work."
good,I good first job but I would never work in fast food again. I learned to deal with money and how to Multitask. I had opening and closing duties that I had to maintain. Overall a great first job.
good,"This job is pretty fun because of the worker and managers the managers are kind of young especially night manager one of night manager is just turn in 21 so if you want to be a manager in the future you have a chance in couple years but we have too much workers now because the hiring manager is too nice so sheb wants to give a positions for every body if apply it so if you apply for it i can bet you can get that position but can't get a enough pay for paying every bill like rent, phone utulity's bill"
good,A typical day at work can be a little stressful. I learned that not everyone cares to put forth their best effort. The management was okay. I loved most of my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is keeping the drive-through time down. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with co-workers.
good,great opportunities to learn responsibility meet new people make friends and to grow within the company such as becoming a manager.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced like any fast food restaurant. You walk in, look at your position and go from there. Ive learned how to have good customer service skills from this job. There is lack of communication among management, but for the most part management is good. The co-workers there vary depending on their personality. Some are easy to get along with and others are not. The hardest part of the job is accepting that ""the customer is always right"" even if they're not. The most enjoyable part of the job is having fun with the co-workers and being a team player,"
good,"liked working for this location, i learned a lot from this company, even though there was some favoritism, but all around it was a great environment to work at. I loved my co-workers they always made the day more easy and fun to be at work."
good,"Typical work day, I would take customers order for food, prepared food, and collected money for products, as well as counting money back to customers. Worked well with co-workers. Most enjoyable part of job was the customers."
good,Normal wendy's restaurant people were nice friendly and never had any problems with any of my co-workers
good,most of the things that i know regarding working i learned from working here. it was an excellent first job
good,I've recently went to a Wendy's on buckeye in Cleveland Ohio. A nice young lady by the name of Ray'Jean Hillar was very nice she was very fast with service and she really made my day and I was satisfied and I surely will return back just to have her service.
good,"This is one of the most rewarding work experiences I have had. Working at Wendys was great, the management team was good at what they did. The were very goal oriented and weren't afraid to push their employees to be better. I learned that being humble and listening to the management and doing your part could get you far in this work place. I was able to keep this job for about a year and a half which is good for fast food. Through it I learned to work hard and fast. I stopped working here to pursue a job and the YMCA"

good,"A typical day at Wendy's is fun and exciting because we enjoy working together as a team to get our daily tasks done. Our main goal is to ensure quality service to our customers while being friendly."

good,"es una buena empresa con oportunidad de cresimento, en el cual siento que me he desarrollado y he aprendido bastante."
good,went to work different schedual each day .i learned how to operate a grill and make chilli .the management was good and the coworkers were also good. the hardest part of the job was learning the sandwiches. i enjoyed using the grill.
good,The job is not too bad.I can say its almost one of my favorite jobs ive had so far.
good,"i was to greet customers,and keep the place clean, i learned how to submit orders into the system,and gas checks"
good,I enjoyed this job. I however wouldn't want to make it a career.

Handled credit transactions right and quickly, Ability to recognize fake currency and other fake transaction greatly.  Must have ability of dealing with all kind of customer.Communicated positively with the management and coworkers."
good,"Arriving at least five minutes early and setting up your station. Learning company procedures and menu/pricing. Company procedures were always followed with certain responsibilities and instructions overseen by manager of that shift. Three to four crew members on line to ensure orders were complete each at different instructions. One of the most difficult responsibilities would of been extra cleaning before inspections. Having to move the fryers, scrape them and clean filters. Taking up a lot of time especially during a rush period. Most enjoyable is working with other crew members helping and assisting to finish end of the night check off lists. Also meeting and assisting customers was usually always a pleasant experience, especially when getting to know customers that come in on a regular basis."
good,"Grill Cook, Morning prep. Detailed cleaning of store.Prepared fast food orders."
good,working for wendys was my first job it tought me everything i neede to know in the food service industry as far as customer service... like how to treat people in good or bad situations and to be patient.. its a great job to have whilt in highschool
good,"This was my first real job ad my favorite place to work, when I started at Wendy's,I was only 13 so I wasn't able to work in the kitchen yet, I cleaned the dinning room and stocked aswell as did storage. Management was amazing, they all treated us great, kept s on track and made sure everything got finished."
good,"I enjoy my job very much, always something to do."
good,i love how quickly i advanced workig there. the only downfall was i felt as if i was always at work. the management training i received was excellent and i will forever be grateful. i left because i got married and my husband lives in a different state.
good,"long hours of cleaning and scrubbing, pleasing and greeting customers and building personal relationships with them and attending to their requests. I learned how to clean properly and efficiently and to take constructive criticism, the management is good everyone works as a team and is well organized. my co workers are friendly most of the time and cooperate with each other. the hardest part about my job is to maintain a smile 24/7 and to take insults from people and not being to defend my opinion because it is a customer and their always right. the enjoyable part about my job is that i get to meet new people every day and see my regular customers come in that come for good food and a good conversation."
good,"I worked part-time at wendys, I worked very hard. I learned how to work the cash register, drive-thru, cook on the grill. The managers were not that understanding, couldn't speak good English. The co-workers were good to work with, friendly. The best part was tending to the customers."
good,"My typical day at work is clocking in, counting a register, getting in position, taking orders, meeting new customers. enjoying conversations with co workers and regulars (customers who always come back). Theres nothing hard about this job. Just come in with a postive mind and have fun."
good,"On my typical day at Wendy's I would prep all vegetables sure our products have dates an time      "

good,"The management there is great. It is one of the cleaning fast foods I have been in awhile. You have to overcome obstacle's every day. you learn something new because something changes everyday. The job is not hard at all, you just have to be a fast learner and a self-starter. The part I like the most was doing my own thing. I knew what to do and when I can do it, but always have to let a manager know what and where you are doing."
good,"cashier & drive thru operator, enjoyed working with coworkers and assisting customers"
good,typical days includes heavy lunch rush and order taking
good,"A typical day at work would be full of making salads, working register, and cleaning the dining room."
good,"Working at Wendy's was a easy job to have. working with the manager and co-workers was like working with family, everytime one of us had a problem or issue we take time and try to bring that person back on his/her feet. the hardest part of the job was manageing time between school and work."
good,"A typical day at work would mean cleaning off counters, also being a cashier and cook."
good,"I worked at Wendys from December, 2011 to April, 2012. My duties included bagging food, running the register, making the chili and the bacon, washing the dishes, and sweeping. When I first started my manager taught me that during my time there, I was going to get nervice, mess up, and get yelled at. She told me that, at time I would want to quite or cry, and at times from the way others were treating me, I would feel as if no one likes me. She said all that doesn't matter. At the end of the day, as long I stuck through with it and did my job, I would still be liked, and I would still have a job. People get frustrated, but it doesnt mean they don't like you. I appreciate my managers there. Sometimes they were annoying because they were so uptight, but its understandable because if we mess up on a customers order, the manager is the one who had to deal with our mistakes. When I first started working there my co-workers didn't like me and thought I wouldn't be able to handle the job. Eventually I became liked and I liked them. I became work buddies with one of the employees there and she wanted to recommend me for a raise, but I hadn't been working there long enough. I was told I was very helpful and every chance my co-workers had they would help me out as well. The hardest part of the job is working with picky customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that I was capable of doing the job needed of me and coming to work knowing that I have friends in my work place."
good,Was given the opportunity to learn all positions in the store as well as to work in the management field.
good,"A typical day at work is I clock in at 5pm as soon as I clock in Im positioned on register. I make sure all the customers have been helped, clean up a little, stock, help the drive through. 7pm my 30 min break. 7:30pm clean up a little, help customers. 8:30 start taking down some machines clean them and let them dry. 9:20 start cleaning restrooms. 10pm lock doors scrub the floors and vacuum. 10:45 check everything, take out trash and getting ready to go home."
good,- Prep Salads and Clean the lobby
good,Is a fast pace work environment. Need a positive attitude that carries out through out the day.
good,really great place for students and getting use to dealing with customers
good,It where to be.i learn everything at the job. The manager helps me to succeed.Hes easy going and laid-back. He really helps me to better myself.and he allows me to be able to have balance in my life with work school and at home time.
good,"At this Wendy’s location they lacked communication skills, this led to a problematic work environment. Wendy’s was problematic, drama oriented, and altogether very unprofessional."
good,Good job nice people to work with. But sometimes there is no team work. Their is not enough pay for the amount of work the job is expected of their worker's
good,Wendy’s was a good place to work the people there were very friendly and made work a better place. I always felt safe going into work and was always ready to work with my coworkers
good,Builds a good work ethic among members of the job. Every worker works at their very best. The customers are treated with utmost respect. The workers also make sure every thing is in place and maintain a clean environment
good,They worked at one of the stores in Tucson until the gas station attached close down and then this is dropped like the restaurant closed itself. Just leave the company for a better opportunity.
good,It was a good place to work. The ppl were amazing there they made shire you were taken care of. They tryed giving me the most hours they could. It was a hard job but I got the hang of it easly.
good,I'm not an employee  been trying to go back submitted 3 applications went to the Wendy's had interview but  needed the I-9 the manager didn't know how to pull it up I worked 2 nights off clock was not in the system or on schedule I'm ready for work without the I-9 I can't
good,Need more hours to survive. Currently at a shelter right now. Can't afford to be out on my own. Please give me more hours. I only got 4 this week :( thank you :)
good,The job overall was overall a good experience. I only changed jobs after working here because of poor management and drama within the workplace. The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers.
good,I loved it i just eventually got into a situation where I didn't have a way to and from work plus I was in the process of moving so I had to give my notice
good,Brand new store when I started.  eally taught me about customer service and the importance. Work hard and you can surely advance without a problem. Lol
good,This was my first job and it taught me a lot I learned how to make all the food that I love to eat it will teach you a lot about helping older people who love to eat there and it teaches you a lot of patients
good,Great company to work for. The managers are all very friendly. They will work around any schedules you have. The day shift crew are very hard workers while the night crew are a bunch of school kids that need better supervision and training.
good,it's a nice place to work very clean other employees are helpful and friendly food is always made fresh can't say anything bad about wendys they pay u reasonably per hour always learn something knew customer friendly make sure food is always right before given to customer
good,Must be adaptable and willing to work under pressure.  If you want to be in a friendly environment then you have to be a part of the process and lead by example.  Don't expect to walk in a have it laid out for you.
good,i enjoyed it. you able to meet different ethic backgrounded people. Learn how to work in a fast pace environment. learn how to cook and understand the saftey of serving food as of to also eating healty.
good,"I loved working at Wendy’s, some of the managers weren’t great and a lot of people were childish. But aside from them, it was overall great to experience it all."
good,"flexible work schedule "
good,"I love it the whole team member"
good,Wendys can be great job asking as you ha s the right people who are willing to learn and ready to work. I have been with the company 25 years and I enjoyed it.
good,"for the most part the closing crew was the fun part of my shift because i had good relationships with my closing crew. we got along. but don't get me wrong  there were time i did not enjoy my job like when i went to different stores, worked 60 hours in a week, or 16 hours days."
good,Great way to gain experience. I started working here at the age of 17 and have learned a lot at this job it’s a good way to advance in the company. If you are looking to start somewhere where it’s teamwork and a ten experience this is a good job to start at.
good,"I personally enjoyed working at Wendy's. They are avery clean and well organied company. It's only really stressful during the rush hours when we got a ton of people at once but all in all it does helps build people skills since you are working with the public a good percentage of the time depending on what position you did, I didn't really work in the kitchen too much other than fries which is really easy and drive through at first I was just doing drinks and frosty's which is also really easy. The worst part is honestly having to watch the ""training videos"" because they are really boring and the hardest part for me was trying to work the drive through window taking orders and cleaning the dishes at the same time. But my coworkers helped me out as much as possible. All around it was  a pretty good experience! I highly suggest it."
good,Wonderful place great people my coworkers are like family including my managing staff I’ve been here a long time pay is low but the customers make the journey there worth it
good,I have Worked at Wendy's for 2 years and i enjoy the work space and employees i just Need a better paying job and i would Like to move on with a different job and show my skills more with a different job that i know I can do great at!
good,I like my job and especially all the people that work there. I get along with everyone and everyone helps everyone... This place is like the cleanest one that i have been to in Portsmouth.
good,"they have great salads, great burgers, great nuggets, great fries, great sauces. s'awesome sauce is my favorite. best root beer floats ever like let me tell you about that."
good,Just wish the pay was more. I work extra hard at my job .When others are lacking in there area I step up to help out.  I love my managers and co workers. We are all like 1 big happy family
good,"A typical day at work would start as a cashier or sandwich maker, and then begin to make food; grill chicken, make french fries/nuggets, prepare meat. Other things are to clean the restaurant or change the trash."
good,"Usually it's really busy, especially in the afternoons, between 1pm--5pm. It's a good environment to work in and the people are great. I would recommend working here"
good,I met a lot of great people through this entry level job. The work environment was nothing to complain about and job can be stressful at busy times. Overall great experience though!
good,"I loved it was there 5years, yes had bad days as well but went great at some point in the day. Would go back if I had too. The people you would work with become family."
good,i have a lot to say good and bad but they balanced my home life and that was the best i could ask for. i don;t like how they handle hr issues though but that is something employees will find out.
good,"I started at 14 and work my way up two management. I've learned a lot from this company loved every day in customer service, and who I worked with. I definitely would recommend this company."
good,"I worked at Wendy's for almost over a year and every day, whenever I went in, I felt like apart of a family. I even met my fiance there! We will have been together for five years in October. Thank you Wendy's:)"
good,"The job for me at first was very great, I always got the hours I asked for but was slightly taken advantage of when it came to having shifts covered bc I was the only one that was called and it was very hard for me to request an extra day off."
good,Wendy's was a great job to work. I had excellent co-workers and great managers. Customers were also great as well. Managers understood everything that you  tell them.
good,"A typical day was getting in to work and jumping in.  I'd do all positions in one night.  From the drive through to cleaning the bathrooms.  It taught me how to be a team player and not allow one person to do all of the work.  I also got to see how management could make a break a young person just starting out in the workforce.  In my opinion more could've been done to ensure everybody who wanted hours got them.  Especially, if they were hard working and willing to do the job.  The hardest part to the job was not having a car of my own and getting to work and then they tell me I can leave right after my ride left, because they have too many people on the schedule.  The best part was getting my first real check!!"
good,Very nice employees great service could be quicker give more benefits and pay more. Cleaning there is great very clean. Management is well I would recommend it for a job.
good,"My own Wendys experience has been fine, aside from new hires getting hired to turn around and say they dont get paid enough to do the job they were hired for. They apply to complain theyre being asked a lot when its fast food, so that should be expected. Its not at all hard work so Wendys itself shouldnt be a problem for anyone unless they have some sort of health issues or injury. My manager specifically has been and is very understanding and willing to talk whenever you need to. I would just suggest we hire better workers. Thats really it, Wendys is perfectly fine as the job it is."
good,I loved the people I got to surround myself with. They never failed to brighten my day. The hardest part of the job was the lifting. There are some very heavy items there that require moving.
good,Its a great place to work if you work hard and put effort into it if your having a problem they will do there best to help you its worth working there
good,Great place to work but they only offer part-time employment. I need full-time hours at minimum wage to survive.it would also be a plus if the company offered any benefits such as health care.
good,"I worked there while in school. They worked around my school schedule. "
good,its was the typical fast food chain. managers were normally pretty good. great first job willing to work with my school schedule. extensive training program
good,Great for teens  & a place to start for beginners especially if your 15 wanting to start working fast food definitely is a place to look st when applying .
good,"Wendy’s is a very good job for starters but I wouldn’t recommend it for your whole life"
good,"Good place to work at, however the upper management hasn't been able to staff all of its stores.  Which created a lot of stress for the employees.  Made the employee turn over rate shoot through the roof!"
good,"Good environment, very busy but we get the job done. We have a lot of people’ come in I work at cashier sometimes or drive thru but most of the time I work at the burger station."
good,"Working at Wendy's for 5 years was a really great experience,I had learned a lot and have become very proficient working in fast paced environments. I gained a lot of friends and knowledge from the company."
good,It’s a nice place to go if you don’t like to just stand around because you have to keep yourself busy by doing everything that needs to be done on your shift!
good,I like it but its time for somethinh better. I have 3 kids to raise. Im tired of workinh paycheck to paycheck. I wanna do better for my kids and my family
good,"157- I loved working there. We all worked as a team. The management was amazing! The GM there best General Manager I've worked for. The only down side to the place was I worked there for 3 years and never got a pay raise. I did not mind it until I got out of school."
good,"This job is a good job, if you never had worked anywhere a day in your life. I say this because, this is a restaurant job. Very fast paced, and you be on your feet all day."
good,"enjoyed the morning shift/ doing the lot which was typical for my morning shift. I got half off of food and also enjoyed extra money to spend on son/Walmart Gift card for being the ""best store""."
good,gave me my break into the working life. The staff was welcoming and I found my current girlfriend there. When life got hard management understood and gave me time off to get my life together.
good,"Once I got there I would prepare the bacon for the cooks throughout first shift. I definitely learned how to multi task, and how to meal prep for our busiest times of the day. The region manager was great, there was one shift manager that I personally feel was not fit for her role, but overall management was great! The culture of the workplace was iffy, but I think that is with any place you work, I was not there to make friends, but to simply be part of a team working towards the same goal. The hardest part of the job was when shift change, I feel the managers should have managed that better, but as soon as the shift would change we would get super busy and we would only have one person in each station. The most enjoyable part of my days were working together through our rush hours and getting it done."
good,I love the wendys team and making customers happy. The daily task is to meet every customers need and satisfy them so that they will always have a reason to come back.
good,"It was a very fast paced job that requires consistency. All the management, and coworkers, all worked as a team to achieve brand standards. Team work is of the ut most importance."
good,I was in high school when I worked for Wendy's. I thought it was a good job. I really enjoyed it. If I ever decided to get another job in fast food it would definitely be going back to Wendy's.
good,It’s a good job for kids in high school it keeps money and your pocket. I would recommend this job to somebody but their pay is not good . Good place to eat at too
good,"I worked for Wendy's for about 4 years now but I would like to try new things and see what else I would be capable of doing. I don't see me doing Wendy's as my ""career"". Being at Wendy's have its bad and good days. But is a good job to gain experience."
good,"Coworkers all very friendly with a good work ethic. When things start getting hectic, everyone pulls their weight to ensure production runs smoothly. Managers have great respect for their employees that set a good example of Wendys standards."
good,Wendys is an amazing company with great food. I throughly enjoyed my work experiance.  Its fast paced with good people that make the time there really pleasant.
good,It’s a great place to work at if it was one of your first jobs but I wouldn’t recommend it to people seeking for a job that will be enough to pay for bills and rent.
good,"Pay is sub par but room for advancement is high and they do promote from within, if you show that you care they will promote you. The scheduling is a little selfish but if youre looking for hours they got them!"
good,Wendy's is a good job too have the pay is what I disliked the most. I put in a lot of hours and my pay checks would come out to nothing basically.  I'm glad I'm moving on to better pay and less fasted paced.
good,Entry level job or good for anyone needing part time flexible hours low pay no benifits unless managemnet good for a first job or side job did not offer full time unless management
good,"It was fast paced so you had to learn to multi task and never get behind. I primarily worked during the time of dinner rush between about 5-7pm, so I was stressed quite often. Between the rush I would do dishes or clean the dining room depending on if I was closing or not. I did enjoy the up to $6 per shift of food. I got a hamburger and fries pretty much everyday."
good,"1.The hard part is keeping up with the orders."
good,"My day started at 6 a.m. preparing the days fresh veggies and chilli. I prepped more as needed throughout the day to make sure we maintained fresh product. I learned how to work with great people, and some not so appealing characters. Management ran the restaurant like a family, it made it a fun and efficient place to work because we actually WANTED to go to work everyday. The hardest part of our job at Wendy's was Spring Break in Panama City Beach!! Lots of hungry college vacationers wanting food well into the early morning, after bar close at 3 a.m. The most enjoyable part? Everything."
good,"A typical day for me at work was a fun and fast pace environment. I learn time management, and team leader skills. The most enjoyable part of my job was to make sure every customer receives quality service."
good,Very helpful crew but wasn’t the job for me it was very fun learning different way of a fast foods service and with a lot of smiling customer and more like in and out service for yourself wen your on the clock seems like time just fly
good,"Management is great, co-workers were great, not sure about the benefits they offer but it's overall a great place to work for young adults who have no work experience."
good,I wouldn't recommend this job to anybody that hates being bossed around or told what to do because boy did these workers have attitudes they wanted the newbies (me ) to do everything mean while they were supposed to be training me i had no clue on what to do
good,"Very busy, great start for a young person starting career. Management is very helpful and nice. Plenty of overtime available. The hours are flexible and they're willing to work with you."
good,You were directed by a manager to what your position would be that day you'd often switch throughout the day. It's a very fast paste job with made it difficult part of the day when you were understaffed. I enjoyed most the people who I worked with.
good,"Let's start off my weekends at Wendy's!!! I would clock in at 10:00 a.m every weekend or any day I had off from school, Wendy's would still be closed so I would restock on cups, lids, paper bags for the food, ice for the drinks, and certain ingredients for the food or the drinks I was required to make. Opening time was at 10:30 so everything had to be ready for the customers who would dine-in and the customers who would order at the drive through. It would be busy all day and I would get a 30 minute break when my manager told me to. I learned how to make burgers, fries, and certain drinks at Wendy's. I also learned that team work is important in any food establishment because it makes work more smoother and more quicker for customers to receive their food. Management wasn't the brightest part of work, two of the four managers at Wendy's were spectacular, the other two were the ones who weren't as great as the other two. The hardest part of the job was learning to make food and how to work the cashier in three days. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with amazing co-workers who made work fun."
good,"My review of Wendy's restaurant is basically straight forward. There management are great, work ethic is great, and flex ability can be better but over all it is great."
good,Je fesais du 40h semaine fixe et je n'avais pas de changement dans mes heure les patron étais compréhensif surtout la journée qu'on a su qu'on perdais tout nos emplois
good,"Wendy's was great with training and was like a family. Management was great and was always willing to help when you need, and be patient. A typical was just average with customers and orders."
good,"Wendys is a wonderful place to be, good people, good food. Would recommend it to anyone. The convience ia that they are nearly everywhere and it is a good place to start."
good,"when i worked there we were short staffed but we all got along, and made it fun. when we worked together we always got the job accomplished and our numbers were met."
good,I loved working for wendys. But after stepping down from management I struggled to keep my love for it. The customers are what kept me there as long as I was. Good service is hard to find and I provided that.
good,"The job in and of itself is a stressful one, but the upper management gave back to the employees. Great benefits ok pay. Very competitive as far as advancement is concerned. High standards which is great and compensation for reaching those goals"
good,"People made the day go fast. Very enjoyable to work with but low pay, not much benefits either but for a starting job go for it! It can be very fun if you do your job right"
good,"I really enjoyed working there, great people and had fun everyday."
good,Over all work experience with Wendy is really good...But the salary benefits was not appreciative. Work culture was quite happy and go along. Future development courses were not tat beneficial.
good,"The job is fast paced, in the span of time I was there i learned all of the positions to be a cashier and a closer and at times had to cove for others if someone was missing. The job itself is rewarding just for some it is a little much but its a great job"
good,"It was a fun experience I had great coworkers for most of the time I was there. My first manager was very professional and enthusiastic. Soon everyone left and got a whole new team. I just didnt enjoy the experience anymore. Burger place? No.. I came home smelling like fries and it just wasnt clean. Many people were recognized for their hard work, many managers and supervisors, and opportunity to move up in company. Flexible schedule."
good,"Nice place to start but don't expect a career out of it. Nice people, great learning  experience but hours are limited. Pay is minimum wage so don't expect to be making a whole lot per week."
good,"As a first time worker, I think Wendy's is a great place to work at. You're always up and doing something, talking to customers improves communication skills, you're never not doing something. Manager always taught how to deal with problems around the kitchen and how to deal with unsatisfied customers."
good,"Wendy's provides new experiences and is great for a first time job. The management is respectful, understanding, and helpful. The employees are welcoming and extremely friendly, and at times can make if feel like home."
good,"Doing prep in the morning , followed by attending to customers, put up the truck management counts down drawers ..employees collect money followed by making sandwhichs."
good,Its a fun but stressful job at times. Dealing with customers and their bad attitude about their food will drive you crazy but you have to keep a calm level mind to work at a fast food restaurant
good,Work service was great I love working with Wendy's because it was so fast paced and providing customer service is what I love .only thing I never really like was how the hours were so small
good,Great place to work !!i enjoy working with customers making sure they are stasfied. Wendy's also is a wonderful company to work at with great benefits.
good,A typical day of work consist of coming to work and start prepping food getting everything ready for the other workers who come in later in the day. I learned how to stock food and how to deal with the new shipments.
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy’s until they started giving everyone else and the new people a higher pay than I was receiving. And I was promised a raise. Than when they heard I was leaving they tried to match what was going to be making else where. Also I would work 9.5-10 hours without more than a 2 mintue fresh air break
good,"I loved working at Wendy's. My coworkers made everything bearable. Most of the customers were great too, I like to memorise the regulars we have. Its been hectic but I loved it."
good,Fast pace work and get people to work with. If your behind they will help you catch up and train you till you can do your job.  Flexible hours and great place for a 1st rime job
good,Wendys Hamburgers had a very serious crew and fast pace i must say that my respect for fast food preparation at Wendys with their proper procedure methods very strict  training. i actually enjoyed working with them but most of all i enjoyed their food ...
good,they are currently closed and are not going to re open the doors for  business at this time. It was a very enjoyable place for me to work at such a young age.
good,"The restaurant was clean, the food was good, management was very kind and caring about employees.  We had fun competing to see which shift could get the quickest drive-thru times while getting orders correct for the customer.  The employees were wonderful to work with.  The owner was a good Christian man who promoted good values.  He even believed that if he kept Christian music playing that it might influence somebody to move toward a more positively spiritual way of living."
good,I work hair in tel 3 year i like wendys but i wand change my compony this compony is very good every month sailary gove us 26 27 28 before start of tha month
good,"Initally, a good day at work means the customers are happy. The entire environment  must be kept up and clean.. Not to mention, I learn how to work and speak up when called upon. Hardest part of work is trying so hard to earn mre hours. The easiest part is really cleaning up and providing the customers with everything they ask for."
good,It was a new fun and fast experience. Ienjoy working for any company that has an amazing staff and team members. The job was competitive and a rush sometimes but with everyone sticking together as a whole kept the company on track and better than ever.
good,job was fun wish could have spent more time the people let me grow for the short time i was the disliked that they brought me on just to let me go due to budget cuts
good,"It was a very stressful job, but if you like a very fast paced day, youll love it, i had a very fun year i worked there, was never a dull moment. was never a slow moment"
good,A typical day at Wendy's was sometimes people not coming to work. What i learned in my time at Wendy is learning how to work in a team and putting the costumer before myself. Management was okay sometimes the managers were'n't really fair.The workplace culture was awesome. There really wasn't anything hard at the job it all depended on your speed.Most enjoyable part would be interacting with the costumer.
good,Good team work dependable hours good management clean at times food always hot n ready team always nice to the guest always have over time and you will enjoy working for them
good,wendy's was a fast pace work place where you learn self control and basic customer service great for a first job. the management really cares a will work with anything.
good,We are a productive and fun crew to work with. We ensure that our customers are satisfied and happy. As a crew we make sure that all tasks are completed and ready for the next rush.
good,"Although it is the fast paced environment, the workers and management work very well with the employees to provide a fun and safe workplace. The hours are flexible and the pay is fair."
good,Great work place but poor pay and no raises from working here over a year I still get paid minimum wage.. managers are great people love working with them all!! Face paced fast food restaurant.
good,If you're looking for a temporary job or supplemental income this is the job for you. Although they don't provide benefits they give you plenty opportunities to advance in the company.
good,"Working as a team , maintaining a great and relaxing environment for the customers. I enjoy when the team make the goals of the day or week. It feels good."
good,I love working at wendys but pay was to low for me then they switch management everyone hours got cut and i have bills so i had to move on to some better for the moment
good,Working at wendy's was productive. It just took a lot of time to adjust to and get used too. You have to be willing to work at a fast pace when it starts to become busy.
good,"I worked there for almost 4yrs and never had the opportunity to advance. While working for Wendys I enjoyed the management team I worked with at the two separate stores in Tucson, AZ."
good,"Coming in out of high school was a struggle in itself. I was shy and awkward and Having to go to work instead of being a teen-ager was not always peachy. "
good,a typical day at work is when a day runs by smooth I learned good customer service the management was kind of poor it was a good work place because of the people the hardest part of the job was rush hour and the most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.
good,"Its a fast paced environment but it is also a good place to start and get experience. Most customers are friendly ,it does provide you with the hours needed and the days ."
good,Was a great place to work but the hours were too much and u didn't get anytime off when it was needed and they didn't give raises at all. But overall the employees were great
good,"My name is ohiji pompey"
good,Very first job i ever had so it was enjoyable.It is very good order and very well organized. Management varies depending on who is hired. It is a great starter job.
good,"This was  a great place to work while I found a job when I got out of college. Managers were great, co-workers were great, nice environment, you do have to be able to handle difficult customers."
good,"I had quite a bit of fun at wendys as my first job in highschool, i didnt stay long after i graduated due to needing more income to live a better life."
good,"Falta mas atractivo sueldo , buenos horarrios para trabajar y estudiae"
good,I loved my job but I didn't feel comfortable with some of the things. I gave 100% everyday I was on the clock.I was getting mistreated trash talked and a lot more I stayed up because I need my money and hours.
good,It was a good job and easy I'm just lookin for something where I can make more money. The management wasn't all that good but we dealt with it being respectful hard workers. I just want another opportunity to show my skills and show you guys my hard work.
good,"A typical day at work was pretty easy, they didn't ask for too much from you. The management and staff were nice and easy to work with. We received decent breaks throughout the day."
good,Everything was easy. Crew members got along perfectly. Management was great most days. Customer's smiling more than half of the time. Evaluations were conducted accordingly and raises were given fairly. The products were fresh daily. Management were more than willing to teach staff with the willingness to learn.
good,"Very fun place to work. Easy to catch on, and learn. I learned how to do most everything in the kitchen. Management is very understanding and helpful. Workplace is clean and organized. The hardest part of the job is during rush times it gets very busy. The most enjoyable part of the job is the friends you make there."
good,I believe this company was a good place to work. The only issues I had were that the employees were more on the younger side and too much drama was brought to the workplace. I am a single mom and loved that i could work around my schedule.
good,"I loved working at Wendys it was one of the better jobs I had the pleasure of working at. it was definitely fast paced. all about customer service. worked and gotten to know a lot of people, the hardest thing about this job I would say cooking the meat on time. I am a peoples person so I absolutely loved working with people and also seeing the customers smile;."
good,Overall good company. I worked with them at several restaurants. Started out on drive through and learned all the stations. I wanted to move up within the company but there just wasnt a position I suppose.
good,It's a very easy job! Though it is quick-paced if you know what you're doing it's very easy. I loved working here especially because they paid very well.
good,"Wendy's Inc., was a franchise company. The pay and benefits for hourly employees are definitely not good. The pay and benefits for supervisors, and management are livable, but not great."
good,I love this work environment. If I got paid more to do this job I would gladly be working here opposed to the corporate work I have found since. I thrive on a high paced environment and this is the best one I have found thus far.
good,"I loved working in a team. I loved the people I was working with and especially new customers that quickly became my friends. Interacting with people was definitely my favorite part of the job. A typical day would go as follows', I  would come in prepare the areas and the food, get the cash machines ready and then help either with making food however most of the time I was the person taking orders and greeting customers, handling cash and making sure that everything was the way its supposed to be."
good,I really love to work in this place prior to the managers and crews. We treat ourselves as a family and working as a team. This store is always following standards specially to the cleanliness of everybody/
good,Working for wendys was a nice fit for  me. Generally i liked it there and had no issues. The job was easy and stable so i enjoyed it. The best part of working for wendys for me personally was the room for me to grow within the company.
good,"great way to interact with customers, and good start up job to get your foot into the door with employment. lots of opportunity to learn."
good,Wendy's is an awesome company to work for. I never had any personal complaints about the management staff. A lot of relationships are formed while working here
good,If your a college student who need a little extra cash this is for you. if your a family man who needs to make more than $600 a month this is not for
good,Fast paced growing industry. Able to grow within the company. Flexible hours. Must be able to give the public a friendly and pleasant customer service smile.
good,There's nothing I've ever enjoyed more than building a relationship with the crew in this restaurant. Amazing doest begin to describe this job.
good,Enjoyed the job for only a certain amount of time because it was my first job and was looking to develop a lot of customer service experience.
good,It was a fun job always had fun wit the customers..jt wasn't really hard because I say all fast food restaurants  are the same jus different food on the menu. ..
good,"Typical work day: clock in,  make sure sandwich station is stocked and cleaned, make sure customers orders are completed correctly. Make sure every customer feel special and is well taken care of."
good,"working at Wendy is a great place to work at. i learned that it can be rude customer but you still have to show them respect. management   making sure were in order and the customers was happy with their orders. my co-workers was respectful, and did what they need to do to get the job done. The hardest part of the job was when it was so busy and people orders was getting wrong, but the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people. putting a smile on their face."
good,"great place to work for, all the food is fresh, made and prepped everyday. good management and time goes by fast when working"
good,"Wendy's is a great place to work, always able to make new friends with employees as well as build up your resume with work experience. Wendy's offers many opportunities for growth within yourself and the company. You learn more about yourself and what you are able to do. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the pace during rush hours, but overall it is a fun and exciting place to work and meet lifelong friends."
good,"It was a very good first time job to get by, but not a forever job. Management is easy going. Its easy to pick up on the tasks. Employees are enjoyable."
good,its very good place to work. you should recomind a friend work here. the employees are very nice. have nice and positive attitude towards the customers.
good,"Fast paced"
good,"Wendy's is a fast food restaurant, but its not like most. The one I worked at in Athens, PA is unusually clean for a fast food place and they are good people. The boss gives people chances even if she can see they won't last and that's the best thing. They keep the entire workplace very clean and they always keep food fresh. No one is ever just standing around, but always doing something productive."
good,"I enjoyed working for Wendy's. It was rough days at my location, but in all I loved it. The staff was okay and I enjoyed going in everyday ."
good,"I think the environment was great, a lot of the people were nice there. I just felt as if they weren't taking it very serious. So I went to another food industry."
good,"this was my first job when i left high school and it was my favorite. being food prep for the Wendy's breakfast rush was very calming for me. the idea of working from 4 in the morning to 11 was amazing. i could work my hours and still have the rest of the day to myself! i was a responsible employee who was being targeted of theft and threatened to lose hours and pay, and the stress and depression(from a 16 year old mind you) got to intense for me so I left"
good,there were days  when people didnt understand teamwork but when it wasnt stressful people were happy to work my boss was great she helped me out a lot and i got my experience for my first job
good,"My coworkers and I all work as a team and get the job done. The managers are nice, the hardest part is the Lunch rush but I also enjoy it because it's fun to see everybody work together and get the orders out fast,I learn how to work as a team while working at Wendys ."
good,"I loved working at wendys. I just don't enjoy the food and being rushed. Sundays are very rushed and so are Wednesdays. The people are very friendly and toy will quickly learn who the regulars are.  I man named David,  Luella, Charles, and Wayne."
good,"I liked my job to an extent. some workers were lazy and rude and some were team players. I learned how to deal with the public and the customer is always right no matter what. The hardest part of my job at Wendy's would be when it was rush hour and you didn't have enough or no help at all and I would have to try to multitask and take the orders, bag food, and handle the money. The most enjoyable part of my job would be seeing my regular customers."
good,A typical day at Wendy's is very busy. What i learned is how to manage a shift and how to prepare food to the highest possible care. My co-workers was awesome. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work hard and still be able to laugh and have a since of humor while working.
good,This was my first job and it was great; I gained a lot of experience and the changes in workload helped and challenged me to adjust to changing work conditions. The schedule was very flexible and management was willing to work with your time.
good,"I enjoyed going to work every day during the summer. Long days in a copy room weren't the best but it was quiet. I learned how to use the time that I was given to accomplish the duties that I was given at the beginning of my day. The management was very trusting with all who worked there, which was a great thing. Everyone had different areas to work in which meant you barely saw anyone all day besides your supervisor and one other worker. The hardest part was working from 7-3 with one short break."
good,it was a fun productive work environment until they sold the franchise and new management took over. co workers were great my managers were awesome. then the change happened and they let go of almost the entire original crew. thats when things started going down hill.
good,Some days are easy and most are kind of difficult. During the summer and the beginning of every month is the busiest. We have our usual and favorite customers like the ones that come through and order the same thing almost every day. And the co workers are pretty cool.
good,"Working an average day at Wendy's is very fast paced but I enjoy it and interacting with the customers. When we aren't busy, we're cleaning and getting things done around the store that need to be done. My co-workers are great, they all get things done and they all do things the right way, it's easy working with them because the majority of us all have the same work ethic. The hardest part of the job is having those very few workers that don't actually work and make one part of the job ten times harder then it actually is and then getting blamed for someone else's work problem. Overall this job has taught me to work with many different kinds of people and to get things done the correct way, I love my job and interacting with all the workers and customers."
good,Lack of help when it came to working their and raises was barely given. Managers had their favorite when it came to given hours out and the cleanliness of the store was horrible.
good,"I would work the drive thru on a typical day, I learned the cashier system very fast. Management was very nice; any time they were needed they was there. My co-workers were very dependable at any given time. The hardest part was doing the back line. The most enjoyable part was having a great relationship with my co-workers and my boss"
good,"Meet different people everyday"
good,Working at Wendy's was great for my first job. I learned a lot and had a lot of fun. I worked with friends and our managers were very (too) laid back. I had to quit for personal reasons but I definitely miss working there.
good,i learned a lot to manage my live cycle from here.  i was a shift supervisor and i un the shift and make my customer happy n and out.
good,"Good place to work, understanding management. I like the fact that when a family issue comes up, sometimes they care enough to let you handle your business."
good,"I love the crew, Very friendly, days go by quick at work. The clients are nice and our food is made in a very clean space, which is why I like the environment."
good,"The job at Wendy's is a great job, it keeps you busy on the go.We work with good people. the hardest part of the job is being on your feet all day. the best part of the job is being to work with good co-workers and helping one another to get the job done and feel that we have done our part to keep the company going."
good,a typical day at work is busy.What i learn is how to attend the people. The management was ok .My co-worker just do their job. The hardest part of the job could be when a boss dont like. The most enjoyable part of it when u have fun.
good,"I only completed my training there so I can't say too much about it. When i was there it was calm and pleasant. I worked there for about a week because of the hours that were given to me without the possibility to change. I was given a Schdual where i was to work from 7:30 till midnight, everynight and go to school the next morning."
good,At wendys a typical day would be me coming in and prepping the food before the restaurant opened. When the store did open at the time it did i would get on the front or drive thru register and take customers orders. I would also help my co worker that made the food bag it so that all customers could get there food at a good paste/time. I would also be the person to make the food sometimes. I enjoyed moving fast and making sandwiches.
good,"stayed on your feet all day, was always moving or doing something, you had a little it of down time every now and then, co workers was nice, management was ok depending on which boss you worked with."
good,Best working environment I've worked in so far. Management was very laid back but always got what needed to get done as soon as possible. I'd get to help with some of managements tasks being so trusted while working there. Very easy going co-workers that are still involved in life even after departure from the store. Regular customers would come in and ask specifically for me sometimes which was very heart warming. Received quite a few very good reviews from customers within the first few months alone. Couldn't have worked with a more caring crew than I did here. Very understanding.
good,work schedule was not always ideal. hours were not always available but I was able to pick up extra shifts if there was a call in.
good,"Honestly, this location (Davis Dr.) is a really great place to work. The store is profitable, the staff are top-notch and friendly, training is comprehensive, and overall it is a great place to work. The downsides to this location are the lack of benefits and the almost no room for advancement. This location is great to attain experience in the food-service and hospitality industries, however, it is not to be taken as a lifetime career. This location is strictly a bridging platform, taking you from one level of food-service to the next."
good,I learned how to multy task in a fast pace environment. I had to learn how to deal with different personalities.The hardest part to deal with is learning how to settle disputes with customers and not letting it get worse then the orginal issue.
good,"The management was very supportive when it came to those busy days, as football games, buses, or homecoming. Team work was a good lesson at Wendy's. I enjoyed working with colleagues that enjoyed and help get the customers in and out without any complaints."
good,Every one has there days but you make it through.When times get rough everyone sticks together no matter what.Working for this company I've learned a lot by the training I recieved through out my employment there.
good,Safe environment that encouraged one to learn new skills through online trainings and on the job training as well. The manager and my co-workers made the environment and fun and productive workplace.
good,Friendly staff and customers.. Most frustrating of the day is lunch hour everyone is running around doing multiple things. All management stays on the floor at all times/
good,"The typical day at work is Friday that's our busy day especially when its pay day, I learned to communicate different attitude of people, my co-workers I'm  having fun to work with them and the most we are all happy when we reached the goal of the day."
good,They work with you on any schooling.  They have good team work and partnership within the company.  I enjoyed the daily task of working with my team to provide good customer service skills for our customers.
good,Company day to day is hectic mainly one manager left to do all the work and there are a lot of busy rushes throughout the day
good,"great people and great environment. "
good,"While I worked at Wendys, I learned a lot of stuff, how to count inventory and do many different reports. I opened and closed the store, ran opening and closing reports, ordered the truck, counted it in and put it in the computer, I made the schedules. I made my speed time for the window and made it a game with my crew. Even though fast food is stressful at time , I met a lot of people that become life long friends. Wendy's in Lafayette Louisiana is the best ever, upper management is great , they encourage you and help you to reach your goals. The hardest thing about my job is making sure every one came to work and to keep them doing what they were suppose to."
good,"Me gusta mi trabajo, he aprendido mucho. Trabajo en equipo satisfactoriamente. "
good,"I had to take customers orders as well as clean, work the drive thru and make food. It was an okay job. I ended up leaving due to Volleyball."
good,"Constant interaction with co workers and management. Working side by side together to provide fast, fun, and efficient service. Very social working environment where you meet new and returning customers."
good,A typical day at work for me was getting to work thirty mins. early. I would help out before my shift began. As soon as my shift begins i started out at the cashier and the went to make burgers and helped out in the drive thru if necessary.
good,This is an okay place to work I really enjoyed my time there. I would work there again if need be. If your in high this is a great place to start. Not somewhere I would spend 20years.
good,"its one of those jobs you get as a minor ,while you learn the ropes it helped me build character ,even when I didn't really believe I could meet my goals, although  I had a few mishaps I value time I spent there."
good,I liked working at Wendy's the people were fun to work with. The manager was nice. I cleaned the bathroom and the lobby.  I made the terrific chili.
good,everone did there jobs and had fun to the management work with us as a team my co-workers like me and I like them becoues everyone did there jobs
good,Everyday at work working with customers is a blessing. I enjoy working with people and when I come to work I almost never wanna leave.
good,"Fast paced, busiest Wendys in Northern Arizona. A lot of changes. Managing a crew of younger kids was challenging. I loved the challenge. I like working with people. My favorite customers were the cranky owns because they were fun to try to get a smile out of.  I enjoyed going to work. I get a long with everyone. Even small conflicts don't last long with me. Management always changes and each one wanted things done their own way the key thing to get along is to find what that is and do it to make them happy. Co workers are easy we do our jobs and have a little fun while doing it even if that means cleaning a bathroom."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job will be when we used to get together for an special event(someone birthday).
good,I thought it gave me a great experience working in fast food. I got a lot of over time which i loved because i was struggling at that time and needed all the money to save for my bills. I loved working with the people there.
good,they're very good at working around your schedule. it's always busy and keeps something to do. its a great place to be social with everyone. teaches you how to deal with different people.
good,"Enjoy working at Wendy's in  Yuma, Arizona.I am a cashier. I either work the back hold which consists of the drive thru or up front taking orders.  I enjoy both positions."
good,Fast paced productive environment where team work is strongly encouraged.
good,the managment was fun at certain stores i work with some stores had favoritism
good,i worked here for almost two years but i had too leave because of all my bills and it just wasn't cutting it.
good,"A service oriented professional with two years of experience in customer service. Providing hospitality and excellent customer service to assure the highest level of customer satisfaction. With the ability to multi-task, self-motivate and my excellent communication skills, I am certain that I would be a great asset to your company."
good,Everyday I went to work with a smile on my face. the job and the employers that I worked with where vary easy going.
good,"Very nice place to work."
good,I would open the store and help prepared  the food. I also help closed the store.
good,it was a good work place with fun people you can team up with to run a store
good,Working at this company is beneficial but challenging when dealing with employees
good,"A typical day for me was mon-fri 11-5"
good,my typical day at work first i would clock in and and look at the chart that is made to see what position you are in. say for instance im up front i would take customers ordes then i would full the oders by waiting for there food to be made and then putting it on there tray. then i would make sure everything in my lobby was full and clean and if not i would clean the tables and trays and counter tops and fill the lids to the cups. then i would help out the drive through if needed. sometimes i would be on fries which means you scoop fries for the front and the drive. in between orders i help out by doing the dishes.
good,i would work some day 8 hours or some 12 hours. i learned how to work a work the grill in the restaurant.Some of my co worker were friendly and some didn't care about other people feeling or if the came to work.The hardest part of working at Wendy's was when they cut my hours to 5 hours a  weeks.
good,I didn't work with anyone. It was just me at the office cleaning. It was quite and time went fast.
good,"It wasn't a job where you stood around, there was always something to do.  I learned to help others when they were busy and I was not.  Management was very helpful and patient.  The hardest part of the job was to keep the line moving during the lunch rush.  The most enjoyable part of the job was satisfying the customer."
good,"I deal with customer complaints and inspections frequently. I learned customer service, food safety, cash handling, and efficiently running a shift. Management is very functional and reliable. Crew members are a little difficult because many are still in high school. But definitely an upbeat, fun environment. The hardest part of my job is definitely training new people when it's their first job. They're still learning the ropes of having a job and good work ethic. The best part is the people you meet and the fun days we can occasionally have."
good,"It was a decent job, I loved the aspect where everyone would try their hardest to help out and build friendships. There were times where people of course took advantage of others good nature and would ask to cover frequently or come late usually."
good,Good food and great people. Hard to get to the next level.Good raises every year.
good,"Friendly environment in the workplace with so much to learn; just being able to do the requirements to assist all the customers needs, co workers, managers, supervisor and able to provide the needs for the work place.  "

good,"Awesome crew members - Some supervisors really take power to their head, but overall it was ok.  Love the night crew, everything just goes by faster!"
good,"A typical day was very busy and fast trying to get orders out to customers. I learned all positions so I was able to help out in all areas of the job from cashiering, to putting up, stock, and watching over the store while managers had meetings. Management was great and they didn't mind stepping in to help out. My coworkers were friendly fun people and we worked together as a team to get work done. The hardest part of the job was getting through big rushes. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people everyday."
good,Everyone was friendly and willing to help each other. One of the best fast food places that i have ever worked
good,in a days work just making sure the store ran smooth and every guest left happy.
good,Better than any other restaurant I have worked for.  Well organized and treats employees with respect.
good,I learn how to talk and serve people with pride in a food service and  management is ok co-workers ok theirs nothing hard about the job once you learn what to do when I get to go home and rest. 
good,Good work enviroment loved working with the customers and also my team members
good,"Overall, I had a wonderful experience at Wendys. I would not have left the job if I did not have to travel 4 hours away to Albany, Georgia for college."
good,"You would come in prep your station and make food orders when customers came in, when we was not busy we cleanded.Most of the staff and management was great. The only hard part would be on the extra busy days with a short staff."
good,"enjoy working there,the coworkers are awesom to work with ,mangement was great.its a fun place to be in an work for."
good,"Great beginner job, very fast pace and urgent. Plenty of hours always! Managers our great, the hardest thing is making sure everything remains the same as far as closing and opening goes every night. Most enjoyable thing is that everyone gets along we're like a family."
good,My managers were amazing. They worked with all my needs very well. They entrusted me with things such as money. The co-workers were nice and very interactive with me. Everyone took an interest and care in everyone elses personal lives.
good,"Come in with a great greeting, learn how to multitak. The management team is great. I enjoy working there if only i could get more hours."
good,"A typical day at work required giving excellent customer service, helping other employes, and running register. Also maintaining and clean and friendly restaurant. The most enjoyable part of the job was the guests and the employees."
good,Wendy's was a weqonderful job for me throughout high school. Gave me a real eye opener on how the people in the world are. Everyone is not respectful and courtious.
good,i love the hours i was getting and the mangers was pretty good to me
good,"I get to work make the salads, then sometimes go to the bank. Once I come back I put on a head set and help with drive thur and also run front register. Then I wash my hands to make sandwiches. I then either run 2nd side sandwiches or I am at the front register or on fries or grill depending on where they need me at the day."
good,We had clear and concise policy's. I pretty much worked the front by myself. I enjoyed working with the people. Everyone helped each other when we got busy.
good,Its alot of work. Loved the people that I worked with. they made everyday fun.
good,"I started out small and became a drive force to this day a game changer to Wendy’s you never know we a simple meeting will take you,Me to and Wendy’s bliss the rest is history just ask someone"
good,"It was a good experience for the time I was there, the people were nice and accepting. It was usually busy at work and I learned how to keep up with what people need."
good,a typical day at work would be a 11-7 shift. on fridays there was always a fast pace team on duty we had to move real fast to overcome crowds.me and my coworkers always worked together.the hardest part was just getting the food out to the customer fast enough to proceed to th next customer
good,"work diligently and success will come, enjoyed the people and customers"
good,Great Company! Pleasant workplace that commits to advancement within the organization; the company lives up to the foundation of The Wendy’s Culture.
good,"i like training new and existing crew and managers, like working with people my coworkers are great dont like 50 plus hour weeks and no raises given to crew or managers"
good,"It was fun and exciting ,How to greet customers, Management was profesional, the co-workers were fun to work with,there was not anything about the job, working with the customers."
good,Everyone there was great and I got along with all the Managment just a great place to work
good,I would do morning maintenence setting up the restaurant.
good,At the time being young learning and talking to others was very important to get orders out
good,I had a great time working for this company for five years it only got toward the end of my five years that everything wasnt the same
good,"Mostly for people who are in school and they will work with schedules. There are some flaws, not many people work there so you do have to work a little extra harder."
good,It was a great first job when I needed experience. It was not my long term career but it gave me a start. There is advancement if you’re a hardworking individual. You could move up to management. There were not too many raises. The hours were flexible. The hours can also be long. Do not expect to get paid at a high wage.
good,"The wages are good based on the position and responsibilities. The opportunity for promotions is very good based on your hard work and dependability. The ratio of work to family life is not good though, you’re expected to put in a minimum of 50 hours a week and many nights, weekends and always working holidays."
good,"Fun coworkers and managers with an easy but active job. Very little down time but the only work you bring home with you is a sandwich. Expect to be moving around the store cleaning, serving, and taking orders all day."
good,"Amazing 3 years of my life. Got to learn bigger thing, had a much bigger responsibility. Quite a hand full. But one thing that kept me on my feet is meeting customers satisfaction"
good,Like I said I’ve been in and out of the food industry an I want to make a change and go somewhere where I’m doing more and not dealing with food. The places i have worked for have done me great business and pay I just want to move into a different Field.
good,I really liked working here. It was my first job and they work really good with your schedule. It’s would get busy during lunch and I liked it because I like to stay busy.
good,this job is very easy to learn how to do and a great place to work staff is friendly and very accepting    i loved the environment and the staff and the customers
good,I loved working for Wendy's I had a lot of gun working with my other crew members were awesome. Managers we're great folks too. Thank you for my working experience.
good,"i had an easy time at wendys after my training, job wasnt too hard once you memorized what certain things were and where they were at. Also the staff and management were kind and flexible so i was treated with respect and i enjoyed that."
good,"Wendys was a pretty good place to work for fast paced and frendly. Good food, great servers. Pay day was ok. I would not left had it not been for my need to be home with my kids at the time."
good,Good place to work. They will work with you and also help you improve and also try to help you move up into the business to become a better worker and person.
good,When do those very different from me I had came from working and a restaurant as a server so working at Wendy's so it was a different little environment for me it wasn't too bad it had its pros and it's cons as well
good,It a fast pace job. You always have to be ready. Managers are at time disrespectful to the employees. The job is fun if you make it fun. At the end of the day it’s your decision.
good,Okit was koo to work there it was a really good job it was all about what you wanted out of it you had a. Chance to learn earn and learn responsibility I think its a great start out job
good,Great place to work. Easy to get along with great managers. Willing to work with you on ur schedule. Easy interview process orientation also easy however videos so long and boring
good,I really enjoyed work here but the hours are long open late every night no time for family life but the people I worked with made it all worth it. It was like a family
good,"Wendy's would have a lot of customers during the day so you'll need to be productive and fast, but know what you're doing. Always ask questions if you don't understand anything or if confused. The hardest part of the job is accepting another persons attitude, because you have to know to what extent you can accept yourself. The most enjoyable part of the job is being on a team."
good,a typical day at Wendy's is right when you clock in is ready for a rush. you get to learn all the types of things with the company the management and workplaces are good every one known when it ok to talk and get there work done. the hardest part of the job is the rush hour
good,"One of the best jobs I’ve had.  Fitness center, flexibility, travel, good salary.  Lots of collaboration and teamwork.  Cross-functionality was probably the best I have seen."
good,"Although my coworkers were much older than me, I do think it was a great work experience for a high school student. While I worked, I was able to listen to my music, which helped me get the work done and it made the time fly."
good,"I worked at wendys (Olds, Alberta) for about 2 years straight during my last year of highschool and my gap year. If you really know how to do your job and are a fast learner then managenent will really like you and give you more hours. When i needed some extra cash after my first year of college i called them up and they were happy to welcome me back to help me out. Friendly staff, good environment to work and, of you are good at your job, job security"
good,En lo laboral es muy bueno pero no es aprobatorio el sueldo.
good,The days at work were okay. I've learned that a you always have to be patient. Managers always had a attitude. It was an okay enviornment to work in other than that.
good,Working at this company taught me how to work in a crowed work place. This was a productive and fun job the managers where very understanding and took there jobs very serious.Over all its a great work place.
good,"My co workers were awesome, there was only one manager who caused any problems. The work was fast paced but we accomplished everything like a team. Would highly recommend this for a first job."
good,Wendy’s is a good company they treat employees good they give you your breaks they make sure we work hard they give back plus feed the homeless everybody love coming to Wendy’s they love the nuggets kids enjoy all the time I’ll always go back in work
good,"There is always something to do. Definitely not a job for someone looking for a laid-back position. There is always work to be done, so if you are not willing to work, you will not last long. But if you are a hard worker? It is so much fun. You get to know your co-workers so much it is like family."
good,"When I left for college, Wendy's let me come back to work on my breaks from college. Wendy's was a good time management job. Made some lifelong friendships there too."
good,My Wendy's was a good place to start if you were new to the working world. Sadly my store was closed and replaced with a starbucks. But I am glad that I had the experience.
good,"fast working sometimes depending on time of day,  management was good fun to work with.. strict but also laid back a the same time. hardest part of the job is being around fast food all day and being tempted to eat food all the time // best part was the people you work with and also discounts on the food"
good,"Wendy's was an amazing, friendly work atmosphere. Everyone learns how to work together as a team. I was able to learn a lot due to the fast pace environment."
good,"Even though my time at Wendy's was brief, it was an amazing experience working there and I enjoyed my time as an employee while I was there. The managers were amazing and helped with anything you asked for help with."
good,"I must say Wendy's was one of my favorite places work. I would go back any day! The manager was one of the sweetest ladies I've meet ever at any job. She didn't let her position go to her head. She treated everybody like her own. & Everybody I mean everybody including the customers loved & respected her. She never had to raise her voice at anyone about anything. The entire staff did everything we was suppose to do & more. Not only for ourselves but for our customers as well. Overall the entire experience was over the roof, I loved it!"
good,when I worked at wendys it was a great job you always get to see new faces and the co workers were very helpful it was always something new everyday :)
good,"It was a fun environment to be in and I loved the willingness to help the my coworkers exerted. I would 10/10 apply again. The manager at the time was a ******, but he's fired now, so(:"
good,"Fast paced work environment with awesome management. It was a great job, but did not pay enough for the area. I would recommend for a second job, or a job while you are in college."
good,"Overall I had a good experience with the company,  but due to some problems with hours and associates I decided it would be best for me to no longer work there, so I decided to respectfully resign from my position and leave on good terms."
good,"Verifies orders to meet company’s standard for food quality and quantity"
good,"was a ok job. It did not pay verywell. but it was a job that help pay bills.   Somedays you had to help out many departments bacause pf the employes calling in sick, or not showing up on time for their shift."
good,Cook and clean and take orders  and clean the bathroom dinner table and the grill and the floor drink stand and greet people with the up most repeat I love people
good,"Overall a fun job to work at if you’re a teenager looking for a job. My location was always busy so you always had something to do, which made time fly by. Fun managers and fellow employees."
good,wendys is a really busy but yet simple workplace.I was a crew member which means i work on the floor as a runner or cashier . I also slent some time in the kitchen
good,I’m examine dovalis was working for Wendy’s Miami biscayne Blvd it was ok fun with the coworkers and hard working miss them but left it because it was a part time didn’t anough to pay my bill
good,It was a very relaxed environment but fast pace at times. Staff and management was very nice. They would be understanding if you was late if you had a legitimate excuse (speaking from what I saw).
good,I loved my job at Wendy's I was there for over 12 years as time went on I began to have a lesser quality of life and knew that a change was soon to come
good,Work was usually fun even though we were usually understaffed or if we did have a full staff people weren't fully educated at their positions so it would go slower than necessary. Management is good and the most enjoyable part was the people I worked with.
good,Wendys is a great first job! it can get a little stressful at times but if you have the right people it’s amazing! the hardest part of the job is when it gets really busy on friday night and you’re understaffed.
good,"It was tough at times, with us being lowstaffed, amd being a fairly new store that people want to check out. It is very busy most of the day. It can be easy once you know what to do, but training is the hard part"
good,It was good I kinda liked job. It was fun and all I did was work I did everything in the job including maintnace I did cashier made sandwiches stockin
good,The most satisfying part of the job was being able to interact with our customers and gain feedback on how we could improve our store from how our store be more easily accessible to special events we hosted for local charities
good,"A day working at wendys was full of laughter, jokes, and a fun time. Everyone I knew at wendy's were great people, the managers were the best and took care of everything like it was nothing."
good,"Long shifts, love the employees the company itself is pretty decent, Not flexible with the workdays when you have younger childern, it is and okay job tho"
good,The hardest part of working at Wendy's is that I have to oversee and train up to 8 employees on a daily basis and diffusing difficult situations between customers and/or crew members sometime. But its a great place once one gets use to the atmosphere.
good,"It wasnt so hard it was pretty easy i use to open the store up"
good,"crew members work in the kitchen preparing food and at the front counter helping customers through the ordering process. Team member job duties include operating a cash register, running the drive-thru, cooking Big Macs and other menu items, cleaning the restaurant, and completing other assigned tasks."
good,"Great company with a desire to provide great customer service.  Culture of giving back, employee recognition, innovative products and people development."
good,You will have to be patient when dealing with customer problems. You never know how someone will react but they how no problem showing you and I know from experience. It is very fast paced as well. You’re on your toes for the day most of the time.
good,This was my favorite fast food place to work. Although customer service isn’t always easy the atmosphere of Wendy’s in bardstown was the best. They made each day worth the work and always worked with you any way that was possible
good,It’s fun to work there if your doing the morning shift where everyone is preped and ready to go. It’s good that the General Manger helps out when it’s really busy.
good,"I don't have anything bad to say about being employed by Wendy's in fact it was a very fun job, even though I was placed in the drive-thru window better known as the hole"
good,Get working thier management was horrible that was the down side but overall get experience to work for them just need to hire more staff because at one point we were three at the store
good,I have had a lot of fun working here. I have been trained very well and feel like I wouldn't be leaving if there were more corporate opportunities in palm bay.
good,It is my second job part time but it isnt stressful need more benefits. I get a decent check from there because I work on the base so they pay a little more because its government property.
good,"I have been apart of the team since 2009. From privately owned to franchise. I feel I should have a manager position if I was to reapply because I have that many years of experience. Overall fun place to work, I didn't mind going In on off days to help my team because we all worked together as one."
good,It was my first job and I enjoyed working there because the people there was so nice and I caught on quick to everything. It also was very clean on the inside and outside
good,"A typical day at wendys is coming in, clocking in. Making sure your station is ready a stocked. Making sure your area is clean. And having your headset ready to go with a smile on your face."
good,At times it can be stressful but you learn from your mistakes When is a great place to start working in it’s a good job for working ethnic. And they pay really good for fast food.
good,Working at wendys isnt like every fastfood place and i love that i would never trade wendys for any other fast food we put every customer first and make sure they leave with a smile
good,"At points you will find yourself tired and semi-stressed but you just keep pushing through and showing others that you can remain at a constant if not better pace, you will do just fine."
good,It’s a fun place to work. It’s just management because some people think because they are a manager they can just treat their employees any kind of way.
good,its a good work enviroment i enjoy my experiance there. Management is nice and they are very understanding of my time and when i want time off they usually allow it. Most enjoyable part is seeing the customers happy.
good,"im not the fast food type of worker, but i respect what they do. its honestly not easy, and wendys guest satisfaction is the company's number one goal beside providing fresh food"
good,I absolutely loved this job! I think this is a great job to apply for if you are just now entering the workforce. The managers are caring and willing to work with you. They are always staffed appropriately.
good,Working at Wendys is definitely a cool first job. The people are really easy to get along with. The customers are nice and most of the time know exactly what they want. Lunch time was always my favorite because you can really see everyone pull together and work as a team.
good,"wendys is a nice place to work at, but it depends on the management. the management was very poor, a typical day at work was stressful because workers would call out. the workplace was very clean. the most enjoyable ting about the job was my co-coworkers because they always kept a smile on my face."
good,"When I worked here, I enjoyed trying to make service time in drive-thru. Also, the people were very fun to work with. They worked with the hours I needed to work around school and life as well. Overall very good working experience."
good,"Wendys is a great place to work because everyone feels like a family! The way management treats you is fair and all staff are treated the same, and everyone truly works as a team."
good,It was a fast paste place. Everyone got along. It was a good job for school time. It helped me pay for my senior stuff. I recommend people working there.
good,they were always running out of products to the point where customers would be upset it became overwhelming. the crew members did not make the environment any better
good,"Always busy, always something to do, very helpful team members, I get breaks most days, polite customers, amazing general manager,  a nice peaceful environment to work in sometimes stressful."
good,Fun but the District manager was vary rude. She terminated me while i was in the hospital. But it was a nice place to work other then that and they dont frezz there meat witch is a plus to me. It tast better.
good,Great work team! Sometimes my work days was long and stressful but some days was very great being able to assist and help serve customers. I would definitely recommend anyone to go there.
good,Great environment and great place to start if it's your first job good people great management and co-workers good location and lovely customer service
good,"Enjoyed working here while I did.  Good people, great Management and there's room for advancement.  Worked the hours that suited my family life.  Enjoyed it"
good,Only thing was it needed more workers so we was short staff do most days i pulled doubles never had time with my kids and pay wasn't much for everything i could do in there.
good,great working place. fast paste. hard working. great environment. gain work experience. easy to learn. great for first job. easy to come by. required to work on more then one task at a time
good,Wendy's is a fast pace job were we serve hot food and smiles to our customers. I've learned that being apart of this company you have to be on your 'A' game daily. The manager's work together to satisfy all customers and employees. The hardest part is coming to work and being short handed because it's hard to serve your customers in a timely manner. I love meeting new people and seeing smiles on customers face. Knowing that the people know I care about them not just there money.
good,Wendys was my favorite of all my jobs. I was my first job and longest job I worked at. Working there is face passed! Lunch and dinner hours were the fastest parts of the day.
good,Es una copañia donde no puedes ganar o aspirar a otras posicionesy hanar mas dinero
good,"Working at Wendy's was an overall good experience I learned a variety of new skills. you would have to treat the customers with respect, make sure to understand thoroughly how their order is placed. The management was good all the managers made sure every employee is doing what they are suppose to do and to make sure everyone is on track. The hardest part of the job was working overnights because it was the most busiest time of the day. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customer happy with their correct order that keeps them coming in everyday!"
good,"Andover is a very busy community, our drive thru was always ringing made the day go by so much faster. New ways of running shifts is the best thing I learned my whole experience. Being a shift manager was different with Wendy's because you had at least 2 every shift. Learning new paper work online rather than paper was difficult an easier all at once. Id like to believe clocking out was the best part of my day."
good,"I learn how to work with others "
good,I worked at the Wendys on 30Th St in Canton for years and I had the best GM. It was like a family and all the management was professional and helpful. I learned a lot working here about customer service and it is a great place to start.
good,I'll come in at 4:00pm n start at the register most likely or taking orders.Sometimes when the day picks up a lil bit I'll have to help other crew members out as a team.Hardest part about the job was dealing with customer's wit mean addtiude.
good,Working at wendy's was a nice first job that introduced me to what it is like to have to balance work and home life as well as communicate with customers in a calm and effective manner. I also gained the opportunity to learn skills on the job while taking constructive criticism from other team members.
good,.... This company is what you make it. This is the only fast food restaurant that i would suggest to work and eat. The cleanliness at this restaurant is most priority.
good,This place was a good learning spot about how fast paced restaurants operate. however it was my worst experience ever because the one manager was very verbally and emotionally abusive.
good,"Most employees were young but i loved the job Managers were cool and respectful, if byou needed extra hours or wanted more hours they were always avaliable ."
good,if you become management your work life/ home life is not an equal balance. your work life starts to interfere with your home life making for many problems at home.
good,Working for Wendy's is great for someone who is still in high school and is barely starting. Management team is great and always there to listen to crew members concerns.
good,I have been employed at wendys for four year. Everyday is different. I love my job but I'm just looking for new work in a different environment. It is a friendly place to work we practice team work and reaching goals together
good,I worked at Wendy’s for three and a half  years and yes there were hard days but out of the three and a half years I can honestly say I have the best memories there.
good,I really enjoyed working at Wendy the staff was nice nd I loved the customers. It was a fast paced environment nd really clean. I will like working there agine.
good,I used to love my job. But now I get 2 days a week when I was promised 5 and 30 hours. Lack of responsibility with managers. No accountability. The schedule is never set. Certain people get hours but don't do there job. Lots of disrespect. Lack of consistency.
good,"I loved my job. It was mf first and last job. It wasn’t room for advancement and the compensation wasn’t fairly great. The hours were cool unless you are a parent, the time we spent cleaning up at night was ridiculous."
good,"This job was a simple task and I was able to do everything I was asked. Management was good, kept everyone in the place they needed to be in. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to get along with everyone."
good,"If you can work here, you can work anywhere. You'll learn here how to multi-task, work in faced paced enviornments, and increase customer service skills."
good,working at wendys is a good place to work and a great job to have part time or full time temporary.   I only say this because it doesnt pay much until you become upper management.
good,It's a fast paced yet rewarding job. There's room for self improvement and advancement. Getting better and advancing your training gets you a raise very quickly.
good,"normally at work, time goes by fast. the workers there are cooperative, and are team players. so far i have learned how to make sandwiches, take orders, receive orders, and how to get along well with the customers during bad days. the managers know how to treat their staff fairly. the culture here is team working its all about team work. the hardest part of working here is standing up in the hot sun at the drive tru taking orders. the most enjoyable part of the job is clocking out and  going home."
good,I worked at Wendy’s while I was in college studying business administrations. This position taught me many skills that I need in any job. I liked that I could apply what I was currently learning in class on to my work life.
good,A better manager would’ve gave me a better expirence to wanna actually come to work more and be there forever but the manager was just not a good communicator
good,"Loved working for wendys, amazing hours that work with your schedule. Friendly staff, and fair pay. Not to often is there over time, but you can advance fairly quickly."
good,"Good place to work, met some nice people, helps build people skills, good work ethics. Paid alright for a fast food restaurant. Taught me a lot about the fast food business."
good,Wendy's is a fun and productive work environment with tons of competition. I loved it. I recommend people to work there aswell as a first job. the most enjoyable part of the job is talking with the customers and giving them excellent customer service even if they're having a bad day.
good,"A typical day at Wendy's can sometimes be easy and sometimes can be overwhelming for me. What i learned at Wendy's is fasht paced isn't always good. The Managers at Wendy's are very helpful, i am very grateful for everything they taught me. The hardest part of the job is trying to get more hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people and getting to know your co- workers"
good,"It was a very fast paced job, especially with busses. It was harder for a high school student because I worked till 11 or later. I enjoyed the staff and the tasks were very easy."
good,Always meeting new people with different points of view. Always having something to work on. There is always opportunities for those who take advantage of it .
good,Great at managing workers and it's a fast paste working environment.  The manager there was awesome and very flexible with scheduling. This was actually my first job and i loved it. I just love how everyone was able to be a team player.
good,by far this was one of the best and exciting jobs ive experienced. it was a fast paced enviroment but it handled as a team which lightned the burden on each indivisual
good,"Work consists of doing more than one position at once. You have to constantly restock and move at a fast pace. The hardest part was trying to do everything by yourself with co workers who may not be on tasks and as efficient as you are. Managers do their job, however they sometimes require you to do some of their tasks."
good,Wendy's was a fast fun place to work.  They maintained a clean restaurant.  Employees strived to please every guest that walked in and to have customers leave with smiles on their faces.
good,i opened witch consists of prepping the store for opening and stocking of the ingredients to run through out the day as well as running grill sandwich making cashiering making the customers visit a pleasant one  so they want to come back .
good,Was a very friendly and enjoyable place to work.  Again by working for this company it also gave me experience to work in a fast paced environment. It also provided met the opportunity to gain experience working with customers.
good,"i would take orders, talk to customers, bag orders and make sandwiches. i learned that you have to keep your opinions to yourself while being involved in customer service. management has lack of communication. the hardest part of the job is having to keep up with everything and dealing with rude customers. the most enjoyable part is the people that i work with."
good,"Wendys was a great place to work at, especially if you are just starting out with a first job. Wendys had a great work environment with good people to work with and work for."
good,Working at Wendy's was a great first job experienced which allowed me to gain a better understanding of what customer service is. We worked together as a team to assure proper preciseness and speed to insure our guests receive their food on time.
good,This wendys was a pilot flying j truck stop as well and it was always very busy . that is what i liked about it the people there were so very great all the time.
good,"Great place to work for tons of things to do. Room for advancement, I'm in a training store so I see a lot. Great food, good benifits, nice environment. Not too pressuring compared to other fast food restaraunts, in my opinion it's really easy. All I can say is pay close attention to the Wendy's way and you'll always suceed."
good,The management team was excellent laid back nice and helpful all the time and I always looked out like a family for everyone and that seems to be like that in the company
good,Wendy's is a good starter job but I couldn't live off of the $8.15 an hour. I am staying long enough to find a better job. I hate how most of the people do not know how to work as a team and only focus on them selves.
good,This cooperation is a good one to work for while attending high school. The location I worked for was close to home and worked around my school schedule so I was able to maintain good grades.
good,"Just your average old fast food first job! I loved it at first because I was finally getting money, i never really cared about hours or that I had to work on a certain day"
good,"When I worked at Wendy's I got to meet alot of people, everyone was great to me. I must say working thier was a great experience. Still to this day people remeber me when they see me out. They always said I was a very hard worker. And I was super sweet."
good,"A typical day at work is always a fun time with my co-workers. It's a fun and serious environment. Everyone is always working hard together to get the job done. As someone once said ""team work makes the dream work"" and that's how I think a working environment should be, everyone getting along, awhile working hard."
good,"I learned every position in the store, Ive been working here since the 10th grade and it could be hectic sometimes but I always showed up to do my job then leave. Ive never missed a day of work. When I say never, I never missed a day. I could be sick and still come in to work because I feel that my money is important to me and im very reliable. Ive gotten alot of extra hours from people not showing up for there shift."
good,Since my time at wendys. I've learned a lot. From when I first started as a crew in 2014 to me being a manager in 2017. Now it hasn't been all peaches and cream. But I've learned to keep pushing past the bad days and strive to do better next time.
good,"Clean room "
good,Great company.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants to work in a restaurant. The work environment is excellent.  And their managers are fun to be with. Closings are a blast!
good,"I worked in the back cooking most of the time.manager is super nice and accommodating.unfortunatly wasn't in the best part of the city.Enjoyed working with the staff there,made it pleasant."
good,"This is a great job for a person new to the work force.  Unfortunately, it does not pay enough to support yourself and there are not benefits available, except for management."
good,"Like any fast-food restaurant, working at Wendy's is very fast-paced. This location, on Horizon Drive, makes the fast-paced day easier  to get through. Being friendly is one of Wendy's main goals and they definitely accomplish it. The managers always work with the crew to ensure everything is done right and as low-stress as possible."
good,"Trabajo en grupo, y con eficiencias en los servicios. A la calidad del cliente"
good,Its a great company to work for.its has its up and downs but overall great company.Some of the manager are nice.There are plenty opportunities with this company
good,"Everyone worked together , there was sometimes when things got hectic and outta hand but they got it together overall . I like working with my team tho"
good,"I like working there because I got to meet new people!! I liked my Co Workers and my hours I worked.  One thing I didn't like is minimum wage. After 8 months working there,  I'm looking for another job."
good,"It's a great pleasure to work at Wendy's. "
good,Pretty good place to work.This is not a place to work and make a career unless you are thinking about a position in management. This is a good place to start for a beginner.
good,"i thought wendy's was a fun job to have, it taught me to be more reliable and responsible,but i wanted to get out of the food business and start somewhere else"
good,"FUN"
good,"Buen ambiente laboral, mi primer trabajo serio. Adquirí muchas habilidades, manejar mis tiempos y administrarme bien con el tema dinero."
good,"A typical day at work would be me coming in and doing what is asked of me. I learned how to manage work and school. My coworkers were awesome. There wasn't anything hard about the job, in fact everyone thought running the grill was a ""man's"" job but I requested to learn it. Grill ended up being my favorite position at that job. All around Wendy's was a great job."
good,I think this job was great the co workers well get alone . the hardest part of the job was working for someone else job because they didn't want to show up.
good,"I enjoyed this job as it was my very first job. I learned a lot about time management and scheduling myself for shifts with school and homework. I worked many different positions at this job such as cash, early morning prep, and food preparation. Great atmosphere, everyone works together and managers are kind and understanding."
good,I enjoyed working with all types of ppl I knew every job in wendys and I really enjoyed working w in the the public and possibly learning management positions
good,Start the day off with a huddle to set the tone of the shift. Crew then is assigned positional responsibilities and cleaning tasks for slow points. The management staff runs from an operations lead position and makes adjustments during the rush periods. The management trains new and veteran staff members throughout their whole shift. The crew is trained to be team players and help one another out. The hardest part is getting everyone on the same page because everyone is different. The most enjoyable part is setting goal an achieving or even surpassing the expectation or goal.
good,"It is an okay place to work. It can be very stressful though. However if you are able to cope with the stress then the managers at the Bluefield, VA location are some of the best people you could ever work with."
good,Mr  Austin was a very good boss Hands-On type person to make sure you learned everything you needed to know to succeed at Wendy's I was very happy to have worked with some of the best team members
good,"wasn't willing to work with work and life balance and took too long for them to respond to any advancement opportunities, always saying they working on it and never seems to be getting there."
good,come in at 7am have a meeting and then fill carts for the rooms that were to be cleaned then do them and if a guest needed anything then we got it for
good,"I usually would clock in early to help out with setting up with setting everything up. I help customers to decide what they would like to eat. I then ring it up on the register, prepare their drinks, cash out their order, coordinate their order, and hand them their food.The other workers there are very nice and easy to get along with. We usually have fun while working."
good,There is really not much to say. The leadership is poor at times and so are the employees it can be very disturbing and nerve wreacking.
good,"Though it was my first time to work or it was my first job, of course it was hard for me at the first place and full adjustment should be needed. But when the time or day past,I learned everything and I enjoy it. Aside from being a sandwich maker though I learned the different burgers of Wendy's, I also had fun in my co-workers,I treat them as my second sister/brother. And of course the management itself, I consider them a mentor on both professional and I have learned so much while working with this company. The hardest part of this job is when there are so many guest and the manager are sometimes got angry, because they want the service is consistent even if there are many guest in store but for me as a crew, it is part of the company and it should be consider in any situation. "
good,"A typical day at work would be constantly busy. I learned that no matter what is happening outside of work, to ""Leave it at the door"". Management had a lot of miscommunication, but my coworkers were always positive. The hardest part was dealing with slow management, and the most enjoyable part was the fast pace and the challenge to keep the timer lower than the previous shift."
good,While working for Wendy's I made a lot of friends and had a great time doing a mediocre job. No one likes flipping burgers but the wendy's team makes it bearable.
good,"its a fun fast paced environment. the coworkers have a lot of personality, and management was great. the hardest part was trying to get everything done within 3 hours"
good,"I was general manager. My day included opening the store inventory, scheduling, and just day to day operations. This was a franchise owned store. The owners were very involved. The hardest part of this job is being on your feet 10 hrs a day. Pay was salary so it was easy to budget my bills."
good,It was a learning experience. Food Service is one of the more demanding careers due to hungry customers. I was very lucky to have had the opportunity to work with such a great team. Members of management were always very helpful and invented new ways to inspire and motivate us to achieve our goals. The best part of the job was meeting new people and hopefully putting a smile on their face.
good,"There is no such thing as pressure in this job, every co-worker and management is there to help and assist every employee. There is a team work in this company."
good,"A typical day at work, is preety easy not too hard. And also have learned a lot of the food, everything"
good,"At Wendy's a typical day was a whirlwind of activity. From the time you clocked in to the time you clocked out you were busy. It was at this job that I truly learned the meaning of time management. I also learned the importance of working together as a team. Wendy's operated like a machine with each person playing an important role. If one person slowed down, the entire operation was slowed down. I enjoyed my coworkers for the most part. Food service is food service and it gets as good as it gets. Everyone who worked their understood this and as a result were always working hard to do their best and not add stress on any of their coworkers. The most enjoyable part of this job was when things ran smoothly without a hitch. The hardest part of this job was maintaining maximum work efficiency during unexpected employee absences."
good,"A typical day at work would include preparing food, restocking shelves, providing customer service, and lifting heavy boxes of food to the freezer, and taking out the garbage."
good,A lot of members came and went. Those who stayed seemed to grow a bond. The store took many different turns for the best in 2015.
good,"Everyone was very comfortable to work, and work with you. They stayed generally on task, and always had some sort of pep in their step. Advancements were encouraged, regardless of who you were and how long you'd been around. Clean, efficient, and refreshing, but at the same very busy, and granted the areas of rushing and crunching time, but there was always some leeway to take a breath."
good,Work is fun an work can have its down times. But at the end of the day. As long as the customer is happy an well please. We're happy
good,Being my very first restaurant job I can say I picked the best place to start. This was a very well run organization that prided itself on the fastest speed of service in the entire industry. That alone was what gave me the start in my competitive edge in the fast food industry.
good,to be able to offer the best costumer service by following all the rules. Work in harmony to keep a enjoyable workplace which will help in keeping the costumer happy
good,"wendys is great for the money, but when it comes to the rules ive felt that they werent followed properly.pay is bi-weekly so if your good with budgeting for a week and a half then your good.it is a high stressful job and is demanding."
good,Good work environment with great managers. Easy to learn the new products when taught. Answered any questions or complaints we had.
good,"i learned how to clean and take orders on a manageable time limit managers encouraged me to push past my fears and multitask showed me how to assist customers with orders , the most challenging  part of the job before getting adapted was multitasking at other service stations and taking orders at the same time the most  enjoyable part of the job was getting use to how machines worked so that way everything just came to me and being able to make mistakes not be ashamed because there would be an employee around to  help me out"
good,"I love working here!! You get the same customers everyday, same routine. After a while you don't even have to think about what needs to be done you just do it!!"
good,"I've learn to be a team player, make shore that my job is well done. Management has make my life more fun to learn how to do m job and be more successful at what I do at work."
good,"I enjoy my time at my job. I usually don't mingle with anyone in the workplace, but when i do its refreshing to have people the that wants to see you succeed. I'm currently enroll into school and my managers make sure i have time to accomplish my studies and maintain a steady job to help make ends meet"
good,"I learned how to handle misunderstanding customers and how to react. Loved working with co-workers and management, loved being in charge of the station I was in."
good,Fast pasted working environment that has only one down size to it. Minimum wage is currently 7.25 and the work  overwhelms the pay. Great management though.
good,During my time working at Wendy's I was able to get used to the work culture. At the time i started as a dinning room/ back room cleaner and eventually got promoted to line cook. When i finally ended my time at Wendy's do to school. Overall my time at Wendy's was enjoyable and rich with experiences.
good,"Overall great place to work.fast fresh and resolve issues for customers..Cook food to order,keep dinning room clean as well as work station and grill."
good,"A typical day at work for me, was managing and assisting to help others. I would go over and beyond for my job, and got recruited to a team leader. Management was sometimes messy, but still insist to do what was required of the job."
good,I would be there at 5 in the evening till about 12 45 to 100 in the morning . I would take orders and hand out food and help the other employees clean the place and get it ready for the next day.
good,"A typical day at work would be fast paced. I was in trainning to become a manager. I also trained all new employee's and basically did everything around the restaurant. ex. Cashier, Drive-Thru- and Sand which Maker. My co-workers were fairly nice."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's was pretty standard, you would come in, and when you started you were working right away. If you opened you would start with the morning prep, and be ready by 11 to start the lunch rush. No matter the time of the day, there was always something to do. Management was great, I have no complaints about them, same with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the days there was not enough staff, so you had to take on the extra work, but the team always came together and got it done. The part I most enjoyed about working here was, the friendliness of the staff. They are always there to make you feel better if you are having a rough day, and if you are falling behind, they are always able to help you get caught up."
good,"My work day usually starts off with me working on a position, later on through out the shift, the crew get an extra cleaning task for the day. When i am on night, i have to help prepare a cart of condiments for the next day. Management is usually on top on things, although there is some bad nights. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with all the drama between crew. The most enjoyable part is when i get to work with the people who always make it a good time."
good,Great company to work for. Very intellectually stimulating. The customers are always satisfied with the attention that I show them
good,"Wendy's is a very fast paced environment. The co-workers are a pleasure to work with and the managers show much pride in their work. Our main goal is to satisfy our customers and to continue to serve hot, fresh foods all day long."
good,"It was fun to work for, it was challenge for me because we had a timer every day that we had to make, and with customers having different attitude it was hard but not impossible. Team was great with out them nothing is possible. Give respect and you will get respect back."
good,I enjoy working at wendys because of the management. It is well organized and my instructions are in complete detail. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing how satisfied customers are when they receive their orders quickly and accurately. The person who trained me is very nice and my co-workers are all very welcoming.
good,"I almost always knew what I was going to do. The best part was talking to guests, but I always ended up everywhere at some point in time."
good,"One day I came into work and there was a rush through drive-thru and front counter. After clocking-in I instantly got on a fast pace with the rest of the crew. The manager supervised and helped out somewhat but left majority of the job to us, so In that moment I knew to work hard and make sure my job was done nicely right along with helping out my team. Whenever they seem to slack and I'm out of work I'll give a helping hand because I know I would want the same in return.The hardest part of the day is just catching the pace when first beginning to get on the job but after so long it gets to become a routine to me. The best and enjoyable part of the day is satisfying the customer, myself, and my team."
good,it was a great place to work at the co-workers were friendly and able to help one another out when asked up. I was always helping management out by keeping track of how much product we had and didn't have before and after every truck order. The hardest part of the day was having to get the store ready to open. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing all customers and how happy they were with their food. Typical day was to show up in the morning and then start prepping food for the day and make sure the shift was stocked with hot food fast. I learned how to make one the best chili in the fast food industry.
good,A typical day at Wendys were very exciting and enjoyable. My management team was awesome. They were very welcoming and enjoyable there was never a dull moment. The hardest part of the job was clocking out.
good,I very much enjoyed my time with this company. Everyone worked together and they took care of people with everything. In my department however there was no room for advancement.
good,"The work environment was easy. Co-workers were good to work wit, management team employee orientated. "
good,"wendys is a great place to work, i love workimg here. wendys i love working here"
good,depending on the work flow determines the way work will go I have learned to work fast and be proficient my co workers are amazing hardworking people the hardest part about the job for me is transportation
good,I would spend my entire shift working the drive thru. Making sure all the orders were right. And also helping with cleaning dishes. The hardest part of that job was making sure during our late night rush that everything flowed smoothly. That all the orders were complete and that we didn't get backed up in the drive thru after the lobby area would close.
good,"lots of work, long hours great pay friendly people great managers great hours good benefits"
good,"A typical day at work would be opening the sandwich stations and stocking everything to get ready for the day. When the store opens, customers come in and I take orders. I learned how to have good customer service experience and calming people down when they get upset about something. I try to fix problems quickly and efficiently. My co-workers are great to be around. We all have a good time but also get our jobs done at the same time. The hardest part about the job is some positions you only stand in one spot for hours with very little walking around. The management is great as well. They are flexible with scheduling and when something comes up."
good,"I've been working there for over a year and I made a lot of friends over the months, even with the managers."
good,I loved working here mad I had health issues I couldn't work there anymore
good,I love the communication and seeing new faces. I learned to be more understanding to others needs. I am currently in the process of becoming crew chief. Crew chief is another sort of manager. My coworkers are amazing. The hardest part of my job I would say is working unpredictable hours. But the most enjoyable part would be working with hard working people and satisfied customers.
good,manage 30 or more crew people make sure that everybody that comes in the store leave happy and that they will enjoy there food
good,"very fast paced,very long commute,learned a lot about scheduling employees and managing employees."
good,"I greeted customers, took orders, received payment, bagged orders, kept work space and dinin area clean."
good,"Bennigans was a great place to work while I had the chance. The associates and managers were great, majority of the customers were pleasant and the tips made up for the lousy pay. The most enjoyable part, was just getting to clock in and work with such an extraordinary group of people. Management was great, and always got time off if needed."
good,This job I was the main food preparer I ran a very tight shift but it was ran smoothly. I served about 700 customers within one shift over a 8/10 day

good,"If you are looking for an experience for your resume, it's definitely a good start to gain that."
good,With a change in management this place is GREAT to have a career at
good,"Opened the store in the mornings so that other employees and myself could prepare the store for the day. I prepared the condiments, set up all the cash registers with money and made sure that the other employees were accomplishing their tasks to be ready for the shift by having everything prepared and the outside and inside of the store was clean and presentable to customers. When the store opened I dropped all products and talked to each employee about what our goals were for the day and what they needed to accomplish. Once we were ""on line( making customer's orders)"" it was my duty to make sure everything was flowing right and everything was going according to plan while making the work environment a place where people wanted to be apart of. At the end of the shift I would count out the cash registers and balance the money made for the day and then take my deposit and deliver to the bank. The hardest part of the job was having to do my job as well as making sure others were doing theirs also.  My favorite part of the working at Wendy's was being a boss and being a leader to help other employees succeed."
good,"everyday was the same, clock in, wash your hands, put your gloves on and started making sandwiches. I learned a lot about cleanliness at the workplace. There was maybe one or two good managers that actually cared about you and treated you fair. It was a lot of fun working with all my coworkers.  The hardest part of the job was cleaning up at the end of the night cause a lot of times no one would help you."
good,"I’m the store manager response for managing people products & equipment & safety and security customer satisfaction sales ,food coast ,making control the controllable expenses line , my monthly and yearly P&L ,forecast fore the next year ,reforecast quarterly , managing people motivation crew moral , making balance between absence requirements  and people requirements to insure good environment for work which effect directly of people productivity."
good,"Working at a fast food restaurant is fast pace. Your days do go by very quickly. It is not an easy job some days. When working on front register, you are required to clean and stock items in the lobby and the bathrooms. You only work with customers for a few minutes. All main point of this job is making food quick, perfect, and pleasing the customers. This type of work may not be for everyone."

good,"it is very fast paced during the lunch time and the evenings."
good,"I was able to learn to use good supervisory and managerial skills in the Restaurant. Co-workers were easy to get along with.  We strived at excellence with food handling and customer service.  Food handling was awesome, I was overall pleased. The hardest part of the job was handling complaints even though there were few.  "
good,"Serving customers with the best attitude despite the stores limitations of product control. Our employees make do with what we have and make it so the customer does not have to know the hassle we have to go through. Whether it is not having a product ready or in store, to not having the tools to get a certain task done."
good,My days consisted of Managing all aspects of Wendy's.

good,I enjoyed the work at Wendys.The people were great and managment was awesome!
good,I have learned wendy's up and down so I already know what to expect when I come to work no matter what position my manager puts me in for the day. What i learned about management is that it's really challenging but not at all hard work. The co-workers are great and we work very well together. The hardest part of the job is trying to keep the time goal where its supposed to be when we get slammed with customers but its exciting at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we get positive complaintments from the customers. It's a really great experience and it feels awesome when your rewarded for doing your job right.
good,"I loved working at wendy's. The customers were amazing, and the staff worked together as well, it was a very laid back place."

good,I did a respected job as a grillman. I got stuck there. But i tryind to run it fresh not a drawerful of product sitting untill sold or old. I found that they try n give back to the community quite a bit. I like that about wendys
good,Working at Wendy's was a really great experience. A usual day at Wendy's consisted of lots of teamwork and a fast-paced environment. Working there helped me learn to multi-task a bit better and use my time a lot more wisely. The hardest part about the job was remaining calm and moving at a quick pace at all times. The most enjoyable part of the job was challenging myself and learning how to do new things at each station; it was nice working with coworkers and managers who supported me and helped me flourish.
good,Great job just wasnt for me long term.i had a new baby ans that was the reason i left.other then that i would recommend young students the job.if your looking for fast work
good,Wendy’s was my first job and it’s made a lasting impression on me. I loved every second of working at Wendy’s. It helped me grow as a person and as a working individual. Wendy’s has a very laid back atmosphere which makes you feel comfortable. They offer plenty of on the job training as well as videos that teach you how to do pretty much everything. Wendy’s will always have a special place in my heart.
good,Wendy’s is good company they just don’t pay enough or have holiday pay or get bonuses like they used to.. The manager is very good trying to make his employees happy
good,The General Manager and the District manager I worked for were nothing but amazing and understanding. They made the job easier by providing flexibility and allowing me to take on roles out of my comfort zone that allowed me to grow professionally and customer wise.
good,The hardest part was dealing with difficult customers but I manage to satisfy them  and help them with their wants and needs and closing at night having to break down allot of equipment in a reasonable time but I manage to do so.
good,"I met lots of nice people, learned how to manage my time and work as a team. It also helped me gain experience working with food and allowing me to work under pressure, giving myself a challenge. I just need a new challenge since I’ve been there for almost 2 years."
good,Working there was fun and I learned a lot but I needed more money and I want a different job to learn different things and I was hoping chills can help me with that
good,Wendy's is great for setting a base for first time employees. It has future management possibilities and also helps build character in youth. Also teaches youth time management
good,A very simple way of a fast food joint. Very well maintained menu that doesn’t jump all over the place. A very friendly and family oriented staff. We love keeping customers happy
good,I liked working at Wendy's but the downside is that they only worked my 3 days a week working 8 hours a day. I got paid good I made 8.50 an hour and I got paid bi-weekly
good,Enjoyable place for employment.  Every winter was a blessing for some people like myself winters can leave you feeling pretty lonely.  The employees there were mostly holiday friendly for a conversation here nor there.
good,"When I come into my shift, things seemed to be slow and relaxed. Then again, I come in before the dinner rush comes in. I would make sure that everything is filled up as much as possible before I get my first customer. But then the rush comes in and everything would go crazy. It does make time go faster but sometimes, everything just seems to go slower."
good,I started working at Wendy’s when I was 16 I loved it. You get to meet a lot of new people and make not only friends but family. I really enjoyed the environment.
good,"It's very challenging. It's extremely fast paced, you have to have good customer service to be a manager because you deal with some crazy issues almost every day you are at work. But I spend more time at work then I do at home unfortunately."
good,"The work days there where fast pace because it was in a busy location and I had multiple task."
good,Learn more on the cook station. Prepare some chili. Learned more on cleaning the grill station. Mark dates on the chopped up meat that's placed in freezer bags.
good,"Was very nice working as a team "
good,Decent job however the salary is very low for the headache. Overwhelming hours for salary pay and you are required to work at least 50 hours per week minimum. The Store Manager worked less; she always arrived late and went home after 8 hours. SMH
good,My experience working at a Wendy’s was great. The managers and staff were friendly and great to work with. Also they treat all workers with the same respect.
good,"it was a good company to work with, I enjoyed the staff and the management, I enjoyed my hours and the fact that I had a stable job and that I was working for my pay, I enjoyed taking orders and dealing with customers. what I didn't like is how everything was done a certain way and you could not come up with your own way of doing things as I find everyone should have a chance of having an idea or at least being a part of the team meaning you can submit an idea."
good,Everyone helps each other. Doesn't hesitate to jump in and help you learn what you need to know and helps you get the job done. They work with you on your schedule if need be. One of the best places I've ever worked.
good,Wendys is good company to work for when your in high school or college. Its a good starter job to get your feet wet. The pay is ok but u cant live off of it
good,"So what can i say about that wendys well its was a nice fun and great place to work at, the location wasnt half bad being next to wallmart, but thats okay and the supervisors was all great and amazing, if i had it any other way and my life wasnt so bad i would gladly walk back in and work with them for many more years in the future!~"
good,when in a rush we all work as a team to help each other out when we can most of the managers are understanding and they will help you out as well as your other team members when they can
good,"this company gave me my first paycheck at age 16! I was thrilled! I learned a lot regarding handling food, proper hygiene, and customer satisfaction in an upbeat fast pace environment. The skills that this company has taught me helped me thought out my job experience."
good,"I love working as a manager at Wendy’s but, there are no benefits I need a place where there are benefits and more pay. You will love working here at Wendy’s"
good,"Working for Wendy's has been a great and rewarding experience. I have gained so much knowledge of how to manage and run a restaurant. Though, I have learned a great bit, there is still much more knowledge to obtain."
good,I worked for Wendy's nearly the entire time I was in college. At this company I worked from the bottom to the top of the managing chain. I was even offered my own store but at the time I wasn't interested at continuing to work in the restaurant field.I enjoyed it a lot and it taught me how to value your customers as well as your co workers.
good,A typical work day would be getting to work a hour before it up and getting everything set up and prepared for the day to start. Making sure everything is together and clean for the customers. Also making sure everything is kept to part throughout the day and able to maintain a great attitude even when there was a rush.
good,This was my first job and it tought me to manage my time while still in High School. The managment there was great and I learned teamwork was a vital part of making things happen
good,"The overall attitude and community was very welcoming and positive. The experience obviously comes with what would be expected from working at a fast food restaurant. Overall, and good and warm experience."
good,"Clock in, see what tasks for today are far as sales an customers. Cook as needed, prep when time. Releave when needed, take orders pass out orders, make orders. Clean, Cook prep when needed"
good,"Overall environment is a great place very upbeat energy but when  the rushes hit they hit bad and management gets frazzled, customers get taken care of faster thru drive thru faster than front."
good,"Flexible with hours if not in management as proven after working as assistant manager. The pay is too low for the amount of work related stress involved. Fun holiday parties with the opportunity to travel with co-workers (carpool to the party or meetings). Management is very strict on clean shaven appearance and hygiene. No facial hair for males. The company made exceptions for mustaches :)~ I love Wendy's but prefer to be eating the food sitting in front of the fireplaces. Yes, they have those in the Wendy's restaurant chains around here."

good,i can't really say anything about the management or the way the gm  or district ran things they were at a fast work place the only thing i can say bad about the wendys on westrbroad is they employees there let their personal life effect the work environment

good,A typical day at work was a busy day at work. I learned teamwork and different skills needed to work in a fast food restaurant. The management was amazing and the mangers were very hardworking people. The workplace culture was mainly about getting the job done right and fast. The hardest part of the job was to get an order of food done within the fastest amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I learned really good team working skills.
good,if your schedule is a problem they well work with you. co workers very friendly and work area is fun to be around. everyone is helpful to one another.

good,"Wendy;s was a fun place to work for during my tenure there. They were always more than willing to accommodate me by granting any request that I made as far as time off, and they were very accommodating as far as other scheduled needs as well."
good,"faced paced , productive excellent work based learning . it thought me how to handle stressfull situations . communication skills working in a team has approved ."
good,Wendy's is very productive most of the time. I enjoyed taking the customers orders and giving them their correct order.  It's sort of a fast paced half of the time. I enjoyed my time being at Wendy's but I think its time for me to find something new.
good,Management is great very flexable hours works well with school and home life friendly customers nice work place aslways able to pick up shifts or trade shifts
good,There were days I wanted to quit my job on spot and days I wanted to continue striving to be a manager and eventually own a Wendy's or be a general manager.
good,"I’ve always had to come in on time, be dressed in proper uniform, keep my hygiene up, and a smile on my face. But, myself I’ve always had to keep a smile on my face and be nice to everyone in our facility and etc."
good,"You get to meet people in the process of working 9-5 shifts, the days are long and stressful but satisfying. The people are great and so is the environment. They make you pay for your own food though even though they throw it away."
good,"On a typical day at work, I preheated the oven, and cooked bacon for about 2 hours. Some days I did Outside Clean up. I broke up Cardboard and Put them in the recycling bin. Sometimes before Lunch I would get on the fry station and make fries chicken strips and chicken nuggets. After lunch I cooked more bacon,  swept and mopped floors in the kitchen and took garbage and recycling out to bins. "
good,Very enjoyable and a great way to learn basic people and hard work skills. Can be a great first job for anyone with or without high school diploma. Helpful way to meet many different types of people.
good,Wendy's is a great place when in school just to get a head start in the work force. One of the General Managers helped teach me to act correct and like a adult. Great places for a first job.
good,i liked this job because the management was great and coworkers was excellent. The managers treated the employees like how an employee should be treated.
good,Wendy’s was my first job. I was a bout 17 years old and I learned a lot there. This job was fun and worth it. They paid me well I was a hard worker and developed new skills.
good,It was great got treated like family and got alot of hours. Food is excellent and the crew members was very respectful and helpful when i needed them.
good,"Most days were the same, but everyone worked together. We all had our jobs and together made the restaurant run as it should. Everyone was considerate and understanding."
good,When you needed help they got you help. The district managers were out for themselves but us mangers helped each other out. Overall good company and good people.
good,"My experience at Wendy’s was pretty great , I had plenty team member to help me out during training and help me learn a lot of things . I’m a really hard worker and I do my best with a smile on my face . I love helping others as well if needed ."

good,"Wendy was a wonderful job.  There work environment was excellent.  There security wasn't the best but we were secured.  The pay was great. you earn what you will get paid.  The managers were most of the time on there A game, they followed all the rules and the work place was great."
good,I really liked most of my managers that worked at Wendy's because not only were they flexible but they were also kind. The only problem I really had with Wendy's was the hours.
good,"they are a minimum wage based company, but value their workers. they will work around your schedule for shift schedules, and are overall a friendly work environment."
good,"The location I had worked at was very poorly understaffed, so I ended up picking up a lot of the slack. It was easy going sometimes, like in the mornings and during the nights but the lunch and dinner time rushes were just outrageously difficult, especially with several less crew members then would normally be required. However, they did keep raises coming, and paid myself, and my co-workers incredibly well."
good,Could be better and j don't know what else to say about it but I just think it can be ran better and there should be repercussions for no calls and no shows.
good,"The management was good, they provided lots of support to the crew members. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning different positions. I overall enjoyed working with the Wendy's company."
good,Loved working there. The atmosphere was pretty welcome. Everyone is willing to help one another. I loved how well we got a long. It can be hard especially on busy hours and you have to keep a quick pace
good,it was productive and organized. the staff was very helpful and kind. it was very team oriented. i enjoyed working there. the managment there was good.
good,Wendys is a good place I plan on keeping that job and adding another. They can be very flexible and there are several locations you can rotate within the company.
good,"At Wendy's, most of the crew was very stressed out and some didn't even work together, but for the most part, it was good. Some of the managers there were nice and very easy to work with while others didn't run the store correctly"
good,"Poor management, poor hourly pay, poor benefits, horrible workplace and very drama-filled & stressful environment to work in overtime effecting well-being."

good,its very fast and friendly work place. i have learned to be a good manager the teach very well. they pay there employees and management fairly. the hardest part about the job is managing turn over and labor
good,I loved working here. It was a great first job especially for someone still in school. I do miss working here but due to living situations i had to leave and they no longer do rehires.
good,"My experience at Wendy's was a good time. I created many memories there, with plenty of my coworkers I created a bond with some, who I still keep in contact with as of this very day. My problem with management, was certain people were underpaid who actually put in the same amount of effort every day at work. Complete favoritism, and if the distract manager and big bosses showed up, is when they would come and get you to work harder just to make them look good. I would have preferred everyone had been treated equally fair and everyone gotten an opportunity to grow within the company. But that's not what happened, and life goes on."
good,I enjoyed working for this company. The manager was nice and friendly. I enjoyed working with my crew. Everyone was nice and helpful and made coming to work a pleasurable experience. Overall I enjoyed working for Wendy's.
good,on my natural day i would be working in the lobby or i would be working in the window. i loved it. working there made my day 10 times better. the mangers were all ways able to tell when any of there employees need to talk or needing to take a brake
good,Allegan Wendys has decent hours. semi well maintained. crew members are easy to get along with. fast-paced but easy work. smiles on all customers faces.
good,A typical day at work is pleasing the customers and making sure they are happy. I learned how to work together as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the smile on a customers face and knowing that they are satisfied.
good,Co-workers were friendly and always a joy to work with.  Managers always set us straight and helped us when we needed it. I learned a lot about hard work and friendship.
good,"The hard part of the job was that I would always be taking orders and customers would complain about there order or some of the time the customers would put an attitude with us and we couldn't say none back in order of respect towards the company. My co-workers are fun to work with also the managers, but the only thing i didn't like was that i would work a lot of hours and my pay was less."
good,I worked there when I was a kid but it teaches you a lot. Wendys was fun and exciting and it brings you all your customer services out of you. It's the best kid jobs I have ever had.
good,I liked how fast paced and the job was. I also enjoyed that I had a set schedule so I can always plan something ahead of time. It was a fun and free spirited environment.
good,The Wendy's I worked for was one big family. We always had each others back and almost never had a stressful shift. We had holiday parties and everything I miss working there.
good,Typical work day includes making food and serving customer. People are typically friendly. Rush hours were quick paced but no big deal. Management are considerate.
good,"This was probably my favorite job, the managers were great and the job was very easy. Enjoyed working with people and food. The only downside of this job was very poor work ethic, and very high employee turnover rate."
good,I enjoyed working there. I always had fun while at Wendys and always made the best of it. Management needs to be better. But overall A GREAT PLACE TO WORK.
good,I opened in the morning for Wendys and it was awesome by the time the store opened at 10 am it was not long before the lunch rush came. Our store manager was an awesome man that loved to laugh just as much as we did. Though we got our jobs done and fast we still had time to laugh which made the day go by so much faster.
good,"It's one of the best fast food companies to work for. I love the fact that everyone stays in position, which makes everybody's job more easier. Team work is a big impact at wendy's."
good,"It was a very good job for a minimum wage standards. It was clean and routine was key. I have worked there for one year and I loved my job till I moved. you always have to remember B.L.A.S.T Believe, Listen, Apologize, Satisfy, Thank. the job is very fast pace and sometimes you would be bombarded with guests."
good,"Always waiting on customers, cleaning and stocking. The hardest part of that job is when the rush hours would hit and we would be short staffed so there for we had to pick up slack. Overall it was a very good crew that I worked with we all put in our part to make it a good day whether it was or not."
good,"it was great"
good,i did not work ther long enough to give a lengthy evaluation as i relocated before i was even up for a raise with the company even thought i was offered a better position to stay
good,The main reason I loved working for Wendy's is the fast pace. There was never a time it wasn't busy witch made the day go by so fast. I worked from the bottom all the way to management.
good,Good place to work got along with co workers it was just to far to travel other than that it was a job learn much about fast food if you need to anything else contact me

good,"This was a good place to work . Th workers was friendly , helpful and they were easy to get along with. The managers made sure all the workers was comfortable and made sure that everyone was taken care of especially the customers ."
good,It gets a lil hectic from time to time but in all its still a nice enviroment to be in. Flexiable schedule. Only thing i didnt like is being under paid.
good,none ok its was fun while I was there working fun days good times some days I had my ups and downs but money move me in the right way and drive me to be my own person
good,"you show up wearing the provided uniform. the boss talk to you and you get to work "
good,"Typical day would be, taking drive thru orders all while helping other employees, and tending to customers. I did almost everything here every day. It was also very fast paced.v"
good,I like working at wendys you meet new faces you can help people with what they need and all its about to is team work if you don't have that its impossible to work.
good,wendys is a great fast food restraunt there flexible with your home life especially if you were in school and they will help you move up in the company. it a pretty fun place every one is cool with each other. this job help me to be more confident in my self and to believe in myself. I enjoyed hanging out with the asscociates and building a relationship. the hardest part of the job was when we get hit bus load of people like football teams or church
good,"Working fast food is not easy, especially when working in a busy part of town. You get a lot of rude customers and occasional work place drama but how your day went depended on the management and attitude of fellow coworkers. I had managers that cared about the staff and coworkers that cared about doing a good job. With that much support in the workplace, you hardly remember the rude customers that come through."
good,"I was pregnant while I worked there, so I left when I had my baby. I had a lot of health issues during my pregnancy and the management did a great job accommodating for me."
good,"Most days are fast-paced and continuously busy handling restaurant services and guests. I""ve learned how to manage, count, and organizing money, how to handle stressful situations and how to problem-solve. The place itself is very open, outgoing, and an adapting environment. The hardest part of the job is keeping guests happy with what it is available to me and the easiest if making friends within my coworkers and having a wonderful environment to work in."
good,It is a nice and calming work but at times it can be very stressful with having to work fast pace but other than that it is really fun the hardest part about the job is when you're yelled it it gets hard to focus cause you mess up the work place culture is really nice it feels like a home the fun part about the job is meeting new people and the management was ok
good,"Working and managing in this workplace was always fun. Being able to lead a team on a shift can be challenging but when it's all said and done, rewarding. Had to be fast paced and a team player in order to get the job done"
good,Wendy's was an up to speed restaurant. The company was busy every five to ten seconds straight. Everything was fresh and ready. One restaurant I know with good speed of service is Wendy's.
good,"Wendy's gave me an opportunity, and that's all I needed. I love that everyday is going to be filled with challenges no day is exactly the same. Fun fast paced environment."
good,"I was lucky enough to work for a store with a great management team. I worked hard, worked my way up three positions, and then learned valuable knowledge about what it takes to run an business."
good,I loved working with my boss she made all us feel like we were family and even we had sad days and hard work problems we always made away to make everybody happy even if they were made. The food was excellent doing the day shift hours I think the night crew needs a little attention but overall its a great place to be.
good,I made sure people get there order in a fair manner I cleaned stocked and prepared for the day . We commonly try to sale more to assure that the guest wants to come back
good,"Working for Wendy's allow me to develop my management skills more. A typical work day kept  me busy from the time I entered the store to begin preparing it for opening to the time my shift ended shortly after a lunch rush. I learned quite a bit working here. I learned about inventory, placing product orders, managing staff, maintaining equipment and much more. I also leading as a manager by setting the example. You have many different cultures coming together to work at one place and you learn about those cultures. The hardest part of the job was getting others to take the job as seriously as you do but the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to interact with co-workers and customers."
good,I loved working there but had to go back home and took care of my brother who had cancer if they would hire me back I would love working for them how to make sandwichs learning was great

good,"I enjoyed my time with the Wendy's corporation. I was well staffed, and well organized to meet the challenges each day. I learned a lot about how to successfully operate a restaurant, anywhere from the day to day operations, to scheduling, to inventory control, to hiring, etc. management was inconsistent and sometimes frustrating, they kept taking all the decent managers and moving them to different stores, leaving me with mainly the weak one's. The workplace culture was good, I trained my team to work together to achieve a common goal. The hardest part of the job was constantly changing shifts. It was very hard to close one night, and then turn around and open the next. I enjoyed working with people and seeing them excell at the jobs they were being trained to do."
good,They are willing to teach you in other areas and always looking to promote. Most of the time they are short handed though and so promotion is there. You just have to be willing to go for it.

good,It's a fast paced work environment with  a lot of things going on around you. Everyone is friendly and glad to help others out. The training was very simplistic and it is more of a hands on experience.
good,I was a team member so I helped people. I also cleaned and stocked when I needed to. The best part of the job was being able to help people and make sure that they would always want to come back.

good,"I really enjoyed my time at this company. I just wish the pay was better, which it probably is by now. The managers were compassionate toward the employees."
good,I worked there for almost four years. It was my first job ad it was a pretty good place to work its a lot like being in high school again the popular kids have their own group and run the place. The owner is pretty great but its hard to advance and theirs no benefits unless youre a manager then you can pay for your own insurance that mark offers
good,There's a lot of energy in the air when you work for the Wendy's company because not only are people there to make money they are there have fun and provide excellent customer service
good,Wend's is a fast paste environment you have yo be able to multitask. its all about making sure our gust hare happy and satisfied without service. managers are great they give breaks if you want one they are very involved with all of out crew members. The mos enjoyable part about working at Wendy's is that they work around your schedule and my team is grate we all help each other.
good,Great place to work great people clean environment great customers but not enough hours for a single parent but also needs a cleaning up to date on dining room area
good,"I worked here for awhile and absolutely loved it! The costumers are nice and so are the employs. I usually showed up and counted my cash, then would log into the comuputer and start taking orders."
good,"In all honesty, Working at Wendy's was one of my favorite jobs not just because the work, but with the people I worked with. At that job I was working anywhere from 30 hours to possibly more over the weekend. I was looking for more hours as a part time high school student. This job was my first job and it helped me build working structure and variety in the work force. progressing was always nice, the managers that trained me were amazing people only making me enjoy the work more"
good,Wendy's was the very first place that taught me how to deal with diverse customers in different situations in many levels. Wendy's is a very fun work place with very organized co-workers.
good,The manager was predjust so that's where we didnt get along but other than that its a job i needed it because i had a son to take care of but other that that it was ok
good,I loved my job there but had differences with the store manager and her decision to employ her son. Treated everyone else different and had a hard time running a store alone being head in charge.
good,"I'm thankful that Wendy's has given me opportunity to work, along with the good relationship/ environment that I have with me co-workers and customers."

good,Everyone seems to be really nice and friendly. Fun work environment. Not the hardest job. Its good for a first job. Management is good very flexible hours so you don't get stressed with personal life.
good,A typical day for work at Wendy's in Foley. I would say its a restaurant in a tourist area if you know how that mixes together then you know what I'm getting at. It has days where we are slow all day then days were you begging to get a break.
good,I loved the customers and co workers they gave you up most respect they treated you kind we all was a family everyone helped each other.I closed I opened I never complained about nothing my schedule was awesome and flexible I was able to learn and was able to grow with the company we all was a big team leader to each and everyone we all were a team.
good,"wendy's was a nice working experience, the managers were friendly and made sure we did our job when some might slack and made sure everything was clean, and given the chance i'd work there again"
good,I love working at my job. My managers are the greatest and most caring people I know. My coworkers are just as awesome. A typical day at Wendy's consist of getting yelled at by customers for giving them what they ordered but then get told its wrong. It also consists of seeing the everyday customers I've come to know and love. The hardest part of the job is definitely the rude customers and trying to keep your cool without telling them that they're wrong. But the best part of the job is my favorite customers coming through. I've learned a lot in the three years I've worked at wendys. When I started I was afraid to talk to people. I had social anxiety so it was hard for me to open up. Now I talk to all of the customers with no hesitation. I wouldn't have wanted any other first job.
good,I loved Wendy's. It was a great first job. Its fast pace. They were the for job to give me a chance regardless of experience. They're also cooperative with school schedules and family issues. Great overall experience.
good,"Though upper level management may be a bit clueless, at the Restaurant level the quality of life is fantastic. The restaurant doesn't open early for breakfast and does not stay open late at night so there are no crazy early hours and no crazy late nights."
good,"Wendy's was close, easy and a cool job . I had to learn all of the different stations, which i caught on to fast, and excelled. I would recommend Wendy's."
good,Wendy's is a great company for entry level job seekers. Wendy's is a face paced environment that requires skill and patience. The customer are pleasant and I enjoy my job

good,"The management at Wendy's in Williamston, NC is great. The employess are very nice and everyone works as a team to prepare orders. The hardest part on the job is making sandwiches because everything has to be so precise."

I sometimes opened and others days I closed. So it depended on the job at hand that day. I liked running the register and drive thru. They were 2 of my favorite things to do. The hardest part was closing making sure everything was cleaned right and sometimes they were long nights. The most enjoyable was talking to the customers and making new friends.

Working with older employees as well as younger ones"

good,"An organized and productive company, management helps and works with you on your weakest positions, co-workers will correct you if you need to be reassured.

Most enjoyable part is being one of the team leaders and being the person to help train new workers."
good,"i work with food all day everyday . make sandwiches . take orders , greet ppl . also i would clean my station constantly. management worked with me a lot give me enough hours and more when i needed them . my co-workes were very friendly and cool i still speak to most today."

I enjoyed working with customers and making sure they are provided with the right service that they are receiving."
good,It was very interesting to work for Wendy's. The experience was a good one. Management kept the ball rolling and always had a personal connection with their customers. The hardest part of the job was to me having to leave on the terms that I did. the most enjoyable pat was seeing smiling faces to brighten your day EVEN when u was feeling down.
good,The management makes or breaks this job and the management when I worked there went above and beyond for everyone. This job can definitely keep you busy.
good,"Despite the fact that our AC was constantly on the fritz, I really enjoyed the fast paced environment and friendly staff. They were always eager to train whoever was willing to learn, to move up in the company."
good,Not enough hours if your trying. To get your own place. But love that i have a set schedule. Learned the sandwiches. Fast and its not hard. Its a card with the sandwiches. If you ever forget.
good,"a typical day at Wendy's include you clocking in, your manager talking you into your position. whether its cash register, fries, grill, or sandwiches. different times of the day depending on your location it'll get busy then slow down. the whole crew is required to help out. if drive thru is busy everybody help drive thru, if the dining room is busy everyone is required to help out dining room. you get a 30 minute break with a 30% meal discount."
good,Wendy`s has been a fast paced environment stay busy. It could be unorganized at times with managers and the crew members. I love all my co-workers I was working there for 3 years learned ever position besides the managers. The only hard part about the job is nobody liked to work as a team from time to time and the enjoyable part is when the day is going by smooth and everyone is doing their job the correct way and pleasing all the customers.
good,"I was the general manager at Wendys. I started out as a shift manager then was put in as a general manager about 8 months of working there. I had and awesome district manager that taught me a lot. The store was a very poorly rated store when I started but me and my other managers work hard to get it up to be a training store, we were very proud of it. They then transfer our district manager to the other store on the south side of the state and brought on another manager. She was very unfriendly and actually told me she didn't care for me cause I was weak for crying when our old manager left. I'm a softy what can I say. She then took me out of my store and sent me to a worse store after all the hard work I did. I then turned in a months notice and left."
good,"I have worked for Wendy's five years ago, I started as crew and I met amazing employees and just the over all place was very relaxed and calm. It's a great place for a first job. I ended up leaving that place to further and expand my experience for customer experience and ended up going back to Wendy's this past year, I became management and was able to take on responsibility and coach and train crew how to properly do something that is productive and encourage them to get the job done fast and and accurately."
good,"Constant cleaning dishes, taking customer orders, cooking fries and checking temperature on ovens."
good,"Training Training Training, Working in different environments. Love at the end of the day seeing the smiles on myco-workers and team"
good,My favorite part of this job was my customers. I love being able to talk to customers on a daily basis & get to know them on a personal level.
good,Definitely working at Wendy's there is nothing typical about working there. The moment you clock into work you never know what happen. You never know what kinds of costumers will come in nor what the costumers attitudes will be like that. Working for Wendy's there are a lot of laughs and sometimes a lot tears. Wendy's become your second family honestly.
good,"When I first joined their team it was very fun and friendly, I liked going to work everyday, with all the different skill levels that are present it always motivated me to become greater and successful. I worked and worked, and showed how reliable I am and my motivation allowed me to succeed no matter what the stress is, weather it's just a difficult customer or something outside of work, I just would keep focused and eventually my hard work showed and became higher position that I worked hard at."
good,"I was what you call a super team member. I did anything and everything at that job with no questions asked. I learned that with hard work you can make your way to the top. My management was top notch and our Wendy's was rated number one for a time being. My co-workers were a family to me and some still work there. The hardest part of the job was rush hour, we would get hundreds of orders by the hour and have to complete them in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was my team, we were definitely like a family and they made working awesome for me."
good,"The job of a crew member is not only to cook, clean, and take orders. Our main focus was to ensure our customers were comfortable and satisfied. I definitely learned the meaning of a fast pace work environment! You must be quick and on top of things. The management always ensured the time to help when busy, help with customer issues and satisfaction. The co-workers are the best part! My fellow crew members were easy to work with and pulled their own weight, ensuring the fulfillment of their tasks. The hardest part is when we would have a super long line, but can only take so many orders. The sandwich makers can only make so many at a time and it is a challenge to try to ensure you don't overload them. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the people I worked with. Even if a job is tough, you can persevere with a little positive nudge."
good,"My typical day at work would to take care of the whole front. Cleaning the lobby, taking orders, and interacting with customers. I learned how to value the money i earned and what it meant to work hard for a pay check. Management wise it was your typical set up. The managers hated their job just as much as the workers but the managers didn't have to work as hard by diffusing the work. My co-workers were fun to be around and I connected with each of them in a different way. The hardest part of my job getting enough hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting the very unusual customers I had each day."
good,A typical day at work was fine until that one customer is not satisfied with staff.
good,"I am sure this is not true of all Wendy's restaurants but when I worked there, it was horrible. Management was all but non existent. There were constant arguments and harassment towards both towards me and other female workers."
good,I operated the cash register a couple times but my main job was to be the front sandwich maker. I assembled sandwiches in 10 secs or less most of the time. I also gathered fries and nuggets for customer's orders. I baked the bacon and prepared salads for the day. I cleaned the lobby and gathered trays and also helped with some dish washing.
good,Well working in this restaurant was awesome I meet a lot of people cooking food greeting with a smile following customers orders I have worked for this company and established a good relationship with the staff there
good,"Helping the customers and preparing tables, food orders, drinks/shakes, dining room area and accessories; was all very fun actually! I had good long hours and a lot of fun assisting the Wendy's team and customers. Great job for a young hard working person."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is focusing on the customer.
good,"Wendys is all about customer satisfaction. I've learned to prepare how to be a fast sandwhich maker and cash handling. Co-workers were generous yet having me keep up with the speed of doing so. The hardest part maybe was remembering the menu itself, yet and still I enjoyed seeing the customers happy at every dine-in"
good,Doing multiple things at once. a lot of moving around. No task was too difficult
good,"it was hard a first, but it became easy later on, mangers always was rude"
good,"a typical day at Wendy's was fun. we always had fun but did our job. I learned how to deal with people."
good,"A typical day at Wendy's is getting there on time, clocking in and getting busy. I start cooking the bacon and preparing the sandwich stations. While bacon is cooking the front freezers get stocked with chicken, the meat wells and the fry bin are filled, chili is made and put on, and I start filling sauces and start the potatoes.  With just two hours to complete my tasks, I have to manage my time wisely. Upon opening I run the front counter taking orders, make change, build orders, and operate drive-thru computer. When more crew members arrive and we get busier my responsibilities are more limited to answering headset and taking drive-thru orders.  I also prepare drinks and hand orders out. Stocking and cleaning are important parts of my duties and I make sure my area is ready to go for the next shift operator.  Any time my area is slow I go assist other crew members in their areas as needed."
good,i worked with a well group of co-workers and learned to make friends with thegood envirementm my best time there was working with my co-workers
good,I would prepare the store and crew for open. Teamwork  Some managers want to play more than work hard. Co-workers don't stay around long.  Dealing with difficult customers.  Making customers happy.
good,"wendys is a great place to work ! vary fast paced,and fun.they just dont pay employees very well for the work they expect! i would still work there if not for such poor pay!"
good,Working at Wendy's was a learning and growing experience. Every day you are on your feet and busy. There is always something to do even when you are slow such as cleaning and setting up your station. Working with the co-workers was a very rewarding experience to grow a bond with those people. The hardest part of the job was working weekends and having no lunch break. The most enjoyable part was meeting and seeing new people come in everyday and conversing with them.
good,"Bad location for a lot of stores !!! Loved working for the company , got robed at gun point DM didn't really care so I left"
good,the people that work at wendy's are very friendly and are fast paced and have good communication skills
good,fast food making burgers it was my first job but i have no regrets i learned the meaning of hard work.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of ensuring customers were happy and taken care of in a timely manner, and everyone had to work together to make sure everything went smoothly. Management and coworkers were friendly and easy to work with. The hardest part of the job was keeping up in the busiest part of the day, when I was the only cashier up front. I still managed to deal with every customer and get their orders out in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the satisfaction of happy customers."
good,"a fun place to work"
good,"cashier "
good,A wrong order was packed due to quality control's mistake.Then I realized in the morning shift that in the night shift wrong order is made i.e different color of bottles were packed.I open up all the packages and do not ship them.And I also do not grind that order because may be in future that order will be used.So I put that in the back plant.So in that way I do not harass the customer as well as company.
good,"Wendys was a great place to work during my time there, I know a lot has changed especially after Arbys bought them out. This company had great opportunities at one point. not sure how things are now."
good,"A typical day was constant rush. Thousands of tourists and tons of prep. I learned how to handle cash, how to work with employees and tourists, and how to learn and work at a fast pace. The management was pretty outstanding. Most co-workers were friendly and made it really fun to work their. I've made life-long friends. The hardest part of the job was when you get customers who don't speak English. It's hard, but somehow there's always a way to get the order correct.The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was fast-paced. The day goes by smoothly, and you get quite a workout. Co-workers also made day-to-day work enjoyable."
good,"Managing 26 employees is fun."
good,i would like to work there again if they do have an opeing i would like to work in the area again
good,"Well a typical day at wendy's starts with clocking in and being polite to every one of my co-workers asking how everyone's doing. Seeing my co-workers smiling and working hard puts a smile on my face and makes the start of my shift pleasant. I've learned customer's always come first, if im having a bad day it never shows i continue to work and smile. I've learned hard work comes a long way and my co-workers help me build the work skills i need as myself. I seen from my managers that managing the restaurant can be stressful so its up to us co-workers to work smoothly and do our job's to make the work place successful. The hardest part of working at wendy's would be dealing with an angry customer while we were super busy but the situation was always resolved in a calm and satisfying manor. The most enjoyable part of working here would be gaining work skills and also gaining friendships with your team worker's, working in general is a great accomplishment in life."
good,I was honestly thrilled to begin working with my mom. I learned how to read people working at Wendy's. My management on the other hand the GM was always rude to us. Never gave a compliment to anyone. I feel like in the work place it shouldnt b a hostile environment. In there it felt like a war zone. This honestly became the worst job I ever had. I would return under different management. I was told that I would recieve a quarter raise and only recieved
good,"I would work at night.  I would take orders, run fries, make sandwiches, or clean the dining room.  I learned how to work in a fast pace environment and multi task.  I loved my manager at this job.  He was great with us and would have contest and reward us for stuff.  I got along good with the co-workers, you almost have to because your in such a small work space.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up in a rush and everyone working as a team.  I loved that we could have fun after the rush as we are cleaning and catching stuff up."
good,"star opening my register ,taking orders from happy customers"
good,a manager that cares about his employees and acctually doing work instead of sitting in the office
good,The environment was very great and provided a great work experience.
good,The management is amazing and they work with your schedule. A typical work day for me was like this: I arrived at work earlier in the morning around 9:30 they allowed you to go on break. The managment as well as your fellow crew members made the job easy and gave it a productive but yet fun environment. The hardest part about the job was leaving the great people behind. I enjoyed meeting new people and interacting with the customers.
good,"i really enjoyed working at Wendy's but I had to take the bus to work every time."
good,would work there again enjoyed my hours and co workers hardest part was cleaning frosty machine

good,"A typical day for me at this particular job was very busy"

good,"A typical day at work consisted of grill operation, and costumer service. I learned the all the responsibilities of a crew person. Management was some what good. My fellow co-workers are friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of my job was being able to keep up with the pace of the restaurant. The best part of the job was providing quality service to all customers."
good,"My typical day at work was when I came in I was to take orders and prepare there drinks and etc. Clean the dining room. Swipe floors, wipe off table and chair legs, maintain to have bathrooms clean. Make sure my area was clean and stocked for any type of rush hour. I was also helping with drive thur when I was not busy in the dining room. "
good,"I loved working at Wendy's. It was a great atmosphere to be in. Our crew supported one another as well as management. Being at Wendy's I  have learned more patient, verbal, happy and friendly, courteous, I am able to work fast past, great under pressure, and even gotten better at math. The hardest thing I had to deal with working at Wendy's was the customers sliding their money across the counter and then holding out their hands for their change or credit cards back. I felt so disrespected and there isn't a policy for this nor does anyone try to make one but despite this issue I absolutely love my customers! They are from all different walks of life and I love meeting new people."
good,Everyday was a test to yourself to see how well you would perform on a job. Either by learning a new process or doing better at the process you already knew. Upper management challenged us to be a more effective team by discussing our concerns with different processes and receiving feedback from one another.
good,You start in the position they assinged for you that morning or afternoon.  You stay in that position until someone comes and releases you.  Customers come first. Customers are always right and we assist them in whatever they need.
good,"Typical days for me can either include working the Drive-Thru window, grill, or occasionally the sandwich stations. I have learned how to deal with customers of all kinds and managing many tasks at the same time as to keep up with the demand of the store. The hardest part of this job has to be the fluctuation of the ""rush"", or the height of store operations. How to prepare for them and then react when they happen."
good,it was a good experience supervisors were awesome. I learned to be very patient. hardest part was when the customers were not happy. the most enjoyable part was working and having the customer happy. 
good, It was a fast-paced job. The customers were great. There was a good work ethic.
good,"I liked working at Wendy's. Nice breaks, and fun environment. "
good,"- A typical day would be come in eat and get to work but during work we would crack jokes, laugh, and listen to music, which helped the day go by."
good,"-Usually a working day multi-tasking, which are done in eight hours, salads, and manage grila for cooking meats and prepare the burgers a day."
good,I learned how to do tasks a bit more faster. I had to take orders and make sure their food is coming at a fast rate as possible. The hardest was to take orders when their is a large crowd and I was the only one working at the cash register. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I get to know my co-workers on a more personal and professional level.
good,During the early morning the pace is normally slow though when 11am comes around it is a fast pace workplace. I enjoyed working with the customers and getting the food out as fast and accuracy as possible. I worked every shift and night seemed to be the best because of the pace though towards the end of the night it slowed down quite a bit. After it slowed down people started to go home earlier and a lot of cleaning was added to the shift to get ready for the next day.
good,-A Day at Wendys was very fast paced
good,"Wendys was a great place to work. lots of fun, i learned that not all bosses are dicks. the management was good. the staff and i got along great and i made friends with them fast.the hardest part of the job would have to be keeping track of time and keeping on schedual and the most enjoyable part is its a pretty lax job"
good,"Coming to work on time and helping my customers, making thier food and see a smile on they face. I learned a lot of communcation skills, ll my mangers loved me and i loved them to. My co-workers was fun and easy to get alone with. Hard part was unhappy customers."

The most enjoyable part of the job was providing excellent customer service."
good,I like working there but there was no room to move up in the company.

good,"Every day was never a slow one, very fast and multi tasking was a must. Food safety, customer service and quality food was top priority. I learned to run this business from the ground up. Budgeting down to cleaning. Safety guidelines were always followed. My co-workers respected me and i respected them, i made sure i did the same jobs as them to show example. The hardest part of the job was making sure the store was perfection. The most enjoyable part was succeeding this perfection as a team."

good,"My hours slowed down a lot over time which caused me to look for new work but otherwise it was a great place to work at and as someone with very little experience, it is a great place to start at"
good,"Overall, Wendy’s is a terrific work experience. I grew a close and personal relationship with my co-workers, customers, and managers. It saddens me that I will be seeing less of them, because I will miss them. There is a lot of work, but it is indeed worth the struggle."

good,I loved working there and would go back given the chance. The team is very tight knit and it was easy to feel like I was one of them. The staff is all very fun to work with and there weren't many instances of me not being in a good mood at work because of the people I was around.

good,"Wendy's was my first Job and for a fast food restaurant it thought me a lot. I learned great customer service skills, and how to work under presser when it busy, how to coordinate well with my team work."
good,The hardest part about this job is keeping a set schedule cause you always had people calling out and doing no calls no shows. The hardest part about this job is finding good workers that’s willing to work and not just trying to get a new pair Jordan’s.

good,Wendy’s was a cool job to work at I work night shift there but one thing about Wendy’s the  customers don’t stop coming until closing...................
good,"A typical day at Wendy's I would go in put the stock up that was left the night before. then we clean the fryers and fill them up.

I miss working there and I really loved working there. They kept  morale at a high."

good,A typical day at work for me sending each customers out with a wonderful experience. I’ve learned that you got to have more patience than usually.workplace. Upturned to me is steady but yet fulfilling. The hardest part of the day is hearing a customer talk about their bad experience.the most enjoyable is when a customer complains about something so small but you kill them with kindness

good,It is great for teenagers that want to start off somewhere. It is very much relaxed but I wouldnt recommend it for older people because it is very fast paced during luch hours
good,very professional . it just was not enough money for me. I have 36 children and it just was not money to support us. The hour was great . staff was excellent and customer service was great
good,the best place to work friendly all way around management knows what they are doing employee's all good costumers are regulars just a blast to work there
good,"Always smile be friendly with customers be fast but be right with your orders work as a team be a team player "
good,"Good management "
good,My opinion is that Wendy's is an awesome job management was good they gave me good hours I would not have left if we didn't move I was working on a promotion at the time so I totally recommend them

good,It was a fun place to work i enjoyed working at Wendy’s . I gave good customer service and when i was working as the cook there weren’t any problems with the food i didn’t get any complaints everybody knew who i was just from me being a nice crew member. I worked everyday from 5:00p.m until 1:00a.m up until i was 8months pregnant. 65 hours every two weeks.
good,People are very kind to show you how things are done.
good,Wendy's was where I really learned how to step up and take a leadership role in the work place. Wendy's showed me how to hold my work and those around me to a higher standard and how to encourage those around me to also push themselves to that standard.

good,I love working at Wendy's I think they treat you well. I hope to stat with wendys for a long time just want to relocate  and learn more management positions

The establishment was always clean. There was always consistent teamwork throughout the day no matter what shifts were being worked.
good,"On a typical day at Wendy's, its pretty fast paced no matter the time of the day.Customers are understanding and the staff is friendly to each other and helpful. Managers are always ready to help with any issue a customer has."
good,As the General Manager a typical day would include preparing the staff for the fast paced delivery of quality food. Wendys was my stepping stone for leaning the basics of business etiquette. The culture was built on Quality Service and Cleanliness. When delivering food to customers within 15 seconds for the dining area and 30 seconds for the drive thru while maintaining a friendly atmosphere was the core of the workplace culture. The hardest part of the job was the lunch and dinner rushes and the most enjoyable was the recognition received by the customer and upper management.
good,I enjoyed working with my colleagues they were very helpful and always made it a fun workplace to be at. The work pace was face especially during lunch time but we always had satisfied  customers.
good,A typical workday could be stressful but it was fast paced and was a great place to work and offered great hours and even worked with school scheduling.
good,Working for wendys was a good experience. I felt like family to my coworkers and everyone is helpful. Fast food requires a lot of teamwork and we did just that.
good,"Can be very relaxed and simple, but mainly very busy and you have to multitask. Management is great to work with, and very respectful to everyone and their hours that they want, and you are always able to move up"
good,A very high paced stressful environment but the co workers working together made it a good kind of stressful like after its finished and the drive thru paper prints and you counted the cards and your time. Makes it worth it lol sometimes
good,"I worked at Wendy’s for about 4 months, it was a fun work place for sure. It’s definitely less busy or slower work pace then McDonalds. But at times it does get busy, you also learn a lot working here, such as again communication, and work skills."
good,Interacted with customers while taking their order and helped promote a positive image for Wendy’s through excellent customer service. l Controlled the cash register and balanced cash drawer at the start and end of daily shift. Helped maintain the restaurant through daily clean-up procedures.
good,"This place gave me plenty of advancement and a good pay rate for the work that I did. I worked washing dishes, then got promoted to two different positions in less than a few weeks."
good,Working at Wendy's made me a better worker. I learned social skills. And more hard working skills. I worked fast paced with my co workers. I was pushed to better myself everyday. The management was excellent always cared for their customers and employees.
good,I loved working at wendy’s i just didn’t like the fact that they didn’t give me no hours to work . Barely put me on the schedule.  The place was clean had fast workers and everything . It was just hours .
good,wendy was a good enviroment for young adults to work i learn how to book certian things while i was there although i wish i could have learn but i manage to use what i learn when i left to my next adventure
good,"on a regular day I would go into the job put my stuff in the back wash my hands and start working I would stock anything that needs to be stocked or restock , I also cooked different foods such as fries , chicken nuggets, or in the back making salads , cleaning dining room and most importantly helping customers leave or eat inside satisfied"
good,"When I first got the job it was very confusing at first, but then I caught on as time flew by. There was still some stuff I didn't understand, or forgot how to do something but I asked for helped or someone would correct me. A typical day at work for me was decent. While I was working there I learned a few things and there are the following: Dealing with different people, how to work with people, understanding the food industry, learning how to take orders, and how to close the lobby. The hardest part of the job is not understanding what someone is saying in their order. The most enjoyable part of the job is coming to work to show off my smile and to make customers leave with a bright smile on their face. Another enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and getting to learn more cool things everyday."
good,"What can I say, it's fast food. It was fast paced and I worked with and supervised a lot of teenagers. They were polite and learned very quickly so they were easy to train. The customers were usually kind but you almost always encounter one rude person who's never satisfied. It can be rough if you're lazy and unmotivated."
good,"The employer was structured in their expectations of employees. One had to train on all material pertaining to every detail of the job to ensure their yearly raise, and amount therefore. When an employee worked hard, they would earn opportunities to move up."
good,Great fresh food . Depending on your staff it can be a very team influence environment and a great customer service opportunity. You are paid very well considering in the fast food industry .
good,"Everyday was a very busy day for my coworkers and I. There were many different attitudes daily. The hardest part, in the beginning, was keeping a fast pace, but overall I had a fun experience."
good,we always stayed busy which definitely made the days go by faster. i learned how to multi task all the time. the job made me feel more confident while dealing with customers.
good,better pay and more jobs with in the business to help the crew to better the story help kinds outside get job and learn more about job and how to make money
good,A great place to get an experience dealing with people. Co workers are very helpful to one another in order to finish the job. They follow high standards.

good,I loved working here! They were flexible with my hours and willing to give more hours however there was very little overtime available. I started working there in December of 2017 and by March of 2018 I was approached about a promotion. They recognize hard work and give praise to their employees that deserve it.
good,"Awesome environment and co-workers. Great place to start and great training. Perfect place to build on your customer service and communication skills. I’ve always been great at multitasking, but at Wendy’s your multitasking skills will improve vastly. With such kind managers you’ll find that working here can be quite fun☺️"
good,This was hands down one of the best experiences of my life. As my first job they were lenient and helpful start to finish. These amazing people are not only crew members but also family.
good,take customer orders and clean bathrooms dinning room and prep orders great workplace and great cow workers i have great customer service fun with coworkers i am great with the service   very polite and respectful management is good they have taut me to politer
good,The staff was Amazing and the GM was a wonderful guy to work for. I would go back if possible and stay with my current job. It was very fast paced and helping with customers was always a treat.
good,working at wendys it fast paced and fun at the same time. they do contest for crew members also there is a lot of room for growth within the company. also flexible with schedule
good,"A very fast paced area,and great food. A few employees and I did notice favoritism in the work area for they have hired family. I was scheduled to leave at 11pm but sometimes would leave at 12am or later due to how busy it would get. I did not like that."
good,Very social meet a lot of new people in the workplace a lot of work has to be done. Make sure everything is in its right place and clean at all times.

good,"its a typical day at work "
good,this is a great company to work for the people are awesome the food is good and fresh the environment is great so are the managers and the  team good service
good,"Wendy’s was my first job as a high school student. I absolutely adored it. I made so many friends and developed such a great work ethic. Within my first year, I was already offered a management role even though I was only 18. Great place to be if you’re willing to work hard."
good,"I love Wendy's I have been there over 7 years. Family valued, strong root values and a company that loves to give back. I would miss them when I'm gone. Just need to work on a few things"
good,Overall Wendy’s along with any other fast food restaurant is a good starting job for young individuals. It makes you more of a team player and you learn to communicate with individuals in a respectful manner along with learning to work in fast or slow paced enviornments .
good,great fast paced enviorment lots to learn about the resturant industry and mangement a sheer delight noting really hard about the job just stay on task and you'll enjoy what wendys has to offer
good,"Good company to work for, but there was no bonus structure in place.   There was something being talked about but every other food service had a bonus for managers."
good,Great place to work at. I been there for 3years and it’s hard working people there and managers that all get along. I would recommend to work there if u want something part time.
good,I think being at cashier wether you're at drive thru or Dine in was the most challenging position at wends . the hardest part is trying to balance you're time so that when its time to go wether you're doing 1st or 2nd shift you're area is clean for the next person. Sometimes you get caught in a rush hour and bring you behind and you find yourself leaving later than you were supposed to.
good,"Managers can often be the ones who causes issues between employees, Environment seems like you are walking on egg shells if not careful of who you interact with."
good,"It was easy and fun. Everyone got along well.  I needed more hours and they didn't have hours to give me, i stayed and waited for 2 weeks. They still told me they couldn't give me more hours. So I had to leave."
good,"The hardest part of the job would be finding potential candidates to work for the company. Also if there is no team environment within the restaurant with strong managers, it shows. The employees tend to not stay long due to the stresses of the job. Again wonderful company to work for with potential advancement to management, just need more dedicated employees and managers that actually WANT to do their jobs."
good,I had a really great time working here. I had the best coworkers and was on the closing shift. I actually enjoyed this job and even went in on my days off.
good,It a nice environment to work in as well the manger are easy to work with and I love how they are not so uptight and not to laidback. As well the food
good,"I am not allowed to do this function. If possible, I would say that I enjoy my job there. No day is a perfect day, but the good days out weight the bad The best part of this job is the customers. I enjoy vistiing with them. ."
good,Responsible for being the customers interaction to the  dining facility.  Create a enjoyable experience for the customer while meeting all the customer need.
good,I love food as I have mentioned about another job I had. Money wasnt great but I did get emplyee of the month at one point while being employed there.
good,"I learned a lot working at Wendy's. As the cashier at times, I had to learn customer service. I loved to make the customers feel welcomed and a lot of them knew me by heart after they met me. The workplace was good, but not excellent. The hardest part of the job, was the keep the customer happy. The most enjoyable part is when the customer was happy."
good,"the Wendy's I worked at I loved very much I was promoted within weeks, and the people that work there are great. I learned a lot from them they taught everything hands on."
good,Good people work at Wendy's most are hard working. It's a job that is part time and more of the crew are highschool students or people trying get through college with. Work hard and the time for management or higher quality jobs are in your future here.
good,We would help customers with preparing their orders and making sure that everything ran smoothly for the customers. We were also responsible for keeping our area clean.
good,"I did an internship at this company. The staff were extremely nice. I learned a good amount of HR related things, however i wanted to learn much more. But overall it was good."
good,I was a great experience as my first job I learned how to communicate with customers and coworkers. I learned how to work in a fast pace. The managers were really helpful.
good,I looked forward to coming to work everyday really was looking forward to learning something new this company does not challenge me from my previous experience.
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was the people I worked with and getting to train younger people to do their jobs safely and maintain quality service for our customers.
good,The pay can be a little more than what it was. Other than that it’s an awesome place to work by not enough to make a living. The customers are friendly and enjoyable
good,The pay wasn't good but that is to be expected through fast food. The culture is very motivating and it was definitely a place that I actually looked forward to going to every day. Very good for a first job.
good,"The food is good. The work environment is very dull, boring, and slow-paced. I'm not going to call it the cleanest place. But it's ok. Everything was good overall though."
good,"What I loved most about this place were the people I worked with. There wasn't a more cohesive atmosphere, that I can think of, in my professional career."
good,"I've only worked here for a year but it is a great place to work! Love my coworkers and the communication is great! I also get very good hours, I work full time. I think pay could be a little more than the just minimum wage."
good,The Managers there are extremely patient with workers. You are expected to get the job done and given the freedom to do so. They are unlike many stores because they don't look over your shoulder or micromanage. If you have a good personality/character you have nothing to fear. If you struggle to show up on time or have limited work experience they will encourage you to be a better person.
good,It was a fast-paced environment i love working there and making sandwiches running drive thru like the back of my hand and loved prepping and stocking taking care of customers and running the salad bar doing all kinds of multitasking i loved working there
good,They understood what went on with someone and would let them leave if they were sad or upset and they understood what the crew members meant they try to work out your hours when you have something going on and they would let you make up hours if you asked.
good,I learned a lot from working as a manager help me with several skills as I went to schools and other jobs.It also help me learned about the safety of food and how it is handled the different temperature of food and how it should be stored
good,"When I started working at Wendy's, I was still in high school and struggling to balance everything. Wendy's and the management were wonderful about only giving the hours I could handle and were always willing to give me more if I wished."
good,Love meeting new people  and working as a team....Being able to interact with my customers means everything to me....I love seeing the smiles of the kids and letting them order their own food....I also love assisting the elderly with whatever is is that they need....I go above and beyond for my customers
good,It’s always busy throughout the day. That managers and employees are respectful. They are clean with in the store and food. They give you the hours you need or want if it’s possible.
good,"decent place to work, especially in management. Biggest drawback would be to work at the Lansing MLK location. I had great experiences at every other location besides this one. Compensation is fair, management works a lot of hours but receives decent benefits. Atypical work day for management would be to clock in, set up plan for shift, count down cash, work the line, set up breaks, fufill orders, delegate work."
good,great job fast pace great people  great customers. The managers there were awesome. Part that I didn't like was cleaning the dishes the soap broke my arms out real bad.
good,"Hard working team. Fast paced. Fun."

good,I enjoyed working with The Wendy's Corporation. The crew members and the managers were helpful when it came to training me. This is a place where you are eligible to be promoted with the right amount of training. That wouldn't be an issue due to great managerial skills provided throughout the workplace.
good,I really enjoyed working for wendys when I was there. It was a fun job. Also wasn't hard either ! Wendys is a good place to work. I'm glad I got to experience what I did there !
good,A great first job to learn to work with others and learn about customers that will help you deal with people in everyday life.
good,Able to move up if you work hard. The managers are very easy going and human. My co workers are like family and I look forward to going in to work every day.
good,"I love my job and that is the honest truth , i think its because i am a people person! I love talking to people and taking care of people.My manager always tell me she appreciates me and i love it .My day at work fly's by because of the crew and the fun we have at work."
good,"Typical Day = no two days are the same"
good,"Have experience working with customer's,  serving customer's in front is so much fun. How to clean and tidy up and stock up everything wen it's empty."
good,Pretty good place to start as a base job. I would recommend it to any of my friends. Just having to move to relocate to a different state. Quick paced good environment yo be in.
good,"customers are usually awesome as long as you have a good attitude, can almost always pick up more hours & your not always doing the same thing everyday."

good,"Wendy's is a nice and fun place to work, I enjoy my job and I love going there but due to the amount of workers the manger put on the shift I work because most of our workers are young and can't work until closing, the few workers that are there have to work 10 times harder than the other shifts and we all get paid the same."
good,Wendy's was a nice place to work everyone was nice and the mangers were nice. The only thing I didn't like was working 5pm to 2am and being in school.
good,i loved the people i worked with at Wendy's. The job itself was fast paced and fun. the pay was well under what is deserved for the fast pace and accuracy needed to do the job .
good,"When I first started working for Wendy's, I was a normal crew member. I started off as a cashier, then moved to the salad/produce prep person. I absolutely loved my job. Within a year, I was promoting to assistant manager, and then within a year and a half after that, I made it to General Manager. It just happened to be at the store farthest from my home, and was the busiest Wendy's in the area. My daily starts at 9 a.m., counting the safe, setting up the first set of cash drawers, going to the bank and making the deposit from the night before, then getting the store ready to open. We run a very busy lunch rush from 11 to 2, and then I coordinate post-rush duties with the crew members. I then plan the night shift positions, catch up on paperwork, count first shift drawers and set up night shifts drawers. I normally turn the store over to the closing shift supervisor around 6 p.m. and finish up paperwork before going home. The Wendy's culture is based on wholesome family values and we encourage these beliefs in our employee relationships. Our employees know that they can come to me and be honest and open about any work-related issues they are having and that I and my management team will work to resolve or improve any work situation so that our crew has a fun yet safe environment to work in. The most stressful part about being a general manager is making deadlines and hitting sales goals while providing the best customer service experience possible. But because I love service work, that also makes it the most rewarding part of my job."
good,"A typical day at work is severing the public and taking on new challenges,The management was good treated everyone well,The workplace culture was mixed,The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude people some times and the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and getting along with different types of people"
good,It is a great job and the amount of hours I worked was great because it would pay off on pay day. I loved the full schedule I had and the amount of hours I was receiving.
good,Over all Wendy's is a great place to work they really care about their employees they work with your scheduled. Its a very fast pace environment but also friendly. very easy if we hall work together.
good,"If you're friendly to other workers then they are just as friendly, lunch time is very fast paced, which can be stressful but your shift will go faster than you think. The new Wendy's in avon is fully updated and very clean."
good,Working for them was a humbling experience for me never have I work for a fast food company for that loan and was treated well in fact they have asked me to come back just want something I just want something that's going to offer me benefits
good,This job was totally worth every day spent there. the management to was outstanding and patient. Communication and training was above all the best I have ever seen. Everyone used teamwork in every job they took on.
good,"Wendy's is typically is a quick place environment, with approachable and friendly stuff and management. Even though Wendy's only pays minimum its still a nice workplace to work."
good,My former manager still calls and checks on Me even after I left from the establishment. They have a really good key to training new workers.  If Wendt paid a little more and gave more hours I would consider working there again.
good,I loved working here. Coworkers were friendly and a lot of help and managers were great. If I could ever go back somewhere to work it would definitely be wendys
good,"Went in check food safety, counted safe, set up registers, helped with prep of food, went to bank. Opened unit helped with the customer satisfaction, food quality, speed of service, hired, fired interviewed, trained on an ongoing basis. Did deposits and settled cash."

Compares daily sales and goals met to develop plans for nightly sales and goals to achieve. Clean equipment, floors, bathrooms, tables, etc., and restock items for morning opening. Record sales and inventory and print reports. I learned how to manage a small restaurant and satisfy customer requests, food safety and how great team work makes your job easier. Management was supportive and challenging to ensure excellent service to our customers. Happy employees make happy customers was the motto and everyone was all for it! The hardest part of the job was not being able to satisfy everyone all the time. The most enjoyable part was to see the appreciative smiles of those customers we did satisfy."
good,"I loved working for Wendy's , the environment is very productive and fun. Everybody helps each other out and they have delicious salads. My favorite meal was the chili and the crackers."

I learned teamwork was most important. the managers weren't great but as far as keeping everything in order they made it work. The hardest part about Wendy's was when we got slammed with orders or closing the store. My favorite part of it was my co-workers they were so friendly and getting to meet all the new people.

She randomly praise you from time to time but overall always had something negative to say. The hardest part of the job was when the general manager at the time started showing favoritism towards her veteran workers, employees started to notice and when she would start being unfair with the schedule like making sure dayshifts always had strong people when she is in production but on other days we would have to struggle with all weak employees that we had to build and make better by ourselves. The most enjoyable moments working with the company was when we will set competitive goals to motivate the employees, it really made work fun."

good,I've worked for Wendy's in Tucson twice now for a combined amount of almost 8 years. I had to go back to it after having worked for them as a teenager due to job market.The management is exemplary in their management approach and coaching of their crew.
good,"A typical workday at Wendy's was very productive, always busy and fast paced. From working at Wendy's I've learned the value of teamwork. My management was very fare and understanding. My co workers would say I'm a leader and a team player. The hardest part of the job would be seeing others not motivated to get the job done. Getting a rush done under the time goals set by the Wendy's standard."
good,"Clocked in and prep the food(salads etc.) before opening of store. Greeted and prepared customers order upon request, hot,fresh and at a fast pace. Learned Team work, working with my co-workers. Been short on help was hard at times. Making the customers happy was the best ."
good,"Good people to work with, great management. "
good,"Wendys is a good company to work for, its just not the job that i want to be at for the rest of my life. I see myself doing so much more than working in fast food."
good,"my typical day at work consisted of doing any task that was asked of me. ive been working at this job for around 4 years now and ive acheived the managment level but decided to turn it down many times due to the rate of pay. the managment at the location i currently work is amazing and makes it hard for me to leave, along with the co-workers that keep the place fun and exciting. that hardest part of the job for me is actually telling people that i work there. for me i need to move on to bigger and better things, being an architectural graduate and a hard worker in my 20's and saying that i still work at wendys is a hard thing to grasp. they've worked with me at every angle and for that it is hard to leave. the pay is not able to pay my bills or ables me to live my life the way i want."

good,"A typical day at work is very busy and fun. I've learned communication is the key to everything when it comes down customers, managers and employees. Management in my field is wonderful."
good,I enjoyed working at this store with a huge variety of people as a crew member.  Varying days and hours allowed me to work with all team members and the management.  My years of experience in the field were valuable to this location and my abilities were used to pass on to the new incoming workforce.  The hardest yet most rewarding part of the job was the level of patrons at the business.  This is the most heavily patronized store within the city and to keep up with the demand takes a toll on ones body.  I would gladly send other people to work for this company and this management staff.
good,Working at Wendy's are days filled will great people to meet each day. We get to see people from all over that stop by and the places they are from are great stories to hear. I love making our guests experiences amazing.

good,"A typical day would be getting to work at 6:00in the morning, stocking the items that just came in from delivery, stock everything from old to new. Stock the line with meat and chicken, filter the fryers, sweep and mop the floors, sweep the parking lot and pick up the paper, bring in fresh buns. Mark off everything that came in from delivery to make sure we received our full order, fill up the ice bins, Count the money to start the registers off with. During the lunch rush period, I would take orders and make change at the same time. The hardest part of the job is stocking, the easiest part would be taking orders and making change. Most enjoyable part of the job would be clocking in to work."
good,A typical day at work is kind of hectic because you have to beat the drive time every hour while fulfilling the customers’ needs. I learned that it does not matter where you start because at the end of the road you may get promoted. The management is amazing because the managers understands each employee personal problems and what they are capable of performing. My co-workers are open to new experiences and when an employee cannot make it to work we try as team to fill in for them. The hardest part of the job is closing because sometimes we run out of food and it angers the customers causing them to make complaints. The most enjoyable part of the job will be making the customers happy because it makes my day go by smoother and faster.Whether or not you are right or wrong the customers are always right because it is your job to serve them well.
good,"A typical day was always fact paced and always changing. Deposits to be delivered to the bank, safe and proper food prep supervision, orders and delivery monitoring. As this was my first job I learned most of supervisor skills and how to run a self sustaining workplace. Management was always helpful and direct to the point of what was required. The hardest part was a language barrier with my Hispanic employees, who began teaching me some 'broken' Spanish. It was enjoyable as the whole crew was always very friendly and overall happy to come to work every day."
good,Take orders on drive through give out the drinks sometimes i would be in sandwiches but it usually depends on where they put me other then that i like it there.

good,A typical day at work was fun. As my first job I started as crew and worked my way up to shift supervisor. I had great examples before me so I learned exactly how to earn the position I strived for. The only thing I can say negative about this job is the fact it did not come with benefits of any sort. I liked the flexibility and fair chance for advancement that this job afforded.
good,"working at wendy's was fine, I was a cashier and order taker, I liked working here, my co-worker were friendly, the pay was not the best but it help to pay bills, manager was friendly also."
good,A typical day at Wendy's consists of making sure the store looks clean and stocked up for the daily rush. Making sure enough staff are working in different shifts. Directing and coaching staffs on a daily basis. What I learned about working at Wendy's is its fast pace to serving customers. hardest part of the job is getting customers complaints. The most enjoyable part of working there was making sure every customers leave happy and working with the staffs.
good,"Working at Wendy's is very motivating and sociable. I learn how to do team work. I not only stay on my duties, but when ever I have time I step in and help out others. My co-workers are very nice but since its a fast paced place there might be misunderstandings. I've learned how to handled those misunderstandings and keep up the good relationship with the other crew members since we all depend on each other. Regarding management, there is always good feedbacks that motivates me to keep doing the good work. What I enjoy the most is the bonding and respect from the crew members and serving customer."
good,Most of he day I greeted customer and kept store environment clean. I learn how to accomplish store goals.
good,Good job with opportunities of growth within the company. Stress free environment
good,"Depending on the other coworkers, I manage the grill station or sandwich station and backroom(dish washer). On a very rare day I will work on the register taking orders. Most of my work day on the grill consists of keeping up on the meat and convert more done meat into chili meat. At the end of the day, I clean the grills and clean the fryers and filter them. I then clean the floors. On the nights I am on sandwich stations and in the backroom, I make sandwiches for customers, the way they want them. I keep the sandwich station clean and stocked through the night. When I am moved to back room, I am responsible for cleaning the oven, chicken fryer, dishes, and the backroom floor. I make sure the sinks have the right temperature for the dishes and that the water is clean. My favorite part of my job is that everybody in the work place get along well. The hardest part is making sure I get everything the customer wants and that the store maintains its cleanliness. The management is very friendly and productive. The managers make sure that we are doing the best we can, but also make sure the environment is friendly and fun."
good,I enjoy working at Wendy's the crew and the managers are amazing hard working people. Everyone is very interested in pleasing the customers.
good,Employees sometimes reflect their management.  Manager has a bad attitude then most likely the employee will have one as well.  You have to treat people the way you want to be treated. (Customers and Employees)

good,"I loved working at Wendy's. This was the job where I learned about the town I lived in and met most of the people I know. The only reason I left was to better myself and pursue a promising career. There was nothing hard about the job, it came natural. I had managers who allowed me to set my own rules. Of course I never took it overboard. I loved my job, but it didn't pay enough and I had responsibilities."
good,I enjoyed working with all the girls and becoming part of the team
good,"As a shift supervisor my fun never ends, from handling employee problems to listening to customer complaints.

May have to fill a shift or rearrange someones  schedule."

good,"The people are a joy to be with and work with.  The management is very flexible with schedules, as well as supportive.  The hardest part of the job is being short handed and trying to  pull the staff to work together.  In the end that is the best part of the job, when we all come together and get the job done."
good,Being a drive thru cashier it required being on top and on point. I really enjoyed working with my customers. And also had great co workers. We all believed in working together.
good,"You come in get your uniform on, clock in, as a cashier i would go to the manager ask for register, count to make sure all the money was there, then i sign in to my register, take the customers orders, bag there order, sometimes dealing with full lines taking up to as many as 5 to 6 orders at a time, having to switch from taking the order to making drinks to get condiments, and bagging up food. You can be on your feet for almost 4-8 hours straight. the most enjoyable part of the job is the customers you get to interact with because of the different personalities."

And Me Being The Order Taker He Took His Angry And Frustration Out On Me And Threw The Shake At Me Thru The Drive-Thru Window! I Continue To Apologize To The Customer And Even Gave Him A Free Shake With My Managers Permission! The Most Difficult Thing About This Incident Was Keeping My Character !

good,"Normally I would clock in and everyone would be pretty alright. They would greet me, and tell me what to expect and what to do. I learned how to enjoy my job there, even when it's a pretty rough day. The management is very understanding, and will work around any unforeseeable problems you may have had, such as illness. The hardest part of the job would have to be helping out the angry customers. Most of the time they don't want to be helped, but rather to be heard. Getting past the name calling, and helping them despite of it can be difficult at times. Best part of the job would simply be the people there. They are accepting and willing to help you, as long as you ask."

Management wasn't all they great, but with any company, there were good days and then there were bad days. The hardest part of my job was trying to handle all of the stress at work, meaning trying to work my position and help my other fellow crew members as well at the same time.

good,"It was my first job ever. It was a very fun place to work. I worked the night shift. I always was ready to work. They started calling me to come in to work on my days off and when it wasn't my shift. I always said yes I can do it. Then one day I was stranded out of town, my friends car broke down and so I call 6 hours before my shift and told them I was sorry but I couldn't make it in because of the car. They said ok. Then the next day we found out that the part we needed for the car wouldn't be in until the next day so I called my boss to tell him. He was mad and threaten to fire me. So the next day I went to work and told my boss that ""I have always been there when they needed me to be there and when I miss tow day because of my friend's car they threaten to fire me, how is that ok? If they were going to treat me like that then I quit."" I had had no days off in almost 1 1/2 months. then they threaten to fire me. That was wrong."

Any ideas or problems were listened to and a response was given, the store was very much ""family"" .  Co-workers  worked well as a team,  everyone willing to ""pitch in and help"" where required. I don't consider that there was a  ""hard part"" of working at Wendy's, however working  short-staffed when someone called in ill  gave extra pressure on the rest to  maintain the excellent service the customers came to expect."

good,Good experience Nd learning too much. Management is good and there behaviour is also good.good environment for working.They give good opportunities for rise your skills.
good,"We choose our schedules and always finish the job before clocking out, it's like a family here if there is an issue it's always heard never will you feel like you can't speak up"
good,"A typical day at work starts with me clocking in and counting the safe and making sure the store is ready for my shift and any rushes that might immediately follow opening or shift change. I take inventory and check quality of food already cooked and cleanliness of my store. In a fun and friendly environment I make sure ALL customers are taken care of by me and my crew and I and we as a team have a great time satisfying customers until the last one leaves the drive-thru, and we lock the doors to prepare the store for the next day, or until its time to change shifts. Its always fun and exciting working there and I really learned that in order to transition from a crew member to a productive manager you need to let your crew know in a respectful manner that you make decisions that are best for that shift and for the store/ company."
good,I really enjoyed my time with Wendy's. I enjoy my bosses and the fast pace. It helped me along my other Food Service Adventures. It teaches you how to be clean and to take pride in your work as a Sandwich Artist. It makes you think and move your hands at the same time and treat people with respect. I don't be able to put me on I can't register do anything with the vehicle
good,The managers always kept up good teamwork. The work environment was very clean. The training was very thorough. The general manager was not the greatest to work with and was often lazy or overbearing. In the end I enjoyed being a Wendy's employee with good people and hard work.
good,Wendys is a great company. Great staff and management. But In general the pay is not worth the stress in general but it is a job and is something to be hold
good,Its a good job to work it. It would be a better job if some of the managers knew how to talk to the workers. Other then that everybody works like a team
good,"Every morning I would clock in and count my register. I would grab a headset and clean the sink so I could wash dishes. I would pan bacon and make sure our shift never ran low on bacon in between taking orders and collecting payments. At the end of my shift I would make sure everything was clean, stocked and ready for the next shift."
good,A typical day at Wendy's would include working fast and serving and assisting customers with choosing a meal of their choice. Wendy's is a job where you can have a flexible schedule due to the hours of operation.
good,I love this job cuz my customers are respectful Dont get me wrong some people gave me problems but I was a leader for a reason so I knew how to deal with them
good,I learned to work as a team as well as being in a fast paced environment. I learned how to have great customer service. At this job you were always busy.
good,everyone was very friendly. a very nice work environment. a nice slow steady pace working area. very easy to get the hang of once you start working there.
good,"Good a nice company to work at."
good,If you enjoy working together as a team to reach a certain goal this is the place for you. Cooperation is key in this workplace as well as being courteous to the customers.
good,this wast first job and it was honestly not bad. the manager and team leaders were super nice and they did their job. there were a lot of young college students working there so it was definitely a fun environment but also serious when needed to be. all my meals were 50% off on my break and 30% when i was not on the clock. they trained me well and learned everything quickly. if you are a cashier it’s a bit more competitive because you’re expected to upsell. only thing i didn’t like was that i was getting paid too little ($11hr)  for the work i was putting in.
good,Most of my time I go to the gym and I like to draw light to read books I like to learn new things in life I go to church on Sunday I am a nice person.
good,"I loved my experience at Wendy's, I have gained more knowledge about customer service and how to manage. The work environment was very fast pace and very friendly."
good,I loved working for Wendy's. It wasn't too hard and the employees I worked with were very polite and energetic. The customers were always so nice and exciting to meet.
good,I wish there where more hard worker's there so the doors won't swing back and forth so much.i wish the pay could be better and get paid vacation.moving up could be better
good,"It’s a fast paced environment, very customer friendly, being a crew leader I would have to close the store , book keep inventory , Counting down cash register and safe ."

good,"Great place to work.  Company gives acknowledgement to hard working staff.  Flexible hours.  Work courses always offered, free to staff.  Uniforms provided."
good,"A typical work day would consist of cooking, cleaning and closing the restaurant. The hardest part of the job would probably have been multitasking thru out the day."
good,"I managed and coached crew to work towards goals for daily service plans. Developed crew training plans and worked with WeLearn training program to enhance full potential of team. Worked hand in hand with management team to develop cleaning plans for restaurant. Followed food safety procedures and protocol to deliver fresh products. Put truck orders in and managed deliveries weekly. Managed cash flow and daily deposits, managed labor and food cost, and conducted interviews and aided in the hiring process."
good,"Work is basically me running a shift to make sure all tasks are done and done correctly. I manage a crew to make drinks and sandwiches for customers. I take inventory, cash management, and budget tracking. I make sure items get recorded and are in our system each week."
good,Wendy’s was a good place to work I lived the people I worked with and my bosses liked me I only left because I needed more pay the best part of the day when your came in and see everyone smile because your their

good,I have worked both part and full time for the past 22 years.  Wendy's has always been supportive and flexible with my life changes and schedule.  The crew are both hard working and fun to work with.
good,The service may need a little more work but overall they are very great with meeting the needs of theirs customers and making sure they are satisfied with their order
good,"Good work Place. Good, nice, friendly workers as well. Good place of Business. Clean and organized correctly. Managers are some of the sweetest people you can meet"
good,Great for first jobs . Allowed my yo learn as nd help s team.  Various different jobs do I was able to move around and work different stations. Hours were amazing
good,"This is a great place to learn and hone customer service skills. Fast-paced, fun job with great people in both Management & employee to employee relations. Since our store was right off the freeway, there were always traveling customers, and new people to meet & interact with."
good,A typical day at work was good and slow paced until the regular eating hours such as lunch and dinner. if everyone was doing what was told everything moved smoothly. from working here I learned a lot about myself such as in how quick I get things done under pressure.
good,The morning staff was great to work with. We were a team. My Supervisor is great and trained me in so many different areas. There's always room for advancement. Flexible hours. The cons are high turnover for the evening shift wich usually were high school kids.
good,Wendy's was very competitive but the work environment taught me how to handle customers with care .i also learned how to cook there also. Wendys also taught me how to save money
good,the environment is fun and fast paced the management team makes sure the environment was fun but made sure the work got done. the faster you work the faster the shift goes by.
good,everything was good at Wendys except for the pay really. Cant really complain about anything. It was good place to work for a first job. I would recommend it to a person in high school or something because they dont give you any hours
good,"I would recommend Wendy's, it is a good environment and good communications also very busy on the holidays. You get a debit card that your check automatically goes onto."
good,"put up truck , open the store for the day , take orders , cook , handle money , clean , stock . learned how to multi task . loved my managers. quick pace. if you get the right crew its a blast"
good,it was good working there. it is best for a person who wants to have flexible hours for job. it helps to maintain life balance. job culture was excellent.
good,It was an enjoyable job. I unfortunately had to leave the area and they were unable to transfer me to a restaurant in my new location. I would work for them again
good,"enjoyed working with employees and customers. loved training crew and manangers. always working on hiring, maintaining profitablity on all levels hours sometimes very long"
good,"Everybody was nice and helpful it was a good staffed i love the day shift everybody was quick and fast during lunch hour, plus the food there is really good . The managers were so helpful and understanding."
good,My time at Wendy’s was the best job experience i have worked at. This was one of my first jobs that taught me customer services and how to work under pressure.
good,"I love working at Wendy’s it wasn’t a temporary job , I just need something that was close to where I live at now , I actually wanna get a career and not just a job"

good,"I really enjoyed working with the wendy's crew and they made you feel like you were family and the management was there and made sure things were ran the way it was supposed to be ran in the store.  Also, they did all they could to help on the line when it was necessary."
good,"Working in a busy restaurant taught me how to stay on top of things, keep customers happy, serve fresh food in target time."
good,Do the job correctly you won't get in trouble. Permanent managers in the restraugnt will work with your schedule while also being polite. Some managers will help you clean cause they understand the crew member position.
good,wendy's was a great place to start my working experience. it is a very quick placed job and may cause some stress but overall enjoyed my time there. great work environment
good,They all worked well together and helped each other out. They were understanding of when something would be going on. They didnt have any problems with things popping up because they understood that sometimes things happen.
good,I’ve worded at Wendy’s for almost two years I like the people they’re nice and som of my coworkers have become my best friends . I get along with the management really well.
good,"The food there was always good and fresh and the employees went above and beyond to do anything to meet the customers satisfaction.  Also food was prepared to order and delivered quickly, never had to wait more than 15 mis for food"
good,"The Wendy's team seemed very helpful, they got their work done and on time. They are very good with the customer service, and helpful to customers about their meals,"
good,"Wendy's was a great place for me to work at for the time being. But, I soon realized, that it wasn't for me anymore. I had school things to take care of and I felt that at times they would belittle me because of it. They also cut back my hours for no given reason, even though they knew they could call me in at any time I would be there"
good,Working at Wendy's was my first job. It showed how to be responsible . Helped me take care of my sister.The hardest about the job was to keep the time down and make every costumer happy.
good,It was a great place to work but needed something a bit better. I just wasn't happy cooking food as a profession. But management was great and overall was a great job.
good,"wendy,s was a great experience for me i loved working there. If i ever had a bad day i knew i could come to work and be able to be in a cheering environment. My manager taught me so much on why your job is important to you and why you should always put your best effort in while you work. Wendy's is a great example of keeping the tradition alive they make sure its exactly the way it was fifty years ago. The hardest part about working at Wendy's is the rush hour and keeping up a time limit without messing up or anything. The easiest part about working at Wendy's is putting a smile on the customers faces just being able to cheer anyone's day up with a smile."
good,Wendy's is a fast paced environment. The employers and coworkers are amazing. I enjoyed working for Wendy's. It's a job that will keep you busy and keep you in shape. You have to be able to multi task and get the job done in a timely manner. I'd recommend this job to anyone!
good,"It's all about the TEAM you work with, your attitude and your managers attitude. I've seen so many Wendy's fail in other areas due to management when all it takes is working together as a team. Wendy's was the best ."
good,"The management is very good. The co workers are very friendly and everyone is very nice. They lose and gain a lot of workers. I love the food, especially the nuggets."
good,wendys I a very nice place to work really nice crew to work with great people  also the food is good great opportunity to up in the company the work is some time hard but u can get through it
good,"I enjoyed working at wendys. The store and assistant manager where absolutely amazing. Anytime you needed help, they would be there no matter what they were doing. They took aggressive customers with no problem if i couldn't handle them. They worked with you on sick days, and work with you during any grievances. They really try to help the associates move up in their workplace, and in life. They don't push everything on one person to get done. They know what you can do, and what can't be done during a few hour shift. I'd recommend Wendys of fort oglethorpe to anyone and everyone who wanted either a temp/part time job, and anyone starting their first job. You'll gain great experiences with wonderful people."
good,"A typical day at work requires prepping enough food to get us through lunch rush. Making sure S.O.S (speed of service) is at the right numbers, and making sure each customer is getting everything they need. "
good,"theirs to much competition in the kitchen and no type of  understanding when asking for time off for family time."
good,They seem to be quick paced and fast at serving they get busy during a certain time and their able to get the food out to the customers rather quickly.
good,Very cheerful environment and productive. The crew and managers made everyone feel very welcome. Very flexible with working around school and your times.
good,Wendy's was great during the time there. No major issues. Staff got along with each. Just a fun environment.  Only con was no benefits. But I would definitely give my crew and management team a 10.
good,"Wendy's is overall a great place to work especially for a first job. The managers are great and treat all crew members with respect. The General Manager is always willing to work with crew members in order to get their schedules figured out. A typical day for me usually involves a big lunch rush. I would usually handle the customers' in the drive thru. My goal for that position was to quickly obtain the money from the customer, give their change, and hand out their order all while being very patient and kind to them. I think that the hardest part of the job was that it could be stressful at times where there was a rush as well as when customers were being difficult. The most enjoyable part was that I had good connections with my co-workers and managers so that tended to make working less stressful and it also made everyone work better together. The best thing I learned from working there was how to work well with others as well as developing skills to solve problems that customers may have. This job has also given me a very good work ethic."
good,"Consistently provide friendly guest service and hearty hospitality. And demonstrated"
good,"On a typical day of work, I went into work and was normally the sandwich maker. the environment is normally not too busy just yet, and everything is in place for the upcoming rush. the hardest part of the job is only when its a little unorganized and food and customers are all over the place, but we still manage to enjoy ourselves."
good,"Todo es bueno al igual que los manager no todos pero si tratan bien , me gustaba la posición que tenia en la estación de las papas fritas aprendi rápido en cuestión de servirlas y freirlas al igual que también fria tenders y nuggets de pollo , cortaba y orneaba tocino ,tenia un buen horario por la mañana , lo único que no me agrado fue que casi todos los empleados se metían en la vida personal y así informaban a uno que otro mánager y pues los mánager ya después de eso empezaban a tratar de una manera muy diferente afectaban bastante la tranquilidad de trabajo en cuestion de que hablaban de uno mal aun estando enfrente de ellos Pero en si la verdad me gustaba bastante mi trabajo hacia lo posible por hacer las cosas bien y de manera rapida al principio si fue un poco pesado pero ya después todo fue mas fácil conforme iba aprendiendo lo iba logrando cada ves mejor él restaurante no me quedaba lejos de donde de yo vivo ya que se ubica en 8810 S Garfield Ave, S.Gate, CA 90280, USA"
good,"I love the job and the working environment, also the people that worked there. Everybody there work as a team and always helping out when needed to get the job done and on time."
good,there are many restaurants but Wendy's always has an opportunity for new and young individuals theirs are always positions to be filled and a managerial position can be applied for if interested.
good,Very respectable colleagues who made sure to help one another. We had strong teamwork values despite the fast paced and stressful conditions. Lack of involvement on other managers ends.
good,"I loved the job because I had great managers , we all worked well together we didn’t have angry customers friendly environment I honestly think every store should have the rule that the customer is right ."
good,It’s a fun family restaurant. The team I worked with we worked really well together. They push you for advancement. The work is easy and fast paced and friendly
good,It was okay working at Wendy's I just needed more money and I love working there it was fast pace job everyone got alone the manager was cool and she was very reasonable with us. I hated when we was slow cause it was nothing for us to be but clean the store not that i minded cleaning.
good,"If you are looking for something to do while working another job, or in school this is perfect. They try working around your schedule. I highly recommend this for a teenager as a first job to get experience."
good,Wendy’s could be pretty busy at most points but other times can be pretty slow. I love this job just because of the  moving pace.  I’d have to say our Wendy’s location is pretty well-maintained and managed.  We have a lot of responsibilities even know your working in a team. Speed and  accuracy is key.
good,I learned alot there long enough to become managwr but i didnt get the hours i deserved. I learned how to make every sandwich on the menu. I know evey advertisement that comes out and i also know how to count down my own drawer.
good,"My role at Wendys was to make french fries, cook beef patties and also, on some days be a cashier. I enjoyed My time at Wendys, but my experience was short here."
good,"I have learned how to work under stress, how to deal with the public much better, not that I needed the help cause I simply just love working with people"
good,I loved this job. The managers and crew got along great for the most part. There were no signs of noticeable favoritism and we all helped each other to make sure our jobs were done correctly.
good,"When Wendy's gave me the job, I had little experience of fast food and they really helped me feel comfortable of how fast paced it is and how to deal with it under pressure."
good,Cleaned dining area. Served customers flipped burgers also cooked fries. Took out the trash. Coordinated the kitchen making sure it stayed clean.  Cleaned bathrooms when needed.
good,"Management are usually those that learned English as a second language so understanding one another can be a trip sometimes, but we were all a family after a point. I love my team even to this day!"
good,I enjoyed other managers there and some of the co workers. Some co workers bit of a mess to work with but was good over all. Enjoyed the free frosty drinks.
good,"This job isn’t really recommended for first time jobs although they will hire you. I’ve been working in customer service for 4 years now and I get stressed out. On the other hand I love my managers it’s a fun work space. But only if you know how to balance fun with work. You learn a lot from drive through, to dining room, to restocking and refilling. Making drinks like green tea, lemonade, and the fruit teas. You learn how to close either dining room or drive through. Some people will think it’s a bad place because they couldn’t handle it or they just didn’t like there managers but even if I was as close to them as I am now. Other people shouldn’t effect you to do your job because you go to your job to do 1 thing. To make money and do your time. If you get hired at Wendy’s I wish you luck."
good,Working at Wendy's was also a very fun experience. Although it kept me constantly busy time flew by fast. It had its ups and downs but we all worked as a team to make the dream.
good,"Most people wouldn't really think working in a fast food restaurant is ideal, but Wendy's I couldn't of asked for better. Easiest job that i've had. Lovely people to work with, not stressful and everyone was treated equally."
good,I learned how to run my on business by working for this company. I learned how to set budgets and not only meet them but double them. I learned how to make a profit
good,I loved working at Wendy's from the food to the atmosphere everything was so fun. hardest part of the job was refilling the chili but other then that I loved it.
good,love working here it has been great to work there i love cleaning and doing some of the maintenance and cleaning the grills the employees are great and management is strong i work from the time i get there till the time i am done and dont slack off.
good,Very professional & good  customer service and always hot no wait no rush and everything is very organized. Great employees & they are very respectful.
good,as long as you always move forward and stay competitive you can amke any establishment fun and entertaining. i run a high volume location which means being busy at all times
good,"I’ve had a lot of fun working there! I didn’t even considered it work. I was doing my job, following the manual and the people around me helped me earn experience."
good,Love the place friendly environment love working for the corporation .Customers come back repeatedly because the crew members are loving/ encouraging make u satisfied when leaving so they will be happy coming in
good,faced paced taking orders before and during rush hour and dish washing is a typical day.  i learned customer service skills.  management was great.  we had different cultures who would come.  Some on a everyday basis.  school buses to me would be the most work or after a game but none of it was hard.  talking to customers was great and of course getting the pay.  Learning the job and new parts of the job was enjoyable and working to become a manager  was enjoyable and hard because i wanted to be on all P's and Q's.
good,"A Typical Day at work"
good,"It was a great place to work because they trained us to work well and complete our tasks. The customers that came in were super nice and easy to deal with. My managers were helpful and kind. They were ready to step in to assist when needed. Overall, I recommend anyone to work there."
good,"The Head Manager was very welcoming. This Wendy's in particular demanded everyone to work at their best. A culture at the work would push those to work harder, however anyone that wanted to relax always deemed unworthy to work. This acted as a positive, despite this being a low pay job. However, the young staff didn't mind this competitive work, and as people got older they hated the work thinking lowly of everyone else working there."
good,It was a good place to work and also was a learning experience with working with people i learned a lot within the time that i was there it taught me a lot
good,"Working at Wendy's was a lot fun, the crew, management just the whole team jn general is like family. How they teach you everything you need to know to run a successful and fun shift is just amazing. You don't question your self or what you are doing at Wendy's because of how in depth and descriptive they are with their training, if you have a question they wouldn't mind stopping and helping you. I learned how to be confident, fast paced, to be able to multitask and run a shift all thanks to Wendys."
good,Wendy's has been a great company to work for and has offered me many advancements and has a great work culture. Keeping a good happy culture for crew and guests alike.
good,The drive thru had a time limit to get food out.  In between customers you had to clean down everything.  Also had to wear non slip shoes.  I made sandwiches was in drive thru and front counter.  I don't thing there isn't much i didn't do there.
good,everyone is friendly and the managers are too. everyone knows each others and they are also very helpful. Sometimes when managers feel really really nice they buy breakfast and we all eat before we start working.
good,"Very Fast paste Restaurant with lots of business at lunch time.  Very friendly Atmosphere but loves to be professional, accurate and polite to customers. Fun place to work if you enjoy working with the public."
good,"Responsibilities Meal prep, grill cook, maintaining a sanitary work environment, assembling meals and training new employees.While working there i had to also take out the trash, and clean firer and floors."
good,"This establishment was a very nice place to work at, especially for my first time ever working. I chose fast food to test the waters originally and ended up liking it a lot, but when i found some opportunities in what i’ll be majoring in for College, i had to expand my experiences."
good,Wendy’s may have been stressful from time to time because i was adapting to the new environment but it had its perks or working there. Although the days seemed long.
good,"I loved being employed at wendys . It was fun but everyone took it serious during our peek hours. Paperwork wasnt hard at all for us managers. Sometimes it got hectic but seeing the customers smile and thank you because you took order correctly , had it hot fresh and ready in a reasonable time makes it all worth while .."
good,"I enjoy being a wendys crew member , everyone helps out. No one is lazy or not willing to pitch in & lend a helping hand. The crew overall is amazing , ive never worked with anyone else that gave me positive vibes & was very fast and productive."
good,"Pretty nice place to come and eat ,I love serving the customers . Very clean  and we always be sure to make our food fresh to order . Very popular location especially during rush time . You wouldn't believe how many people come in early in the morning !!"
good,I Loved being a manager at the Wendy's in WV. It gave me several opportunities to advance and quickly noticed the hard work I put in and moved me right on up! It was clean and the food is the bomb. Wendy's will always be my favorite fast food.
good,"When I did work at Wendy's , they gave me a great experience . everyone loved each other . It was Individual personalities nd I think that's what I had liked about working there."
good,"Wendy's was a good job. The only thing is that I don't see anyone living in Poughkeepsie being able to just work at this job and able to pay all the bills and have pocket money. Its a job for teenagers , unless your a manager that's different. But its an easy job."
good,Friendly people and amazing management that is looking for internal promotions and people ready to strive within the company. Flexible hours and fast pasted environment.
good,"They have good services They make sure that I have what I need they meet all my needs will at least try to.They always have my back.I love working for Wendy's they make sure I have my days off or work around my schedule,"

good,Wendys is a fun place to work it’s fast paced and it gives you a great opportunity to move up and develop growth in the company I would recommend this job to anyone
good,I worked here for 6 months and it wa s a great 6 months as I got a decent pay (better than some of my other coworkers my age) and I loved it when customers come in and complimented me for my smile and my great service I provide. As well as when managers were proud of me for receiving so many commentate about me. Overall great place to work if you’re in high school and need a little money.
good,"It's Fast Food , so you have to move fast and keep up . Good food and good service. Everyone gets along and mangers are good at understanding and will work with you"
good,Very busy location . Good place to work. Pay wasnt good tho. We did get compensated every week was the good part about it. Good food friendly staff. Remodeled the store. New romodeling helped us to become more efficient
good,I learned how to work in a fast-paced environment where the customers are always right. I learned customer service skills as how to multi-task in the workplace.
good,"I took back cash and orders. I did the dishes. I took orders in the Lobby. I stalked up, and clan the lobby.I worked the fry station. I had to drop fries, drop spicy and regular nuggets. Prepare nuggets and fries for drive thru and Lobby. I had to prepare my frozen fries. I presented the lobby and drive thru. The management was flexible and strict with the working procedures."
good,You have to schedule your home life around work especially when you have children. That's the only thing I didn't like about the job. But it is a great place to work other than that.
good,Wendy’s is a good company to work for. It’s gives you the opportunity to grow. It teaches its workers to care about the customers. The atmosphere is friendly and inviting. I would highly recommend this company.

good,My first job my hard work paid off I got offered a position within two years bit didn't take it them got offered again and said yes bit after all that I've been thru with Wendy's I'm still there
good,If an individual is looking to start their work experience voyage then Wendy's is a perfect option for them. Learning the job is rather easy and the work itself is not hard at all. The coworkers were all tremendous and it was like a second family. Overall there is not much bad that I can say about working at the Wendy's establishment.
good,Fun but fast pasted sometimes stressful but not to bad it's my first job i like it but it's not something I can c myself doing for the rest of my life
good,At Wendy's I got along with everyone there and the people took their time training me. I would say it's a fun work place because there were a lot of good personalities.
good,"At Wendy’s we have to move fast, because it’s fast pace, and you have to keep our times down, get the customers food out in a fast time, take their order in less than 3 seconds."
good,"i opened everyday: prepped the store got everything up and running. counted my cash or the day, read my numbers, did my low chart, set my plan, and then started my day. i learned how to read numbers and ales, lead my crew, satisfy customers, and handle responsibilities."
good,Loved working here. I was a good job to work at when I was in school. The management was very respectable toward the employees and everyone got along.
good,"I enjoy working with my fellow workers and learning different skills (preparing sandwich, French fries, and salads) the hardest part of the job is multitasking when it becomes busy and we are short handed and not able to take a break."
good,"Each of us working at wendys had a job to do. If you were a cook, you were expected to be able to grill patties, chicken and manage the fires, as a sandwich maker, make sure the sandwiches were made fresh and to the customers liking, etc. Everybody got along well and never had problems. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers."
good,Working for Wendys has gave me a lot of customer service skills and patients. Very friendly people I have worked with. very fast pace but its always nice to meet different people and to satisfy them

I was in charge of servicing all Wendy's equipment including all cooking equipment and HVAC. and everything in between. I had 13 stores to maintain on daily basis. The best part of my job was the ability to stay busy and to complete almost all work orders the same day. The hardest part of my job is every so often I would have a slow day and trying to find things to do can a little aggravating.

The management is very knowledgeable and most are leaders rather than bosses. Since Wendy's was my first official job, I learned so much. I've learned, mostly, how to deal with customers and other people in a more professional way. I have learned how to conduct myself with poise, confidence, and professionalism. The hardest part of the job would be rush hour. While rush hours aren't hard, they can become seemingly difficult when the team doesn't work together and communicate."

good,"This particular Wendy's was located directly by a church, so Sunday's were often hectic and fast paced, but I thoroughly enjoyed my employment here. Fun environment with wonderful coworkers and fantastic managers. Was not fond of the owner by any means, he was quite rude and made the days he popped up stressful, but he didn't show up often and we were given a heads up a day to a couple of days in advance."
good,A typical day at work is to fulfill the customer's needs and make sure the customers get taken care of and have a great experience. I have gained experience in good communication skills and have learned to satisfy the customer to the best of my ability. The managers are really good at staying on task and helping employees the best they can.

Everyone got along and worked efficiently with one another, resulting in an enjoyable work experience."
good,From my first to my last day my managers made sure that everything on their shift was organized and ready to serve our customers. Other workers brought their personal problems to the job but as they should the managers made sure that it didn't interfer
good,The manager was very down to earth. The most enjoyable moment there that you can be yourself didn't have to worry about feeling out of place or a manger on you about everything. The hardest time seeing some of your employees leave.
good,"So far best work place I've been in . Managers so kind and professional but able to maintain the the restaurant so clean and well maintained . They were also able to hire such a cooperative team where everyone did their job but also seemed to help one another making the restaurant flow so nicely sometimes had me wanting to go to work. The staff knew how to handle customer service we kept our customers well served and attended . Hardly any complaining customers towards our service but we always did our best in making sure they left happy. Truly a store I can say cares about their customers and making sure they got exactly what they ordered as quickly as possible. Very friendly , hardworking , and comfortable team !"

My manager was very strict but understanding and very nice. The hardest part of my job was when I had to multitask 3 or more things by myself.

good,I enjoyed the environment and people. I learned basics of fast food and a quick environment. I excelled in my position and even got trained on multiple positions. The hardest part of the job i would say was the night shift when I would have to get everything done in a timely matter but have late night rushes.

good,"The Wendy's in Sharonville where I worked had a great team of people working there. Everyone always had each others' backs and no one slacked around; everyone always worked very hard. We all had a very stable schedule and two days in a row off every week, which is kind of unusual but was great. Management was great there, the general manager having worked for Wendy's for over 20 years. The hardest part of the job was having so much to do every day, but it wasn't too bad. The most enjoyable part, hands down, was the people I worked with. Probably one of the best groups of people I've ever worked with."
good,Wendys is a job work Place They have respect for people. If you need help with anything they will land a hand to help. I will recommend anybody to work for Wendys

good,Working at Wendy's was a good working experience for me & I appreciate the great opportunities provided here at this company. I would absolutely love too have another opportunity to work here again.
good,"A typical work day at Wendy's was not very difficult, as it only required minimal food preparation in the mornings and nights. As this being my first job ever, I learned that not everything goes as planned in a fast-food restaurant. All co-workers and managers work very well together at all times and were there when needed. The most difficult part of the job itself, was keeping up with inventory and stocking. But, also, I enjoyed my co-workers as we all helped each other get through the work day and kept each other on track with respect and good communication."
good,"A typical day at work as busy all day, I learned how their system was ran which was something new to me , the hardest part was finding something to do when we weren't busy. Overall I enjoyed the job."
good,"- Work in the morning, do what I usually do everytime I open the store. "
good,"Wendy's in Locust Grove, Ga is a good place to work for a person that has never had a job. The crew members and managers are good people who don't mind to you get on track. The one thing I enjoyed about working there is being cashier and greeting our customers."

Im grateful for this experience because it taught me how having a good work ethic would benefit me in situations where a leader was needed but not provided."
good,Working here I learned a lot and met a lot of people. The pay is decent and you get paid every week. There is room to grow and advance in the company.
good,"Decent place to start out managment keeps the bare minimum of people on shift for budget and makes it so much harder to do anything, district manager is unprofesional and childish."
good,"It's fact paced, multitasking, great way to stay on your feet no matter what your doing whether it's cashier, grill, fries, dishes, lobby, and of course stock"
good,"Any job worked your going to deal with people. Some being just as sweet as you or some you just cant satisfy. I've learned working a Wendy's to develop a tough skin and try not to let things get to you or under your skin, that was hard for me, I've had people to throw burgers back at my employees and even curse me out and me in return them the same. I got older and realized that it wasn't worth it at all. hardest part of the job especially as a manger was trying to get the weekends off or at least have your schedule rotated to accommodate  you and your family. most enjoyable part I got from it was having a great crew. they had your back and was actually willing to work."
good,A typical day working at Wendy's was very busy. I learned how to communicate better and to keep at a fast pace. I learned to be more professional like. I had growth in maturity during the time I worked. All of my managers were very nice and helped out when it was needed. The culture there was amazing. We kept everything clean. When we would get a little backed up we helped each other to be motivated. The hardest part was probably closing. There was so much that needed to be cleaned or prepped. The easiest thing was keeping the customers happy.
good,This job was an exciting experience in my life. My first real job and in a fast pace and friendly environment. I learned alot from this cooperation. I wish things panned out different.

good,"Day consisted of taking orders, cleaning tables, and stocking. Management was very nice, and positive. The most enjoyable part of the job was being around all these positive people."
good,"I would close which I liked to do. I like staying busy, I liked meeting new people. I learned a lot about the job along with responsibility. Management was awesome. Everyone tried to have fun passing the time. The hardest part of the job was trying to get along with everyone and staying away from drama. Co workers had some issues. I did too but that is why I refuse to work with family.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing happy customers."
good,"I trained initially all operations that each crew member performed, then I was trained to run the store. The company also paid for me to take the ServSafe exam and I successfully obtained that. I was able to utilize my skills to run a crew. My co-managers where extremely patient and helped me learn during my training. The biggest concern I had was keeping my employees content and to show up as many teens worked for me. I enjoyed my Manager meeting where I got recolonized for great ideas and My leadership role."
good,Wendy's is a wonderful place to work..The coworkers become a team and are like your family away from home! They know what teamwork is..everybody helps each other!!
good,the managers there are too good for them selves.. they play favoritism with some of the employees and do not play fair when it comes to hours.. I loved working there on certain days but other days i don't want to be there. if the managers acted like they should the restaurant would be great!!!
good,I have good customer service enjoy being around people I'm a hard worker I put in a lot and still only get paid little. I jus want something other then fast food I want to do more then fast food

good,"A typical day at wendy's. I would get to work start grilling @ frying food and cleaning until it was time to close. I would close the restaurant and go home. Wednesday's I would come in at 7 am and unload the delivery truck, stock the freezer, cooler and dry stock area. I would mop, break down boxes and do other various task from scrubbing the grease spots in the drive through to changing out promotion signs. There wasn't anything hard about the job. The most enjoyable part was the people."

good,"Working at Wendy's was amazing. It was my first real job and I loved it. There were stressful days, but my co-workers and managers always made up for it. I was on cash, and it was great. I started out on the lobby register. I was soon moved to the faster-paced, drive thru register. It was a great experience because I learned how to quickly multi-task. The hardest part of the job was the closing part. Closing drive thru would have you washing dishes until 3 or 4 in the morning. Soaking wet and soggy and tired was not my favorite thing. However, the most enjoyable part of my job always made up for it My favorite thing about working at Wendy's was the great discounts on the food ! Even better was the manager that would let you take free food (;"
good,Coworkers are fun to work with and it is a well organized company that strives to maintain all our guests happy. Always making feel guests as employees feel at home. Quality of food is highly important.

good,everyday is different some of my co-workers are teen and they dont know how to act at a job site. l learn that all everyone is differnt you learn everyone likes there food different. the hardest part is trying to get things done when u have people who post to be working and they play around and the manger get after them but sometimes it doesn.t help. the most enjoyable is when u see the older couple comes in with the family and have a nice supper and hear them laughing
good,"I worked on saturday and sunday's"
good,dealing with customers and cash as well as taking orders. When a mistake is made in the order apologize to the customer and make sure the mistake is fixed and ensure the customers satisfaction so that they will come back. Most enjoyable part of the job is seeing a smile on the customers face.
good,Hard work pays make the business about your people and the customer the business will run itself numbers all of it will come together
good,"Good place to work. Has lots.of business and demands a fast paced employee. Equal opportunity and gives benefits to its employees. The hardest part of.the job is remembering everything that is to be done, and dealing with the attitudes that come at you each day."

I am constantly learning from my superiors how to improve with child conflicts, working as a team, and focusing on what is best for the child. I have been able to plan events, run conference calls, form trusting relationships with the children on my caseload, and pour my heart into my work. The most challenging part is desiring each child to have a loving family, but not being able to make that happen and seeing the disappointment on their face."

After lunch hour, I'll go to the drive thru and take orders, make the drinks and sometimes bag the food as well as, taking money and giving the change back.

When their were rushes, their would be a lot of people come in at one time it became hectic and no one really knew how to stay calm and work at a steady pace. As of management, they did an excellent job at being on top of every responsibility, including the assistant managers. The hardest part of the job is the ""RUSH"". Didn't seem as if people could get it together and take each order 2 at a time. Especially to keep up the pace. My co-workers were very nice and everyone got along just fine.

If we weren't busy, we were making sure that all of our work areas were stocked up and cleaned up. Since it was so fast paced, I learned how to work fast and in intense environments. The managers were always very helpful, some of the workers were not, but most of the time everyone helped everyone.

good,this company has great service as well as delicious food they taught me a good skill and how to deal with all kinds of people and personalities
good,My typical workday consists of me being there on time and punching in and being ready for my day. I get in my position and I am ready for my job that has to be completed. I have learned to just cope with whatever you are doing whether your frustrated or not. I always keep a smile on my face and I am friendly to everyone that I come across that day. I love everyone I work with. I mean you do come across the ones that are rude and think their better than everyone else but I ignore it and I and still nice and go on with my day. I love working with everyone and love interacting with all of the customers that I wait on for the day.

The hardest part of working at Wendy's is rude customer, you have to learn how to keep a smile and remember that the customer is always right."
good,I work alone so I know what needs my customers want before I start my day. Most of my customers are elderly so I like to ask how things are for them and what I can help them with first. They are always pleased at the end of my day.
good,It was a great job but sometime the customers were rude and loud and no respect.
good,"During the time I have worked at Wendy's was a great experience for me. I learned how to cook on the grill, become a better cashier, and a flexible employee on the job.

good,Great company to work for I enjoyed working with all of my co workers everyone worked with each other not against and everyone was able to communicate quite well and comfortably
good,"Wendy's was one place I liked to come into work to. The managers were nice and got things done without yelling at employees, they treated the employees with respect and they got respect back from the employees, Management knew I would get my job done without having to tell me (they knew I was the hardest worker on the crew at that time, and they knew I knew what to do, and when to do it) The whole store mentioned that I was the hardest and most dedicated worker on the crew. I actually cared about the store and the customers, the rest of the team only cared about getting payed I guess. I liked it because it was fast paced, I was always moving around working the fry station and the grill at the same time. Time went by fast because I always stayed busy which is why I liked always being busy and working my tail off for Wendy's. Wendy's was a good company to work for until a year into my employment they were getting rid of old management and replacing them with new management. The new managers were not nearly as good as the old management things did not get done around the store like they used to and employees weren't working like they used to or caring like they used to. So for that reason once new management came in I quit wendy's because they weren't managing crew or doing there job correctly like a manager should."

good,The co-workers was fun to talk to and work with. Having a bus coming in. The enjoyable part of the job was smile at the customer greet them and taking their order. The management was good no problems with that. I learned that you can't always be late be on time and don't call off if it's not important.

good,I ran the drive thru register. Since 6/10 co-workers happened to be close friends of mine our shift ran very smoothly. We had all known each other for min 7 years prior.

good,"I started out a crew member for grill. The rest of the staff noticed I could everything faster then the rest, and it was all about speed. I quickly advanced to Maintenance. My job was to make the store my own. I would clean every single part of that store. I learned through all my experience that I am a fast worker and get things done. Also I learned the value of team work, when you have a full lobby and a full drive through. It takes a team to get the work done. I would always jump in when necessary to get it accomplished. My management was my down fall for this company. When I started I had an excellent general manager, who cared and would work with you. When I finished, they brought a new manager in to ""clean house"". Basically getting rid of every other employee and hiring his kids in there place. On the other hand my co-workers were the very best. They all did there jobs and kept the store running. The most enjoyable part of this job was learning the fundamentals of team work. And being introduced to customer service for the first time. The co-workers were great, I remain friends with them to this day."
good,A typical day at Giant consist of going into work and reading what jobs had to be done before my shift was over. Managment was great seeing as though they trusted to leave us alone to get our work done. The hardest part of the day was always the clean-up part.

good,"A typical day at Wendy's is very fast pace. You see the same familiar faces, and so many different new ones. Working at Wendy's has given me the opportunity to learn what a family company is. It has built a trust between its workers and the company itself. Everyone is very supportive and there is always opportunity to expand and develop within the company. The best part about working here was the great customer face to face contact. To put a smile on someones face because they enjoyed the service and seeing them come back is always a plus."
good,"Front line and drive through crew member consisting of cashier, taking food orders, customer service, janitorial duties, customer service. Typical fast food service. Multi-tasking. I learned that when people get done shopping they get very hungry and always come in packs to the store. My managers and co workers are very fun to work with and when working with them we always have a good time.

The hardest part of my job was that the crew wasn't very friendly and I wasn't given a desired amount of weekly hours. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers. I love helping people and being a part of something that makes their day easier for them."
good,"Great job for high school or college students. Easy to move up if  you stay focused and work hard, "

I admire that in a company. unfortunately Life circumstances had pulled me away and I love the restaurant atmospher! I loved the challenges that fast foos offers as far as speed and customer service. You have no idea how good if feel to serve a great meal under 30 seconds. How good it feels to make others happy and how it feels to work together as a team to make it all happen."

good,Operate cash register
good,"After clocking in, I would normally go to the back, grab a headset and work in the drive thru, taking orders, or work on the front counter. I learned teamwork, how to deal with angry customers, and discipline. The managers were always tough on me, but I did what I had to, to make them satisfied with my work. My co-workers were always a pain to deal with, none of whom liked me. There were no breaks, and the manual labor was taxing. But the best part of the job is that rare moment when a customer smiles at you genuinely, and thanks you."

good,a typical day is customer based and fun feeled days and great customers.
good,"A typical day would be arriving saying hi to everyone, clocking in then getting my stuff and count my register and start taking orders. When there was no more customers I would start closing down certain things or start cleaning and restocking. Then if people arrive go back and help them. I also learned how to count money and also take orders and help around. Managers were somewhat nice at time but pretty nice to get along with. The coworkers were amazing some of them were, the morning people were sometimes mean and some on the afternoons. Hardest part of the job was like in the morning when the rush hour would come you have to be going at a super fast pace and also try to know who ordered what and which tray. The enjoyable time was when we closed and got to relax and clean but still help out thru the drive thru."
good,A typical day at work was fun and relaxing i like wendy because they understood i had a family and they try to give me as many hr as i wanted

The most enjoyable part of the job was my coworkers and managers."
good,"Never knew schedule from day to day"
good,"In my opinion, Wendy's is the best northwestern fast-food chain you can work for. You can tell right from the start that you are valued as an individual, rather than just another one in the dozens on their payroll. Filled with plenty of fun, wacky employees, you'll never go too long without a good laugh. In the end, however, it is still fast food. With that will always come the woes of understaffing, drama, and questionable management."
good,Wendy's was a great place to work made some great friends I enjoyed working with managers they would give me a assignment and leave me to do what was expected of me I will miss working with Wendy's they gave me the tools and training for cashier positions and trained me on the sandwich station thank you for all you gave me to work in fast food industry Wendy's i was trained in other positions as well God bless you Wendy's managers and co - workers

good,"I started when I was in High School and worked years for low pay. I suggested that if you live at home with parents and in school it would be a Good thing because it will build your character and work ethic, but if you have kids and Bills I wouldn't suggested making a career out of because the pay is okay but you can make more money by working somewhere in a factory or manufacturing plant. You live pay check to paycheck and be behind and plus if the store doesn't make money you will not get a raise probably for years."
good,"Throughout my time at Wendy's, I am understanding the importance of providing great customer service.  Customers will continue to come back to the restaurant when you acknowledge them and help them with their concerns along with serving great food.  Along with this, Wendy's has shown me what it truly takes to be a great team member with your crew.  Working together always makes a difference. a difference"

good,I think Wendys company is great it taught me teamwork and how to maintain self control and great communication skills. It help me to understand others and the meaning of getting work done.
good,"People are great to work with, some of the management could use work. Some do nothing at all and some don't care to do their job correctly. They're losing a lot of good people because of it."
good,It’s fun working at this job especially been a manager even thou it has its challenges but that’s what makes you into a better leader the challenges dealing with angry customers and the others that just don’t make any sense but other wise from that it’s a great experience and a fun culture to be in
good,If you asked me if I would go back and work for Wendy's I would tell you yes I would that job changed me boring life coming up for my first job and third job I loved thee atmosphere and everyone I worked with loved me cause I was fast paced in all positions but more faster on register then all my co-workers working for Wendy's was enjoyable and made my day everyday
good,"In the beginning, I was very nervous to start my job. However, the management team and my fellow crew members made me feel comfortable instantly. They taught me a lot and never failed to give constructive criticism when needed."
good,It is a great place to work and always has availability to move forward in the company. The environment and crew are always wonderful and welcoming to those who work there.
good,"My experience working at Wendy's was stressful but what made it great was my coworkers, although the fast paced environment was very stressful at times my coworkers really pulled through and made my time working here great!"
good,"Great family geared establishment, feeding families for about $4. Ea or could do less even! Great to work for understanding and willing to work with u and management team was helpful and worked along side us! Very good to work for. A huge blessing in my life and would have still been working there without a life situation that forced me to leave!!"
good,Before I started working at Wendy's I had no fast food experience. I knew I would have to pick everything up fast because Wendy's is all about urgency. Within a very short time of my employment I was offered the position of being a manager. Being in fastfood you learn the importance of team work and leadership. Being noticed for my hard work was very important to me. always willing to learn new things
good,Loved opening and closing shifts. You get to put in your headphones and do your work. You usually get the same position when you work. Discounts included for on shift meals.

I still remained humble and didn't allow that to discourage me."

good,"Really good job to gain some experience, especially for high schoolers. Don’t expect to make a career and finance your whole life off of it though. Hard work is rewarded"
good,Wendys is a great place and to meet New People. Staff are friendly pay always had been nice and it was great way to interact your coworkers who never or doesnt interact with others.
good,When I was hired the job was being mangenged the roght way for a business but since several different general managers walk in and out it hasn’t been the same for a business should be being run the right way it needs to be
good,I'm not speaking French so when i try to join company in canada they insist I must speak French not English 😓 so I can't work there . it's a fun place the staff is really supportive in lakeway Wendys

good,I would definitely work at a Wendy's again if I didn't stop working there due to relocation. The staff were friendly although I would have preferred the jokes they made to be more appropriate.
good,It was a great place to work at however I've worked at the same location twice and has had trouble with a shift manger which is why I left (Different Mangers both times) The gm of the store is fair and friendly as well as the district manger. Employees do come and go but they are hardly ever understaffed. good place to work at if your young and can handle being mistreated by shift mangers behind the gm's back.
good,"I have worked at Wendy’s since my Senior year of high school. The managers at my location have always made everyone feel like family. They always work around our school schedules and are agreeable to giving students plenty of time to work on schooling (i.e days off during midterms and finals). It has been pretty great working there these past few years."
good,Its a good place to work because of the good people and work environment I enjoy it it's fun and everyone is great and gets along. We try to improve everything day by day as a team and be there for each other
good,"My review at Wendy’s is a a-ok job, it’s just the night shift when the customers come in drunk before our shift is over and we never get off on time. But the job is good."
good,"Was very productive and time consuming to work at, very professional, safe, sanitary, and had great management. I would recommend working there for any person needing a job."
good,"A typical day working at Wendy's is pretty fast paced, but it is a great work environment when you are surrounded by a friendly staff. The management is good, plus there are benefits for sick days. I definitely recommend this job."

good,I love working for Wendy’s. The hours could be greater in that we don’t work more than 28 a week. But Wendy’s will always be a great place to eat and work. They provide opportunities for advancement and recognize those that work harder everyday to better theirselves and their work ethic.
good,"Fun environment, outgoing workers, team building every weekend, many opportunities for advancement with in the company, constantly learning new things."

good,very friendly coworkers. great atomsphere. they were willing to help if you needed it. very fun atmosphere. they know how to ake care of their customer ad make them feel welcome.
good,Everyone there is friendly and hardworking. The managers made working there very easy every day. I would recommend working there over any other fast food place. It's straight forward and easy unlike other fast food restaurants.
good,For the first it was a good experience I would recommend someone to work there. The manager will actaullay work with you and be very understanding cause we’re human and w still go threw thing so yeah
good,The Wendy's Company treats there co workers like family and the work together to get the job done. It is a good learning experience and team work is awesome.
good,"Nice company to work for, advancement is achievable ,there is always opportunity for advancement. On the job training is provided. Company provides uniforms."
good,I liked Wendy’s the were just a little to mean like the manager was talking to me any kind of way and I didn’t like it but I was getting paid they right amount
good,"Dont get me wrong, wendys was a good start for me with that being my first job. but it do get real busy working there, especially on the weekends but the team members always maintain to get through the day."
good,"Great place to develop your skills in relationship building. You deal with a lot of different owners and operators in multiple states. You get to see multiple people grow and improve, based on your feedback. You play a huge part on ensuring restaurants are operating to the Wendy's standard."
good,"Worked at Wendys for 5 years, this including throughout high school and then returning in the summer between school years of university! Loved working for this company and the management"
good,Workes at wendys had a good time. Nice people to work with. Nice managers and customer . quick paced . didnt give too many hours .  nice job .good people
good,Wendy's is very fast paced and u have to be on your toes all time. Fun and exciting place to work. Plenty of room for advancement as well as promoting with in the company before hiring out of company.
good,This is a great place to work everyone tries to get along very well.I know sometimes work get’s over whleming at times the manager’s there try there very best to coup with things
good,The company itself is a wonder place to work but the franchises can ruin it. Working at a corporate location comes with much more chances at advancement.
good,It is a fun and fast paced environment that I loved and would recommend to anyone! Good hours and nice pay overall. It was temporary for me while finishing school.
good,"Worked there a long long time ago. Started as a crew member and was promoted to shift supervisor. Could have moved up in the ranks in I stayed with them,"
good,The nights would be busy but fast paced. There was always something to do. The coworkers made the atmosphere good to be around. Some nights were slow to the point where I was able to close some stations down earlier than usual.
good,Great place for growth and advancement if you want it. Treated right. Training great hard work deffinately recognized and noticed at the San Angelo location
good,"a lot of the time spent at Wendy's is in the company of like-minded individuals. Tones of time to learn more about the fast food industry. the place is crawling with plenty of management personnel trying to help you come up in the company it can almost feel like you are a part of a family of all walks of life. ever so often you will face hardships and trouble like situations, but that is part of the front line of customer service is to not make the customer feel bad but better than when they walked through wendy's doors."
good,"Wendy's was always my 2nd job and the allowed me to work very flexible hours. I did this off and on for 20 plus years. I really enjoyed working here and i actually started as an employee and then became a shift manager. I think this really allowed me to say I have been you the employees shoes ,so it help me to better manage the employees."
good,"My management was phenomenal. My GM had been with the company for 18 years and our DM was amazing. Evey job gets stressful at times but both the training processes down to the final details of the register operations was well organized compared to most quick-service restaurants. As a Crew Leader but not a Shift Lead, I made a decent wage and they often give recognition to employees doing good work. When the company is organized and training is done properly, it was a much better experience than most places. The most enjoyable part was the type of people I was able to meet, from my managers, to regulars that would come in and be on a first name basis. Sometimes the most difficult part, as with most customer service, is remaining in a positive, friendly, and supportive tone with unsatisfied customers. Knowing why things are and how things are is the best way to help those customers and ensure that you will fix the problems to the best of your abilities. Overall, I greatly enjoyed my time at Wendy's."
good,"My review on Wendy's is that it is a very good place to go if you are looking to relax and enjoy your fresh sandwiches. You can watch tv or talk to the workers."
good,"didn't mind working at wendys i was younger at the time so it was just a job while i was in college and just finished high school, but the people i worked with made it amazing and the management was so great and they are very flexible"
good,I started with Wendys. They gave me my first pay raise. My first promotion. And my first true chance to prove myself. I graduated high school while worling within the franchise. I felt so at home and the other employees and managers were always a huge part of my support team. It truly is more than a simple fast fokd chain. They strive to create an environment you would want to work in.
good,"Wendy’s was my first job, the day of my interview I was told I got the job I was so excited. It was a fun fast past job. Always was busy. I got to experience how to do different positions at Wendy’s. I think the best was opening. Loved the lunch rush made the day go by fast."
good,"I worked at the fry station and the burger station, so I scooped the fries on the monitor and brought them to the according place wether it was driver thru or for the customers who were eating in. on the grill station I had to make sure there were always fresh patties on the grill waiting to be served."
good,enjoyed working in the kitchen as it was a fast-paced job and was able to deliver food on time to the customers and the management was friendly and understanding

good,Managers are very fun and nice. The GM is understanding of situations. They work with your schedule and change your availability whenever needed. I enjoy working there

good,"During my time as a cashier at Wendy's, I learned how to multi-task, maintain a clean workspace, properly serve/handle customers, make sales, and clean a dining room"
good,"Everyone works as a team and puts the customers first. It was an organized work place and you knew what was expected of you. Overall, it was a positive experience."

good,Working at Wendy's was a satisfying experience in the aspect that it was one of my first jobs and I had a great time learning how the fast food industry kind of worked. It was a very healthy environment and the co-workers were kind and had good intentions. The managers were very understanding and spent a lot of time getting to know and understand their employees better. I really enjoyed my experience there.

I like working with fast-paced company, keeps me busy durning the day, helped co-workers with the stations, help customers, keeping my stations clean and organized.

I learned to move at a quick pace, and how to do it effectively. The environment there was wonderful. The managers were always amazing at explaining different things and how to make a situation better. They also taught me different tricks at remembering what goes on what sandwich. I couldn't be more happy with my first job and I'm glad it was at Wendy's."
good,what i learned was that i had to have people skills and work at a very fast paced and keep up with my tasks that were asigned to me and to always work as a team
good,Very fast paced but a fun place to work. They have pretty flexible hours and will work around your schedule. If you are looking to move up in the company it is very easy to move up.
good,"Great company to work for, only downside was the pay. I worked nights and usually didn't have enough staff to cover a rush, which involved me exhausting myself most nights. Other than that, they work well with scheduling and management is wonderful"
good,Towards the end of my career at Wendy's the managers where harassing me and my fiance (who worked with me at the time) and didn't do anything about any problems
good,i think is a good place to work learn a lot about other people and their culture and the best part always have fun. and the food is great management vary store to store
good,I enjoyed my job at wendys. I particularly liked the managment team that I had the pleasure of working with. I however left for a career that could offer me health insurance benefits. If I was eligible for these benefits at Wendy's I don't think I would've looked for any other employment. Working at Wendy's was still one of the best jobs in my opinion.
good,"i love the Wendy company , It was great work experience for mw the employees where  amazing but at the time i was working there the mangement was unrule"

good,Wendy's is the best first job anyone could get! It teaches you all about food and how to be clean. It also teaches you the leadership role and how to work as a team.
good,I honestly loved working at this location and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a job in the Pocatello Idaho area. The managers were very fair and tried to keep everyone's mood and attitudes lifted.
good,I feel like this job pushed me to the point where i wanted to quit but also pushed me to do better improve my skills and work harder to reach my goal of doing better
good,Everyone is friendly and we work as a team.Crew have to work with each other .The number one goal is to satisfy customer and let them have a great experience so they will come back .
good,"I learned a lot about team work at Wendy's. I learned that if one person is not paying attention to what is being ordered, than that portion of the process will lag behind."
good,Good place to work get fired very easily over stupid reasons hard to get along with managers rude main manager and didn’t care about part time people.
good,"When I first come in, depending on the day it’s usually slow, which isn’t so bad. They taught me how to be more open and they helped me come out my shell, the hardest part about the job was drive thru but over all coming to work wasn’t bad"
good,"Must be willing to work s team member. It's and very fast pace work environment. Customer friendly , but they will get a bit rude just look over it and continue with your day without letting an unhappy customer make you an unhappy crew member."
good,"The people, as well as the managers, made the work day enjoyable. We made sure we did what we needed to do but at the same time had a happy work environment."
good,"I’m one of the best workers my managers said, so I got gull days and worked often. Walking in I was always greeted with a smile and always went straight to work. Hardest part of the job was dealing with other employees who didn’t do their job very well so I was often handling multiple positions at once."
good,Wendy’s was a very nice place to work. Manament was always understandable. My co-workers were also good to work with. I learned a lot of things working with Wendy’s.
good,Management was super nice and really flexible with hours. Slow paced. No benefits and min. wage. Overall I enjoyed working there. Everyone was close and fun to work with.

good,Great place to work time goes fast because its always busy Learn who to manage your time and multitask efficiently theirs always an opportunity to grow with the company
good,"A typical day would just be coming in and making sure your station was stocked and ready to go throughout the shift and that we met all time goals on serving fresh product to every customer. I learned how to multi-task and work under stress. I also learned how to handle conflict with customers. Management was there to teach and support you and when problems arise, they would then step in. They just oversee everything. I think the hardest part of the job was just being able to withstand a rush without a strong team and everyone doing their job. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get to eat for 50 percent off and that you get to learn how to work under pressure."
good,Wendy's is a great company to work for with great compensation. You're offered many different opportunities to advance in the company as well as options to relocate. Unfortunately because of the commute I'm looking for other Job opportunities but if I lived closer I would definitely stay with the Company
good,"Lo que aprendí gracias a este empleo fue que el cliente siempre tiene la razón, por lo tanto hay que tratarlo con el respeto que merece siempre"

good,The days at work would be fun with my coworkers still making times and learning new activities and experiencing new ideas . Managers are very hard working and serious but also know how to make the work day exciting . The hardest part was mostly when it got busy and we received new people but of course the were a joy and the most enjoyable was meeting new people and bonding with daily customers.
good,The days at wendys are very nice. i enjoy the people and managers. i have learned to maintain a clean work environment and also cooking. the most difficult part is running all stations while someone is on break.
good,I was greatful working there.. It was a great fit for a moment but got an offer for management. And decided. To take the jump. I would have no problem retuening bacl to the company
good,Wendy’s isn’t a bad job to work at it’s just the customers that make it a place not to work at. Their rude and disrespectful and don’t care about people’s times.
good,I would just want to work without people distracting me like in the back just cleaning the dishes and sweeping and mopping I really don't talk unless i have to.
good,The general manager wasn't too kind and very judgmental. I don't feel she valued her co-workers or teammates. She had several complaints on her and sometimes made it uneasy to work with her.

good,"It was a summer job for me in high school in which you learn the basics of a work environment, it teaches you to e fast paced and maintain multiple tasks at one time."
good,"i reallly loved working at Wendy's until I got another Distreict manager.  he was prejudice and my biggest competition when he was a general manger.  The new managers that I had under me were scheming to get me fired and they achieved this goal.  i was a good manager who ran my nmbers and was rewarded with bonuses, paid trips by company, and raises for a job well dome.  Everything was going well until I got the new District Manager who fired me because my managers let some employees work off the cloc(I didn't know always happened when I was gone)"
good,"its been a great opportunity to work here all these years. the company cares for its employees, plenty of opportunity for advancement. if you like fast pace work this would be for you."

good,"was a little uneasy with it being my first job but co workers made work fun and easy and once i got comfortable being in a work tormentor i was the most productive worker they had, was going to becoming into a shift manager/management position but ended up leaving to work else where would have been nice to see where that would have went"
good,I would worked for this place for about three months and it was a good healthy enviorment for me i loved it becuase everybody was friendly and nice and ahead in what they were supposed to do.
good,Everyone here works hard and it shows. This store was #2 in Texas for customer service and excellence. Work environment was warm and friendly.
good,"I enjoyed working for the store I worked at, the team was great everyone pulled their own weight, it was like a big work family there. There's not a lot of benefits for employees under management though."
good,"This job was very hard to handle. You had so much to do and much time to do it , but this is a job that can have you handling multiply things at once.  This job had me on my feet and busy something I like to make customers happy and have them come back with positive things"
good,"I enjoy working in service industry; seeing new faces everyday and returning customers. Some days were tough learning the ropes, but easy to get the hang of. Fast food is a good experience for young people to learn communication and basic math skills. Wendy's as a restaurant is a nice change to the typical McDonald's. We served better food (my opinion) and we did our best to make sure every customer left with a smile."
good,My summary says all that needs said. Look it's fast food. It sucks sometimes but if you need a job this is a good place to go.
good,I enjoyed working for Wendy's the manager was fun and very understanding. I was comfortable working with this manager never felt judged or discriminated by him.
good,This job gives me opportunity to work with the public and meet different people. There is always something to work on and be better at. It was long hours and always get alone with everyone. I'm a people person. Management communicated efficiently and was great to their employees. Coworkers knew their jobs and were like a little family. I enjoyed the fast paced environment.
good,It was a really good experience for a first-time job. I really enjoyed working at Wendy's and learned many qualities of customer service and leadership. The best part was getting to meet new people to work with because they were all mostly my age. The hardest part was that it was always fast-paced and did not get many breaks.
good,"great day"
good,Although very diverse and inviting the wendy's career path is not suited for everyone i would honestly recommend it to highschool students or college students who want to make a little cash on the side anyone supporting a family wouldn't really benefit from them unless you had manager experience
good,excelente equipo de trabajo aunque la paga no es tan buena siempre estamos ocupado haciendo nuestros deberes con gerentes estrictos que llevan una excelente liderazgo dentro de la empresa.
good,"Everyone I worked with were very humble and kind. We became like a family. I've learned a lot there, such as how to be responsible, how to have patient and how to deal with customers the right way."
good,i loved my job my gm understood wen i was un able to come to work or wen i had to leave early do to my daughter was very ill.wen i was able to go to work i did what i was asked and i learned very fast at everything i was being trained on
good,"A Typical day at work would be coming in and getting prepared for my position at the time. As a manager there were always a million thing to get done, but with the help and compliance of my fellow coworkers everything was able to get completed in a timely manner."
good,A typical day there was also busy but I didn't mind I rather stay busy. My co-workers were always nice I enjoyed their company. I learned a lot like working hard paid off and staying focus was something I'm actually good.
good,Excelent company to work very friendly and respetful a little be stresful with task of a drive thru service time. It is a good bonuses with oportuniteisto move up
good,"I worked for Wendy's for 3.5 years: as a cashier when I attended college and then as a team member after I graduated. All of the managers I worked with were excellent leaders and made the work environment friendly, but organized. When I needed a job, the district manager agreed to hire me again after I quit. I had the chance to be trained as a manager, but due to my own lack of initiative, never achieved it. Overall I enjoyed the years I spent there, and I would work for them again."
good,i have enjoyed working at Wendys  because of the great work environment  and the great employees and the management was a great experience .
good,"a typical day at work was serving and helping customers anyway i can. i learned how to work together to get the job done. management was very respectful. everyone got along with me, i always got the job done and didnt have any problems getting along with others."
good,they are a excellent place to work for you do a lot of traveling and meet a lot of different people it is easy to moving up and pay is determined on your work ethics
good,Typical day is either busy or not. i learned almost every position besides the register. Management is good and so are the co-workers

good,They are flexible and understanding. I really like management I get along with them very good. The people that work there are nice and cool. Never had any problems at wendys so far.
good,"A typical day at work: Routine, Easy"
good,I was responsible everyone else was on a different agenda I enjoyed cooking beef paddies and fries along with chicken the hardest part of the job was cleaning up after the store was closed because I was left to do all the work while other employees' stood around but no complaining I always finished with no disrespect just silent working skills.

good,"I liked working on a flexible schedule, I learned a lot about customer service, management was great giving the fact we where a very busy location, I enjoy people there for my co worker were awesome I enjoy challenges, one thing I dislike was unsatisfied customer or just grumpy people in general. I enjoy all the people and fast past work"
good,"un dia tipico de trabajo en esa sucursal en particular es muy activo, debido a que se encuentra a un lado de un cine, por lo tanto hay mucho movimiento, trabajo sobre presión, pues cada cliente quiere de una forma diferente sus alimentos y debemos hacerlo en un tiempo aproximado de medio minuto para ser entregado en tiempo y forma después de pagar los alimentos."
good,"Wendy's was my first job and it was fun. It taught me responsibility, the real value of a dollar and most importantly it taught me how to become indenpendent."
good,"It was hard at times, but I can get through the day. The only hard part of the job is the rush, & the rude customers."
good,"It was a great experience working at Wendys, learned many new different things, I learned how to deal with many different people and managers. We got 50% off on our lunches. The only cons about this was the way people treated you sometimes."
good,"My typical day at work was usually the same position everyday I go to work it was okay for me. I've learned many things, even when you are trying your best to deal with costumers and making them smile and feel good where they at... My co-workers were really helpful and a great people hat I met.. The hardest part of the job was nothing really since I've been working for 3 years in Wendy's. My enjoyable of the job is that I'm a great team member to be working on a fast food and making the costumers feel good.. But I know I could try something new to work on my life. Meaning I love working at Wendys but I really want to start new thing to do.."
good,I  worked hard when I went  into Wendys   I learned to get along better with the people I work for  The management was very good.My co-workers were okay to work with The hardest part of the job was doing the cashier job hade to make sure the drawer was correct at the end of the shift.  I enjoyed meet ing  people that came  into order an working with my  co-workers
good,"i am still having an amazing experience, i have learned to deal with customer frustration and provide an efficient service under pressure. It's a good place to feed yourself, they always care about customer and food quality"
good,Working at Wendys for 2 years was great when i was going to school. I worked with a lot of nice friendly people all the time great place to work part time.

good,"Really enjoyed the atmosphere working with crew and management"
good,"I enjoyed this job a lot."
good,Wendys is a fun place to work with the people there. You get to love your customers as you would get your regulars for lunch everyday. You would learn what certain customers would want for lunch before they reach the register. This is a place where you could grow in the business. They recognize their workers. Hardest part of the job is letting the customers always be right even when you know they are wrong.
good,"Love this place, part of a team, easy to talk to managers, flexible work schedule. Personal growth within restaurant has built my confidence way up."
good,"Wendy's very fast paste work not time to slow down team work its the key to success in this type of job, you learn and grown and see that all the hard work owners and company CEO see it right when they walk in one of their locations."
good,"I enjoyed this job. I was a fin environment to work at. I learned a lot of things. Like taking orders from the drive thru front and back. Management was great, but there's always that one you have issues with. Got along great with my co-workers but they were all younger than myself except for a few. I really enjoyed working front counter and meeting lots of new people. The hardest was running drive thru for an entire shift."
good,Had fun working to jobs an going to school an still made the workers and the customers happy in a good clean place... I love everything about working no complaining with anything I done ..
good,I had a great experience at Wendys. At the time the restaurant was just built and The management did a great job hiring good-hardworking people.
good,"Wendy's was a great place to work! The hours were very flexible and the management was the best I have ever encountered. My co-workers were kind and polite, never rushing me or asking me for too much, and the part time experience I had was one of the best I've gone through."
good,"Wendy's was the first real job I'd ever had. When I first started, I was new to the concept of working and trying to fit everything into my schedule was difficult. Typically, after I became a manager, I would come into the store, count the safe, print out the paperwork I would have to complete, do a walkthrough, let employees go home and greet the employees coming in. I learned a lot during my almost 6 years there. I learned not to judge people based on appearance, how to manage and maintain a beautiful store and how to be courteous. My co-workers and store manager were the best people I've ever worked with. The hardest part of the job was trying to fit everything into my crazy school schedule and the most enjoyable part was getting to work with some of the best people."
good,I was in charge of either opening or closing the store.  I ordered inventory and was in charge of hiring and training new employees.  I kept the store clean while providing excellent customer service.  The hardest part was lifting the boxes to put away inventory and my favorite part of the job was getting to know the customers.
good,Because I like what I was doing so it was really fun place for me. I worked the 3rd shift. It is a hamburger place where I helped with the register and then help clean after we close.
good,"Flexible hours, fun environment, great management team. Easy going place to work with advancement opportunities. Always fast paced shifts, ever changing."
good,"I loved working at Wendy's.  Nearly everyone was kind and friendly.  It was a job that judged you on how well you worked, not how friendly you were with the boss.  If it only paid enough for me to hire someone to watch my daughter, I would still be there."
good,"Wendys wasn't your typical everyday, How may I help you work enivorment. The managers and co workers helped out alot. If you needed something and was busy and couldn't get it, someone was there to help you out."
good,"I enjoyed working at wendys very much, I also had the pleasure to manage the shop in warnbro and I can honestly say the environment the owner works in and has her employees work in is fantastic. all very hard working girls."
good,"Wendys days at work are fast pace, hard work pays off is what I've learned my management team very supportive the co workers are very hard workers that is what I loved about Wendy's, hard part about trying to be on time opening the store and having all he product ready, I enjoyed coming to work to meet friendly faces."
good,My Day Would Usually Start With A Store Walk.I Would Walk The Parking lot On To The Drive Thru For Trash and Debre.Then The Inside If the Store For the Same.Product Count Making Sure We Had enough TO Cover Entire Days Of Work.Cash Control.I Was Encourage Daily By My Management Team Some More Willing Than Other But Everybody Helped.Great Team Smiles And Hard Workers.Hardest Thing Was That One Customer Who Was There For 10 Seconds But Made It Feel Like 15 Mins Completely Unsatisfiable.It Help Me learn Alot About Any Buisness
good,"fantastic opportunities, the new management, co workers were the BEST, lots of hard working people working in the stores, you get to help develop so many young people who move on to become leaders, that is by for the best part of my job!"
good,I enjoy working with a company that I am able to grow in. I am open minded and a risk taker. I like to be active and on going on a typical day of work.
good,I will take orders and then when dinning room is close i will clean that and then help with bagging and making food and do dishes.
good,It was very fast pace it was very fun to work for Wendy's it was great watching the customers smile when got good quality food on time overall a great place to work learned a lot of management skills at this job as well
good,"Wendy's is an amazing company to work for. I have learned a lot of skills, that will last a life time. While working at Wendy's there  dull moment, was never a dull moment the co-workers as well as the customers were always respectful. My managers always made sure every crew member accomplished their desired goal throughout the day."
good,A normal work day for me at Wendy's would consist of getting to work 6-7 ish doing all of my early morning perp work for the first few hours of the day
good,"wash dishes and food off for prep"
good,I worked here during summer vacation and loved it! I would have to loved to continue working here with my co-workers if school hadn't started back up. Everybody was friendly and the customer were fun. My organization skills and time management abilities during rush periods improved drastically thanks to my position in the company.
good,The job was very busy and demanding. What I learned is to make sure the customer is satisfied with their order.  Management was great. Co-workers were good and helpful. The hardest part of the job was making sandwiches because there's so many types of hamburgers and you had to be fast paced to get them done.  The most enjoyable was greeting the customers . They always liked my accent from Virginia.
good,"10 hour shift but stayed busy which I enjoyed. I like the training that I got, time management, employee training, customer service, the rush. I worked my way from a asst. manager to co manager within a year, then went to a co training to general manager. I was tough but my employees respected me because I was more hands on than a office manager. Don't get that wrong I did my office work but I think customer service is more important. Being short staffed was the hardest but you do the best you can. Working as a team from inspection."
good,"Working for Wendy's has taught me to work more as a team and care for each other like family. Wendy's has also taught me to have great customer service and to always wear a smile on my face. While working for Wendy's I was able to enhance my experience in cash handling, management, time management, multi-tasking, and of course customer service!"
good,"very fun people to work, with, managers were great, and the experience was great"
good,"Relaxed, fast paced, flexible schedule, get paid bi weekly"
good,"In my opinion, it was the best first job anyone could ask for. They gave me enough training, both on the computer and on the job. They gave me good hours. My managers balanced being nice while stressing how hard everyone needs to work pretty well. My coworkers who had second jobs had their schedule worked around to accommodate that. My class schedule rarely got in the way of my work schedule, but they also worked around that."
good,"The most typical day at work here was the rush and flooding of animals getting their baths,i learned the importance of helping the animals and the certain techniques and ways to bathe an animal. Management was kept in line well.the most enjoyable part of working there was playing with the animals afterwards."
good,"A typical day at work is fast-based environment depending on the day. What I learned at Wendy's are customers service skills, patience, and learned how to work in a fast-based environment. I liked certain managers more than other, but overall they all had respect which i appreciate. The co-workers was funny people to work with. The hardest part of the job at first was the fast-based environment, but I quickly learned to adapt. The most enjoyable part of the job will be the customers giving me compliments on my great customer service skills I give to them and the check I receive every two weeks."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of coping in a fast paced environment while maintaining customer interaction. Preparing and receiving orders while perfecting time management. As well as processing payments while working on multitasking skills. While working in such a team oriented environment I gained knowledge on skills such as, time management, multitasking, cleaning, organization, customer service, team building and much more. The management team at Wendy's was exceptional and contributed to all of the skills I gained knowledge on as well as all co-workers. The hardest part about the job was being able to receive and ring up orders while processing payments for previous orders all while maintaining customer interaction through the drive thru speaker and at the window. The most enjoyable part of the job was the challenges given each day as well as the need to multitask in a timely manner and consistently maintaining customer interactions."
good,A typical day for me at Wendy's would start at 6am with opining the store and making sure that the grill was clean and ready and also that the oil was changed out if needed. and also I cleaned the parking lot. and at 10 am I take orders in the drive thru till 4 pm.
good,"Wendy's is an extremely difficult job, but once you get it right it can be very fulfilling.  There is definitely opportunity for advancement. The hardest part of the job is finding good employees. Best part of the job is developing employee potential."
good,Very friendly staff everyone is very personal. They also care for all workers and are very considerate on scheduling only on certain days.
good,"Over all a very structured environment. The managers were very organized and knew what they were doing. Sometimes the co workers did not always want to do what they were asked and the managers knew exactly what precautions to take. The hardest part was when we were short handed things sometimes got chaotic. I Liked when we were busy. This kept everyone on track and helped time move faster. I love to move around and i can always find something to do. I have adopted a popular saying from my previous job, ""if you have time to lean, you have time to clean."""
good,The workplace is fantastic and the co-workers are very friendly. Managing the food service to the customers made my management part very strong.
good,"Great to see the same faces everyday and to be able to enjoy yourself but the unprofessional things became too much. Overall I enjoyed working for Wendy's but I knew it wasn't something I thought about as a ""long term position""."
good,work shifts 10  hours  keep store accuracy and clean keep customer happy
good,"I have no complaints with working with Wendy's. I enjoyed working with all my co workers. I liked management at times it could be stressful but , I liked it . the hardest part of the job was in management when you were not aloud to fraternize out side of work with the employees ."
good,cleaning and cooking and watching eldery people meeting new people
good,"I've learned the front cashier, fries, and food prep positions. The management was amazing, knew the difference between fun and work. The co-workers were very helpful and answered any questions I had. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the long lines when it was busy, but I did very well under pressure. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning different positions that I could."
good,"I started working for Wendy's back in 2005, It was my first job.  My typical day at this establishment was fast paced and very out-going in customer service."
good,"I ran various shifts of 5-20 staff. I was responsible for hiring, firing, training, deposits and tills, cleanliness, safety of staff and customers, stock, profit and loss, product quality and appearance, etc. Our management team was friendly and worked well together. Our staff was enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of this job was keeping watch over a large area to assure Health Codes were maintained. The most enjoyable part of this job was working with people."
good,"It was my first job, I learned about work ethics and valuable qualities of an employee. A typical day at work I would go in and begin to start on prep for that day. The management always challenged us to do better, and the crew usually got along and got the job done."
good,"I will show up to work and help set up the store to make things like vinaigrettes for some of the new salads that we sold. I would also take orders from customers, make drinks, prepare fries, restock, clean, fill orders, and much more. I learned ingredients to our sandwiches and how to make them, how to use the computers to take orders, and how to effectively work in a team-based workplace. The Wendy's management was great! I enjoyed working with my managers, they were helpful and positive when teaching me about the workplace. The hardest part of working at Wendy's was the high-stress times of lunch hour on busy days. It sometimes felt like no matter how fast you worked, that the line of customers never ended, so you just needed to work faster and harder to get all the customers fed. The most enjoyable part of the job was having multiple customers speaking to me during the day saying ""Wow! You are an excellent worker"" or ""I really appreciate you working so hard."" Hearing compliments from customers that are pleased with my customer service makes me feel very fulfilled with the work that I've done."
good,"This was a great career experience.  I assisted all facets of the business from operations to training, human resources and maintenance.  Every day was filled with something new to do.  "
good,"A typical day at work would be separated into two alternating segments. One of them was the hard-working interval, where the restaurant had to keep up with the demands and everyone on the crew worked together to meet these demands as quickly and efficiently as possible; we were such a good team. The other segment would be the more relaxed stage, where although we still had duties, we could carry them out while laughing and talking with each other. The typical day at work was fantastic."
good,I loved working for Wendy's. The employees got along well and worked great together. I loved the fast paced environment.
good,Wendy's always has fresh fries and meat cooking. Salad is prepped daily and thrown out at closing. The store is always clean and the managers are nice.
good,"Over all a fantastic place to work. The general manager, as well as assistant manager were the best superiors I have ever had. Always motivating and inspiring. Always made the work place a group effort and managers were on line with employees helping and giving examples of quality work. Co-workers could be unmotivated at times but over all easy to work with. I learned a lot during my time at Wendys. Almost every aspect of running and maintaining a fast food restaurant, time efficiency, customer service skills. The hardest part of the job was learning to balance the multiple tasks given, but not enough to not be capable of being done on time or correctly."
good,"Wendy's was my first ""real"" job, and it was a very humbling experience. Working up from crew to crew leader to management, I saw a lot of people come and go. This made a typical day hard because you never knew who was not going to come into work that day."
good,A place where everyone feels like family. Managers and supervisors treats you like family. Serve customers in a friendly and timely manner. Cooking and preparing food to serve our hungry people on the road. Customer service was amazing.
good,I enjoyed working with the customers and crew.  Management worked with the employees.
good,most enjoyable part of my day was interacting with customers and making sure all of their needs were met and executed.
good,At Wendy's I learned to work in a fast paced environment and how to deal with difficult customers. The best part of working at Wendy's was when it was crowded and my co-workers and I worked as a team and had fun making the orders. The looks on the customers faces were priceless especially difficult customers because they wondered how my job could be fun but making the customers happy was my job and it was fun. It was easy to do with the vibrant personalities of my co-workers also.
good,"This wendy's was fun to work at as well,had awesome management and employees,everyone got along just fine and also made friendships outside of work."
good,its basic you pretty much deal with coustomers hands on shoowing the most customer service and working in a fast paced envorinment
good,"My typical day there was to get there at 9:00 am. Prepare to cut fresh lettuce, onions, tomatoes, make salads, and back up of each. At least three or four than attend to the customers and their needs. clean prep and get things ready for the next shift."
good,"Getting the store ready for opening.  Interviewing, hiring, training and scheduleing. Cash and inventory conrtol"
good,The typical work day involved cooking and taking out cash register orders
good,"Very great work environment, fast pace but management was very on point and created a great aroma throughout the restaurant. Daily routine was carrying out prep and cleaning duties, inventory and dish washing. Management and co workers both helped and eased the new hire process and helped me transition very smoothly. hardest part, detailing oven racks nightly. most enjoyable, enjoying looking at the shining oven racks."
good,"making all the prep for the day. that there all cultures on this earth and you need to get along with everyone. I loved my bosses they made the job fun, some of the coworkers were good and some weren't, there was no hard parts . the most enjoyable part was sitting down on break and get to know my bosses"
good,"het mogen mee gaan op cursusdag naar het Alzheimercongres."
good,"Open resturant make sure everything is ready to serve customers at open time. I learned how to handle cash, inventory, food waste and supervise. My co-workers were the best always in a good mood. The hardest part of the job was asking other stores for product. I enjoyed making customers happy"
good,I enjoyed working at Wendy's but did not enjoy the management who were also bullying myself and others
good,i loved working here. we always had fun but we always got our work done. the managers were great i had a few favorites. the part i enjoyed the most is i got along with most of the people
good,"Working in a fast food restaurant isn't glamorous and it can hardly be considered skilled work. However, there is flexibility in scheduling work time which makes it a perfect job for high school students who can earn money and gain valuable customer service experience. Fast food workers take and fill customers' orders for food and drinks. They assemble some items, for example sandwiches and salads. They also collect payment. In addition, they maintain dining areas which includes clearing and cleaning tables, emptying trash cans and washing or vacuuming floors."
good,i had to make the food cook the food and ring up orders and collect money. i learned no job is easy. the co workers where really nice and lot of them became my friends. there wasnt really anything hard a about the job and the most enjoyable was being able to make a lot of friends and becoming a family
good,its was always good when i went to work how to mulittask with everyone and the envrioment the management was alright the people i worked with was very friendly trying to mulit task at first when i was able to be around everyone
good,"A typical day of work starts off at the shop, loading cleaning supplies and cleaning tools. If one house is occupied still, we move on to the next house.  Everyone starts off doing their usual duties, mine was typically the bathrooms. After everyone finished their duties, we all worked together in order to finish in a timely manner. I believe this job has helped me learn the importance of working as a team as well as individually. I am pleased with the way I have grown as a person with this job, as I am more confident with my team working skills and asking for help/clarification when needed. For me, the physical aspect of cleaning bathroom facilities was the most trying part of the job. As far as job security, I would have to say that since it was a summer time position, I cannot really comment on how secure a job with them would be. I think the compensation for the job was wonderful, but did not receive any other benefits since I was a seasonal worker (which was fine with me)."
good,"A typical day at work for me was never very typical.  Things were always different, constantly having to deal with different issues or call-offs, but I learned to expect the unexpected and it helped me gain an attitude of taking complications with stride and tackling them in the most efficient ways possible because we had a business to run. The management team I worked with were amazing, I get extremely lucky with being able to not only work along side, but also under individuals who were not afraid to ""get their hands dirty"" and work one-on-one with people. The hardest part of my job was hiring and training new employees, it was always very disappointing to have someone come in and give an awesome interview but then not have the capacity to keep up in such a demanding position. Also, the franchise I worked under was very close knit, which I loved, but it was very difficult to see myself moving up the ladder because of the personal relationships they had already formed. The most enjoyable part of my job was working along side people who shared the same general compassion for people as I do. I measure my days by how many people I can make smile, if I can positively influence the life of one individual other than myself every single day, I call it a win."
good,"Working at Wendy's is not your average fast food dining. The company as well as management cares about it's employees. Everyone knows how to pull together & make a successful team to get the job done. If there is a mistake, it is taken seriously and tended to right away. You can guarantee to great a happy experience and a nice smile to go with it whether you are the employee or guest. I really enjoyed working for this company as well. It's not just about work, they care about you as a person too!"
good,Wendy's is one of the best fast food places to work for. its a fun friendly place to be. I would come to work clock n and wait on customers all night fast pace. u be working and have so much fun before u know it its 2am  time to close.
good,i have  really fun at work the co worker are very nice and we work together. there was nothing really hard about the job i love every min of it. the most part i love was greeting people and helping them too
good,Cashier prep shift lead at night etc.. Cleaning the dining room being nice to your customers
good,I enjoyed working there. The management was awesome and it was always a pleasure. I enjoyed serving the customers and staying busy.
good,"I loved my job at 7/11"
good,"i love working at wendys because the Management was very helpful and understanding. they work with me until i understood what i was doing. while i was working i learned how to worked the cash resgister,Make sandwhices and how to work with all different kinds of people."
good,I was trained in all positions at Wendy's and also trained people in those positions at well. It was great to work at such a flexible place during my time in college.
good,I like this company the pay start is good and there is room for advancement
good,"In the last eight years I have learned how to manager crew and treat them fairly.  It is a family run business where the owners are very on hand and in their store whether its working line with the staff or doing their own maintenance.  They treat all their staff like they are family and I love working for them.  The best part of my job is coming into work every day and interacting with the staff and customers.  The hardest part is sometimes having to discipline the staff, especially when you like them or consider them to be friends. "
good,it was okay working there i guess some rude customers but thats it 
good,"i loved working here, learning new things and meeting new people."
good,As a part of Wendy's crew you learn that great food is made best through great teamwork. Wendy's teaches you how important teamwork really is an fast paced environment as each of your piers rely on one another to get the job done. After each day you grow closer to your team and begin to see what it means to be family.  
good,A good job that stuck with me throughout my career. I am a graduate of college and I prefer to work towards my career. Management wants me to explore my means and leave the nest. My co-workers are very supportive of me. The hardest part is leaving them behind to pursue my career. 
good,"The most hardest part of this job was the Management Team, so I resigned and returned to my previous employer."
good,"My work in Wendy's is good and very beneficial to me.  I learned how to do sandwiches, prepares salads and other things even it is not related to my past job.  Also, I learned how to communicate in a different kind of people.  About the management they are good to me and very hard working a good example to the staffs.  My co-workers are all good and very approachable. The hardest part of my job is when it was so busy and the staff are only few. The most enjoyable part of my job are when I am in the front assists the front cashier and gives food to the guest.  Also, whenever some of the guest are  satisfied in my service, appreciated my work and gives a compliment.  "
good,"I would arrive to work at least and hour early so i can make sure everything is prepped and ready. I am a firm believer in preparation being the recipe for success. We start of the day with an inspirational few words about the daily goals, upcoming events, expectations etc. These ""huddles"" are run by the highest ranking manager on shift that day which was almost always myself. I really enjoyed them because i was able to put passion into inspiring my crew to make a difference that day in someone's day."
good,"i work 8:30-4:30, i get to work and start with line set up and food prep, when we open the store iam a casher. Wendys has lots of positions to learn from, i learned how to be a cashier and work with customers. Management is great and co-worker are a great team. the hardest part of the job is when we are short staff. the most enjoyable part of the job is doing different tasks and working with people."
good,I would recommend other people to try the job but not quitting the job 
good,"A typical day at work was go in at 7 AM begin setting up and prepping for the day's business ensuring all safety and health regulations were in place and the store was probably staff for the peak hours, throughout the day maintaining the flow of business and coaching and training employees. I learned you cannot talk to everyone the same way sometimes you have to go up a level down a level depending on the person everyone is different and you get your results by learning your people. My management staff was handpicked by me people that I trusted when I left million dollars store in their hands. The hardest part about the job is the part that you make it when you start the job dictate to you how your day is going run you set yourself up for failure. The most enjoyable part of my job is achieving goals that have been preset prior to the day, and at the end of your day if you can look in the mirror and say I made one person's day better"
good,Thus far working at wendy's has been a good time for me. They allow me to balance out my social and school life on a regular basis.
good,The manager had alot of discipline which is a reason i believe this Wendy's was such a great place. We were required to clean our hands and make sure attire was perfect then assume the position. Employees would laugh and be playful (some of them) while there were no customers then get right to work whenever a customer appeared. This was a good example of a team because we each helped eachother.
good,A typical day at work is usually busy and fast pace which i love. I've learned that when you have lots of work to do the day goes by faster than having not much to do. Management was awesome and never disrespectful. There was really no hard part about the job. But the most enjoyable part was seeing a satisfied customer smile.
good,"my job conistied store opener which included food prep for breakfast,lunch service. i helped make biscutts, bacon, sauage,eggs, and when i was finished i started making salads,chilli, yogarts, mandering cups, i was really happy there. i also was a runner went to pck up merchantdise from other stores."
good,A typical day of work at wendy's was very enjoyable and stressful at the same time. I learned how to cook and prepare different kinds of food and salads. Management was good and they showed me how to maybe one day own a business. My co-workers were a good bunch of different personalities. The hardest part of the job for me was learning what people like to eat. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to provide good customer service to the public.
good,I love working with the employees and enjoyed taking care of the customers
good,the most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with customers and making them happy. i learned that people are hard to please but in the end it makes the customer happy and in the end will always return.
good,"As a manager trainee, my typical day began at 4:45 am. I was responsible for insuring the restaurant's equipment and employees were prepared fro opening at 6:00 am every morning."
good,"I was Product Coordinator, so I had to take out the garbage, wash all dishes, restock everything, sweep/mop. I learned all that + more and I was 15yrs. old when I started there. management was fine and strict. one of my co-workers was one of my best friends, so I had fun working there with him. hardest part was to get all of the dishes all cleaned before my shift was over. most enjoyable part was to work hard at every shift."
good,"There was always something to do everyday which I enjoy. And the chance to work at all avaliable locations within the resturant was a pleasant mixture of experiances. I was actually sad to leave, I was in the process of moving and unfourtunatly had to give up my position."
good,"I was constantly doing something whether I was typing and filling in orders, cleaning my station and or the lobby, washing dishes, or emptying and cleaning the garbage cans. I learned a lot about helping others and listening carefully. I enjoyed having lots of tasks to do and I made sure to stay busy as much as possible. My coworkers were friendly and helped me learn how to do my job better. The hardest part was learning to deal with difficult customers. Working here gave me a greater love for customer service."
good,great hours and easy work and worked around me being in college
good,"This was my first job and I was a sr in high school; and my management team was really help for when it came to the things I needed to get done as a sr, loved working for this company"
good,"Fun workplace enjjoyed my customers, looked forward to seeing them on a regular basic, as well as my crew. Very productive work place, enjoyed managing and teaching my crew. Held the same crew for about 6yrs straight. Management was pretty good also"
good,"A typical day at work included the laughs and smiles from my coworkers as well as the complexity of the customers. I learned in this business that though you can not please everyone no matter what you do, but that you can do your best to accompany anyone when you approach them correctly. My managers were understanding, but stern when it came to business. My coworkers did their best to keep me afloat upon entering the job field until I could handle it on my own. The hardest part of the job adjusting to rush and getting back acclimated after post rush. The best part was working with my coworkers and giving a smile to the customers who came in."
good,awsome company to work for. great offers for advancment and pay increases
good,Great employees. Excellent quality of food products and customer satisfaction.Overall just a great family place to dine and eat and have good family memories even though it is only a fast food place. I learned more about handling situations with customers and making my food servie more excellent. The hardest part of the job was not being able to do the tasks I really would like to try.
good,"A typical day at work is usually busy, I have learned patience and how to deal with a variety of different people and their cultural. Management very easy to gain hours and get ahead as long as you were willing to work. I got along wit all my co-workers. The hardest part of this job was the night cleaning. The most enjoyable part was the customers."
good,"My experience at wendy's was very enjoyable, i have learned how to have patience, how to mulitask and how to maintaing a job, i've had the best experience with my co-workers with friendship and learning to work as a team and for those who i could not cope with i still manage to deal with them in a very professional manor but i must say the management was amazing they was always on top of you making sure you get the job done the proper way and any mistakes being made they were right there to help you altho the hardest part of the job was rush hour and trying to keep the customers satisfied but it was very enjoyable knowing that i could keep them satisfied with conversations along with laughs and humor."
good,"I enjoy working new people, the hardest part is once again dealing with nasty customers attitudes, I loved my co-workers, and I learned no matter what you have going in your life always keep a smile on your face."
good,"A typical day at work consits of helping customers have a great experience at a fast food restaraunt and cleaning the store to help create a clean well maintained environment. The management is willing to help if you have a complication with customers, machines, or if you fall behind on your work due to busy store volumes. The hardest part of the job is trying to close the entire store in 30 minutes after close when we've had a busy night as the store manager requests. The most enjoyable part is being able to talk to my employers/employees about anything that is going on in my life and knowing they will help me (i.e. when i was pregnant the other employees carried my heavy dishes for me)."
good,I had alot of fun working at Wendys I just wish I could have gotten more hours.. I got along with most of the employees and the managers
good,Provided excellent customer service.
good,A typical day at work for a cashier is pretty laid back unless it's very busy. The rush isn't that bad though. You meet a lot of interesting people.

good,"I loved this job I was able to serve customers in a very fun environment, you are crossed trained on everything and if you"
good,great food and great managers!!wish i still worked there!!
good,"This was my first real experience working daily and all year long. I learned the manage cash and payments. The management and coworkers were great. The hardest part of the job was when the drive through was backed up in orders, the most enjoyable part was talking with the seniors who would come in every Sunday."
good,"A typical day at work for me is always fun, Im really dedicated to my job. I have learned that all fast food is almost the same except some places are more strict about speed of service. My management team is the best; ilove them! Some co-workers are very lazy but for the most part when its time for business they know when to get on the right track. The hardest part of work is when the big bosses are in town & there is unexpected stuff to do. The most enjoyable part of my job is that we have fun & we get along."
good,"very busy through certain hours but very demanding cleaning and lifting. management trys to be as flexable as possible, such as changing scheduals and listening to ""crew drama"". The hardest part is to not get involved in the drama and chaos between crew. People tend to wear their lives on their sleeves and it is definately not talk for the work place."
good,It Just long hot hours in the kitchen and huge orders that we had to get out quick as possible and the people we like a good friendship cause we saw each other everyday. The hard part was the huge orders in the heat
good,"A day at work included flexibility, meaning that there were a number of things I might or might not do, including the times in which I worked or was asked to come in or stay over. I learned a lot about customer service and I grew as a person because it was a time where I was transitioning from a teenager to an adult. Management was always professional and fair. The hardest part of the job, I would say, was probably the days where I worked until 1 or 2 in the morning and would have to be back up there at 6 in the morning, but they weren't even really that bad. The most enjoyable part of the job, I would have to say, was that the management and staff that I got to work with were amazing to work with."
good,"it was great, the employers i worked with were fun and hardworking"
good,A typical day at wendys is that u got to look forward to coming to work because its goin to be alot of ppl come in everyday. what i learned at wendys is how to work everything in the building. management staff was ok at times.the co-workers was nice people.the hardest part of the job was when we get alot of people in the store u have to do alot of stuff at once. the most enjoyable part of the job was that we all had fun at doing what we knows best serving the customers.

This job is a great entry level job especially for those in high school and are just barely leaving high school.

I loved my job, I have no bad words about anything."
good,"Everything is timed, we have a timer we have to go faster than the timer, our food have to be fresh, we have to have fast paced people working so the drive thru works go by smoothly. Everyday is something new."
good,"Fast paced environment, pretty decent pay for someone who only has themselves to support. I don't really have much else to say about the company. My experience was fine until a new manager came along. Worst manager ever."

good,I enjoyed going to work. The work crew was very friendly. I loved working with the customer. The manager was willing to work with me and I learned a lot. I became employee of the month.
good,Corporate was great to work for. They were fair with opportunities for advancement. Owner operators not so good to work for. They have little to no experience in the industry and bring in their own people to try and run stores without success.
good,Really fast paced. Great employment opportunity to work for. Always happy to help you with anything. Employees are always happy to help you out with anything
good,The managers were really nice. You always had something to do. My hours were set so I never had to worry about my hours changing and I always had the same days off every week. It was really nice working there. However if I were to work for Wendy's again I would only work at the location I had worked at and nowhere else. They were all great.

good,The typical day at wendys was Me or someone else taking orders and baging  to get the orders out In short time. What I learned was that I needed to learned was that everybody does learn like me. The management was great but when you have a husband and wife as managers in the same place it doesn't work out that well. The hardest part is making the sure that everthing runs nice and no mess ups. We all do it but man it can be a pain. The most enjoyable part was making the customers happy.
good,"A typical day a work for me would be coming in, making sure my uniform is correct. Make sure I have everything I need for the night. As the night goes on I just make sure my customers get taken care of and that all of my duties are finished before I leave. Management isn't the best,but I have learned to ignore the drama and go on with my night. I'm there to work. To be completely honest I don't think my job is hard.

good,"The company was good for being a job receiving paychecks to pay bills, but it wasn't a type of career job for myself. I learned how to make sandwiches and salads Wendy's special way in style. I work I learn how to work with some of the customers being aggravated at how they weren't getting their items fast enough. Their management system was very awesome because they were respectful and really into work, with employers, and they have patience with their employers as well as making reasonable judgements on situations."

Although, the training and on the job experience lends more to customer service and the food industry, rather than construction and trades. For reference in case you feel like switching occupational titles anytime soon."
good,"All I can say about this New Port Richey store is wow. They were such understanding and able to relate. My life was in a spiral downward and they did everything they could to work with me.

good,my manager was very friendly and also the assistant manager all of the crew got along well and we worked together as a team
good,"Work environment was friendly, fast but secure. Everyone had fun doing what they were required to do. Though I didn`t work there for long, while i did work there, I got full time shifts which I loved but my feet hated (stood for up to 5 hours in a row while serving customers) personally would have enjoyed another break after 3 hours but, every job works differently. When it came to the actual learning experience,I was mainly on the front line taking orders and serving the food, whether we had to bag it up or place it on a tray that I would later sanitize upon its return for the next customer (I had a lot of fun doing it) I had a blast working at Wendy`s though i was let go after almost a month of service (was not able to get to speed in time allotted...I am a slow learner) which my parents found to have shot my confidence.The type of shifts I got were day shifts, as listed in my resume, I worked opening, though i mainly worked for the lunch rush, i also worked during the diner rush. I enjoyed the fast pace work environment. definitely helped me pass time."
good,"Even though most would say that managing any type of food establishment is stressful; I found the challenges inviting and did not find this job to be stressful. I did put in many hours most weeks, but in return, I was able to maximize profits, keep food costs and labor costs in control and keep turnover to a minimum. "

good,"It was a very busy place to work. The regular customers there are great people and just make your day .  I managed there and the rest of the management team were good people and we felt like a great team.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the upset customers, but I would always make sure they were leaving happy.  The best part of the job was the management team and crew.  Everybody for the most part got along great and we all fit like puzzle pieces.  I have taken great work ethics and lessons way from that place, like customer satisfaction, and positions of authority."

The hardest part of the job would have been handling rude customers while staying calm and while fixing their order, food, or any other problems they had.

The management was excellent and always ready to lend a hand when needed. The co workers were very good at their jobs and willing to learn other positions when available.

good,"What I have learned from working at Wendy's is to never give up and  always look at the glass as being half full. Even on hard days when a customer or coworkers not being polite, be positive and don't take it personal. Just do your best and use what you have learned. Getting upset will only get you into a negative state of mind and that never leads you to success. It's a part of life to have hardship but it's up to you to learn or grow from it and not let it be your weakness. I did enjoy working at Wendy's. When I graduated radiology school and moved, I felt like I was leaving family. My boss was great, he was very professional and made sure everything was in order."

good,I was really pleased when I was working at Wendy's. I loved the job atmosphere and just the job in general. I was really sad to leave but when your family goes through hard times you have to put them first before anything. If it wasn't for family issues I more than likely would've stayed and probably be looking at making a career out of it. The only downside was the lack of benefits but other than that it wasn't that bad of an employment opportunity.

good,Wendy's business  is run through programmed system where every key of keyboard is programmed to a specific name. one day there was system crash and cashiers were unable to take any orders. because there was already a backup plan for this situation that is why problem was solved within 10 minutes otherwise it can cause a loss for a whole day. the hardest part was to convince people about the problem occurred. the workers were very  helpfull as they were patient enough to wait for the problem to be resolved.

Wendy's prides itself on their quality food products as well as the customer's experience and I feel they should, not only is the food quality better than most fast food, but also the workers were exceptional and genuinely cared to provide quality customer service in a timely manner. The managers became a good support system and there was always a open office policy. I felt very comfortable with the crew as well as my supervisors. In a fast passed sometimes stressful work environment the managers and crew members handled themselves well. I very much enjoyed working there and I would have loved to stay."
good,"During rush hour, the energy required a big Mountain Dew and the coordinated efforts of a large team.  The workers were wonderful, the customers sometimes not so much, but we put our smiles on for all and enjoyed the easy bantering that made it feel like a family instead of a job.  The hardest part of working there was the panic during rush hour, but we all got through it fine.  The best part about working there?

If I had a question they came and helped me if I had questions. There wasn't really a hard part. I don't think at least. Grill compared to back window was a little more complicated. Only cause you had to make sure the sandwich makers had enough meat for what they are making. Make sure the meats and everything is stocked for the rushes so you wont run out. Make sure there are fries. The most enjoyable part was the fun environment. Coming in I thought it would be so hard. It being my first official job and all but it was easy to learn with great people and great managers that help and answer any questions I had."

Then, after 8 years of being an employee I was promoted to a shift manager and that is when I learned how to use computer programs for the company and learned how to manage a shift. The hardest part of the job is when we are short handed and we are so busy with only a few workers. The most enjoyable part of the job is when we all work together as a team and get everything done."

I also worked at the fry and nugget station as well as the front counter where I took orders, used a cash register, and worked great with customers. My co-workers are pretty friendly but not people who can influence me for the better. The hardest part about working at Wendy's is the constant standing and walking with my disability. We get a half hour break every six hours we work and never get a chance to sit down. I am still strong in my legs, however constant standing and walking makes me fatigued. The most enjoyable part about working at Wendy's is making people happy. I love when customers have a smile on their face.

Followed by heading to the office to communicate with the other management on duty and we would discuss the plans for the day/night and sales goal. As a shift manager I learned that you have to be able to multi-task along with thinking quickly during rush periods. My management team helped me grow and learn more everyday to improve on my job duties. The environment in the workplace was clean, organized, focused on job tasks while having fun at the same time, friendly, and goal orientated. The hardest part of my job was trying to maintain happy customers and direct the crew on the job at hand. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to be apart of that team and learn from co-workers and management to grow within the workplace and teach my knowledge/experiences to new hires."

Some managers needed to be expressed to that all of them was equal and that they needed to step into some areas that they may not like doing. But overall it is a great place to work. I would go back if they would take me back."
good,"Not much to say. It's a typical fast food job. As long as you expect that and nothing more, it's a great job. I wouldn't expect anything more out of it than a temporary job. Advancing to higher positions isn't worth it at all, but easy to do if that's your thing."

The managers there were super nice. The hardest part of the job would be mostly on Sundays after church, it gets BUSY, but time goes by so fast you dont care. Its only hard because you have to make food, drop food, take orders, clean pretty much at the same time. I loved my job, i wouldnt have left if i was given a raise, like i asked multiple times."

Whether you're in school or if you're on your own and need to start getting ready for the real world, Wendy's (along the other massive food chain restaurants) is a start, so to say,"
good,"Wendy's fast food restaurant, was an active job. It was amazing to learn with this company the organize way to work. Their system to calculate the production to prepare hourly was amazing.

There are lunch and dinner rushes, and maybe a few unexpected ones, but other than that, it's quite relaxed. I've learned to manage my time, multi-task, work as a team, and I've also learned customer service skills. The employees are very nice, it's like a family. The new manager has done a good job implementing his rules and picking up where the previous manager left off.

My Managers taught me everything that there is to know when working at a fast food, even when I couldn't figure something out they were always there to help me.  My typical day at work I would always be helping out customer with a huge smile on my face, I would always be happy with the position I was put in. The hardest thing about working at Wendy's was learning how to be social with everyone, at first I was a quiet shy girl but now they have taught me to greet anyone and be confident. The most enjoyable part about working there was being able to see how far working as a team can get you. When working with Wendy's I slowly noticed how one person can change someone's mood so quickly, just a simple ""Hello how is your day?"" can brighten anyone up."

good,"Llego a abrir el restaurant organizo todas las cosas y cuando me llega mi colaborador que es la persona encargada de la caja, porque el gerente no puede tocar caja para facturar un pedido solo lo puede hacer para autorizar una compra. Al finalizar la jornada laboral le cuadro la caja al cajero luego de eso tengo que que hacer las cosas administrativas. Antes de ascender a gerente uno pasa por la parte de entrenamiento que es aprender a dirigir un personal y parte administrativa.

What I have learned from working at Wendy's are beneficial leadership skills that I can apply to my every day life."
good,Upon working at Wendy's I realized the true challenges that present themselves upon working for a corporation.  Value of the customer and hard work was the main driving factor of the company.

good,I started off as a team member and quickly became a manager. I enjoyed going to work every day. The crew and other managers were great to work with and my GM was amazing!

I learned at work that safety is always first and always obey the safety rules so accidents wont occur. My manager is very encouraging and understanding when it comes to certain situations. I have some of the best co- Workers all very polite and selfless. The hardest part of my job is closing down the store on time.

good,"Working at Wendy's was my first job. I loved it, I had a lot of interaction with all the customers. Working with people is one of my favorite things. Wendy's is a fast paced job, which I do great with. Everything had a time, whether it be the drive through or how long the fries were allowed to be used before we dumped them. I learned that no matter how mad a customer is, or how stressful the lunch rush was, that you have to stay positive and keep pushing through the day. All of my managers were great. They were always there to help with everything and make sure the customers were 100% happy with their visit. The hardest part of my job here would be trying fix something that a customer is upset about, because sometimes the customer will never be happy with what you have to offer. Either way, this job helped me learn how to deal with 30 second problems, and to always stay positive! Schmidt family restaurants is fun to work under!"
good,a typical day at Wendy is really busy but i always try to do my best and help the costumers as much as i can. show and give quality to our customers is our goal every day .

You could always talk to Mangers about anything. Employees where also supportive and helpful for example if you were making an order wrong they would tell you and help you fix the mistake. I myself would say that he hardest part was to take orders make drinks and bag orders and still manage to get a good time. Now this would occur when you are short staff. Besides that everything was great. The best part about working at Wendy's was when we had to see who could sell the most frosty coupon books during Halloween. It always got me excited. I enjoyed everything about working at Wendy's they (mangers and coworkers) have really taught me a lot and I am very thankful for the opportunity to be able to work with those that I did for two years."

good,I love coming in everyday cooking. I really didn't like be a cashier because sometimes people be mean for no reason but that's life. I love my crew that I worked but what made me leave was my boss had me working with the lazy crew and I hated it and it was too many problems so I left.
good,I liked working for Wendy's it was an easy place to work. Everyone got along well. Employees were nice to others as well as their employees.

Everyone there were like family and I enjoyed every moment working there. My mangers were really dedicated to their work and would want everyone to be as well. I really enjoyed working late shifts. Late shifts were the best because my coworkers and I would have the best times closing. All together Wendy's was a good job and had to best general manager.

Go to the bank and drop the cash from last night. Take inventory 3 times daily, check bathroom and dining areas for clealiness. What I learned is  how to be patient, and deal with the customers in a professional manner. Management can be a demanding position. I love working with my co-workers and helping them out when necessary.  The hardest part of the job is firing an employee or disciplining him/her.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when the day is running smoothly, and I don't have to answer to customers inquiries or discipline an employee."
good,Everyday at work is fun! The attitude of the managers basically determines how the day is gone be. The management really cares about the customers.
good,"You would learn new things every day, there was always something different to do. The management of the store was great it was always a very busy day with lots to do. The hardest part would be trying to manage time as to what to do and guessing when to do tasks as you never know when you will get busy. The most enjoyable part of the job would've been interacting with the customers and working as a team."

good,"My shift usually started at 10a.m clocking in, and counting down money for register. I learned that you have to constantly stay focused when it comes to working with people and money. The management was well organized with everyone on task . Few coworkers seem to be at work only to do what theyre suppose to do. A lot of coworkers rather not make friends as easily as me. The hardest part of my job would be dealing with rude customers; Especially if you are very impatient .The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you did your best and worked hard to help follow company policies to ensure the safety of customers ,coworkers, and management."

I learned a great deal about what goes on behind the drive through window and have a new appreciation for fast food workers. Management was great no hassel regularly scheduled for work. The coworkers were great because they were people I went to school with. The hardest part of the job was keeping ahead of the incoming orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was I got to do something I truely enjoy which is food service. I am still trying to obtain employment with another Wendys in my new area of relocation.

good,Loved the people I worked with and for. The customers were nice. Loved my hours.
good,"What I enjoy the most is the people I work with, and the customers. Sometimes it gets hard but that happens to any work place. Staying productive and keeping yourself busy is easy enough, but time management/long term goals in the work place (like closing) can get challenging if you're not used to it. My favorite part is training the newer people, and helping them understand how the work place works. The management has changed a bit since I first started working here, but the fundamentals of keep yourself busy and do your best hasn't changed at all. I can enjoy my job because it's worthwhile to keep the place enjoyable."
good,Wendy's was a great company to work for. I loved how I was in charge of 14 stores maintenance programs. I learned how to setup and run capital projects within the corporation.I also learned how to use a PDA to run a mantenance program. I was let go because another company bought out Wendy's and they downsized our department. They did give me a great severance package.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my day is being able to make food and coffee for our customers and seeing them come back over and over again.

good,It's a great job. I work the job and trying to work back at the job. I stopped working this job because I had a lot of family issues.

And the next time which is the third time may and will be critical.
good,i loved working with wendy's  working with the customers and serving customers make them happy. it was wonderful working with fast food place it make me learn how to work with customer service greeting them make them happy.

good,I loved this job overall. My co-workers were great at being respectful and helping make sure everything was clean and in order. My managers basically didn't have anything to do when I was there. I would multi-task a lot just to make sure the customers were happy.

good,Working at this company was an enjoyable experience. I learned how to take orders and prepape food safely according to rules and regulations. Customer service skills were important in this job as well.
good,Not to much I can say bad about working for Wendy’s. Pretty decent job. Helpful to the ones still in school. Give our people a second chance at working. The downer is getting paid bi weekly. But it’s nothing I’m not use to
good,Each person makes their own opinions of a company or workplace. I adapted to what was given to me and worked hard to achieve goals. It has benefitted me and my crew and I have grown due to it. I believe the challenge can either help mold you or it can break you. I have surrounded myself with great crew members which makes it a fun working environment and team members work together more effectively due to respectable work environments.
good,"My typical day working at Wendy's was either working the cash register or fry station, and cleaning up the lobby after closing. My coworkers were very kind and accepting."

good,"Stocking and organizing everything will be the easiest part of the job and will be the most common thing that everybody should know. We prioritize the cleanliness of the store whether it is inside the kitchen, in the dining where the customers eat, or outside of the store. I learned to spend my time wisely at the store because every minute is important. I also learned how to communicate with other people better. Slowly, it isn't just my skills that have improved but also me as a person. And that is really important for me since it is my very first job. It is also easy to balance out school and work because the management won't force you to work that day unless you are supposed to work. You just need to tell them in advance that you can't go to work for the days ahead. The hardest part of the job maybe whenever there would be tons of customers at the store especially during the weekend. It would also be a lot harder whenever there are only a few staffs to help you with the job and there would be nothing left for you to do but work even though it is busy and stressful. But despite it all, everyone is very supportive and helpful. The environment is good to work at."

This included the fact that the customer is always right. The workplace culture was good. The hardest part of the job was if an order was incorrect and the customer faulted  you.

good,Fun fast past and for that time in my life I felt it was fitting. I started school after this. I liked the job but I knew I wasnt going to be in that field for long.
good,"A typical day is, if your opening then you have to be there at 6am. You start by prepping all the condiments and sandwich stuff that need for the day. Sometimes the management will let you listen to your headphones but sometimes they won't. When the store opens it is usually slow but don't worry, it picks up really quickly. You'll get asked a million times if you guys sell breakfast. I learned that everyone thinks that fast food jobs are so easy and everyone can do it, but once you get behind that counter, you have to be a completely different person. You can't just be you, you have to be you times 100 plus be nice to people when they are rude as heck to you."

good,wendys is a good company that has changed over the years from owner to owner and  its rising between all fast food restaurant that are in the food industry.
good,This job molded me into the man I am today. Feeding hundreds of hungry people everyday really teaches you the art of smiling under pressure. I also became very good at counting money on the spot.

good,"I felt like I was in a productive environment with supportive team members, and working with the customers was enjoyable most of the time. During my time at Wendy's, I learned how to strengthen my communication skills, as well as how to maintain a friendly and clean environment for customers and fellow workers. The managers at Wendy's were very good at keeping me and my fellow employees in line, reminding us when it was time to act seriously. Whenever one of my coworkers was doing something they weren't supposed to be doing, the managers of the store were always there to stop them before any terrible repercussions could take place, making the environment feel very safe and well-managed. The hardest part of the job, I would say, would have to be the customers. While I am a very patient and understanding person, the people who come in to fast food restaurants can have their moments, but I would always try to step into their shoes to try and see what problems they might be facing that may cause their negative attitude. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help in making the store's environment a good place for customers and coworkers to spend their time in."

good,"A typical work day at wendys was always fun. The managers were awsome,welcoming and knew how to get their new employee's trained and ready for the job. The scedual was made according to when people could make it so their were not usually any call off seeing as how some of them were still in school with practices and some were parents with kids. Working around others scedual I learned the concept of ""give a little take a little"" a little bit better. It was a well rounded group so team work was very easy.

good,This is my first and best job ever. I use to talk to my customers and ask how they want their sandwich made I work there so much I had the same customers and they came in and ask for the same stuff so I had my same lil crew of people. I truly learn how to make food and the customer is always right because they are the ones buying food. I also learn how to do stock and receiving and count boxes of food and how much we should have a week. the hardest part of the job was when people would take off of work the day of and we be short of a crew.

There's nothing too hard about working here."
good,All the days begin to blend. This is precarious work at it's finest. There is little room for advancement. I would not recommend for a serious adult with real responsible. It's great first job but do not get too comfortable.
good,"Typical day at work, lets see getting into the forest with weights of gear over your shoulder gear relating what is required for the job, operating a chainsaw.

good,A typical day at Wendys  for the most part was slow until around lunch. I learned different type of cooking methods. The manager was very thorough and outspoken and easy to get along with once you knew him. My co-workers were very professional but silly they always got me through the day. The hardest part of the job was making or ringing up a sandwich that does not even exists at Wendys. The most enjoyable part about Wendys was that not only was I polishing up my customer service and people skills I also got a chance to polish up my cooking skills.
good,"we have our fast and slow times, but stay busy. i have learned everything about the store. Management controls all employees and orders coming and going out of the store. My co-workers have their own station and we all work as team. the hardest part of the job is getting orders out in a timely manner.  getting along with fellow employers"
good,"This is a great company with awesome management with great food!  I work at a great location at 5070 S Syracuse St, Denver, CO  80237 in the Denver Tech Center so the amount of work M-F is endless but it is a good secure extra income job that i can take off whenever i need to which works great for me and my family at this juncture in my life."
good,Working at Wendy's is definitely bittersweet. Even though I have a set schedule I'm not getting the pay for the hard work I put in. I am also a person that appreciates organization and sometimes it could get a little hectic at Wendy's. Besides that I get along well with my co-workers and management I had however and definitely learned a lot from my management. One thing I can say I've learned is that if you do your job well people will give you the respect you'd like. I have also learned that the customers love and will appreciate a positive and steady work environment. I want to take from what I learned from Wendy's and learn even more.

good,"Over my three years at Wendy's I've gained essentials skills for any job and have enjoyed every minute of it. I have amazing coworkers and employers that understand that a successful business is only that if its workers are united to achieve a shared goal. I honestly consider Wendy's to be a fantastic place to work and all my coworkers to be genuine friends. The hardest part of the job is dealing with difficult customers during busy periods such as school holidays and the Christmas period, however everyone helps out whenever someone feels overwhelmed. The most enjoyable part would be getting to know the people I work with and becoming close friends with everyone there."
good,"Typical day would be going in making sure your station is stocked, cleaned and ready for the day. I would then proceed to make orders throughout the day. I learned how to better multitask, how to handle different types of customers and how to work with fellow co-workers. I would say the most difficult part of this job would be standing for long periods of time and the fast paced work environment. The most enjoyable part is the team environment."
good,"The management in the company was very helpful and very pleasant to work for. I enjoyed working with all my co-workers, everyone is very friendly to each other."

Everyone on a team is never going work at the same pace but you have to know how to co exist and everyone make up for each other deficiencies . management is very understanding of real life outside circumstance and they are fair, they listen to us when we need new equipment or new uniform items and fix the problem immediately, and they respect us work with us.My co workers are the greatest , ranging in age and race.i have built some very strong friendships grinding every night with my closing crew, we hang outside of work support each other in all endeavors I am a part of a great team. the hardest part of the job is nothing work is work never easy, nothing is every easy if you are working towards a goal.so I will say the hardest part of the job are slow nights when we aren't busy, the time passes painstakingly slow. the most enjoyable part is interacting with kids when they come through.

good,A typical day at work is very good and tried to make the best out of so that my employees are in a comfortable workplace. I have learned a lot in management working for this company. I have learned to maintain a well managed store. My assistant mangers are some of the best I could ask for. They're always doing whatever it takes to maintain the store just as much as me. I think the hardest part of my job is finding employees that really want or need to work. And the most enjoyable part of my job is seeing my customers smile.
good,"During my time working at Wendy's, I learned more and more about teamwork. We worked as a team and got the job done fast. If someone messed up on the job, it was always someone there to help them fix the problem. There were excellent management, and they were well organized. If a co-worker came to work sad or stressed out, there were always co-workers in sight to help cheer them up. We worked not just as co-workers, but as a family.

good,during the summer I started working from eight in the morning till around noon or two in the afternoon.  I learned to always have a good attitude and to keep a smile on my face and deal with stress.  The management was the best and they helped us when we needed it.  My co-workers where wonderful they where hard working and with me just starting out they helped me when I needed it and even asked if I needed help when I didn't ask.  The hardest part of the job was to make sure you don't over do your self at once because its really easy to get ahead of yourself.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.  We took the job serious but there was always room for laughs.  We helped everyone not get stressed out and also made sure that new people working there had friends.  When school started I would work from four till ten or eleven at night.  With this on top of school I would get stressed easy but with the support with the management and my co-workers I didn't get stressed like most people would have thought.  I learned that at this time a lot of people where getting of work so I learned to work hard and fast and get the job done. I also learned how to handle more than one thing at a time.  Also no matter how busy the place got we all helped each other and worked as a team.  I learned how to run the drive thru and I learned how to make fries and also how to work the grill.

They stressed that family comes first, and would understand if anyone needed time off for personal things that come up in life. They would always offer to help in any way they could.

I enjoy not only the positive and ever improving work of my crew members, but also the ever-so important relationships built with our customers.

Aside from other companies Wendy's treats each employee with respect and is always willing point out things to help you improve and become more than just a crew member. Working there Is fun and full of things to do. Wendy's Is very fast paced and I really do miss working there I hope to regain a position there in the future.

good,"A typical day at work I would greet my crew members! Nothing by smiles and small talk of jokes. I would go back to see where my positions for the day was at and clock in and do my duties. Ive learned a lot such as using the right tongs so you to create cross contamination, also to keep everything stock in advance for lunch hours, so you meet excellent times. My co-workers are always my fuel, we get serious when its time to get serious and share a few friendly jokes i call my co-workers family. The most hardest job would be beating a better time that was already excellent. The most enjoyable part of the job is Customers! They are always interesting!"
good,Greeting all types of customers and handling money. Wendy's was my first job so I took it pretty serious I knew everything there was to know from the prices on down to how long it takes to cook off top of my head.

good,"I've been with Wendys off and on for almost 3 1/2 years. The first Wendys I worked for was in Toledo, Oh. At first I thought they were a little too strict, but when I relocated to another Wendy's, then I understood. The Wendy's in Toledo, Oh, taught me so much that I still use alot of that knowledge at home. I really enjoyed working with customers who had special needs, and even customers who didn't. The easier part of that job, was actually working with the customers. The harder part was more-so making sure that everything was the way it was suppose to be by the time we opened at 10am. I was offered a management position after 2 yrs, but I've decided I don't want to work in a fast-food place for the rest of my life. I want something more and something better for myself."
good,"I learn to work with new people and meet new faces everyday. I help give the customers a great experience at our Wendy's restaurant, and have a great day."
good,it was good fun work i learnd some thing in the fast food industry
good,wendys is one of the best jobs out there. i learn so much from them the crew are fun to work with the mangers are always there to help you out when you need help. if i had the the chance to work with wendys again i would apply in a hart beat. the only thing i found hard about wendys is the part that i had to leave for the day.
