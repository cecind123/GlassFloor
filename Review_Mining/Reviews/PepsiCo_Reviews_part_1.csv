bad,"Horrible company. Poor management. Not concerned with making ALL employees do their share of work. Your future depends on how much upper management likes you as a friend, not your work abilities. ""Team"" atmosphere does not exist. They will single out who they like, then put those person's work on the backs of the actual good workers. Long hours and nothing to show for it."
bad,The job is awful treat u very unfair tried hard.and noone even cares the say if u put in a w weeks ur fired unfair awful job awful management as well didn't get trained nothing
bad,"If you want to be used and abused PepsiCo is the place to work. I was in a contractual seasonal summer help warehouse position. They were telling us all that they would hire-in people that did a good job at the end of the summer. While Union employees in the warehouse were contractually obligated to work until the work was done, the summer seasonal contract was for 40/hrs week. But, they would pressure you and hold over your head if didn’t want to work more than 8hrs that you wouldn’t get hired in at the end of the summer. You would regularly work 70/hr work weeks and constantly be scrutinized for your work pace although you were out-working 90% of the union employees. And as summer help we were treated like second class citizens."
bad,"Leadership is consumed with form over substance, but the emperor has no clothes and even the form is terrible.  ""Transformation"" and other buzz words run amuck but just mean cost savings, with no one actually interested in doing things correctly.  The company has lost focus of its chips and soda cash cow and is consumed with diversity-inclusion-social-justice-rainbow pursuits."
bad,The managers could made the alot easier but just decided not to and let you struggle. No consistency when it comes to running the warehouse slot people got away with slot and others didn't.
bad,Worst place ever. Unless you like unfaithful people and slackers who dont care. They smoke weed weed and sleep with each other. This union is not strong backstabbers galore.
bad,"They have Horrible management "
bad,Terrible management who bend the rules to suit them. Very biased and only let their friends progress even if they are not skilled for the job. The workers are great but as per management destroy the place
bad,"They will get rid of you the first chance they get. You wont get raises and room for advancement is ""lateral"" promotions."
bad,"You will not be paid even remotely enough for as hard as you will be working. The risk of physical injury is HIGH to keep up with unrealistic demands. Poor management over the merchandisers at this location because they admittedly were using their position only as a stepping stone to get to a higher position and don't care about their employees that do the physical labor, you are never appreciated for your hard work. You may work as hard as everyone else but never be valued or even seen as an equal.You may work 8-14 hours and never have time for a lunch break. Part-timers get paid less than the full-timers for doing the same work and often working the same amount of hours but not technically considered full time even if working full time so you don't get benefits or the extra $4 an hour that the fulltimers get. You risk physical injury every day to get things done as quickly as possible, everything has to be PERFECT, if you miss one item out of the 10 pallets you are stocking you will get chewed out by multiple bosses. I worked hard and enjoyed the physical labor but not for what I was getting paid, I sometimes worked 14 hour days to get multiples stores with many pallets stocked, including the drive time. Never knew when I would be off work."
bad,Very poor attitude within this business I don’t buy these products anyway as a point of who runs the show idiots management are clowns they all out for themselves I always buy a better product I leaving this company then I’m happyof crisps
bad,They care about only the cases going out not about the workers. You report harassment to one person and its basically your fault. Management is never there hard to even move up
bad,"Pay is good but not worth it. Management, training ,and professionalism lacks. Workers are def under- appreciated. Typical shady warehouse system where all the hard labor workers make the management look good for sitting at a desk."
bad,Job was ok but management destroyed all employee morale with empty promises and poor treatment of employees. Claimed to live by various values that management broke as they saw fit.
bad,"Worst company to work for. Zero Communication, poor pay especially when given extra work/tasks to do daily, which is every day."
bad,They want you to work 16 hours a day everyday. The union workers do what they want and management won't say a word to them about it. Do not work there for any reason.
bad,"Went through all the proper channels and still got screwed. No compensation. Was a long time employee at the time."
bad,"I would never recommend anyone work for Sean Sadler or PepsiCo in general. It is a fly-by-night Mickey Mouse operation with no respect for anyone."
bad,"Working here was one of the worst time of my life. First when arriving they was doing commission as a pay rate which no could throughly explain how it's broken down which caused alot of attention and converted to hourly. Trucks was very old and out dated. No heat for those wintery days and no air for those terrible humid summer days, bay doors dnt work properly, electrical problems, etc. Overall they consume 90% of your time and very hard work."
bad,Do not work here. You will noonger have a family life or even social life. It was always work first and family last. Do not recommend working here. Dont get paid enough fir the work you are expected to do.
bad,"No work/life balance if you have a family say goodbye. You start at 2-3am depending on the day and you end your shift when it’s over. 8,10,12, 14 hour days. Plus it’s “Union”. So everyone is paid the same, but because it’s Union it protects those that are lazy. They only way for they can let you go is if you point out. Your sole purpose is stock soda and eventually work towards getting weekends off. I have had to miss class because of the hours and wether or not you’re going to get out in time."
bad,"PepsiCo does not care at all about their employees unless of course you don't put out what they expect(the contract there is no standard). Broke down equipment and they could care less! Physically demanding job.  Get 7 points for a year,  with this kind of work you are very very sore. HORRIBLE PLACE."
bad,"Company only cares about the “bottom line “. Pays the line haul driver a 2003 Over the road , long haul driver . Expects drivers to secure loads, fuel trucks, do inspections all for free. If you’re delayed there is no compensation for the delay until one hour is up . Delay pay is poor and only if the delay occurs at a Pepsi plant or warehouse."
bad,2010 yılında mevsimlik işçi olarak çalıştım..girdiğimde kendimi çok iyi hazırlamıştım forklifçiydim...mevsimlik işçilerin performans çizelgesi yapıldı.içimden dedimki..!!!!! performans 1.si seçildim ama sonuç sezon bitti kış geldi otobüsler yanaştı okadar emek boşa çıktı..yani herşeyiniz aldatmaca..3 çocuğumla kala kaldım...kötü bir anı vede kötü bir şirket olarak hep haanılacaksınız
bad,"PepsiCo is a bad company to work for. Do you always have to work through holidays, and weekends. The only way to move up is to be in with the bosses. if they don't like you you will never move up. You'll never make more than 60 Grand a year."
bad,Management sucks and it doesn't matter how good a worker  you are they will lie to you and promise you lots and never deliver. It's a game they love to play.
bad,"Started to work for the Newport News Bottling facility with 15 years experience and excitement. My 1st clue should have been the excessive turn over for production supervisors/managers. Shortly there after I realized that the senior leadership team was lead by a narcissist with no empathy, compassion, leaderships skills, honesty, professional conduct,or integrity. His antiquated and barbaric leader ship was based solely of fear of reprisal. He would lie and expect others to lie with him for positive reports to corporate. He trained other senior leaders to follow his example and would protect them at any cost. I believe this behavior was condoned by corporate PepsiCo leaders due to zero interaction on their part when credible and substantiated claims were filed on him and his 2nd in charge were filed through the HR department. The excessively high supervisor/manager turn over was directly related to this manager and the team he had surrounded himself with. This issue was also never investigated by Corporate PepsiCo, which only shows how much they value their teams or people. They do not want good leaders or good managers but promote and advance the ""yes"" group regardless of their process knowledge, people skills or leadership abilities. This will be their undoing in the end or at least until someone is smart enough to recognize the issues. I would never recommend anyone accepting a job with PepsiCo based on my two year tenure. No work life balance and no compensation for the expected 70+ hour work weeks. The HR departments are also definitely not protecting their workers, even"
bad,"want to work like a dog? this is the job for you! pepsi will run you 6 days a week all year round, and if you happen to get sick, better make it in! terrible place to work."
bad,"Pepsi MidAmerica is the worst place you can possibly work. Turn over rate is crazy, nearly 2,000 employees hired within the time  I worked there and this is not national numbers.... local numbers! Local Management at the Cape office does not provide any guidance in regards to helping others succeed in their roles and will not support you when questioned by senior management. I would not recommend this place"
bad,Horrible not compensated enough for the work and life sacrifices. Conditions are bad. The whole warehouse is on some type of illegal drug. Just all bad. Management doesn't have a clue how to operate.
bad,Managers allow people to make knives on and with company equipment while being on the clock. Overtime only goes to employees that are friends with the managers.
bad,"If you're white you have all the possibilities to advance, if you are a person of color and you like to be in the same position for the rest of your life, then it is the job for you. Before you start working for Pepsi, look at all of the upper management and you will see where you can succeed in the company. The easiest jobs are given to the white people no mater their effort level a have seen top builders by stats stay in the warehouse for years, and I have seen bottom builders that are given easier jobs and promotions after working at pepsi for 3 months, I am not going to tell you who the colored person is or the white person it was just and obvious action the happens all the time in Pepsi."
bad,"Can’t even describe how terrible this job was.  Zero leadership, zero accountability, and zero integrity.  Vehicle tags were expired.  Little to no training."
bad,"This company will use you literally kill you. There were some coworker drivers that were getting hurt and going into surgery because of this company breaking drivers backs. That was my sign to get out of this company, they don’t care about anyone just sales."
bad,You will work hard and get paid nothing 25 cents a case. You will make more money at Walmart. Management was not the best had. O people skills unless you are in the favorite zone. They will play around on hiring you in full time in to the union so they don't have to give you a vacation. All lies
bad,The life will be sucked out of you and thrown out like the trash. You will be used and abused. All the OT you will want but better be single because it’s not for a person with a family
bad,If I had to do all over again I would have never taken the job. The have no communication and they Do Not Follow the rules they treat you how ever they want unless they like you
bad,I worked there since 2004 and never got a advancement. I asked to get a CDL with the company. They told me to get a permit. I got the permit and was never moved any further than that. Worst company to work for..
bad,Awful. Started out great but has been  going down  hill very fast.  Moral is very low & management very unorganized & inexperienced.  Communication is extremely  poor & everything  seems to be done by spinning a wheel like a game show...awful.....
bad,They discriminate against your age.unfair treatment by management. And unfair work condition. They don't care about there employees Loved ones that are sick. And can't move up in the company.
bad,Do not work here they are the worst place for employment. They lie and are all rude and lazy. Stay away from this company. They will take forever to hire you then try to find a way to fire you if they don't like you.
bad,Horrible company to work for. Management talks about everyone to everyone and violates hippa. Management lies to cover their own job doesn’t care what happens with you since you are replaceable
bad,Loading and moving machines alone in the rain with warped and tearing straps.... after that day i started to notice all the small things that were off about the place. ZERO of the management had leadership experience
bad,Pepsico is a great company but the Bakersfield branch is amongst the worst of the Pepsico facilities. Don’t go or work there if you don’t wanna waste your life away.
bad,"Started off ok but if you can't pick fast they don't like it ,youll probably never see a union rep ,they can push your probation further just so they can fire you cause your not fast enough if you work there make shore your young without a life"
bad,"The most recognition I've ever had as an employee. Management had favorites, and if you weren't one, you could be right but they would make you wrong. Due at work no matter the weather and they would say no dings during snow storms but they counted against you. Quick to term someone in the probationary period."
bad,"Mal lugar, el sueldo es bajo"
bad,"The experience wasn't good at all, by a month into work management already made there decision on who the want keep. The 90 day rule for hiring its not fair, you work really hard and come on time, don't call out, be positive and be team player, prove you want the job. It doesn't matter, everything decide by status, meaning if you can't toss 90 to 150 case per hour you won't go pass the probationary period, they extend your probation so you won't become union. Management doesn't care if you have issue at customers, I have call management for help while fairly new with company, supervisors would huff and puff when calling having attitude when answering the phone, putting you on load speaker while  explaining your issue or problem with customer, or when a pallet tip over in the trailer cause warehouse didn't strap pallets down right, I was laugh at by 2nd and 3rd shift supervisors when calling for advice and help. Supervisors punish their driver have an issue or you can't get the route done, so the next day you can have 14-16 stop with 7 pallets to 9 pallets each stop. Keep in mind that's just for one stop, they don't care your fatigue or stayed late from last route done from the night before, or heat exhaustion, the training suck management will pair a new employee with a guy that has big load to deliver and just have you help break down pallets not explaining anything to you, all management care about how fast his driver that been their 6 to 7 years getting it done, the new guy just want prove to everyone he can do the job....management only look out for guys that their close"
bad,"This was the worst place I have ever worked.  The differences in shift work loads, inadequate and overpriced insurance, lack of communication between shift managers, problems with the delivery drivers, high employee turnover rate are ridiculous."
bad,La verdad es una empresa qe da vergüenza entrar a laborar yaqe ay traciende el qe se la yeve mejor con los jefes(barberos) cuidado tengas un accidente laboral como me pasó ami qe buscaron pretexto para echarme para fuera ya qe el accidente limitó mi función y la empresa prácticamente me echó para fuera no todo es malo la empresa
bad,I was a merchandiser with the company for about 3 months working 60 hour + weeks and constantly had to fight the company to get my mileage pay. I was offered a position in the warehouse that was suppose to be full time. After a couple weeks I asked why I wasn’t put in the system as full time. The supervisor said well unfortunately this position didn’t work out the way we hoped. Therefore I was cut back to less than 25 hours a week
bad,If you want to work very very hard to much expected out of the driver. Way to much to deal with for the little that they pay. Driving jobs are all out there that pay a lot more than Pepsi and you do a little work little less work.
bad,i messed up my shoulder at work and i had to go to the doctors to have my shoulder checked out next morning they told me to resign so i can use them as a reference or they fire me and had a whole bunch of made up reasons to get me to leave
bad,Would not recommend G&J Pepsi. Horrible pay and hours are horrible as well. Want you to work every weekend and get off days off through the week. Overall bad experience.
bad,"After 1 month of paperwork, they offer you the sky, the manegers are military act without meaning and always in all opposite directions, they want you to work at 300%, they promise you the increase and you almost have to shake them imagine for the holidays, you drive a truck full of money for them and sometimes they force you to make 2 trucks, you work 3 days to kill yourself -36 hours and the last day 4 rtw are shameless, at the end of the week all your checks are the same and you never understand as if You killed that week they give you a phone to call at any time, you belong to them, in the stores if it's your turn at night, it's like a movie every night between the drugs, the costumers with bad character, collect the credit, your supervisor calls you from bad way every moment, if you have the day there is papa you will be running always give you 21 stores in 12 hours or god meets it and then the manifest says that if it can be done, it is a terrible end to that work, I'm glad I did not continue with the scammers these, god sell pepsi which is a good drink, bad manegers"
bad,"You will break your back all day typically starting around 3-5am.Almost every store that you deliver to requires that you rotate and fill cooler shelves for them,why do they have store employees for then? After slaving all week your check will be everything short of satisfying. Other companies pay double with nowhere near pepsis workload"
bad,Been here 4 months worst mistake of my life they will sell you the job and lie to you about hours and commission Do Not Do it!!!!!!!!!!! I'm currently trying to find a new job this company is Terrible to say the least ! Payroll department screws up constantly and when questioned nothing but excuses are given! Osha and DOT would have a hay with Pepsi midamerica if a surprise visit took place
bad,"The night manager play favoritism and he is very condescending and arrogant when he speak to you especially if you're not progressing within a couple of weeks.  Co-worker is lacking of teamwork and their very arrogant as well because it's based on how fast you work and lack of compassion for new people.  This is by far the worst teams to work for, I don't recommend this place."
bad,I will never work for this company again. After the way they treated me loading my trucks wrong so all my product would be all over my trucks I to do 3 times the work just to get done with my day I had the busiest route and got a done within 12 hours or less by myself and they still fired me because of who I am. After I was fired I got HR envolved and they found out it was them discriminating  against me against me
bad,"Pepsi used to be a company, one rushed to get too.  Management used to be concerned about the wellbeing of the employees.  Hiring college kids that have no experience in the field to do the work required.  Might as well follow Amazon and employ robots."
bad,Anyone who ever worked here knows it sucks. The management look down employees like they are less of a person and are rude and oncaring for absolutely no reason
bad,Working for them sucked. Worst job I've ever worked. Dont work here. You will become a unpaid slave. With no family time. You are better off shaking a cup on a street corner then working there
bad,"This is the worst company I have ever had. Management is the worst. They treat you like the worst human being ever. Yell at you for trying to work your stores l, but then yell if you go over by even a minute."
bad,Inside the Pepsico/Fedex warehouse there is a lot of racial discrimination and racial targeting. Me and other African American coworkers have been told we are not allowed to talk to one another or any other coworkers.
bad,jefes despotas se burlan de ti señalan al personal no cumplen con lo que ofrecen ademas de que no tienen trato humano aunque tu hagas cosas de mas y te esfuerzes eso no vale para ellos prepotencia al maximo y los operadores de las maquinas no hacen nada cuando se trata de limpieza el operador de produccion lo tiene que hacer todo y encima se mufan .
bad,"Average 50 hours per week. Pay is decent , but no home life or life with family. Start time is usually around 4 a.m. struct on the 14 hour day and 60 hours per week."
bad,Mandatory overtime 12 hour days including weeekends. No time off. No off days. Low man power and as a result forced overtime. Do not work in maintenance department in St. Louis!
bad,You have no time for yourself. You're expected to do a huge amount of work in very little time. If you don't finish your work in the time the phone says you get yelled at then punished. If you're sick they don't care they want you there regardless. Avoid them at all cost.
bad,Seriously run for your life! 16.50 sounds good for merchandising BUT IT ISNT ENOUGH FOR YOUR SANITY! I am a current employee looking for another job because the chaos is just too much! People are always calling on or quitting I’ve been here a year and about 15 people have quit in that time! Management lies during interviews says it’s easy job and you can easily move to sales rep NEGATIVE! They don’t even try to advance you because they can’t keep any merchandisers! Your day starts at about 430-5am and you will be working until 4 sometimes 6 PM! You never get help but they will send you all over Oklahoma to help sales reps WHO MAKE WHAT WE MAKE PLUS COMMISSION!  You will walk into stores that have empty a** coolers because sales reps never do them and a back room full of pallets. Overtime ha don’t even think about it you will just get yelled at for taking to long. No accountability for sales reps merchandisers get blamed for everything and micromanaged! If you have a family don’t plan on seeing them on the days you work and plan on being useless from exhaustion on your off days.Seriously don’t do it unless you are desperate. Can’t wait to leave this joke!
bad,"Delegacion que solo busca amiguetes sin buscar profesionalidad en los candidatos, prefieren a un amiguete escayolista a un vendedor de toda la vida y con años de experiencia"
bad,"Horrible treatment of new hires. Clueless management and some racist bullies going uncheck.ed Human resources seem to be absent or outsourced. No acknowledgement from the ""leadership""  for people's time and efforts. Customer Supply chain is an example of disastrous functions where customers' orders keep piling up for days and days and short leads are kings. Supervisors will boldly tell team members Not to care about customers' needs and feedbacks."
bad,The management is poor and you dont get raises managers dont know what they are doing most of the time they pick and choose there favorites and talk about you nehind yoir back
bad,"Poor company and  poor management save your time , license, and body way better opportunities for a CDL driver. Best thing for you to do is keep looking and stay away."
bad,"Strong marketing and public relations for product as well as career and work life.  However, below the surface, the experience dramatically falls short and is just simply disappointing."
bad,Very discriminating company especially to women.  New direction for the company is men to be promoted with no regards to women. Women are frowned upon and ridiculed.
bad,not good bad work environment poor management poor working conditions constant layoffs no benefits when fulltime paid union dues with no benefit no benefits
bad,Horrible Place to work for. The plant manager does not care about his employees at all. He is all about his bonuses. The supervisors and managers under him are good people.
bad,"There is no communication between Corp office and depots. There is a reason the turnover rate is so bad. Service issues because under staffed, delivery issues because of understaffed. The inventory management is awful, it's a plain circus"
bad,Very bad job bad management low pay back breaking work pay should be much better no raise unless you know the mgt not good benefits trucks are not the best
bad,"If you black , Latino or minority you not welcome at Pepsi, they focus on firing all blacks, Latinos and minorities,  it’s run  buy white supremacy’s , only whites get promoted or keep their jobs . Nobody else"
bad,"Upper management is terrible, they never have the answers to any of your questions and will always give you the run around. Management will just tell you anything so that you will stop bothering them, also when it is time for a raise it takes months before it goes into effect."
bad,Different rules for different people. Put in for a opening and didn't even get a interview for it after 10 years of experience. If you don't have a degree you won't go no where.
bad,Management is backwards. No leadership! People have roles they shouldn’t have at the company. Pay was great but the people under the BCR not so much. Take it from me!
bad,"Requested off for the birth of my son, was told by my supervisor it wasn't his problem so I had to just call in that day (scheduled C-section).  I explained I needed my schedule to not be so chaotic for a month while my family adjusted to the new baby.  I went from working evenings 5 days a week to working 6 12 hours shifts per week jumping between 6am shifts and 4pm shifts.  The point in the PT position is to work into a FT position but new management seems to like keeping people trapped in PT so they do not receive any benefits at all.  I watched full time position open up one after another and no one was moved up to fill those positions but new PT employers were hired instead.  I relocated closer to my route to cut down on my travel time and within a month my route was moved to another county!  You have to use your own vehicle but you are paid mileage which works out pretty nice if you have the right car.  Whenever you think your shift is finally about over your phone rings and you get 2 more stores dropped on you.  This is a job that promises you a future career if you can stop loving your family."
bad,Pepsi says they care about their employees but doesn’t give them a cost of living raise. We went up 0.001¢ for commission. They make you work long hours with aweful pay. One position works half as hard and makes twice the money vs. a position that requires special training and more physical labor. Management is only out to get what benefits them the most. The routes are horribly inconsistent and never get better. They constantly give us more responsibility but fail to compensate us for it. Will never work here again
bad,"Poor management, lack of proper training"
bad,Definitely not worth your time. Unless things have drastically changed in 2 yrs. it was horrible. Junk equipment junk vehicle. The faster you get your job done the more work they assign you with the same pay.
bad,Good luck with this Outsourcing Shell of a Company. You will have 0 Job  Security. Layoffs every other month. Zero culture. On the plus side I had a great team.
bad,"Running a truck route as a merchandiser for 12.25 an hour.  While also being in charge of the handheld, the paperwork, getting my check reconed. (Reconed means taking money from your check.)  They would do it product was not loaded, or I went over the 12 hour mark, because “it’s impossible to work that many hours in a day”"
bad,"If you want to be treated worst than a human go work for them, PepsiCo is a racist company from top to bottom. If you go to HR you might as well quite....."
bad,"Господа не советую пытаться устроиться в эту организацию. Обещают трудоустройство по тк, а по факту данная компания считается аутсорсинговой. Прошёл собеседование сказали можешь увольняться со старой работы и приходить к нам, оформил все документы в офисе м. Павелецкая, прошёл мед. осмотр. Я уволился и целый месяц рекрутер меня динамил. В итоге звонил сам, постоянно кормили завтраками, потом оказалось что медицинская книжка утеряна. Потом книжка нашлась, назначали инструктаж на следующий день. К вечеру написали, что нужны справки от нарколога и психолога, неожиданно понадобились справки заранее об этом никто не говорил. Все справки пришлось делать за один день и за свой счёт, направления не дали. В завершении пришёл на инструктаж, на проходной вышел парень и отказал! Менеджер не ответственно относиться к кандидатам, из-за них я остался без денег и без работы."
bad,"low paid, hard labor, no advancement opportunity to speak of. mistreatment by supervisor on a daily basis. very stressful and ungrateful atmosphere to be in!"
bad,Not sure what to say. I think i had the worst manager in all of PBG. He had no idea how to manage. He had no idea how to do the job. Just terrible. All the way around.
bad,Very nice respectful people to work for. Cares for there employees safety. Very easy to get along with other coworkers before going out to have to go out to deliver product
bad,"Do not work here. You will regret, I assure you. Low level managers, and inexperienced. High, high, turnover on a daily, weekly monthly basis. *** WARNING *** ***STAY AWAY ***"
bad,"Very negative environment, bad management, backstabbing to gain advancement. Don't believe the paid positive reviews in company magazines or the lies from the butt kissers. Hard work does not pay off here, only whose butt you are willing to wipe. "
bad,Me parece mal que aún se trabaje con efectivo en la calle ya que corres el riesgo de que te asalten y la empresa eso lo cuestiona
bad,"-Very poor management"
bad,You have to beg for a raise. And when they agree on a raise it will take MONTHS to be finally put in. No OT they may make you come in late or take a long lunch so you stay at your 40.
bad,"Bored and confused, right? This sentence could apply to a product launch, reorganization of the company, a hiring spree or a round of layoffs. And therein lies the problem with business jargon. It’s often meaningless, uninspiring and unmemorable."
bad,"Working for Pepsico in Wilmington is an absolute joke of a job. If you are considering it, DONT! The management is a joke and they are all incredibly lazy. The managers never give their employees any appreciation after all of the hard work and extra days picked up because of the lack of employees . Management does not supply proper equipment and uniforms because they dont have enough for all workers such as gloves,t shirts,pants etc. They will try to bribe you with 2 hours of OT every day but it isn't worth it because the pay is laughable. The turn over rate is unbelieveable simply because of the unrealistic expectation that we are expected to fulfil. You will work very hard and the payoff isn't worth it. Managers will leave you hanging when you need their help and while you wait for their help, they will later give you complaints about you wasting time on a route. I dreaded going to work and me quitting was the best decision I ever made. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME! Other companies pay at least $20 /hr ,this company is trash. The company doesnt give you the correct amount of sick hours before the holidays because they dont want you to use them during the holidays (which is illegal BTW) goes to show how trash and cheap the company is. You've been warned"
bad,"The typical work week included 18 hour workdays packed into 14 hour days at the cutoff time. Many employees worked ""off the clock to cover other employees work or their own because it was too much to finish in 14 hours.   Managers were always doing hourly and warehouse jobs because employees didn't show up because they were often sick or injured. , 70- 80 hour hour weeks, workday start between 1-3am.  machismo culture.  unhappy employees, high turnover."
bad,"They'll work you until you get hurt and then they'll expect you to work some more. I had to leave due to a tumor in my chest that causes me constant pain and Pepsico's insurance company Sedgwick fought me for over a year on getting the disability payments that I was owed. Finally they found doctors (that had never seen me) look at my medical records and decide that I was fine to go back to work even though my own cancer Specialists were saying I was not fine to work."
bad,I would not let my dog work for this place wanna work ya for commission n wanna recon ya for things n charges you for drug test worse experience to everyone unless ur desperate n need a job don’t get cdl through Pepsi gotta stay 6 months n they own ya then i had my cdl for many years n my advice run run n never look back

The PMA franchise covers southern Illinois, southwestern Kentucky, southeast Missouri, northwest Tennessee, and northeast Arkansas. The PMA franchise employs around 1,000 employees in this region. "
bad,If you’re looking for a delivery job in the beverage business this place is not for you! If you want to spend your life filling shelves coolers and displays and being unappreciated this job is for you! Management doesn’t care about you or your family they only care about whether or not you hit all of your stops and filled all shelves and coolers.
bad,Was a route drive CDL. Management had no CDL or truck driving training. Would aunt the wrong trucks on the wrong routes then complain when deliveries couldn't be made. And the branch manger is the circus ringleader who has no clue what he is doing. And hires unqualified supervisors for ever department delivery and sales managers.
bad,There is no training you are constantly being cursed at and degraded and management doesn't care your just a body to fill a gap and they lie to from jump saying they are there to see u and help you succeed they are there to degrade you and run you into the ground
bad,pesima no pagan nada bien te ponen metas que jamas vas a lograr para que no te paguen lo q deberian
bad,horible place to work not recomended  did not learn anything intresting or usfull. horrible work to life balacne would work 50 hours a week or more and could not be confisidated for overtime
bad,Poor leadership and lack of direction are the cornerstones at PepsiCo. Many good people left the company due to issues as such. I would steer clear from applying at PepsiCO
bad,"They will short your hours on your paycheck. This happens to a dozen employees every week. Then they will say they will fix it, and only sometimes do. The work hours are never what they say either. Also extremely unsafe working conditions that wont be addressed. No raises either, youll get a quarter every year or so if your lucky. Consider any other job first as this will be a waste of your life that you will regret."
bad,"They have not honored my initial salary offer (which doing so is illegal for a good reason)"
bad,"No one likes working here. Management doesn’t care about you, they constantly lie to you. You’re just a body in the seat. Not enough pay for all the work you do. All the equipment and trucks are old, they aren’t safe to be on the road. Not enough gear and equipment to do your job. Just not a safe place to work."
bad,"Very steady, underpaid, and no care for employees. Only one break. This company as far as the one located in Hattiesburg Ms is horrible. My only good experience is the fact that I have a job."
bad,"At Pepsi no employee was valued they were seen as disposable cogs in their machine. plan to work 60+ hours a week, plan to work every holiday ever, and plan to do the work of two sometimes three people."
bad,"Its a cool place to work but it really sucks when all the leads give you a run around about a question you may have, also I put in time off for a couple of days which got approved but come to find out my team lead said they wasn't and they let me go"
bad,A fair and safe work environment. Managers take care of their employees. They cared for the workers' welfare. No paid holidays and new employees have to reapply.
bad,"Manangers are horrible  the machines are horrible over 35 years old they don’t care about you but you better be there on time or your wrote up even if your mom dies you better be there! Most unorganized place I’ve worked none of the manangers know what’s going on, maintence sucks The machines break and mess up every other hour they put a bandaid on it and keep going don’t fix it right at all you mean nothing to them if you can’t run 4 machines that mess up constantly by your self  at a 80 percent they will let you go! The pay is good not worth it at all glad I got away"
bad,"The managers call you out of your name because they do not like remembering  your name, they will either say its too hard to remember or other times they will tell you to hush and to get back to work."
bad,They dumb they don’t make No sense. They like to pick on the younger one and abuse them. The mangers don’t got your back and will stab you in the back
bad,job sucks and the work doesn't add up with money and i would never recommend anybody to work there!....its a bad job with poor management and the company cars always breaks down!
bad,Routs sales rep means you drive broken down old vehicles and deliver snacks and stock the shelves.  There is no sales in the route sales rep role.  You often have to start your day at 3 or 4 am and work until all scheduled deliveries are done.
bad,Students are paid less than half of the other employees and do the most work. They do not care about the students. Force you to work in 30 degree weather and time your every move.
bad,"Managers make decisions in vacuums, and then when they don't work they tell their folks to fix them."
bad,Terrible hours.  Worked in unairconditioned docks loading cases to fill side load trailers 5 days a week. Docks were exactly 8 foot. Don’t b off 1 inch with terrible guides and no help
bad,"Horrible Company. Takes money from checks if machines are short, which is out of your control! When you ask why and how to prevent it from continuing, no one can give you a straight answer."
bad,also depending on which facility.  Perhaps HQ in New YOrk is better in terms of the diversity.  Other southern areas of US at Pepsi are truly horrible.  Tons of EEOC.
bad,"No organization ‘the place was gross not clean at all, managers were not on hands at all,the area it was in was the highest crime area in Cincinnati, I would not recommend Pepsi for anyone to work at"
bad,"Would not recommend PepsiCo. It was strictly head-down invoice processing. No interaction between co-workers, no talking. It was demeaning and stressful. They did not want people, they wanted robots."
bad,"bad management, poor people skills, they reward employee that do less work than employee that work hard.The training for new employee is sucks, they only train for one day and they own their own."
bad,"Management didn’t comunicated correctly with their employees, management didn’t manage though situations correctly. Got forced to worked 12 hours regularly, good workers always had to pick up the bad workers slack."
bad,"Bad culture, untrained management, no advancement opportunities & negative customer feedback market wide.  Exploited in hourly position to cover sales routes & unfair compensation during vacation coverage.  Very unethical management tactics & practices.  Hands down the worst job experience in my entire working career.  The most enjoyable part of my job was quitting."
bad,Worked there less then a year and felt like a lifetime. I was a new employee and thrown to the wolves with management not caring as long as they got their bonuses.
bad,"Long days, lots of hours and OT. Management is a joke."
bad,"Long day and hours, no a/c in the trucks and no heat in the winter. Daily routes not scheduled right and stressful conditions. Low pay for all the driving and work you have to do."
bad,Stressful and no support from management.  Management was not pro-active in giving employess the resources needed to complete daily job functions.  No room for advancement.
bad,"unfair treatment, 15+ hours with one break. also was always cut-throat with breaks. dangerous levels of gases in warehouse with no ventilation. punished for trying to recieve fresh air"
bad,Deep depression. Smoked way to many cigarettes there. Left the company hand haven't had one cigarette in 15 months. Poor management poor life balance. Never get time off on weekends and my two days off were Tuesday and Thursday and I was working graveyard. Missed my kids missed my wife. Any ways they just sell cancer in a can and you can get just as good water out of your sink. Look at there future. There market is dead.
bad,"You worked 14 hours a day throwing cases of soda, you started at 5am every morning and returned at 7pm every night M-F. It was very hard to complete your route everyday when you are given 22-25 stops per day taking roughly 30-45min. per stop."
bad,"Thanks Pepsico for leading me on for about a month in April playing phone tag with two department honchos, being told that ""if we like you we'll give you a face to face interview""; only to be told via email (a cowardly way to do things) that you would go with someone else with more than likely less experience. ""Like you"" shouldn't be in the lexicon of people who hire and business leadwers/representatives. Don't waste your time with these clowns."
bad,Like most retail companies it is very demanding/ stressful. This place was no exception. they give you unrealistic goals to meet because that's how they pay you. They pressure you to meet these goals with while being understaffed (always Understaffed)  labor intense along horrible communication topping it off with horrible pay its no wonder they can never keep people because of how badly they treat the workers. Everyone is always overworked and under paid. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
bad,"Working at pepsi has been by far the worst experience I have ever had the displeasure of having. Your normal day starts at around 4 am when you drive 10+ miles to your first store, and then have to clean up the mess made by the previous merchandiser.  During this time, you are then berated by loading dock workers and grocery managers for not ordering enough product (which is not your job in the first place).  Then, when you attempt to explain the situation and how to reconcile for it, they threaten you with a ""kick-out"", which is basically where they ban you from the store and report you to your supervisor (which then leads into more issues).  After cleaning up the mess made by the previous merch, you then receive your product load, where you receive upwards of 8 to 10 pallets worth of product, some product is snuck into order to increase the 'commission pay' sales reps receive for each product sold, newer products = more pay, great for the sales reps but not for the merchandiers.  additionally, Newer products = no place to go = takes up space in backroom = client gets angry at you.  once finished with your first store, and taking upwards of 4 hours to do so, you are then expected to go immediately to your next store. If you are expected to arrive at a certain time, not only will your supervisor contact you and tell you to drop everything you are doing, but every so often the actual client will call you and yell at you over the phone for ""being late"".  Not leaving a whole lot of time to take state mandated breaks or lunches, you could work at full 10 hour shift plus overtime,"
bad,management was terrible and the hours are ridiculous along with a lot of other things. every week you schedule was bound to change then I didn't like how the only way you would find out was at the end of your work week through email
bad,Most of the management have no idea about how the routes should be done and how to schedule the routes because they have never done the job of being a driver and do not take the advice from any of the drivers. The company cares more about numbers than they do their workers.
bad,"It started out great, but with a management change it went from a good place to work to a terrible environment.  You are micro-managed, you get no support or feedback, you ask for help and you don't get it. You will get blamed for everything that goes wrong."
bad,When delivering for customers. It truly sucks when you deliver 50 cases. And have to move 150 cases just to make that deliver. So instead of a delivery being 25 minutes per stop. It takes you an 1 and  half to make a simple delivery. And when you call management they phones not working. Until you miss a stop.
bad,terrible company to work for. Only care about their bottom line. You get punished when you use your sick days. You are treated less than human. The management is terrible. The plant manager is the worst I have ever worked for. The worst union I have ever seen.
bad,"they have new driver work 88 hr a week and paid them $500.00 a week however after tax's they only take home $138 a week."
bad,"Do not work for Pepsi Mid America. "
bad,"Poor pay, no vacation till after 1 calendar year, no sick time, 1 personal day a year, shifts vary from 8 hours to +15 hours. management who only knows how to sit on the computer and watch youtube. very hostile environment, always fights and arguments due to lack of proper management and hiring standards."
bad,You only advance if youre friends with supervisor. PT pay working FT hours. No insurance. Management needs big improvement. Not at all run very well. They make the work harder than it should be.
bad,"Pepsi has been a great company to work for until the last several years.  I was able at one point to learn and advance as a result of doing my job, the benefits were great!  Even though that no longer exists with Pepsi. I have still managed to learn some new skills as part of my current role - and will always be grateful for all the skills i have acquired in the 22 yrs I have been with them."
bad,Funcionários não tem plano de carreira. Muitas pessoas ficam com problemas psicológicos como Depressão e Síndrome do Panico. Benefícios são bons para níveis a partir de Coordenação.
bad,day to day operation was not intended to make the employee comfortable and management was not helpful when faced with problems on the job. very very high turnover
bad,"Not a good work atmosphere and don't you dare drink a coke product onsite, at pepsi you are just a number and you are not vauled at all. If  your a YES man you will get used up and spit out."
bad,Labeled as part time so you get nothing no health insurance no time off but yet u still work full time hours its a shady company to work for . always get last minute notice that you are going to work one of your days off and always threats of getting fired if u tell them you cant work you made plans for that day.
bad,Eleman Alınacak diye çoğu siteye ilan vermiş onca yol yürüyüp başvuru yapmaya gidiyorsun alım yok diyip gülüyorlar  birde !
bad,"if you only want money, don't work here cause they do not pay enough for the b.s you put up with...  the hardest part of the job is dealing with customers after doing all that physical work"
bad,I wouldn't wish this place on my worst enemy the management is horrible the trainers are overworked and grouchy and they are all terrified of visits from the owner.
bad,"all good and natural, typical day at work. very interesting, popular, enjoyable. ived learn how to manage my time i learn to enhance more mu skills and abilities"
bad,"Worst environment imaginable. Management will lie, cheat and steal for personal gain. They will destroy employees to advance their own agenda. Safety is non existent and compliance is a word muttered in myth."
bad,Sirketler buyumeye calısirken alttakiler genelde küçülür
bad,"Terrible job with terrible pay, terrible hours, and terrible management! They start you at $12 while Coke starts their employees at $18 and 7UP starts at $15 to do the exact same job!!! They force you to work overtime every single day NO MATTER WHAT!! If you try to leave after 8 hours every day you will get fired. You must work until the Job is done!! That means you will be working from 4am to 5 pm some days! (Sunrise to Sunset) "
bad,"Not enough money for what you do. "
bad,I learned that if a company has little to no respect for there employees. This effects everything. The morale was the lowest I have ever witnessed anywhere. Everyone was against everyone no one not once received so much as a compliment for their efforts.
bad,A great experience until management personnel changed and people came in that did not have an interest in continuing to make their employees happy. While being concerned for themselves and their own well being.
bad,"Pepsi is not a place you would want to work at. They do not treat their employee fair, employees work long hour for little pay. Management talks and treats employees how ever they feel like."
bad,İnsana verilen deger çok ilkel Verilen maasa göre istenilen iş uçurum
bad,"Obviously, the delivery manager at Canton, MA location was not a driver before and has no idea what a driver position really is.  I would not recommend Pepsico for any driver"
bad,Bad place won't even give you a chance to get hired even with you having all the experience they are looking for still won't give a hard working individual a job or chance to provide for his family
bad,back breaking work all day for 12 hours.  Managers are unprofessional and are just looking for employees to get the order done.  Youll stay till 3 Am.
bad,Bad managmet. Don't compensate their worker's fairly for the job their doing . everything they tell you in your interview is not true and they take advantage of their workera
bad,Management can't do the jobs they expect others to complete. Managers talk poorly about employees behind their back. Instead of telling employees they have a problem and helping them fix the issue they would rater terminate the employee. Typical employee rarely makes it a year at Pepsi  MidAmerica. AKA-Crisp Container. It's not even real Pepsi.
bad,Worked here in the past.  Management was never what it needed to be.  Had no structure or goals.  They would hire anyone just to fulfill their employment needs but had high rate of turnover.
bad,Will never work for Pepsi again.  Very cut throat and racist to anybody who isn't white.  They dont care for their employees. I should have been let the company
bad,I m not happy for this post..hard working & more time including some money for me but not response by Pepsi co...therefore I quit this job...my ta da & incentive r not receive me.... I loose my time for pepsi co
bad,"i like this job great place to work nice people .the most enjoyable of this jobs was monday free chips,drinks & pizza all u can eat salad bar great hours"
bad,So unorganized..I had to train myself  on big million dollar machines. The machines were never running the way they should. They didn't train anyone right. Just over all a horrible place to work.
bad,"the issues has and will continue to cause high turnover in the drivers/help. if the upper level management would take a concern in what the drivers who do the job on a daily basis have to say, I think it would be a different situation."
bad,The management here is terrible. You are supposed to receive bonuses my route was up the whole time I worked there. Structure is always being changed there in order for you to not receive your full compensation.
bad,"not able to provide my needs because of my position which on-call so i need to wait for them to call me when they needed more manpower to work for them, so i decided to look for other job opportunity."
bad,"Management looking for someone to blame, never at root cause, employees  moan but don't stand up. Pepsi treats them like dirt and does not care about any one except ones in their clicks..."
bad,"This company over works their employees, Promises Commission pay that does not come, does not compensate for all the extra hours worked everyday, and does not change any working conditions to accommodate to their employees livelihood."
bad,The is no chance of advancement. The work environment is hard and glum. None full time employees are treated like slaves and disrespected and over worked. Paid little but expected to work miracles.
bad,"Pepsi that I worked at was not under PepsiCo Inc. was independent "
bad,"Worst company to drive for. Long hours, junk equipment. Horrible people in charge. No structure. After working here for some time, you start to hate the people you work with and yourself. Payroll department and supervisors will constantly make mistakes on your check. This place is hazardous for your health."
bad,"Come to work pick up your truck, along with your computer, computer cable and your handheld computer. make sure all your product is accounted for on your truck."
bad,buen compañerismo incentivos para cada día mejorar como empresa cada empleado era fundamental para la empresa
bad,Management is the worst. Communication isn't there. Worst company I've worked for. The structure of the company has changed so much in the last few years to benifit the company rather than the hard working employees.
bad,I have enjoyed working with this company for 3 years. I have never called in for all 3 years. It is very disappointing as the management is very unprofessional in which there is to much gossip.
bad,"They will lie to you, steal compensation, make promises that never happen. The management would make great politicians for they are part of that, ""good old boy"" club. Just get in the good old boy club and you will have it made."
bad,"If your a single individual who doesn't want a social life, then this is a job for you. If you want a family then look elsewhere. Try supporting a family on the salary in this position is impossible."
bad,The fact that Pepsi is the leader in soft drinks is foreshadowed by the employees they hire to run their warehouses. My boss was on my case from the time I walked in until I got into my care. This was overkill and very unnecessary.
bad,Empresa não custeia ajuda de custo do vendedor externo em nada! somente comissões.
bad,This company was moving all of its payroll in one location. We worked long hours and were under appreciated for it. There was also a lot of racism. I felt like I needed to be out of the situation.
bad,Im a hard worker and take pride in what i do no matter what it is. But working for pepsi was a mistake i watched people with higher power treat others badly just for fun on a daily basis
bad,I don't know where to begin.  So I wont.  Stay away from this company.  You wont get a paycheck some weeks.  They will work you to death.  Continuously hiring new management.
bad,Worst job I have ever had they sit there and tell you that they care about your personal life but work you 14-16 hours a day 6 days a week. Other employees talk trash to and about new hires which isn't a very warming welcome to the company. This facility produces the most work and works the most hours and gets payed the less and management acknowledges it like it's a good thing. The main warehouse Manager is rude and only sees you as a number.
bad,Pepsi has downgraded a lot since I've been working. Cut backs on everything. Managers have no experience and don't consider employees feedback. People I worked with stab you in the back.
bad,"If you can avoid this place to work please do yourself a favor and do so. Managers dont care, unfair, work in bad conditions. Beaufort, sc.  do not train properly and expect you to know job"
bad,would not recommend anybody work there. they don't care about there workers. no time to spend with your family and low pay........................................................
bad,bad company to work for this company treats there employes bad work you like your a robot constantly adding stores when your almost done with your stores on your route
bad,this company is not about there employees in Memphis too many skus and you will too many out of date and they will act like its ok and then fire you after u clean it up. great pay and schedule BAD company. they been swiching managers so no one knows what they are doing.
bad,"Pepsi Company warehouse on Westbelt in nashville, Tn"
bad,"there are third party working and there poor management worst. "
bad,This company they dont know how storage the merchandise on the racks. Its a pain in the ... to look for some product they put it in one location today and two weeks later they put it in the other side of the warehouse. Things like that.
bad,"cubre turnos"
bad,"Management is a disgrace. Turn over rate is ridiculous. Mount Vernon depot is a joke. No help, no pay and stupid hours. You are left alone to work, alone if products or money come up missing. They automatically assume you stole it and take out of your check. Bonuses are pathetic as well as the environment. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this place."
bad,Pepsi Mid America is not a good company to work for thy hire for a position and keep putting you on other positions that you were not trained for and then getting upset when you did not do well on the job you weren't trained for.
bad,"over worked employees, lack of breaks, no employee handbook or benefits. the place is a total mess that cuts corners and under staffs to save money."
bad,very unorganized poor managment it was horrible have to get get drafted on off days barely get a day off most of the time we worked 14 hours instead of 10 no appreciation shown we always had to buy our food on appreciation week just horrible and selfish
bad,"A typical day isn't bad the work is simple and easy, the management is severely lacking though. Little to no respect is paid to their employees, they often times forget their own responsibilities and pass the buck to the nearest employee."
bad,Beware stay away only for new drivers or drivers needing a redemption ( DUI accidents) other than that stay away training routes are a joke 15 stops 700 case  count is not for a trainee they try to push a ton of volume in one day over a million cases pushed the week of labor day  absurd
bad,"Worst place to work! I've been employed there for 3 years now, was given a full time position and it was taken 3 months later. Have a family of 4 and can't even give me more than 20 hours a week. I still pay into the union when I'm not union. They do not care for their employees what so ever."
bad,"A Empresa e os colaboradores só cobrão e nao dão suporte para o funcionario,nem ao menos alimentaçao"
bad,"Terrible company to work for. absolutely terrible. This is a dead end job that will make you work your butt off 50+ hours a week while being underpaid. They expect so much but offer so little. Steer clear of this joke of a ""company"""
bad,I did not enjoy this job at all. This was a very depressing place to work. Bosses where very rude and did not seem to care about employees at all.
bad,"Pepsi in Sherman, Texas is a terrible place to work. The management is horrible and they expect everything from you, and give nothing in return. The plant manager is the biggest liar and is constantly putting the employees down. There is major favoritism and it is very obvious. They do  it give you time with your family and demand you be available anytime they need. Again I can't stress enough the plant managr is the worst type of manager and is very disrespectful."
bad,For anyone who wants to be a slave this is a good job for you The benefits are OK union is a very very little help they keep you out and don't tell you when your next-door is more that they're going to add a store then they expect you to work the overtime if you say no you're penalized
bad,"Horrible benefits an employee with a family of four pay 600 a month plus a $2,500 deductible managers look for ways to push their job on two employees constantly people are fired without notice and constantly harassed"
bad,"Venta distribucion y cobranza . Manejo de sistemas, control de stock, manipulacion del producto,vencimientos y calidad. La gerencia mala, mis colegas muy buenos, sin dificultades , libertad para tomar desiciones."
bad,If you have a life run from this place!! Long hours for very little money and for all the health problems that will come your way. Management team is a complete joke only answer they can give to anything is it is what it is. There is the buddy system in place for promotions if your in the inner circle of buddy's. This company is a dead end job basically if you value your family life stay away!!!
bad,they care more about there numbers than the health and safety of there own employees expecting them to do more with less time.
bad,"Im a current employee and the commission pay, routes and management is unorganized. Need to be hourly only and fix the AC in every truck. Texas summer weather is horrible and management seems to not care about the drivers health being they have you doing up to 21 stops and 600 cases by yourself. Pepsi is a 80 billion plus dollar a year company and dont care about the employees. The turn over rate is extremely high due to how hard the work is, management and being unorganized. Be aware if you thinking about working here, this is what you will go thru every single day."
bad,"Everything going great, at my 30, and 60 review, all good marks then when I hit 90 days., told me my numbers were not up to standard. It was the same time, I was to get into union and get pay raise. Don't work here. Just want temps they can pay peanuts to."
bad,"Terrible work life balance, managers push for volume and products but are rarely ever seen. Management is just terrible."
bad,I  did not enjoy the time I worked at Pepsi. The company was more concerned about profit more than the will being of its employees. I learned that I had to look out for my best interests because the company did not care about me. Management did not care about your personal life and if it did not benefit them they did not care. The best part of my job was I was able to manage my schedule for start my day and ending my day. The hardest part was physical labor that was required with very little help given when you needed it most. The most enjoyable part of the job was finding a new job.
bad,"im talking REALLY bad. Even the can tastes better than it's contents."
bad,I really didn't like PepsiCo and plus i was a temp But i stayed until my assignment was done but i would never go back there but i did learn a lot there mostly the rf scanner
bad,they have no idea what they put their employees through but at the end of the day they think they do. then on top of that the managers take our life for a joke and tend to us like we are kids instead of adults
bad,"I wouldn't work at the Las Vegas location! Avoid! This place is filled with corrupted merch managers and sales managers  These individuals like to favortize certain employees. They never acknowledged the hard working individuals, and for the ones who don't do their job correctly even get awarded sometimes. The pay isn't enough for all those long hours and stress one must deal with on a daily basis."
bad,"I do not recommend working here. Senior Leadership does not care about the people that work for them, only sales goals to pad their own resumes. Work/life balance doesn't exist. Leadership refers to the job as a ""lifestyle"", not a career. Company has gone through multiple ""restructurings"" since PepsiCo purchased the two Anchor Bottlers a few years ago. They just keep cutting and cutting and cutting while lining the pockets of their Executives and investors while asking what is left of front line and lower management to give more and more of themselves. The driver job is the worst job in the company. The pay is not worth the job requirements."
bad,"The most unethical, unprofessional, obscene organization that I have ever worked for.  A very poor employer and produces poor-quality beverages."
bad,Horrible company to work for lie about hrs and jip you in pay each week i regret working there. Good co workers is the only good
bad,This company was very unorganized. It was the worst pay/salary I was paid and the health benefits were awful. Schedules consist on early mornings and end with late nights with no help on delievery routes. Drivers had to merchandise product and never could get ahold of any of the supervisors. Sales men made up orders for stores.
bad,La empresa tendrá prestigio pero detrás de las paredes es otra cosa muy diferente en cuanto a los jefes calidad y elaboración
bad,Pepsi Beverages Company over works & underpays their employees. The treatment of their employees is poor. They have no employee incentives.
bad,"bought out by peeps bottlers. no longer in operation, not doing business any more with anyone. asdf and fads ads fads def fad asdf sd"
bad,"First and foremost,the pay is lacking $629 base salary plus commission......commission which is 4 cents on cases you drop off and 9 cents for cases you stock. Pretty much keep your pay weekly under $1000 . transportation supervisor,doesn't even possess a Class A CDL,how can you manage drivers in a field you know nothing about? Don't waste your time applying here, apply with Coca-Cola,their drivers always happy and well compensated"
bad,Working for this company as an contractor was quite different than any other company I've work for in the past as a contractor. My experience was they don't treat their contractors with respect in the AP department.
bad,"Nothing but one big Harry Crisp ego trip. The most disorganized company ever. There is no where to have lunch in the depot. They want you to leave. That is, until its time to leave  at 6 pm. I never got off at 6. Always 7 or later. My DM told me to leave at 6, but my GM would always make me stay late. I had to go to a pointless meeting every week an hour away. Male on female harrassment is just a normal thing in that office.. the DM is rude and on a power trip."
bad,Demandamos un mejor sueldo y nos corrieron a todos a 35 preventistas
bad,"Trabajar en pepsico aprendi a envasar productos alimenticios ,controlar,a poder desempeñarme en forma rápida."
bad,"No family work life balance."
bad,"You're just a number in the company. Management won't hire good hard workers. But people who work there are nice, helpful, supportive."
bad,The overall moral of this company has gone down the drain. This is an okay place to work if you are single and don't have a family or any other commitments.
bad,Terrible equipment no way to move up in the company from the loader position.  Poor staffing poor management.  Too much favoritism
bad,As a quality officer I handle one line shift wise and fully responsible for quality compliances and deviations on line and final product.
bad,"Job starts at 2-3am on weekends. Work 13+ hours just to get yelled at by store managers. 5 to 6 stores to serve daily, so you have your boss plus the managers at each store yelling at you daily plus the receiving manager cause too much product in receiving. I stressed out daily even on my days off. Work 8-15 pallets at each store. Worst part is breaking down a pallet 8-9 foot tall to get 2 12 0acks to stock on shelf, then put product back on pallet to take back to back room. Most store won't allow pallets on the floor past 7am, so you would load product on a u boat to take out instead of pallet.... that means 1out of 5 stores you can take pallets out on a floor.. Such a joke.. PLEASE LISTEN. THIS JOB IS NOT WORTH IT AT ALL. You bust your but just to get yelled at.."
bad,"I would rather starve to death than work one more hour for these monsters."
bad,"If you like being harassed and belittled for doing your job and doing it well, obtaining and maintaining your quota/goals, going over and above to get the job done, then this is the company for you. If you are not invited into the little group of undesirables in the office your job could be in jeopardy and if a family member or friend of theirs needs a job I have seen them let people go that had been working here for years so their friends can have a job. The harder you work the worse it gets. Others who do nothing but promote drama within the workplace get promoted. Management is useless. Like I said if harassment is your thing you love it here!"
bad,If you get paid its wrong and your short and they don't care. The whole company is a joke I quit because i was tired of management and their lies wasted 3 years of my life there. If you need a job go to McDonalds because you make less and work 60+ hours for less then minimum wage
bad,I would not recommend Pepsi Co to anyone. The management would never help you with any concerns you may of had all they cared about was getting the product into the stores.
bad,"Do not work for Pepsi MidAmerica unless you want to be treated with no respect on a daily basis.  The ""higher ups"" had completely unrealistic expectations about what we needed to do.  The pay was not very good and there were never any raises.  When you are hired you have to pay for your own drug test and background check. This place is all about making money and has no regards to what employees are going through.  My health started going downhill the day I began working there."
bad,I worked my butt of for the company and was let go after three weeks of work. The excuse was I wasn't taking charge. The hours were weird and the work was brutal. I had to learn for my self and there was little to none training.
bad,I was vey disappointed with their training techniques; stayed in contact with my supervisor about my issues; but never got the proper training  to do the job.
bad,"From a viewpoint of all honesty, and compassion for my fellow humans, do not ever work for Pepsi. I worked for Pepsi for a while in Joplin, Missouri and finally couldn't take it anymore. Let's get this straight, I am no stranger to hard work. I expected the job to be physically demanding, but never in my wildest dreams could I have expected it to kill me like it did. I am physically in shape, and love fast paced work environments. I have had no trouble with working hard in the past. This place is a whole different story altogether. You have to be at your first location at 6 am, which my location was an hour away so I had to leave in my car at 5 am, meaning I had to wake up at 4-4:15 am. You have about 4-6 locations to merchandise a day, most of them being big box stores like Walmart or Target or large supermarkets. You receive a daily schedule everyday that estimates how much time it should take you to complete your tasks at each store. The whole schedule is a lie. At stores that usually took me 6 hours to merchandise, the schedule would estimate that it would take an hour and a half. Yeah, maybe it would have taken an hour and a half with 5 people doing the job. By the time you are finished with your first store, you are completely exhausted and ready to go home for the day. But, here it is, only 11 am and you have 4-5 stores around the same size left, all with 6-12 pallets full of Pepsi stuff left to completely stock on the shelves. On top of frantically trying to fill the near empty shelves and coolers at these stores, you are expected to look at 6 pt font dates on every"
bad,"I worked here as a vending technician and full line salesman in both marion and Mt. Vernon. And I can personally tell you that unless you're a manager that's good at ""kissing butt"" you'll never make it in this company. You get no benefits, barely any pay, all the managers lie to you and their superiors,  and Harry Crisp cares about nothing but money, so don't expect to see any raises that they promise you. They no longer put money into 401k,  the majority of the people you'll work with are either incredibly stupid, or they whine about everything. Gotta pick your poison there. The turnover rate is incredible, it's honestly impressive that the company has been in business this long. I could keep going with this review, but I'll just finish with this: DON'T EVER WORK FOR PEPSI MID AMERICA."
bad,"Horrible place to work, they don't care about there employees and don't care if your truck isn't safe to drive. Management blows up your personal phone and nothing is ever good enough."
bad,"No lunch breaks, constantly driving your own vehicle from stop to stop. No car no job. Breaking your back working in stores. No holidays off but x-mas. No appreciation from management. No promotions or even hoping for advancement unless you are a college hire or a woman or want to move. I feel bad for the few minorities working here. There is no hope for them. Long hours, no training from management. EXTREMELY high turnover rate. You have to be stupid to work here. This job blows! No job security. Employee satisfaction is always at a low. No respect except from the low level employees who are all miserable. I am sure they have labor violations. They hit you up for over a $1500 penalty if your employed spouse takes your insurance instead of their own company.  They don't like to hire anyone over 30. If I could rate negative stars I would. Work work work, like a robot. Management is quick to throw you under the bus. Never helps when needed."
bad,"Only good thing you get is driving experience, city driving.  Union a very bad idea as they pick and choose. Will not ever recommend this place to any new commercial driver or any driver.  Salary based. They exploit you, and at the end of the week you get a horrible pay check. Only good pay you get is while on training at 21.60 an hour, but after that you go salary without notice, and doing the same job plus for a salary pay.  On top of that you pay useless union fees.  Half of the people that work here are a bunch of rednecks, and racists.  Management won't take action in regards to this as they are and I quote ""a brother hood, and they protect each other."" If you are a minority forget working here and be respected. Hillbilly oriented in NH."
bad,"I would give it zero stars if I could the worst place to work ever not good pay and they don't let you do the job you are hired to do, the managers there have the slightest idea about what's going on there most of them never even done the job they are managers of! nobody wants to stay there, they are always looking for people. The job title says relief driver but your real job title is utility what a waste of a position name. They hire you for days but make you work evenings in the warehouse.and make you merchandise. You will never be a full time driver you will always be a low man there's no room for Advancement it's just my opinion but there's a couple of day shift managers that are ""Mama's Boys"""
bad,"Worst experience EVER!  Account Managers were hired on to replace the Truck Drivers role as sales person. Didn't know this at the time and only found out when Drivers would treat you poorly because they got a pay cut to afford my salary.  Awkward!  Horrible work life balance.  Management asked me to change my wedding date because of a product launch that same day. Yes, this really happened, and no, I didn't change our date.  Fast forward a year later, informed them I was pregnant and was let go a month later, when I said I couldn't lift over 50lbs."
bad,PBG ws converting to Pepsico and the company was going thru major changes and work life was difficult. Not enough hours to pay bills.
bad,"Recorrido diario de las instalaciones."
bad,"Poor management, they don't want to pay you what you already worked and they deffinatly wont pay you for the overtime worked..Horrible company to work for"
bad,It is a hard job that is rewarding. You will feel every day the struggle of the job. but it is a fun job
bad,"was hired in under the assumption I would get my Cdl. After 6 months, still no Cdl. Was never given time to take the test. Trailer was frequently wrong or loaded backwards. Management doesn't care!!!  Trucks would not pass dot inspection. Do not work here!!!  I would run away from this place as fast as possible!!!!!"
bad,pulling orders and filling up the conveyors with pallets full of bottles
bad,They treat the drivers like dirt dont care how long your out as long as they get there numbers
bad,"long hours, low pay, no advancement potential"
bad,"Place is a joke take money you work for for no reason.  You either don't receive a pay check and if you do it is short for different reasons.  Pay is ok, but its based on 40 hours and you never ever work that its more like 60 place is a joke don't ever work here you would be treated better at a fast food place"
bad,no me dio mucho gusto trabajar en esa empresa por que no dan solucion ah ninguna duda y no te apoyan en nada
bad,I quit because I worked 15 hours without a lunch and without a break. The management was not helpful and the pay was horrible.
bad,Just from what I've seen that place is not run in a professional manner at all. The managers do not show any respect whatsoever and there is no cohesion with anything. They don't care about the worker they just care about machines getting filled. And they lie. They say you get holiday pay but you don't. They say you get paid this but you get paid that. It is completely unprofessional. They don't even really train you to standard and they threw you to the wolves even before you are legal to do the job. I drove the truck before I had my class C license and was scared every day . I was told that if I didn't go on the route I would get fired! So they make you drive illegally when they are supposed to give you a week to get your class c license. They will work you from 6am -7 or 8 pm but only pay 350-400 a week . No overtime no holiday pay Nothing!!! Do not work for this company
bad,"Was hired on as a ""management trainee"".  I later understood this was a way of monitoring new hires to see if they would buy into the hostile, unethical, (probably illegal) and disfunctional Pepsi MidAmerica  regime.  Turnover there was the worse I have ever seen.  17 people quit in one day;  just walked out.  No one saw this as unusual.  "
bad,The working environment was not very good and the pay was minimum wage for an admin job.
bad,"after hired they will take your money out of your check for background checks and drug test and credit checks on the second pay. they do not train new employees the ropes of the jog .they leave you standing around for work to do. the checkers are expected to do all the cleaning, pick up damage merchandise that the pulls pull and run over in the warehouse. very little training as a checker on the products out . stand up all day not standing down to do computer work as the office people have . not a good place to work and the management no sense of managing the work flow. disable people should not apply they do not concern with your problems at all."
bad,Its a job but it would be nice to be appreciated for all the hardwork and long hours we put in. Unless you kiss the right butt you won't move up.
bad,Worst work environment I have ever been a part of.  There is a lack of loyalty for their employees.
bad,Till they abruptly cut you. The bottom line drives everything and you have very little say
bad,"When hired, it is very difficult (And made confusing) about getting your first paycheck. There is a system in place for paying you for your mileage driven but it is not paid weekly. Direct managers are nice and very friendly at first. (Over all, there okay) But when an issue arises with a store, and you the employee are not at fault for the issue but are wrongly blamed, instead of the company standing up for you, they leave you out to dry. When the work system is learned by everyone some will find it easy to leave one person to handle a 2 or 3 person job so the other person can run off and flake off the day and it is not noticed by management."
bad,Pick orders in a fast paced environment by using automated headset system and also hardcopy orders. Build skids precisely as per order instructions. I loaded and unloaded trucks by using a forklift and pallet jack.
bad,"Trabajo para cubrir gastos universitarios, es una empresa temporal no para puedes sostener tu vida con esta empres"
bad,"Merchandise anywhere between 3 to 5 super markets daily. Management could be helpful, co workers were great when it came to team work. The hardest part of the job was working holidays and the long hours of never knowing when you were going to be relieved. It was a job."
bad,unless your looking for working 60+ hours a week at less then min wage. DON'T Apply. The main office n marion is always looking for reasons to deduct your pay. never had to worry about my employer robbing me.  This company will give you a raise and take it way. Claiming that your raise has expired. never heard of a raise expiring.
bad,Place is ridiculously stupid to work for. You get a write up for working overtime. got fired for breaking something while installing it. drivers tear up these trucks way worse than what i did and they never get wrote up. Just plain stupid company to work for.
bad,It's a okay place to work. Some of the employees were nice. The job I did was okay.
bad,"Every aspect about this job is horrible. "
bad,"not a very fun place to work, the working run the show. management does nothing. and they get very mad about taking a sick day or needing the day off for family Emergency's"
bad,"Company cares more about revenue than employees,management very poor."
bad,"The pepsico in marion, awful place to work. I was nightshift 12 hour shifts. You get a mini 30 minute break about halfway through. The machinery is broken as far as their fail-safes, ran over my leg multiple times and eventually twisted it pretty good. Watched people get hit by forklifts, as well as product teeter tottering on the top rack when its placed up without care. Management? whats management in Pepsi? I watched my manager pick up a pallet and throw it across the factory into one of the shelves because he lost his temper. I  told my managers multiple times about the broken brakes on their machinery and nothing came of it. Talked to one of the employees that has been there longer than i was, and he told me that they don't want to spend the money on making sure their equipment is safely operating. As well as what they start you as, is about the only raise you will ever see working there, there has not been a ""raise"" in a few years from what i heard from the older workers. The company truely sucks, management, safety, cleanness of environment (watched multiple rats ontop of product) makes the Marion PepsiCo one of the more dangerous, as well as stupidest places to work around.."
bad,Accounts Payable position. A temporary position that I truly enjoyed
bad,The Southern market at Pepsi is at the very bottom in a competitive market against Coca Cola. Dangerous place to work.  Pay doesn't compete with other Fortune 500 companies. Benefits are the worst I ever seen.  Up North or anywhere out of The South.  Pepsi is a lot better overall.
bad,"Horrible human and constitutional right violations. Deplorable un healthy environments to work in. Not family friendly, not employee friendly, low wages, low milage, hardly any benefits. DO NOT TAKE THIS JOB!"
bad,"Incompetent workplace, Unrofessional. Did not match up to my criteria or qualifications."
bad,"i worked here it was in better terms hell ,the management wouldn't control the workers causing confusion and delay it was almost impossible to complete the tasks required"
bad,I learned how to work faster & generate calls faster while in a high call environment yet having a steady flow of work still being able to multi-task an have work done in a timely manner. My co-workers were easy to work with an very helpful if needed assistance in on a call. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to talk to the customers & speaking to all types of people & being able to meet people & interact with new people assisting them in there needs by giving them excellent customer service.
bad,Unprofessional people with filthy mouths.  I've never experienced something so unsettling in a work place.
bad,"I worked for this company for about 6 months. This job seemed ok at first. Then I realized that the more I worked the less I got paid. More hours equals less pay. The management was horrible. This job is not recommended for anyone that has a family. You will work 10 to 14 hours a day in the rain etc., and not even be able to pay everyday bills because you will not make enough money. This company knows that they have a very high turn over rate and don't seem to care.. Do Not Work Here. It's Horrible!"
bad,long hours company does not care about u or your family. Hardest work you will ever do for the least amount of money you will ever make. I am on food stamps and government assistance for first time in my life working for Pepsi. Management plays favorites caters to brown nosers. Horrible bosses supervisors and trainers. Do not work here. Pepsi sucks horrible. Salesmen do not do their jobs. Leaves everything for driver to do. If you wanna work 60 plus hours a week and bring home 300 dollars a week and be treated bad by everyone. This is the job for you. They do not give you a stick to fight with.
bad,"New people in charge all the time, takes a while for them to get the hang of their jobs, so its like starting over again all the time."
bad,bad management no time off never can reach management no leader no one takes any responsilitys
bad,A typical day at work consists of extreme office politics and favortism
bad,"Management plays favorites. Purposely sends you to known stores that is known to not have been serviced for days, and expects you to service and clean everything in a short amount of time, then blames you for not doing your job and being slow and uses you as an excuse for the store not being serviced. Uses you as a scape goat to cover their own faults and their pet employees. You guys get what i'm saying right? Don't deny it doesn't happen. Merchandisers that regularly services the stores get lazy, leave a mess for the part time back up merchandisers and blame the back ups and complains to the sales reps and managers, and the management blames the back up because the regular full time merchandiser is buddies with management or is their pet. So if you have friends in management, it could be a job for you. It'll be a kick back job if you do."
bad,Worst company I've ever worked for If you work here kiss your personal life goodbye
bad,"El ambiente es intrigoso, no estan organizados, las condiciones e instalciones de trabajo son deplorables, el sueldo minimo, los horarios extremos"
bad,"Long hours, very little employee input listened to,their way or the highway whether they are right or wrong,"
bad,Hours were to long take advantange of employee
bad,"Trabajar para grupo PEPSICO fue una de la peores experiencias de mi vida laboral, tiene el peor ambiente laboral, no conocen el concpeto de cultura organizacionall, tratan pésimo a los colaboradores, las oportunidades de mejora son minimas, las condiciones de trabajo son con mobiliario en terribles condiciones, y horarios exremos, no existe igual de condiciones entre empleados."
bad,"Not Productive employer, under paid, not very good career and no leadership."
bad,worst company I ever worked for. Supervisors work you like a dog for little money while they collect the nice bonuses. Cold hearted and ruthless!
bad,"A nice family owned company back in the 80's and now don't have a clue to run this company now,and the management on the sales side are unfare and all out for themselves and don't care who they hurt,just to be good looking for themselevs to their bosses for their bounes,don't care about the people who work for them or big thing safety.."
bad,"management talks out of both sides..Health insuarnce terrible ,overworked under pay."
bad,"Good Benifits ? My but they are terrible. If you need a dentist might aswell pay outa pocket. And the 80/20 health insurance is at most jobs. Good Benifits are the companies that pay 100. It's not a good jOb for anything but a work out. They overload your route. They make you cut corners on Purpose to get done faster and that angers the customer. Pay is horrible. They do not pay true overtime when u work over 40 which u will every week. They pay what's called vrot. Which is like 6 bucks an hour most of the time for overtime. For the amount of work you do it's a joke. Drive for the oil field make 15-20 an hour with no labor. Work for pepsi for what is the equivalent of 14 and work ur tail off. See where I'm going with this. Not to mention dot and safety violations you will have to make to get done. Last but not least 0 family life. No breaks, they say to take one but of u wana be home before 6pm you ain't taking one and none of the people I worked with did."
bad,Worked for this company for 18 years. If you don't have a college education you will be stuck on the truck forever. When I gave my 2 weeks notice the management would even talk to me. The management is terrible. They lost 24 seasoned vererans in 10 months and the company blames people for leaving on everything else instead of facing the problems with the company.
bad,"They worked us extremely hard, long hours. Understaffed for merchandisers. Scheduled deliveries of tractor trailer orders , 7-10 pallets of product and then expected you to be everywhere you were responsible for all at the same time."
bad,"Do you ever have a feeling "" I am here again""?  That was my feeling work for PepsiCo.  A lot of pressure from the manager and the lead in PepsiCo.  They always ask, how many equipments have you fix today? Why you are so slow?  How many parts you using today? You will seeing a lot people come and go constantly.  That's why they are hiring all the time."
bad,"Te obligan a trabajar todos los domingos, bajos sueldos, bajo el mercado, existe una mafia venezolana,"
bad,"Terrible management and a constant battle between union staff and non union management. Childish, unprofessional. By far the worst union/non union scenario I’ve ever had the unfortunate experience to work for"
bad,Need way better management and the department has zero organization and communication. Management very disrespectful. No one is on the same team at all!
bad,"Literally terrible, night shifts, managment only cared about kissing butt of higher ups. only cared about the company, no work culture. They didnt care about what days you needed off, only cared for work getting done."
bad,Pepsi is several years behind its competition. There is no sense of urgency to improve within the organization. The support is awful and upper management is disconnected.
bad,Horrible place to work manager Is very rude doesn’t see wat any one else is sayin but him he’s always right would not recommend this job to any one stay away
bad,"Sure all jobs have pros and cons but it didn’t take long for me to see all the cons in this place. From the get-go there are some things my manager never told me about in the interview:"
bad,"You're not treated like a creative human being, just an unappreciated cog. Terrible hours and calls at absurd hours. Deadlines are unreasonable and corporate is very unorganized."
bad,Just a warning not to go here. They won't care about you as a human being much less as a employee.......................................................
bad,"The management is dysfunctional creating hostile environment. They expect tons of overtime regardless of personal appointments or vacation plans. Do not work here unless you enjoy being stepped on, pushed around and smiled at when they 'put it to you'."
bad,I had a double bypass heart attack at work and my manager was walking by and I told him I thought I was having a heart attack he told me he had no time and told her to find my supervisor so I walked across the plant and set on a pilot for 25 minutes until my workers found my supervisor then I brought another worker and he told me I wasn't having one and I should just go home and rest well I went to the hospital and I ended up being flown to St Louis and I was in surgery within 20 minutes and had a double bypass heart surgery which took me 9 months to recover from when I went back they did not let me have my job back and tell me if they would never hire me again because once Pepsi gets rid of you for any reason they do not hire you back which they screwed me and now I'm behind on my taxes I'm broke all the time and I can't find work anywhere so that's what Pepsi's about them not you I hope that got their attention he told me he busy
bad,"Very very few good managers, great co workers, low pay for the amount of work you do. Not a lot of advancement and without the managers approval your stuck."
bad,I was a merchandiser which is entry level. You have to drive your own car which you do get paid for mileage but only one way. You get paid pennies on the dollar and break your back. You end up needing surgery from all the back breaking labor and they will simply tell you to leave once you get injured and cannot work anymore.
bad,Worked me like a Hebrew slave day in and day out. Couldn’t take a brake or even get a drink of water until Moses freed the Pepsi slaves. I hated it!!!
bad,Pepsi is a sink or swim environment.Racism is rampant.I experienced it firsthand and was retaliated against and terminated.I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.Everyone is running around trying to figure out what to do.I also figured there is not only a good ole boy group but also a good ole girl group.
bad,"Very toxic company to work for, riddled with discrimination,  favortism,  and reverse sexism. They would go above and beyond to rid of unwanted employees to the extent of forging documents and facts or commiting illegal act; athough those employees that they wanna get rid of would be high performaners.  PepsiCo is a den of thieves and vipers that have no honor nor credibility. A band of backstabbing weasels that don't have ethics or morals. Currently,  The company is struggling with the changes happening in the market place. They reduced the percentage of commission,  fired hundreds of managers, and keep cutting pay and increasing work load. PepsiCo redefined slavery to fit our modern day. When you sign your contract, it's like selling your soul to the Devil..."
bad,"Hard work ain't the word to describe the bull I put up with working here.First of all the trucks old as dirt. They have unrealistic demands. You're gonna be working from 3 am to 7pm at night driving around Richmond metropolitan in a tractor trailer. Any bumps you run over, potholes,etc.are gonna make the pallets of sodas in the trailer fall over. Then you have a bigger problem, you have to unload every pallet in the truck manually using an electric jack then take the skids of soda into the store if you can manage not knocking the sodas off the skid while dragging it across the parking lot."
bad,"managers only care about themselves. treat employees poorly, no home life, hours are not the greatest, if you speak up they will try and get rid of you"
bad,"Toxic working environment and the management had a terrible chip on their shoulders 24/7. The job title. ""Assembler"" was a horrible job due to stress and lack of climate control in the building"
bad,Slave labor and talked down to. Never appreciated for your hard work and constantly being professionally cussed out. They will not reward you but gladly glorify themselves.
bad,"7 years with the company is all I was able to tolerate, management sucks and not qualified to do the job , this company works on who you know and not what you know and not to mention hours you are working 12 + hours per day and I mean work and they don’t care, turnovers are crazy"
bad,They brag about diversity and equality. But they are very prejudicial and discriminating. On more then sexuality and advancement. Lack of saftey concerns due to regional mgrs making a bonus.
bad,"Management got nasty and started making life difficult for me when they found out I was pregnant. Forced me to leave in a legal manner, by switching me to hours they knew I couldn't work therefore forcing me to quit. "
bad,"The management was lazy and just plain useless.  Several times it was brought to their attention that a RSR was stilling form others and the company, but since he worked weekends when people missed, the stealing was overlooked, so the managers didn't have to work on the weekend."
bad,"Horrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There is a reason why they have a huge turn over rate. Absolutely disgraceful company to work work for. The union only looks out for the senior guys. Look for antoher place of employment,"
bad,They over work you. 60-70 hours a week and expect you to keep the pace of a fresh and healthy human. They want you to throw 150 cases an hours for 14-16 hours a day six days a week and only give you a 30 min lunch. If you fall behind they tell everyone you work with to embarass you. How do you keep this pace everyday for that many hours? Its insane.
bad,It had a terrible work life balance with a dog-eat-dog environment and a very high turn over rate. most of management is gone within 6-8 months. I would never return.
bad,PepsiCo sold the company to Pepsi Bottling Ventures and most of the employees at the Terminal Street loc. lost their jobs. Hours were to long working on the dock. I think that we should of had a better facility to work in and we should of had 3 shifts to help out with the long hours each day.
bad,Place is a dive  to work in with no rewards and very poor managers your overworked in a smelly hot dusty and smoky environment.  Long shifts and lack of morale on shop floor. Please go and look elsewhere for work. Use this as last resort.
bad,"They promise you this pay until you find out you have to work there for 8 months before you get the full pay ."
bad,"Poor management, broken promises. Long hours.  Unethical.  Poor management.  Unsafe work practices. Warehouse to small.  Poor management, see the trend. Revolving door for employees.  There was eight employees that came and went in the 80 days I stayed there.  Whatever you do, look elsewhere for employment."
bad,Management is absolutely horrible in the buffalo NY location. They don't care about anything other then the product. Your life means nothing to them. The general manager has more ego them brains. Has to learn to control his operation more. The main delivery manager was a childish loser. They all suck.
bad,"Most days you will have up to 40 stops depending on your route and you have to use your own vehicle as a Sales Rep. The reimbursement for gas was so low that it was ridiculous and sometimes you wouldn't get it because they said they ""forgot"". Plus you have to deal with rude customers at each stop and then put up with the managers bullcrap. As a Sales rep, you're doing two or three other people's jobs. Very high turnover rate, pay and benefits aren't that good either. Management sucks, the coworkers were all miserable and the company is horrible. Doesn't seem like a real company to me. No room for advancement at all. I advise you to never work here. EVER."
bad,"Pepsico doesnt care about there work force anymore."
bad,"falta de organizacion y valoracion al trabajador, falta de compromiso he informacion y capacitacion al trabajador."
bad,Worked there for 4 months and only had 4 days off.  They make it sound like you will have 2 days off per week.  Only apply if it is for Full time NOT Seasonal !!! You will work 60-75 hours/week.
bad,Would not recommend this job unless you are single and have no friends or family or personal life! Management is out of touch with the needs of the sales team it's all about the needs of the company!
bad,"Difficult place to work. Very sad because it could easily be much better. The good equipment is good, the bad equipment is terrible. So many changes you never know what end is up. Most positions allow for what they call ""recon"" which means they can take money right out of your paycheck."
bad,if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all. i have nothing to say! Staff has little to no help from management. lack of funds for such a large coeporation.
bad,"Terrible place to work, managers don't manage right. No incentive to stay at a terrible place. It is not a fun place to work. Training is horrible & nobody cares."
bad,"Lured in with this great amount of your yearly salary and once training is done amount paid per day is nothing you have to get cases for commission.  You have to literally overwork yourself to the bone, fast, stressed to make a decent paycheck and work 6 days a week 12 hour days.  What kind of life is that."
bad,"Employee safety is overlooked no one cares, they will work you till you die you are a number to them roaches of the night easily replaced there's no structure."
bad,One of the worst job experiences i'm sure I'll ever go through. I was constantly neglected and overworked. management is the worst I've ever seen at a company of that size. The entire work force was miserable and over-worked and management was rude and inconsiderate.
bad,"cons: terrible place, terrible people, management talks constant trash about each other and their employees. "
bad,Pepsi was a high stress cutthroat atmosphere where you are required to work heavy loads and long hours everyday.  The management is poorly suited for their roles and if you give any feedback you are treated like an enemy.
bad,Worst place to work for bad management. The hire supervisors out of company. At pepsi u never have a set position. They move to days then nights whenever they choose.
bad,"Not open to new outlook "
bad,"You will be required to work twelve hour shifts, they will change your route without telling you before hand, you won't have time for anyone or anything outside of work, and if you have a problem - say you're being harassed by another employee don't both relating it to the managers or HR.  It gets swept under the rug, even when you have the text messages and emails to prove it."
bad,"managers were disrespectful to employees, would expect employees to work 10 hour days without letting anyone know"
bad,Way to much work for the pay.....work four ten hour days they say but those days Start at 4:00 am and finish up around 6:00 pm doing between 12 to 16 stops a day. Stay away from Geo Box !!
bad,"temporary worked in Ayer facility.  Doing clean up  for new manufacturing plant. I was only there a period of 1 month. I wish I could have stayed longer. I was under the impression, I was going to be working there.. Once they opened the plant .. Guess not"
bad,You have to be a yea man or kiss a**in order to be promoted if you're not apart of the college hire program. Management doesn't care about anyone thats not apart of management.  They dont promote employee development.
bad,Schedule was not very family oriented. Management didn't care about their employees at all and would always ask them to do stuff for them and it goes unappreciated.
bad,"Work you to death, understaffed, so management gets big bonuses..no job security. Treat you like dirt.go somewhere else.  Don't waste your time.high turnover because when they get all they can out of you they move to next person."
bad,Poor management and very low morale here.  A lot is expected for low pay and people advance with no knowledge of the job the people they are managing are performing.  No-one here is happy.
bad,drive to numerous clients delivering products but you have to unload  by hand and load it up at the clients place by hand merchandize everything making sure cuts was satisfied
bad,After new supervisor took over. He has a policy of doing wright ups without verifying to get the truth and when proved wrong it doesn't matter. You get criticism by people who can't even do the job themselves. Customers are great but the office BS is really hard to handle. The insurance they have cost a pretty penny but doesn't cover much. If you need regular lab work you pay for it yourself. You will need to get use to working alone with no support or at least very little help. And pay raises are very slow in coming. Over all not that great of a place to work for.
bad,There no career path at the company. Management doesn't even have a clue what is going on. Management is extremely incompetent and extremely unprofessional. No home life can never make plans.
bad,"I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone!! Stay away...Management doesn't have a clue! They stay in there cozy little offices while the pickers are braving all sorts of weather elements, safety issues, lack of leadership, as well as being understaffed the whole time I was there(5 yrs)...The loaders were ALWAYS there 16+ hours whether it was peak season or not!! HR was a non factor, they NEVER!! Showed any type of support for the employees...the Pepsico logo is very misleading to a person that wants to work for a fortune 500 Co. They are ran like a mom and pop organization literally!! Its kinda sad how my warehouse was being managed. We went thru several PAMs, and plant managers since I've been there...I wouldn't be surprised at all to see this company go under or at least closing up several plants/warehouses around the country!! This place is a horrible place to work!!! Please I'm not just a disgruntled employee, do your research and I guarantee you'll have second thoughts!! Great benefits are the only pros at this company!!!"
bad,"Ребята не ведитесь на то что это компания мирового уровня. Пепси уже как 1.5-2 года гниет изнутри. Отдел продаж держат за овец. Смежные отделы чуть что тычут в нос своими инструкциями. Кто хочет побыть рабом за 28 тыр в месяц то пожалуйста. Нормальные ребята уже либо уволились либо написали заявление. Остальные либо новички гонющиеся за американской мечтой, либо просто от безвыходности сидят..кредиты, ипотека, дети. Да когдато это была компания работая в которой я ходил с гордо поднятой головый, но сейчас по факту только слезы. Ушел и даже не жалею."
bad,Communication is dismal from top to bottom. Management doesn't hold the proper people accountable. Upper management lacks professionalism when discussing constructive criticism. People at the bottom of the hierarchy are treated very poorly and aren't shown enough support from management. Frustrating work environment and the lack of compensation makes it all the more unsatisfying.
bad,"Typical day at work is fine, you are given a few stores usually around 6-8 a day, which is fine if you work fast most stores are cvs or riteaids and so on, and you get one big store. "
bad,"may not be this bad but this location is."
bad,te meten faltas aun que nunca faltes y para que telas repongan tienes que rogarles no te pagan tiempo extra aun cuando ellos telo exigen. la capacitación es fuera de la jornada de trabajo
bad,"All the employees are angry working for incompetent company and management.  There is a lot of back stabbing and negativity starting with the Senior Management.  They promote individuals based on favoritism, not on qualifications.  They work people excessive hours when there is no need too.  I have learned the the best policy is being consistent and fair with everyone no matter what the basis is."
bad,mi evaluacion como podemos ver lhe caracterizado  yt calificado muy bien ala empresa en la que estuve la borando porque mesenti muy satisfecha contodo
bad,"Dont work here as a merchandiser you will regret it. I can go on and on about the cons! Worst job I ever had by far, the pay and the reinbursement for your gas mileage did not add up to the amount of work and driving you had to do."
bad,"All the stories about this company are true.  They lie to no end, send you to random out of the way places and claim you never turned in a gas expense report, daily timesheets mysteriously vanish and pay gets deducted for recon, with no explanation as to why.  You always have the burden of proof on you to defend yourself and seek the pay that was stolen from you."
bad,"Environement compliqué et instable."
bad,"regular, mais ou menos não é boa no meu cargo (terceirizado) pela Proficenter."
bad,a typical day is a terrible truck and messed up route and a management team that doesn't what happens or how the customers treat you the job still needs to get done
bad,"here at the pepsi in savannah management is irrelevant to whats happening, to people taking 4 hour lunches and people just leaving with out saying a word, the best way to advance in this company is either 1 buy your boss lunch for a few months or 2 tell them your going to quit as far as a work life balance there is none me being married and a father to a 5 month old son its hard to find the correct balance when working 14+ hours monday- friday and sometimes sunday due to lack of man power the unwillingness from help from managemnt and the lazy co workers"
bad,"Pepsi out of Marion IL is privately owned. Its not the same as the other companies reviewed on this site. Do your homework before taking a job at this company. Over promise /under deliver on pay, benefits, culture, and work/family balance.  Very unethical intimidating environment. . High turnover says it all."
bad,Prior history with customers create hostile and untrustworthy enviroment
bad,Very long days. Little to no training and absolutley no on going training. The management are lazy and demanding. Constant threats from management about losing job. Management talk about employees to employees. Promotions based on favoritism and not on merit.
bad,They don’t care abt your home life. All they care abt is orders getting delivered even if you have to spend 16 hrs a day doing it. Your just a body to management and there’s rare advancement. I would not recommend working here. If you value your life and family!!
bad,La mauvaise expérience de me vie aucun intérêt pour les employés
bad,"You can advance quickly here if your a minority and/or female and willing to take a promotion for pennies. The Micro managing is out of control, management above you have been through a campus hire program, spent minimal time in each position and do not understand the business at all. 99% of employees hate their jobs now. The only employees held accountable are frontline, mostly by inaccurate reports."
bad,Dead end job and no opportunity to grow. They will bring people with no experience to take higher level jobs. The work life balance is non existant. You will constantly kill yourself without any possibility of growth
bad,The management is a joke- they have no idea what they are doing and treat people like dirt.  They not only take their employees for granted they also devalue them.
bad,"Un-organized and slow paced environment,poor management, lot of politics and no work-life balance for the employees.Bad work culture and no interest in employee future"
bad,"I would not recommend this employer. I do not have anything nice to say here. Long, unpaid work hours. Hypocritical. Policies do not apply to management."
bad,"Not appreciated at all, low pay. Company cares about money and careless for the money makers. Equipment needs a preventative maintenance  along with regular maintenance"
bad,Everything is fine if you work like a slave. Management smiles in your face telling you that you are a great worker then they plot to get rid of you if you work to well! Management is young and right out of college have no clue to what hard work is! They feel threatened if you are too good a worker! Very unprofessional at the Columbia Md plant! The main plant manager dresses very unprofessional!
bad,"I m 35 been working sins I was 9 years old, got experience in sorts of jobs, from warehouse staff n every department to accounting and business management with great references. And got 1st class degree in international business management. I have never experience such hostile environment really."
bad,Not a good place to work. They lure you in with the pay but it’s not worth being there 15 hours a day. Turnover rate is extremely high. Can’t schedule off days have to take the days that are given which is Saturday and whatever day is given during the week. Treat 2nd shift like trash and praise 1st shift. Wouldn’t recommend this job to anyone over 25
bad,Was let go after presenting a doctors note for bronchitis. After I was told that it was ok because I had personal days and vacation to cover my sick time
bad,"The pay rate will lure you in but the warehouse job is a joke. You are expected to work at a pace that is only attainable by running from your lift to the pallet of stock and back, and you do this for 12 hours or more in a hot warehouse during the summer. The pallet jacks were constantly needing repair and switching to a backup meant you weren’t going to make rate. They set you up to fail. Stay away from the warehouse loader job. Trust me."
bad,"I Wouldn’t recommend this company for nothing in the world. Most ,if not all employees ARNT happy here due to the outdated contract. "
bad,"You get 10-19 stores with 300-550 cases and sometimes it can’t even be done in 14 hours because driver are supposed to fill shelves , build displays, and rotate products... don’t work 6 cases out of a 42 cases delivery, you might have sell rep taking pictures and send to a supervisor saying that You are not doing your job and get you a write up. Oh, and it’s salary so, they don’t care if you do 14h and don’t like when you do 9hlol."
bad,"Terrible management, unethical, uneducated, the worst ever."
bad,Yönetim berbat hep bana hep bana politikası uyguluyorlar. Sürekli işçiyi ezme derdindeler. 5 Senelik hakkımı bir çırpıda sildiler suçum olmadığı halde.
bad,"Poor management. Favoritism and who you know are major components. The more you screw up, the more you get praised. Management are the ones who couldnt make it or couldn't handle actually working. They give no chits about you and will do anything in their power to get you wrote up for ""numbers"". Steer clear"
bad,"Overall, I gained a lot of great experience at Pepsi. The company is definitely stuck in the dark ages as far as company culture, work-life balance, and management styles, but it's a good place to get a few years of experience."
bad,"Sales rep send in product that the stores don’t need, no support from upper management. Pepsi has their hands in so many things. No one ever knows what’s going on"
bad,"A revolving door of managers who have little experience actually managing people and or knowledge of business. "
bad,"As a Geo-Box Tractor Trailer Driver in Orlando, Florida I was confronted on a daily basis with many difficulties even before leaving the terminal to service the customers.  Broken down equipment, delays in finding equipment because other drivers were scavenging your equipment from your assigned trailer if theirs was broken or missing. The warehouse system is a nightmare with constant delays in getting routes out on time. The logistics side of management chaotic and very inefficient.  I don't recommend any professional Tractor Trailer Operator to drive for Pepsi."
bad,"Big company doesn't care about the lower (peasants) of the company. No communication between supervisor/managers and workers at all. One mess up and ur gone, no warnings. Working with Merchants is a pain especially since they all have managers who feel they can torture you or they can get you fired just by writing you up for things that you didn't even do."
bad,Managenment really don't look out for employees they just want their product deliver don't care how just do it. They said you have 2 weeks vacation after your first 90 days that don't roll over to the following year abd every time one want to take vacation they either tell you people that work with the company fist and when you do they be like we be very busy that time so you really lose it
bad,Too shorthanded. Sink or swim mentality. Too much of a burden put on individuals based on the task combining tractor trailer and merchandising. Severe physical demands. Drivers should work in pairs but that's disregarded.
bad,"Start YOUR day someone is late every day, sometimes same guy 2-3 days nothing is said, you work hard while every one else is either on there phone or actively hiding to avoid work. If your a time thief or like to take false comp claims than Pepsi is for you. They do not value hard or dedication. Worse management and lazy environment"
bad,"the management on my shift are unappreciative, unapproachable and treat people like sh#t. Working in unbearable heat at times can’t see with the sweat in your eyes. No investment in air conditioning just fans full of grease and fat blowing roasting hot air at you. If you happen to be off sick for any reason your pressured to get back to work. Work with some great people but a lot of back stabbing. Do yourself a favour and look else where."
bad,Manager is too busy to help you and There is No one on the team that wants to help you. The team members act like your bothering them and act like they don’t want you there not work there not friendly staff to work with.
bad,"Training is great. U start at around 4 am, and off around noon.  When u get to be by yourself, dont expect to be off before 4pm.  Your expected to stock all the product that you take into convenience stores, and aren't paid to do so.  You dont gry paid for stand by time, but are expected to stand by if someone else is unloading at the time, which could be more than an hour.  Just dont do it."
bad,Management is trash.  Hard workers get paid the same as people sitting on their phone. Play favorites. Terrible place to work. If you want to work your butt off for little pay. Come work at Pepsi!
bad,Very very poorly managed  warehouse manager has no experience what so ever I had to train him to do his position as an hourly employee does not listen to employee needs
bad,Some of the best parts about Pepsi is the other drivers the union sucks they don’t stick up for there drivers management doesn’t care about the drivers unless your in the group they have favoritism big time
bad,Management was the only down fall of the location I was at. Long stressful hard working hours just for your Bosses to find anything little wrong to act like they were doing their job. Best thing that could ever happen was leaving the company
bad,"Never experienced working at a place where it hurts you to be ambitious. The inequality, racial inequality is the most evident I've seen at any place I've ever worked. Pepsi Latham hires their supervisors mainly fresh out of college, so as an employee you teach them to tell you what to do later. Even at the most important positions to work, you still may never have knowledgeable help to turn to when needed"
bad,"This place has a super high turn over rate.  Ask anyone you know that works there(Frito Lay of York, Pennsylvania), they typically pay the top hourly available in the area and that is the only reason people will work there and have been trapped to work there.  The cost is that you have no free time and you end up working 6-7 days a week and you have no control over it.  Most hires aren't even told their schedules until after their training is complete.  Congratulations new hire, your schedule is 3rd shift 11p.m.-7a.m. Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday and your off days are Tuesday and Wednesday(which you will have to work those too because they are so understaffed its not even funny).  WOW WHAT A GREAT OPPORTUNITY.  Their forced overtime means they can force you in early 4 hours @ 7p.m. or over 4 hours until 11a.m. as well as 12 hours on your off day(s).  "
bad,"Its an alright job but if you like being discriminated then go ahead.  The company advertises that you get full time hours but in reality you do not.  They expect you to be by your phone all the time and when they call you they do not like it if you turn them down.  The only way for this company to get better is to get rid of the every single person in management and get real ones in. "
bad,"Choose to work here if you dont enjoy spending time with family, dont have goals outside of Pepsi, or unless you enjoy working 6-7 days a week without appreciation, its expected while the bosses either ""work from home"" or offer you help that never shows up"
bad,"Unorganized....... everything is a lie. You will not work the shift you are hired for because it doesn't not exist. Only the selectors are made to work, while the rest of the warehouse support team sits on there phone in front of fans in a hot warehouse. If you ask a lift operator to let down a pallet he is doing you a favor. If you have any experience this is not the place for you. The pay rate is good but you will not be allowed to leave at the time you are supposed to and if you do u will receive a point. 1.5 points you are fired. It's like some one took the building and shook it up everything is unorganized. The equipment is even outdated and slow yet you are expected to maintain a certain level of work per hour. The manager who has never done this type of work doesn't understand that after 15 hours its unsafe to operate the equipment in a warehouse full of other people who have been working 15 hours. The position is called loader......you will not be a loader you will be a selector. All in all Houston warehouse sucks!!"
bad,Pepsico would be a better place to work if their mangement lead supervisor wetent unfair to the pm workers and didnt allow favortism bulling co workers and didnt put them down at any job everyone should be treated equal no matter what age or race you are mangement is ran by geto tattooed people who are not presffesdial thats wny everyone quits from the temp agencys its too
bad,"Not flexible, very low pay increase if any, no appreciation for hard work, micromanage their employees, the management creates more issues then address them"
bad,"Poor uneducated spineless mangement. They didn't care as long as there were bodies there to move the product. "
bad,"At the beginning I thought it was a decent company to work for, but after two months in I was in for a big surprise. Geo driver supervisors have no integrity, stab you in the back and purposely make your life complicated when they hear someone tell them you will not treat me in a demeaning manner."
bad,Horrible place to work. Management turns employees against each other. They make up attendance contest and don’t go through with the prize promises. They offer lieu days and don’t pay them out.  They got off on writing their employee up and the Union is no help.
bad,"This job might of been the worst job of my adult life,  I admit I’m wasn’t mentally ready for what I was getting into at the time. But the traffic is what makes this job impossible. Its a two man job to begin with. "
bad,it is a very stressful job and supervisors do not care about employees all they care about is getting their product out. I would not recommend this job
bad,"Got bullied and then they just told me to stop it because they couldn't see it on camera. Use or lose vacation days but you can only use them if someone else agrees to do your job, even if is one day, but they never will do my job. If your lucky, you get a quarter raise a year and have to be in your current role at least 18 months before you can even apply for another one as long as your manager is ok with..lol they NEVER are."
bad,"Never had a fixed work schedule. Made to stay after shift, with no notice. Job just sucked. Was not bad at the start like any job need to get feet wet. Than it gets the down hill run going. The place is a revolving door in all blue collar work positions."
bad,"They kept changing my hours. They told me one set of hours before I was hired, and when I got hired, they changed them. I work a second job also.  When I interviewed they said it wouldn't be a problem.  Now all of the sudden, it is. I got in trouble for doing what the management wanted me to do, just to have them say they wanted me to do what I just got in trouble for. The management was never happy with anything I did."
bad,They do not value good workers. Poor management. Long shift and very high expectations for what they pay. Too much effort to receive nothing in return.
bad,Very demanding job .... very little respect ... top management is very narcissistic and lie promising full time when they have no intentions of it. Management make big promises just to keep people until they are no longer needed and let them go without notice. Great employment for casual or student workers.
bad,They only care about their product. Could care less about your home life. They did not mind working you for 16 hours a day. Does not care about your family. If it ain’t Pepsi it ain’t s**t.
bad,Summer is killer at pepsi. long hours w/no AC or fans. no heater in summer. some days we didnt get off till 5am. we went in at 330 pm mon-thurs and 230 pm on fridays. If you try to move up you'll be written up for something and it will keep you from doing so. this happened to at least half our crew. in the off season they fire half the staff because work slows down so much. you might get 30 hours in the off season. some days the work load us 5000 others its 15000. either way you have to pull 170 cases per hour. we never stayed properly staffed.
bad,"for such a big company you would think they had quality workers but that is the exact opposite. The warehouse is like a jail, the people in there are absolutely insane and management allows it and goes along with it. Cussing, screaming, fighting. No control over anything which makes it impossible to do your job. Plus if you try to ignore it and just do your job you are harassed by other workers. it is literally the worst place i have ever worked, and i have had some pretty bad jobs. The actual work isnt bad but the environment is unbearable."
bad,Pepsi Mid America was a stable company to work for but they do not value their employees.  I would not recommend working with them.  They need to improve thier employee relations.
bad,There is only one thing that keeps me there at present and that's money. Physically demanding and just down right terrible. They should be ashamed of themselves.
bad,Harsh and unrealistic expectations. Only get lunch break.Health insurance way too expensive for a group plan. Change rules without telling anyone. Cheat workmen's comp claims.
bad,"Heavy and demanding work load."
bad,"Start at 5am I have a route of 6 stores which a work 5 times a week, I stock shelves with the proper merchandise and work until the job is done. the hardest part of the job is the company is not organized most of the times it feels like we are out there by ourselves with no support at all."
bad,"I had a terrible experience with them they tried to push me to run past my hours, I refused. I would have to work impossible routes without and lose money while doing it. I would never go back or recommend to anyone to go there"
bad,"management always on your back, two faced employees talking about everyone and always crying about something, bad moral, typical day working for pepsi"
bad,Very poor morale and poor leadership.  No training and support from anyone.  You are on an island on your own.  Bullying type of Management from the people in charge.  Extremely understaffed especially during the busiest times of the year.  Run!!!
bad,I did not enjoy working at this office. The office demeaned and makes women and minorities feel miniscule. I would never work there again and would not recommend it. I couldn't agree more with this statement
bad,"Management is horrible, they work against each other. Managers do not respect supervisors or hourly employees. Horrible hours, be ready to work 12 or more hours if you are a supervisor or hourly employee. Be prepared to be disrespected and stressed out everyday. I would not recommend this company to anyone if considering working in the manufacturing and warehouse departments."
bad,Daily felt as if company was trying to undermine and replace every person.  Constantly trying to rotate individuals within the company.  Felt bullied by management whom may have had ulterior motives for decisions made about employees.
bad,"Was placed with trainer, he was great it's just the management is not good at all. I was hurt pushing one of their carts off the truck an was sent to the doctor as soon as I got back from the doctor they fired me."
bad,"Absolutely a joke place. No morale. If your ill, and phone and sick, you’re in a big trouble as they don’t honour or believe doctors sick notes. Stay away this place"
bad,One of the biggest companies in the Philippines that do not take care of their employees. They do not provide other benefits to their employees and they only care for the people in sales.
bad,"it was ok because I didn't have anything else. besides that, I would forget they exist.you work early and you work at own pace. sun, rain, or snow, you have to work outside. big thumbs down. managers act like its the end of the world when you need a day off."
bad,Pepsi used to be a fun place to work. I worked day shift and they switched us all to one shift. I now work 4pm.-4am.....except that I usually do not get off work until 7-7:30. Our bosses are only bosses because they have been here since the beginning of time. They are horrible at managing. They let 3 to 4 people off at a time and always leave us short handed. Its non stop on us about getting out numbers and reaching out goals. When I first started working 8 hours is was actually fun. It's scary how sleepy and tired you get after 12 -14 hours. I never feel safe in here anymore. You can only drink water when the warehouse is 95 degrees. Cant even have Gatorade one of our products. I have tried to move up for years and I cannot.
bad,I use to love to come to work.  Now it is a complete shot show.  To much micro management and concerns that do not help the company succeed only for political reasons..  Business moves are done only to look good on paper and not properly thought out to help grow the company.  Such as a display of warm 20z single serve maxed out in a dollar general .  Meanwhile we have a 5 for $10 6 pack sale with no room to sale.  This is just a minor flaw of business..
bad,"Pepsi is run by people that seem like they have no clue what they're doing, always running into late hours because they keep workers that don't have work ethic to get their job done. The managers (personally) were pretty sneaky and devious when I out threw every other employee in cases month by month they put the extra work on me because I was quicker, instead of dividing it up between everyone when I never received a pay raise either. 0/10 don't work here."
bad,"Job was horrible. Lied about advancements, horrible pay, no hope for a future. Stay away at all possible. You work 70+ plus hours and you are still considered part-time. Garbage union that protects lazy workers and the good old boy system is in full effect."
bad,Would not recommend this job to nobody. This job will make you want to continue your education. If you do decide to work here good luck. The turnover here gets worse every year.
bad,"After many years at Pepsi, you ultimately realize they don't care about treating supervisors well or fair. Management is ego driven and not collaborative. Front line employee satisfaction in surveys is all they care about. and stockholders. The worst of the worst."
bad,not a place for a leak individual.  both physically and mentally.  Cut throat upper management with threats of termination if certain goals were not met.
bad,Eğer hayatınız tamamen işten oluşsun her sabah işle yatıp işle uyanayım üstlerim birbirine bana saygısız davrasın herkes birbirini ezmekten zevk alsın diyorsanız sizin için ideal iş ortamı. Her iş ortamında tabii ki rekabet olur ama şirkete girdiğiniz gibi herkesin suratındaki o mutsuzluktan ilk girdiğimde kaçmam gerektiğini tahmin etmeliydim. Müdürüm deadline bu akşam dedi diye ameliyatlarına gitmeyenler mi toplantıdan ağlayarak çıkıp rimelim akmış mı diye sorup hiçbişey yokmuş diye devam edenleri mi söyliyim bilmiyorum. En iyi okullardan mezun olup burada hor görülmeye ezilmeye ve her gün psikolojik olarak çökük yaşamaya ve içinizde hep geç kalma hissiyle yaşamaya istekliyseniz tam sizlik bir iş. Gece 2ye kadar mesaide oturmayı anlatmıyorum bile.
bad,The management and supervision is terrible and very disorganized with the worst lack of communication I have ever seen. Expect to always be working.  Unable to make plans.  No work/life balance at all.  They take your life.
bad,"Loved being lead merchandiser then pre sales rep plant manager was a control freak in the 2 years he's been there 17 people have quit,lost my position of sales rep cause of senority,they wanted me to go back to my old job which was a $24,000 a year pay cut so I moved on to different company."
bad,"Harassment daily from managers hostile work environment from supervisors ,mold and mildew and roaches everywhere.Supervisors require operators that do their job well to do over half of the ones that cant."
bad,Pepsico is too big for it's own good.  The matrixed organization is more like a ball of yarn thats been vacuumed up.  Fancy titles with no accountabilities and low titles holding the whole place up.
bad,"Very long hours. Poor accountability of employees. Management is very poorly trained in relating to employees. Employees very rarely rewarded for a job well done. Lack basics of structure. If you want to be treated poorly but paid decent, this is the place for you."
bad,"The benefits for the company are ok, but the pay is good and you will work hard to get the amount of money you may need to survive. Management is horrible and does not care about the employees and the home / work life."
bad,"A good place to learn and earn competitive pay. Also, a good place to display a multitude of skills. Typical work days are 8-14 hours and overtime is usually available."
bad,Very low pay for the task you are asked to do. Management doesn't train very well. Most supervisors do not communicate very well with employees with what they want from them.
bad,"I have worked at Pepsi for 10 years in Vegas Absolutely a waste of time. They work you to death. The management is horrible. Management throws you under the bus every time they get a chance. The pay is lacking, you have no home life and have to work weekends. No communication between HR and the employees. You are just a number here. DON'T DO IT!!!"
bad,"no ay comunicación por parte de los encargados a sus subordinados."
bad,The managers will set you up for failure and provide you with false hope on moving to other positions. They care nothing about the employees. Very difficult to move up to other positions even if you qualify for it.
bad,Management is a joke!!!!!!! Slave drivers. And unless youre comfortable with getting your nose brown dont look to advance your position. Extremely biased and unsafe work environment
bad,no matter how long you have been there they always hire out before promoting within.Do not get hurt they will throw you away. after 3 solid years no accidents equipments falls on me and i get the boot.
bad,If you you read all these reviews of all the bad then they are telling you the truth. Long hours hard work for the pay no appreciation for giving 100 percent. No respect no trust. They have there favorites and there butt kissers. Look else where.
bad,Your schedule is the worst. Never know if it's going to be an 10hr shift or 14hr shift. No one can go home until work is completely done. MANAGERS ARE ALL HORRIBLE. YOU WONT LIKE THIS PLACE. Don't waste your time. Iam currently employed here.WE DONT EVEN GET UNIFORMS OR ANYTHING ANYMORE. BUSINESS HAS GONE CHEAP!!!
bad,"Top down, poorly managed company.  High turn-over rate.  Physically  draining and injury prone profession.  UNDERPAID.  Negative work environment.  Constant battle between employees and management in all departments.  No career path.  There are many job opportunities for a CDL driver, do NOT choose Dayton Pepsi as one of them."
bad,"If you are a casual i recommend not work there."
bad,"The epitome of a dysfunctional group.  There is absolutely no sense of team; as a matter of fact, they purposefully create a culture of silos and disregard for the human element.  One nameless cretin serves in a management (very difficult to state this) capacity in the warehouse, with an unparalleled desire to create conflict amongst the group.  Given that he has no issue with serving countless hours on site, he remains employed.  Bigotry, inept business acumen steer this facility in a pointless direction.  Very unfortunate as I'm certain this is not the core values of the PepsiCo organization.  Take note and right the low hanging wrongs."
bad,the management doesn't care about there works at all or about there family life . no one wants to stay there just because of the way they are treated .
bad,"Upper management is terrible, they have no idea how to run a manufacturing business, the employees argue with each other everyday and complain to management about any and everything. No work/life balance. Thought it was a great place to work but boy was I wrong."
bad,Sorry do not work here.  Management sucks they don't promote from within. Make changes on how the feel.  Not on how the employee feels about it.
bad,"With Pepsi they play favorites. if you are not in the in group your time there will be short. At first I thought that i finally had a place where I would matter, where i could stay and possabley retire from this company. I was proud to wear the uniform. but then about the time the economy took a dive the attitude at Pepsi changed and it was no longer about doing the right thing it was about surviving and making the upermanagment happy.  I was with pepsi for 8 years not one bad review and two weeks after I get a new manager I was gone. not a warning or a meeting to move in a new direction just fired. after everything I did for pepsi. my area was a area that span 1200 miles and it was in northern nevada. lot of snow in the winter and gold mines. there was one manager in Elko NV that just had to complain and you were in trouble. even if the thing you did was what the rules tell you to do. So even if you are a yes man and work your but off and do everything right. if you do not do what the bigger boss tells you to do. you will still get fired. there is no being nice or the rules will protect you. even if you do what your manager tells you to do, you will get in trouble by that same manager for not following the rules. so enter at your own risk."
bad,If you enjoy time with your family and just have a life period stay away long hours anywhere from 60 to 80 hour's a week. No room for advancement unless you are one of the boy's and the only thing that matters is location manager's bonus. The management team is lack luster a group of  trained monkey's could do a better job. Very under paid for the work you do and the physical toll on your body is not worth it. The macon GA location is a black hole stay away!!!!!!
bad,There is nothing professional about working here. Everyone is childish and out to get everyone. Management does not support their employees in anything they do. They personally attack their employees and treat them like garbage. I would never work here again!
bad,"People will dis you every time they see you."
bad,"This is by far the worst place I've ever worked.  The pay scale is low and the raises are very minimal in dollar amount and frequency.  Most of management does not care about the employees.  Turnover rate is extremely high.  People are constantly getting fed up with getting more and more work piled on them and not getting compensated for it and just walking out.  A lot of them recognize this is happening during their training period and don't even make it through that time period.  Other good people get fired without being given a just reason.  Parking is terrible.  The parking lot is a long way from the buildings which makes it bad in the rain, sleet, snow, and extreme heat.  There is a lot next door for sale which could be bought and used for parking but since the owner could care less about his employees that hasn't been done.  He sits comfortably in one of his many mansions and parks in the parking lot right in front of the building when he's there."
bad,"Not a typical work place for someone with a family or other responsibilities. The pay was great but not working 16-18 hours everyday with a 30 minute lunch and (2) 15 minute breaks. The work environment is very fast paced and nonstop from start to finish. There is no cut off time for when you get off so basically day to day is different. Regardless of being sick or the weather you are expected to work like a robot. And this is based on a 5-6 day work schedule and if you leave early or do not come to work it is considered job abandonment. Bad management childish co workers and if your not in the (group) or kiss up to management you will not last long here."
bad,"When Pepsi bought out the vending company I was working for they offered me a position within their company, promising more money and less hours, I took the position they offered only to find out they LIED.  I went from working 8 to 10 hours a day 5 days a week with the previous vending company to working 11 to 14 hours a day 5 days a week with Pepsi.  The company I was with before Pepsi took care of their customers, filling every row of the vending machines until full, Pepsi routinely made me leave rows with only 2 to 4 items in them.  This ultimitely destroys a persons commission.  I learned that Pepsi management really doesn't care about the working man with a family and my co-workers were some of the laziest people I've worked with.  I strive to serve people in the jobs I do and in my home life, it was a horrible experience to work for a company that just DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS OR EMPLOYEES.  The hardest part of my job with Pepsi was dissappointing the customers on my route and being away from my wife and children for at least 11 to 12 hours on most days and as much as 14 hours on some days."
bad,Pepsi preaches brand loyalty and this family environment but it was a daily occurrence that management would take advantage of the lower tier workers by pushing their workload on the merchandisers instead of doing the work themselves. Merchandisers have little to no say and would have to do their workload or they would get in trouble for not providing adequate service to a store. Overall just a terrible company to work for and the money you make will mostly be put back into your care for the wear and tear of driving.
bad,"Management does not know what they are doing.The pay for what you actually have to do is horrible.(13.88 plus mileage .58/mile)  To get a decent check one would have to work 55 plus hours. Also, you will have to pay for other's mistakes or take the blame if its your route. Plus it is not a professional atmosphere, it is too relaxed."
bad,"Your schedule varies due to the production schedule. Mangament doesn't care about your time off or your personal life, and you will change shifts wether you like it or not. Expect to be called in on a moments notice with no on call pay."
bad,"long hours donbt care about home life of employees. "
bad,"Frecuentemente trabajamos bajo presión debido a los altos índices de ventas que requieren los supervisores y gerentes, no tomando en cuenta las variables de mercado o las rutas comerciales. No existe horario laboral, debido a que la entrada es antes de la 7 am y no hay hora de salida, en mi caso, muchas diariamente mi salida varía de las 10 o las 11 pm, llegando a casa poco antes de la media noche. Los días de descanso son unicamente domingos, excepto en fin de cada mes debido a que nos exigen ir, para elevar las ventas antes de que cierre el mes."
bad,"- MEM department has absolutely NO leadership! "
bad,"14 hr. days.  very tough conditions, very physical job. its hard on your body. not much opportunity for advancement. I enjoy all the other drivers. they work hard."
bad,"This job was terrible. Most, if not all my co-workers were unhappy. Most stayed BC the pay is OK, and didn't have the time to look for another job. "
bad,"You're boss doesn't care about you, your family, or your life. You may give them your all day and night for years, but that doesn't matter one bit to them. They will change your shift with no real choice to you and screw up everything you had going in life."
bad,This particular job really makes me regret ever obtaining a CDL.  This company doesn't look out for it's employees.
bad,The job in Pepsi was temporary I've stayed for nearly 5 months
bad,Be warned you will have no home life. Unit manager treats everyone lreally bad and rules Naples through fear and intimidation.  If corporate ever came in and investigated he would be fired.  He does shady deals to hit sales numbers. All on the backs of his employees if they don't like it they will find a way to fire you.  I worked there for 13 years  it was a different place without this bully in charge
bad,This is by far the worst company I have ever worked for. The only good thing about it was the guys I worked with. They were all helpful and fun to work with. Management could care less about you. They will give you the fake smile while stabbing you in the back. The equipment ....trucks... are not safe and way out of date. The warehouse cant load a truck and no one cares to change that. You will work your butt off for peanuts. I could go on and on but I'm warning you now. Don't do It. Says a lot when they loose drivers by the week. Cant keep them.......never will because they refuse to listen or change
bad,"Management is entrenched and has lost all perspective of reality. Most of the employees are mediocre and those who aren't quickly realize this and leave, engendering a culture of mediocrity."
bad,badness starts from the top down.. not a good work environment.
bad,Very challenging work environment.  Not welcoming for new employees.  Finance inidividuals are not seen as partners just data pull resources.
bad,Bad management attitude made for bad work environment and caused low work morale.
bad,"grast place to start a career, but no chance for advancement"
bad,"A lot of people steal everyday."
bad,"I only worked for this company for 60 days and it was the worst 60 days of my life. I should have noticed the signs when no one could give a straight answer about what I actually would be doing. The training after my initial orientation sucked. There is too much division in departments. There is no cooperation or coloboration and no one is held accountable. People in other departments don't follow up and this causes more work for A/R and inbound reps. The so called trainers for A/R don't know the job to even tell you how to do the job to be best of your abilities. The compensation was good. The benefits packaged sucked, and they are extreme (to the point of crazy) over the brand. Good luck if you are considering this company, maybe you'll have greater success than I did."
bad,"A typical day consists of 14 hours, and if any product comes back on the truck at the end of the day, managers write you up for it."
bad,I worked @ pepsi for 11 & half years. I had a boss who always tried to get everybody in trouble for any little thing. He was able to get away with it because the plant I worked @ had no union! I had no problems with any other supervisor I worked for but him. Eventually he weaseled a way to get rid of me & he did it 3 days before my baby was born.
bad,The manager wont everyone to tell her about everyones mess-ups even if you are new but not tell you or help you get it right.
bad,"Eat, sleep, breathe, live, and drink pepsi 24/7 to be successful"
bad,Typical day would be stressful. Management wants to do more with less and pay isn't competitive with competition.
bad,"The pay is very nice, but the company itself is poorly run. Management does not communicate with each other and you may have 3 different people giving you 3 different assignments for the day. They expect you to forget about friends and family and devote yourself to the company."
bad,told one thing and it was something todaly diffrent when started
bad,Working at Pepsi will be the end of your personal life. Everybody has been divorced. You will not be happy working there. People leave all of the time.They most recently took away our 401k match and lowered our pay. You will work 60 hours plus a week and on holidays you will work weekends.
bad,Pepsi is the worst place I have ever worked. They don't care about their employees/associates. I worked there for almost 4 years and management is terrible. I wouldn't recommend working there at all. They follow no safety rules and when you get hurt on the job due to unsafe conditions they find a reason to let you go
bad,"I worked here for four and a half years, the original management staff left and were replaced by a management staff who could not manage. I left, and my manager who helped me on the weekends left as well. No discipline or work life culture, my manager who I reported to was irresponsible and not trustworthy at all."
bad,"More of a lifestyle than a job. Pay is t what they say. Great job until they changed the pay structure. Management is non existent, and it feels like you’re on your own to sink or swim."
bad,"It's all about numbers to Pepsi. They could careless about the warehouse worker's. If you have a disability that holds you back more then most or not .If you don't hit your 123 cases an hour,  they will do everything that they can to get you fired."
bad,Job did not pay what was advertised on job site.  To little pay for the work involved.  Management was friendly but did not listen well to employees.  Driver training was very good.
bad,"The pay will never be worth the stress, rush and bad managers/leads. They want you to move fast in a tight warehouse and quickly load their trucks. The work destroys you because you have to be on a 90% rate or higher, if not help you God. Then you have to watch out for managements puppets otherwise expect to be mistreated and get your hours cut. Never work for this place at all costs."
bad,"I did not enjoy my time with pepsi. It seemed like you could wither make your store happy, or your manager happy. Never both. Very much disliked my manager. He was hard to reach and very unproductive."
bad,A typical work day at Pepsi goes as follows; Waiting 30 minutes to get into the gate. Wait to get into the building. Forklift fumes inside of a warehouse with no windows and few doors.
bad,"Very poor management. Poor culture. Not appreciated for the excellent work you may do. They retain the worst managers, while the best employees leave."
bad,To many hours management is terrible and there is no home balance 12 hrs 7 days a week. You are forced to work over everyday because you are the low person on the union pole
bad,"Felt like a robot here, it was work, work, work with no appreciation for the job. The managers and supervisors are almost never there and when they are offer no support to you. You are given routes that almost always can not be done in a reasonable amount of time, work 10 to 12 hours a day 5 days a week."
bad,If you like an unorganized place and being lied to in your interview and working 12 hours 6 days a week this place is for you then. If your in a pinch for money try it out here no one including upper management stays long at the Muncie location..
bad,"Worst job ever modern day slavery. Management is terrible they have a stupid point system, and the certifiers think they are better then everybody and look down on you. The union just takes your money they don't help with anything it's so bad there i don't even drink Pepsi anymore."
bad,"Lack of training and or response to training requests, procedures when changing Job title were never clear. The co workers were great, bit management was completely disorganized"
bad,Worst job ever. No home life. Deliver all your drinks no matter what it takes. Exposed to all the weather. If you have a good back you wont have one within a year of working here. Way underpayed for the amount of work you do. Best thing is I got my CDL A and was able to get a good job elsewhere.
bad,"Everyone here hates their job truly they hate it and the moral at the Johnstown location is worse than any job I've ever worked at. Management treats you more like a number and less like a human. Forget your social life, family or kids they don't care. You'll get worked doubled and told they'll give you an 8 hour break between shifts which is OSHA regulated but then they lie and give you maybe 3 hours. The workers are aggressive and will throw you under the bus in a heart beat. It's honestly like a Dr. Phil show I've never seen such grown men cause so much drama. The Supervisor over the plant has such an ego and kissses his bosses butt non stop. He will schedule you on the weekends and work you into the grave but go on Saturdays and enjoy his Penn State games. They blame the employees for the low performance in a quarter but in reality it's the equipment that's old and outdated which breaks down and causes the poor performance."
bad,"No opportunities for advancement unless you are in the ""it"" crowd. Wouldn't approve transfer to another facility. Great pay, but after 3 years it was time to move on due to management."
bad,"12hr days, that's ok ,mgt.sucks.No one cares. You are on your own,  although it's a union shop. John Becker the union agent apparently works for Pepsi.  Just an awful place to work"
bad,"If you want to work in a place where the work is overloaded and understaffed this is the place to go, manager is clueless and you're expected to stay til all hours of the night and put a smile on about it,any ""extra"" help is usually clueless or stoned"
bad,"Management is horrible, they turn their head on their job responsibilities and pass it on to the next person so eventual it gets partially taken care of. They pay good but play games with your pay check. They expect you to live there, don't care whether you have a family or not. No one stays, mandatory 12s and 6 days. Gets old quick, not to mention very physical work with no AC. Very disrepectful place."
bad,"Pay is good but management is terrible they tell you one thing and do the complete opposite no communication. Revolving door of a company, hard to make it out your first 90 days."
bad,Way under staffed need to hire many more people if you like working ridiculous amounts of hours this place for you forced overtime more so in summer but year round more so for new hires
bad,Management shaves checks and terminate workers based of feeling and almost no paper trail is needed they dont pay us riight for all the overtime we do and the treat us like slaves
bad,I was involved in an accident at Pepsi and it wasn't my fault.  Pepsi did nothing to help me recover physically or mentally..I had to get an attorney involved for treatment.  I lost the job for pain medication that was prescribed to me by the emergency room doctor. Was told by Pepsi to not listen to the doctor and return to work.. I stayed in pain for almost one year. Couldn't take the pain..took medication on off day and was asked to random after returning to work. informed management but was sent home then fired.  Attorney wasn't able to get my job back as they wanted me to resign anyway. (Said that in writing) sent CEO and vps message and they didn't respond. Hate this company.
bad,"Co-workers all get along well, pay is good, benefits are good and that's were the pro's end for Pepsi Wichita. Management has really gone down hill. Nothing is ever managements fault, it's always yours. Not enough hours to get tasks done, then you get reprimanded for not getting it done. Then when you work extra to get everything done, then your in trouble for to many hours. Unrealistic expectations unless you are willing to be a shady salesman. That might be how management wants to do things, but not me. Sales manager will cuss at you and show you no respect unless he wants a favor. I put in my 2 week notice and was treated horrible after doing so. I wouldn't go back for twice the pay!"
bad,"long days no home time no balance. mandatory overtime. poor training I really hated working for this company. the only nice thing was I was trained to get my cdl, which they took away from me after being fired."
bad,"Worst place I ever worked. 12 hour shifts. Usually ended up being 15,16 hrs. Management was clueless. When they say they run a lean crew. There not joking. 1 operator. 1 maintenance tech. 1 quality tech . 1 line driver and a supervisor for a bottling line. No thanks . Pay is not comparable with duties."
bad,Supervisor constantly lies to you and put you in the worst areas in Memphis. If you are a driver don't waste your time applying and They have to worst trucks
bad,"This was one of thee worst companies Ive ever worked for. The turnover rate is EXTREMELY high and I understand why. When you think of Pepsi you think of a great company with room for advancement. The average employee has to belong to the company for at least 15-17 years to receive a promotion. You really have to be seen and not heard and if you are a WOMAN, don't even think about it. The gas station, store and drug and dollar managers will not respect your decisions or ability to know your job. The job is very sexist. I DO NOT recommend this employer to anyone. Also the Drivers of Pepsi have a union so they do as they please and the Sales Reps don't so they take the bulk of responsibility, mess ups to fix and no one to support them."
bad,"Great medical insurance. That is the one pro for the job. Other than it's long work hours, most often sporadic, you never know how long you are going to work until you walk through the door. It could be 8 to 15 hours. If someone calls out it puts the warehouse workers in a bad place and management does nothing to fix the issue. They just expect the guys that show up to do whatever it takes for however long it takes to get the job done. If you want an outside life other than the weekends it's not the job for you. Monday through Friday you are going to live at work. Most people would say the job pays well, but for what you do and give up and what they expect of you, it's not nearly enough."
bad,"Extremely long hours for not that much pay in difficult areas with bad trucks, no AC or radio, and bad equipment and the management does not care. also they give you around 17 to 20 stops a day rain or shine and they expect you to do it within 16 hours. They don't respect DOT Hours and they will overwork you even if it kills you. You can find a different job to accept you. I was 23 when I started here and I thought I had no choice and I gave it my all and was not rewarded. The company isn't organized. Because I was routed in the hood, the truck was always robbed. Sometimes I'll be in a corner store, delivering during a theft. Just a true nightmare, please stay away. I eventually quit almost three months later and went to Coca-Cola which was a lot better but similar so after a few months of that I went to UPS freight and I love driving again. There was a high turnover at Pepsi and they had a lot of drivers on light duty because they claimed injury but the truth is they just could not deal with the intense extreme physical demand on your body."
bad,"Not a place to work if you are not prepared to work 15 hour shifts each scheduled day, and at least 12 hours on forced days off. Management did not care about anything except the numbers."
bad,"This company is laughable at best. They can’t even afford winter clothes for all its employees, new hires wearing shorts and t-shirts in the middle of winter. Gloves and box cutters maybe once or twice a year.  As a merchandiser spend your work week most likely split between two of the “sales reps” who work the easiest and slowest days of the week, only to then cover their days of which are the busiest. While they send themselves simple work loads they will dump so much product on you and expect it to all be done for them by the time they come back. If you don’t happen to finish all of the extra work that was put on your shoulders so they could have an easy week, guess who gets talked to? You. Which brings me to the next matter, management. AWFUL! The sales reps bosses literally hold none of their reps accountable and all blame or responsibility for your lack of miracle working is thrown straight back in to your face for working yourself in to the grave.  They are so short staffed that helper routes are often pulled without any notice, leaving you to scurry around all day like a chicken with no head. This company does not care if you have worked years for it, shed blood, sweat and tears. At the end of the day you are expendable and the more people they can pay at a lower rate per hour the better.  The pay is about the only positive thing I can say about the company, besides that.....look for another company. Plenty of higher paying companies for the same type of work."
bad,Management is a joke No morals or understand of your life Dont give you help but expect you to do everything and then complain and write you up for ot
bad,If you have more than 6 months experience do not apply. Find anpther driving job. Manager is respectfully disrespectful. Knows what to say for them not to get in trouble. HR team is inconsiderate and does not care.They work you to death with no care in the world. Your manager will tell you. You should be comfortable with 600 cases a day! All side unloading no automatic carts. Money is very good if you would like to kill yourself for it. Revolving door company.
bad,Weinig kans op doorgroeimogelijkheden en weinig gebraagd op interim.
bad,"A lot of favoritism, and they don’t try to help you move up the chain. They try to keep you at the bottom. They say they will make something happen and don’t do anything at all. They make promises they can’t keep."
bad,Es demasiado la cantidad de producto que quieren ingresar a tienda y no tiene la benta que se cree
bad,Management is completely disconnected with the actual work that needs to be done. Not at all team oriented. The workload placed on Manufacturing Supervisors in impossible to complete.
bad,I worked 10-12 hours a day and they would cut my overtime and then withheld my last check for 3 months. It was well over 100 degrees within the building and you wouldn't get a break for several hours (only one break). You worked until all the teams were done with their trucks and couldn't leave until that point.
bad,At PepsiCo Skelmersdale you are just a number. None of management are interested in your progression at all. They are all just trying to make an impression for themselves by being as stubborn as possible. Permently sacking people for tame reasons. Most defiantly the worst job I’ve had. I wouldn’t advise working there unless you are desperate for the wages.
bad,Your chances of being fired immediatly before your benefits kick in is high with this company. I would never recommend anyone looking for a long term job to apply to here.
bad,"no, im good. managment sucks, no advancment opportunities. Horrible place to work. i would not recommend this place to anyone. They do not like women workers"
bad,"Terrible management, selfish culture, you are a number not a person. Absolutely wouldn't go back to working at Pepsi. Management discriminates and doesn't care."
bad,I work at walkers in skelmersdale bad place to work thay threat you like dirt and the factory floor is so dirty and if your ill thats it thay get rim of you
bad,If you want a job where it's a hostile work environment- and treated like a kid and enjoy getting yelled at then this is the job for you. The mananger here is a a..hole point blank. Once you left the yard wasn't bad other that the 18-23 stops with half merchandise stops about 12 hrs a day.
bad,Pickers were a great crew. But night manager and warehouse manager need to be replaced. Between the two of them you have no chance at success. They would do anything in their power to keep you down. Accused you of everything bad happening and took no fault. Would be such a better company and location to work for if those two were gone. Had no sympathy towards their pickers family issues and only cared if you could make it to work. Two sad excuses of humans in my opinion.
bad,"Unless you want to work at a place for 60 hours a week for $20-$22 an hour with no time and half then this is your job. If you like early start times and like getting home late then this your job! Compensation is really light for moving 10,000-12,000 or more lbs a day for straight time for 60 hours a week then this is for you. And if you like doing it in all weather conditions then take your CDL A license and apply to Pepsi."
bad,Management wasn't very pleasant. Hot conditions. Not very good to move up in the business. Some times you only get one break.Overall would not recommend working for this company.
bad,"The machinery keeps breaking down. The mechanics aren't allowed to fix it with new parts; just putting band-aids on the problems. The company invested 14 million dollars in a production line to run Propel. The line is garbage. There is a efficiency rating the department must meet, 74%. They are running at a steady 53%. And they are using the same company that installed the Propel line to start producing KeVita. Some co-workers, all male, gossip and talk garbage about other workers; the stuff you would see in Mean Girls. I can go on but I feel I said enough."
bad,"Overall this was a good 1st job right out of college. I gained sales and management experience early on from a reputable company. Work life balance is only talked about, they have difficulty delivering on that aspect. Many critical aspects of the job wasn't disclosed prior to on boarding. I moved out of state for this position, felt obligated to ""make it work""."
bad,"Very poor management, otherwise I would be happy to be as a part of that company. Had many interesting a successful projects, however the whole team was destroyed a couple time and finally completely lay-down during last re-organization."
bad,"This company is a prime example of working for a large company. No working life balance, they don't care about your well being. Only care about numbers and is depressing to work for."
bad,You put in a lot of hours. You get decent benefits but not decent pay for the amount of work that you are required to complete. The work culture is horrible. The boundaries are not clearly defined and one person just has too many tasks to complete because there aren't enough people to do the required programs. There is a blame culture and lots of negative energy. The good part of the job is there are some good employees to work with that make the job bearable.
bad,"You start at 7am, do not expect to finish anytime before 4. If you have your child is sick management has been known to give you a hard time for missing work. If there's an issue with a driver, it falls on you. If there are any other issues it falls on you because it is your route and you are the owner of that route."
bad,"Ran like A high school. Kids with engineering degrees whom are bright, but not wise at all.  Once management changes and the culture here changes, then it would be better! Pepsi is a great place to work, but this facility is by far the worst ran plant in all my 20 years of industrial maintenance/engineering. Blame culture rather than find solutions.  Favoritism runs rampant throughout facility!"
bad,Stressful environment. Need better management. Can't keep enough help. Luckily there is a union so make sure you sign up. Got tired of bringing the job home.
bad,"Would not recommend this job to anyone management gave no support setup to fail, good pay but not worth it. High seniority did not mean anything but put a target on your back"
bad,This company pays below the average industry salary pay rate. New management is racist and entitled. I left because I felt under appreciated and under paid.
bad,yönetim ve personel çalışma sistemi olarak fazla kötü
bad,Es una empresa dedicada al servicio de refresco todo está bien solo la gente que está en el área de jefe directo no sabe llevar su trabajo ya que no quieren k nos paguen bonos
bad,"absolutely no accountability whatsoever, When I had days off and the person covered for me didn't do their job I would be the one to get talked to and coached. The hardest thing is having to work from 4am to 6pm or later and when I ask for help which was rare it would only be for 30 minutes then the manager would ask them to go somewhere else. I hurt myself at this job my health declined. I work non stop without lunch breaks,"
bad,"Get blamed for other's mistakes daily."
bad,"The worst fleet managers in Pepsi, no experience with the equipment being serviced,  but they try to tell a ASE CERTIFIED technician how to fix equipment and how long it should take when they have never seen a wrench in their lives."
bad,"Political, not matter how hard you work it does not matter if you arent kissing someones butt. Pay was not enough for what we do. People are great out in the trade. Management does not know what they are doing they came from college but not all are business majors, or even had business experience."
bad,"Работа сложная, требующая особой пукнтуальности и терпения"
bad,"Management structure and how they treat their employees is ridiculous!"
bad,No life working here.   No kind of balance.  Pay should be way better for the amount of hard work a person puts in. A real lack of communication and don't zalways keep a person informed of what's going on.
bad,"Not advisable to ever work here for anyone or anything at this location. The pay is bad, the people are clueless, the ones who try to produce here get abused."
bad,They will work you to death then blame all the bosses mistakes on you then expect you to b okay with it. Join this company only if you want to be made out to look like a fool
bad,"Pepsi is by far the worst place I have worked at. They are completely unorganized. Also they work you 11-16 hours every day. Including 1 whole day overtime.Promised me a $2 raise once I was full time. That is a lie. My raise is on hold for the union for 1 year. Wrong on so many levels. Unrealistic CPH count and favoritism. Working like a donkey for low pay. At least before I was working my butt off for that raise. Now I'm looking for another job, I refuse to work for such low pay, I have zero life because I am always at work."
bad,This was one of the worst places I have ever worked. Don't be fooled by the commercials. This is a performance based company only interested in their bottom line so they are not concerned with your personal life . The management treats you like dirt.. Everyone I worked with was so unhappy but didn't want to quit because the pay is good. And that is only because you work 12 hours per day on average. I was terminated because I filed a grievance against my supervisor. They get upset when you run out of hours like traffic jams are your fault. They drag their feet when you are stuck on the side of the road because you are not paid hourly. Sometimes you have to wait as much as three hours to get unloaded and they don't want to pay you detention time.  The right hand has no idea what the left hand is doing and as a result you are penalized for it. I was unfairly singled out and mistreated because my supervisor had a beef with  New Yorkers. They are so petty so do yourself a favor and look elsewhere. Don't say I didn't warn you.
bad,"Every day is a different challenge to be deal with to be able to do your job. It is not a life balance work, you work 14 hrs a day plus your traveling commute will add up 1 to 2 hours depend your distance,  forget about your family, friend and social activities. Vacation time, you have to schedule a year in advance only to get what is lifted over from the seniority, never will get summer time or holiday. Management is a joke, some have experience, but the majority are new because the cannot keep up them. After you have worked for 14 hrs, you have to deal with the management at the office and most of the time you have to work off the clock if you are a sales rep to avoid DOT regulation. They make you sing tons of legal document, so you feel treat of the job, because it is a constantly pressure from management and customer and you are in the middle, you have to go beyond your mean to make thing work. Otherwise you wont be able to make it here. No air-conditioning on vehicle, only heat, and van or truck can easily reach extremely high temperate and should not be allowed it by the government to let company operate on that circumstance. You are by your self basically all day, with no help and extremate amount of job to do (delivering, merchandizing and ordering the product for the coming order) I you willing to sacrifice for a few year it will pay, but you have to have a limited time, otherwise you will be in a cycle that can not get out of working and sleeping a few hour and do it again next day and so on until you get fire for any mistake because you are wore out  or a bad situation"
bad,Very physical work fast paced but the poorest management and moral I've ever seen from any place I've ever worked. They only care about there numbers not employees.
bad,"Overall, based on the market, Pepsi jobs usually pay more than others. But, it isn't worth it. The only holidays that I had off were Thanksgiving and Christmas, and some roles required people to work these, making sure that the stores had product in them. The company works people like dogs - our warehouse team regularly worked case pickers 16+ hours a day during the summer. Supposedly it has changed now, but that was the daily expectation during my time there. Work life balance doesn't exist with this company. "
bad,"Out of my 8+ years of work experience this job was BY FAR the worst. Sure the pay is great and you receive benefits the day you start, but that excitement only lasts so long. It seems as if everyone absolutely hates being there and you feel the tension the moment you walk in the door. They over work you and there is absolutely NO teamwork. I was so excited to get this job because the pay was great and it was only a mile or so away from my house. Well after 6 months, an infected cut, and a stress fracture in my foot from an absurd amount of pressure and hours put on it. I cannot stress enough to STAY AWAY from this job. Its just not worth the stress....trust me"
bad,"company only wants ""yes men"", employees don't want to improve process and always make excuses for missed deadline. managers don't know how to control spending"
bad,"I would suggest potential employees not to spend time at PepsiCo unless you are hired directly. Contractors are nobody here, especially if your major is not Accounting, Finance doesn't work!!!"
bad,Management is terrible.  No advancement because nobody ever leaves.  The benefits are real good but thats about it.  They give the most horrible customer service of anywhere I have ever worked.
bad,"With the 12 hr shifts on nights and the rotation there's not much of a work / life balance. There is a lot of favouritism and it brings down team moral. The pay is good but your personal life suffers for it. "
bad,I work 58 hours as a driver and my paycheck is $540.00 a week! I can work at Costco and bring home more and work less. Not a good place to work unless they start paying us hourly.
bad,"My job as a line operator is to keep the line running at an 82% efficiency rate or higher. The most enjoyable part of the job is that it is a fast paced environment and I get to lead a small team to get terrific results every night. This meshes well with my military and leadership background. However, there is absolutely no room for advancement within Pepsi. The management would usually come to ME for help if they did not know what to do in a particular situation because of my background in leadership. I personally want to start a career that i can put my leadership skills to use and help grow a business and personally grow with it."
bad,"going downhill everyday and the workload gets more and more"
bad,"was given minimal training, and thrown into the fire to crash and burn.. Made one mistake that I corrected with no issues and was fired for it.. My advice to this company train your people better have someone dedicated to training..was told multiple different things at least 3-4 times a day.. I wouldn't recommend this job to my worst enemy.. Poor management, understaffed, no direction.. I prefer coke anyways"
bad,Very hard to advance unless you know someone. Hire more from the outside.
bad,"There is no such thing as a typical day, the day starts at 6am and everything depends on if all the route drivers show-up. I learned that you can not plan from 1 day to the next, you never know what the day is going to bring. Managers have to manage who shows up that day. The District Manager is on the phone by 6:30AM counting heads and borrowing from one location to cover another. My co-workers were some of the finest people I ever worked with. The hardest part of the job was keeping a positive attitude, when you see hard working employees payroll deducted for things out of their control. Most, not all, employees in my opinion are treated as liers and thieves. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a satisfied customer."
bad,"The pay is low for a local truck driver, the work load is more than expected to do in a typical 10 hour day and the company does not follow the D.O.T guidelines properly."
bad,Get ready for long hours and half pay for overtime. The superiors are unexperienced which cause alot of headaches with mismanagement. Promotions are non-existent and very high turnover rate.
bad,The local management is terrible.  The pay is terrible.  You are expected to give your life to the company and your family comes second. Some of the customers that you deal with are ok. Most hate you because you work for Pepsi
bad,There are more fulfilling jobs in the market place. There is not very much upward mobility. Most people feel like a hamster on a wheel at their job. The only positive aspect to this job is the benefits. The pay is not that great.
bad,"Pepsi could be a great place to work but management is very poor, they will say apply for Sales Rep then during the interview they offer you a seasonal position as a Reset person!! The management is vey dishonest! Don’t waste your time!!"
bad,"never work for pepsi they are all crooks  If you have an accident at pepsi on their ragedy equipment they will fire you or blame it on the worker, They dont take responsibility for anything"
bad,"Pepsico Omaha: Masters of covert racism and discrimination. The certain subtle things they do to employees they don’t like, one could say is worthy of a lawsuit!"
bad,Was 1 of the best temps hit my number regularly and never missed worked 4 months of bussing my tale working 12 hours shifts 6 days a week and was not hired just hired new temps to replace the old  and the hard work is damaging to the body PepsiCo is trash they also play favorites
bad,Place is a joke nobody cares! Send you to places that are unsafe to work. If they weather is bad they don’t care. Management sucks!!! Kinda funny ask you to do stuff they wouldn’t....lol
bad,"There is a union, which is not worth the money you pay for it. Work goes by seniority so if you are a new hire you won’t get full hours. Guys that have been working there for a few years don’t get all their shifts. Delivery is the worst department. Job is not worth the pay for the work, terrible management. Only good thing is only working four days a week."
bad,"They set you up to fail daily it’s your job to fix their failure and when it impossible it now becomes you failure "
bad,"They'll give you every excuse in the world why they cant promote you, even if your record is impeccable etc., and then they'll find a reason to terminate you if you complain about the fairness of it. Your immediate supervisor has TOTAL control over whether you're even ALLOWED to apply for another position. RUN AWAY."
bad,This is by far the worst place ive ever worked for if you wanna live at your job then apply at pepsi howell monday - saturday sonetimes no days off for weeks. Never get time with family and they do everything by seniority even tho its a non union postion so everyone on first shift get whatever they want pretty much. Supervisor and manager have no backbone to put them in their place. Working for coke is much better
bad,"Top performance ratings do not deserve taunts and abusive behavior "
bad,"poor management, if you are a YES man, you will be alright in that place but as soon as you disagree with the management you will be in big big trouble and they find a reason to you to exit with the business."
bad,They work you like a dog. If there are system issue where work isn’t received sure you get to sit around and not do anything but when system comes back you will work very late and still get  scrutiny about being there so late.
bad,"You are expected to drive 40' tractor trailer into places that they do not belong. The company will sacrifice safety for delivery. I have had 8 managers/supervisors/interns in the last 4 years, none of which had any driving or delivery experience. The trucks break down daily, the trailers are trashed and full of black mold, and this is the second summer of no AC (they continue to look into it), and the equipment is always broken, or falling apart. The ""Drivers Board"" is based on seniority, based on hire date, and based on work available, so many times your left waiting for a 4:30 am phone call each day that doesn't come. You have an option to Merchandise (fill store shelves) for far less pay and tends to be more work, all while driving your own vehicle to each store. Many times you only get two driving shifts a week and on those two days senior drivers are in on OT or Double OT. If a route opens up and nobody takes it you are forced based on seniority to take it, often times being thrown on a 7pm-3am night shift 5 days a week, usually with 2 days notice. As a new driver, with the least seniority this is the route you will start on. 3 days off in a row are rare, even after working 4x10's they will call you with one day off and expect you to come in. This is not a company you want to try and start out in, their is no advancement, you lose any and all seniority if you leave the drivers board to work in the warehouse or anywhere else in the country in the same position. There is no schedule, no routine, and must be available 6 days a week."
bad,"not a bad place to work if your looking for money, but you are constantly working 6-7 days a week, you're not guaranteed any time off, and the management is very poor and could care less about you as a person, your just a body."
bad,If you like pushing a wheeler through the snow. If you like filling shelves and coolers. If you like destroying your back with 12 hours of lifting. If you like making $21 an hour. If you like lifting a full wheeler up and down stairs I’d recommend for you
bad,"Well if you enjoy arguing and getting nowhere with thick headed managers who could care less about you or you’re struggles , “ just do what I say “ thankfully, we have local 830 to represent us in our everyday struggles with a management crew who knows almost nothing about a Wharehouse,  if that’s what you like to do for extended periods of time, you’re in the right place !"
bad,The job is boring. Its the same every day. 12 hours shifts including nights. Pay is good. Most employees are not English. Management are deluded and get paid about 46k. Bit of a joke of a place.
bad,"Management, terrible, environment, terrible, you will be overworked and under appreciated. The Union will work against you before it works for you. DONT DO IT."
bad,Management here is the worst I've seen or even work for. There is no possible way to move up unless your there favorite.  They finally put fans in the place but only on the dock to keep the qcs and management cool. I do not recommend working here unless your use to bs
bad,"PepsiCo is a corporate business that care less about their employees...There model is to do more for less pay...At the moment PepsiCo bottling is taking over Tropicana and frito lay going warehouse, so a lot of people about to lose their jobs...."
bad,"Cool job if you're trying to make quick money, but it's nothing that you should try to make a career out of. Management is horrible, and they definitely don't respect or value their workers."
bad,They tell you what you want to hear to get you in the door. They work you 7 days a week all summer long and constantly tell you they are working on a plan to get you days off and never do. Many supervisors quit in the short time I was there. Supervisors that are still there are incompetent and dont follow through on anything they say. Also one of the most disrespectful companies I have ever worked for.  No HR within this location. Zero communication between supervisors and floor associates. Plant manager that is clueless to what is going on. Production manager who is brand new and doesnt know what to do. High turnover. Coke is better
bad,I wouldn’t recommend this job for someone who has a family it’s long hours but the pay is great. I hate that we do like 12- 18 hours a day and we are under staffed
bad,Terrible management and extremely deceptive hiring practices. Company is full of old timers just running out the clock. Also backstabbers  everywhere!
bad,"From the time you start in the morning until you punch out at the end of the day you are moving. You move thousands of pounds of product mostly without help. Some routes have about 12-15 stops and other days you could have up to 23 stops. you have to merchandise coolers at most accounts now, New products are arriving all the time."
bad,"Hard work for employees that cared, the management didnt care and would let employees stand around.   Management was very poor.  Management had favorites and if they didnt like you they targeted you until you either quit or they fired you."
bad,"Took the role right out of college. It's extremely physical and you drive your own car all around. You start work around 6am going into gas stations and stocking their selves and placing new orders for them. "
bad,Durante el tiempo que trabaje en la prensa nunca me sentí valorado.
bad,Corporate Bureaucracy.  Cooperate is not interested in their employees on a lower level or taking grievances seriously and impose their political views on their employees.
bad,"The job with Pepsi is not difficult mentally. It does require physical work, I work with soda all day long and that requires some strength and stamina. The people I work with are great we are a huge team and are always there to help each other if someone is needing a hand."
bad,"Worst job I’ve ever had. More complicated than it has to be. Management treats you poorly.  Hard on your body. If you’ve been there 20+ years, the money probably makes it worth it. New people get burned on routes and money. Left after 4 weeks."
bad,management only cared about the little boys not men who rather leave early and cheat to get the production incentive. The men were allowed to use the womens bathroom and it looked and smelled horrible after they did.
bad,"A lot of effort with no reward, nor appreciation.  Work/life balance does not exist.  Poor management and favoritism.  Ideas are shot down, then the next day was executed by the same person that shot it down, with no communication on it - credit stealing is very common."
bad,"PepsiCo has no loyalty, nor do they support honest committed employees. They hire students right out of college for management and do not consider employees that have been working there system for years. No true advancement opportunities."
bad,Management team has no experience. They just rotate supervisors to different departments so they can make more money. Because their lack of knowledge in a specfic department causes a chaotic work place.
bad,I've learned a lot about sales and how to advance my customer service skills but after putting in the time and work into trying to advance within the company you get nowhere.
bad,Unorganized. Long grueling hours. tough on your body. dont have plans for your own life working for this company .pepsi is the number 1 beverage company and product is in every store. they will take advantage and work you into the ground. ideal for recent high school graduates who dont know what they want to do with their life yet and just want to get hrs and stack money or ex cons. managers are shady all the way up the line.
bad,"Co-works where great to work with. Management was a joke. All the management was to busy covering there butts rather then getting there jobs done correctly,  Also they are anti religious"
bad,"It's a big company and has great benefits.  "
bad,"PepsiCo is the type of job that your make a career out of. Unfortunately i wasn't aware of this until 5 months into having the job. I started to realize however that i had no life. I would have to be to my first store at 7 a.m. to packout the shelves and make my orders before i went to my second and third stores to then in the end have to come back to my first store for a second packout. During the interview, i was told that i'd only have to work some weekends. However, i worked every single weekend both Saturday and Sunday for 5 months straight. The managers and higher ups, only cared about themselves and it was quite frustrating to know that all the managers and higher ups had their weekends off. Also too, i was told that merchsndisers worked from 7:00a.m. until 4:00p.m. when in reality we were expected to work u til the job was done, even if that meant 12 hours a day."
bad,"Hate this place, I will never recommend anyone to work there, any lil thing can get u fired. They don't appreciate the work you do they don't evaluate you on your job performance, even if you've worked your buns off every day with no call outs and no lateness."
bad,I was managed by people that had never done my job. They had never made deliveries and had never drove a truck. They used me until the busy season was over then I was let go. I was told that this was a full time position not a seasonal position.
bad,"Awful place to work, executive management was not supportive, not a collaborative environment, management said one thing, did another.  Very cutthroat, everyone was looking to try to keep their job and no one shared information.  Terrible culture."
bad,"If you like working non-stop with minimal sleep and an out of touch boss who doesn't care about his employees, and only cares about sales, here you go."
bad,"If you expect to get ahead at this company make sure you suck up to the boss everyday of your life and expect to eat and breath the company, if not sorry you will be stuck doing the same job forever."
bad,Had a manager that will tell you what you want to hear and lead you on and on. Job sucked as you never really had any time off unless you requested it a year ago. And the cockroaches that rule the warehouse at night. Employees come in sick wiping there nose and still handling products without washing hands.
bad,"Pay was decent but the management was terrible, always changing what they wanted to happen and not collaborating together to find a way to get things done simpler."
bad,they like to preach diversity and inclusion but totally discriminate against older employees and do not value any one's opinion management and hr is incompetent
bad,Total lack of accountability on employee's. They come and go as they please and no follow up by managers. Made it a hostile work environment. Always coming into a mess everyday with no help to clean up.
bad,"The job itself is physical with long hours (12 hours daily) which isn't a bad thing if your okay with a physical delivery job. The base pay of approximately $30K is good and a typical driver makes $50 to $70K after comissions. They have few written policies and procedures. The bad thing is the driver manager, he lacks basic ethics and morals. On a daily basis, he talks to drivers in adegrading manners, he threatens drivers jobs for missing stops, plays with drivers incomes by forcing them to work as driver helpers which results in them not earning commissions for there deliveries. Upper management backs and supports his actions because they all receive bonus checks based on delivery numbers. Management is one good lawsuit away from losing all of there jobs. If you have the time, patience, and a good lawyer, Pepsi is a good place to pick up a check."
bad,"ZERO Job Security. Horrible management, but the pay was decent. HR was totally no help. No chance to advance within the company. Treated as if you were easily replaced. Company would rather rely on temporary workers than permanent employees."
bad,This job will consume your life and not leave much time for anything else.  It is very physical and time consuming.  You will work 10-12 hours on average and when you get him you will be too tired to spend time with family and/or friends.
bad,I don't enjoy it anymore. Working hard gets you nowhere but dumped on. They need to change the commission bonuses in order to fix all the forces in product to stores
bad,The Del Sups screws up and the drivers are the guys that have to pick up the slack. We aren't paid for our work because most guys are salary in philly
bad,Daily activities were to get the warehouse ready and keep upmwith the day to day chores. Pepsi takes care of its employees who work hard and have the company as its interest.
bad,they stopped taking care of the people who made the company run good and only care about numbers they have become very disrespectful and rude to good employees
bad,A lot of work for not that much pay. I serviced 3 stores and ordered the product for all of them and was still only making as much as the starting pay.
bad,"Worked for Pepsi just about four years. I would have to say Management here is a joke! I have never been lied to so many times, They have no idea what communication means or is . More problems get swept under the rug here. You talk to upper Management and get told ""we are working on it"" HR is useless, corporate office doesn't care. Summer are the worst no A/C! In the building. They push policy but don't even know there own policy or just tell you a lie whatever works for their benefit."
bad,"Job is difficult ,but easy . The difficult part is the routing because they route out of another state and they have no idea how the routes should be ran . We are permanently closing November 6th, so thats why i am looking to relocate after 8 years."
bad,"One of the worst jobs I have had in 36 years! Night shift, not too busy, lead was an OK guy. Fleet Manager would go get diesel spark plugs if you asked him."
bad,"I was the Manager, but felt like a front line worker. I dont think it was fair for me to be held to the same standards as other manages in the region."
bad,I'd rather pick cottom in a field than work here. The place is full of miserable people who only work there because they're stuck.
bad,"el ambiente laboral era muy bueno ya que se vivía con un cariño fraternal con los compañeros, pero el horario era muy pesado ya que no teníamos hora de salida definida, me dejo mucha experiencia laboral, desde facturación y programación de han hell, lo que mas me gusto fue el servicio qe se le brindaba a los compañeros de ventas, en la entrega de facturas el recibimiento de sus fichas depósitos, y el poder guiarlos para facilitar su instancia dentro de la sucursal al momento de llegar con los clientes"
bad,This pepsi location is a horrible place to work. They don't care about their employees.  All they care about is the bottom line.
bad,2nd shift supervisor makes sexist comments about how women shouldn't work there and upper management won't do anything about
bad,Did not think it was as bad until I got in the door..they don't have you're back at all...not at all idea for someone wanting to drive trucks. You will get a text message while you're in bed saying your not working the next day.its a slave ship...stay away from this place Body will be in pain and they want you there at 4 every morning.
bad,A empresa não está disposta a manter os bons funcionários e não se importa com as decisões das suas filiais no brasil
bad,"Poor management"
bad,Well its was just the same type of work everyday. We had to meet an production number everyday to get 15 minute breaks everyday . That was the hardest part about the job everyday. What I learn from the experience is I'm ready to something more stable with some advancement
bad,not good family maN JOB you work long hours taking away from you life and time with family an kids
bad,"My route extended over 150 square miles in Southwest Louisiana. If you have a gift at being a salesman, you will do well. However, if you need training or help at any location that is too far from the Pepsi plant, you will receive it months later!! Most stores in Jennings and Crowley are tougher sales than those in Lake charles. Management has a hard time getting people or themselves to travel more than 50 miles from Lake Charles so you'll get dealing with issues that you can not fix. I asked for help and did this for six months, but when you can't take care of issues that only your plant management can take of, your customers take it out on you! For example, the plant in Lake Charles distributes Crush to all of its stores. For whatever reason, the barcode changed and the 12 packs and 2 liters are now unauthorized in Winn Dixie in Crowley!! This problem has been ongoing and plant management had done little if anything to fix it. My supervisor shot a few emails, but the problem is still ongoing!!!!"
bad,"expect to be treated horrible if you dont fit there, buy a boat , buy a car, buy a house mold!!"
bad,I've worked for cutting edge firms and started with Pepsi. I might as well time traveled back to the stone age as the district manager sought to reverse all advancement of technology back to the pen and paper inventory record keeping. I also didn't like the disregard to safety as it seemed to be thrown to the wind. I can't say I've liked a thing about this place other than my paycheck. I couldn't stay longer than 3 weeks.
bad,You just dont have a life out of work and will get in the way of your life with family.
bad,Hardest job ever. Compensation not enough for what you have to do on the job. You will be forced to work weekends and holidays at early am hours if you have low seniority. You will also have to do other types of work as needed for lower pay. Management will not be honest about all the details upon hire. The pay scale with variable rate overtime is a joke. You are better off finding a lower paying hourly jjob and earning time and a half .
bad,"Bad management, no family time. Be prepared to work 12-16 hour days. My fiancé had a miscarriage, they wouldn’t let me take leave and supervisor asked was I still coming to work. Didn’t even say “sorry for your loss.” All they care about is getting product off those trucks. That’s why they have so much turnover. Maybe if they at least acted like they cared, then people who stay. I could write a book about this place for the short time I worked there. I quit, coukdbt take the BS anymore. Most of those guys don’t have a degree to fall back on like myself."
bad,They'll work you til they squeeze every last drop of sweat and blood out of you. Pay is good but not worth all the bs they force feed you. MGMT trash.
bad,No regards for human life whatsoever. No limit to hours worked a week ad long as there was eight hours in between shifts. I seen multiple employees faint from exhaustion.
bad,Loved my job until I changed back to small format and over heard something I should not have about a campus hire being arrested on the route also who was related to some one in corporate then you can kiss your career good bye
bad,"PepsiCo has a culture that is unhealthy.  I wouldn't recommend working there to anyone, unless they were my worst enemy.  Hardest part of the job is working for a manager who has no leadership skills."
bad,"Just know it's a joke. Warehouse management tries to be your ""homie"" the lead ain't much of a lead. The job is more competitive. Dont get me wrong it's a good job but it's not worth the stress. I've seen the warehouse mangers tell the new hires they would get fired if they didn't make the daily goal of Case Per Hour (CPH). And they rather fire someone who comes to work everyday versus someone who doesn't."
bad,"Hands down worst place to work. I would never consider going back. Pay seems great until you really break it down and realize you’re killing yourself for $18/hour. Upper management can love you one day and be ready to fire you the next. They claim to be a team and say they can get you some help to keep you from working 16 hours a day, but when it comes down to it there’s zero help and you’re stuck on your own"
bad,"I enjoy getting out and meeting new people on a daily basis, my job includes myself working deliveries and making sure we are always beating our competitors. (Coca-Cola)"
bad,Best company to never work for. The only reason I quit is because it’s not a job for anyone who wants to live past 40. Drink and drug seem to be the winning combo to get the job done.
bad,Es demasiado abuso y trabajo para estar ahí hermano abusan de los choferes es un juego mental frustrante es agotarte y frustrante trabajarás para una compañía de esas mañanitas
bad,This job is a very demanding and stressful i would still say no management was very harsh you had to be 100 percent efficient all the time the team leader and the senior associates got all the over time i had to pick and pack customer orders. Also unload semi tralers i had to load the local trucks with pick and pack per customer orders
bad,Co workers bond on one thing and that is how terrible the management is. You are working more than 12 hours a day with unrealistic expectations. The sales managers are probably the dumbest people at the facility and do not have a back bone. The mentality at Pepsi is you can be replaced if you have a complaint. The sales and delivery managers have been there way to long and get away with too much. They have no problem swearing at you when you have a thought of your own. One sales manager got in an employees face at a gas station for doing exactly what he was told.  Extremely unprofessional. Need a personal day that you didn’t know you need at the beginning of the year? Good luck getting it!
bad,long hours sometimes 16 or more how to pull semis into dock doors was not good at all it was ok long hours sometimes let us tke home out of date drinks
bad,All about numbers and not afraid to use intimidation and lyes to achieve this. Their is no place for family life here it’s all work. They don’t even have Christmas party’s under a guise of being inclusive.
bad,"Oh Pepsico Fritolay, where do we begin? So at first working in this “finely established” “rich and fun” “professional” organization you tend to think, hmm this place isn’t have bad, getting good hours having good trainers, but then you slowly come to a realization that this place, this place is absolute garbage. They treat you like a robot over working you and not paying you a dime extra, constantly sizing you up against eachother like you’re in some type of competition, yet you dont get paid for extra by doing any extra work. Which YES at other companies if you do more then the average you get paid an extra bit of money at the end of the day, depending on how much more you do. Which brings me to this, if you go out of your way all the time and constantly do more then an average employee is supposed to do, like take leadership on the floor, pull out bulk trucks, plug them in, clean up the facility to a tee, train peers how to safely and effectively do the job properly ( BECAUSE YES THERE IS A PROPER WAY TO DO THE JOB example Picking up your boards, pulling porduct up, NOT clocking in and out of job codes to make your rates faster, actually doing the job how its meant to be done.) they dont care they just look at you like some idiot and may take shifts away from you just because they may not like you, well sorry your HR idiot may not like you. also picking more cases then Your supposed to, they just reward you with more cases the next day. This place also loves to choose favorites, especially if you know how to kiss butt and ride the managers croch. If your good at doing that"
bad,"Our team had a manager with no management skills about vansales, she was young very inexperienced  & a supervisor who was just like her lap dog, stay clear of this company unless you want to work 12 hours a day a be treated like s##t."
bad,The ad doesn’t mention that you have manifested time restrictions. Unload two pallets in a restaurant and rotate their stock within 15mins and onto the next stop. You get pushed and hounded if you don’t finish within their idea of how long it takes. They don’t show you the crappie routes during training. The trainers get the best routes so you get the false sense of what your job is. The newer you are more merchandise stops you get. Which slows you down. After a while you said I’m done and quit.
bad,Management and culture is terrible. We had to hope and pray we even got paid. Tons of turnover. High pressure. As a route sales guy I did have some anonymity. Good start for first job. Not a career
bad,"expect to deliver 8 tons (16,000 lbs.) of soda BY HAND everyday. be prepared to lift heavy cases all day that are poorly loaded on bay trucks. old and unsafe equipment that constantly break down. some customers can be rude and add stress to your day. poorly managed  with dispatch coming from texas, over 2000 miles away. just an absolute mess of a facility."
bad,"I worked at Pepsi Co for a little over a year, and after the time I spent there, I was fired because, due to a snow in, the department in which I worked was backed up because I was unable to operate my forklift safely outside of the enclosed space I was working in."
bad,"Good company, poor leadership. Micromanagement can be an issue depending on department and supervisor. Most of management should NOT be overseeing some teams and do not collaborate as team players. Unethical use of temp agency employees, no reasoning behind contract termination."
bad,Been a while since i worked there but basically i got fired over jealousy. the pay is really good though as i was a sales rep. but the job security is horrible in that department
bad,"Management is almost never around. when they are they scatter when work comes around, Up keep of warehouse is poor floors always sticky. Ware house rules do not apply to employees who make numbers"
bad,"Not a nice place to work, they have a group of people that has more time there working so they get the better routes,also mostly of the truck don’t have ac"
bad,"Great pay and decent benefits provided not much time off at all so there is no work/ life balance its just work/ work . The management will appear to care about things in your life but numbers are their only concern. there are opportunities to advance but you have to be close with someone in the front office for them to really push your career. Everyone talks about each other so keep to yourself or else anything you say will be said to everyone. people go out of their way to pick on one another but if you defend yourself they are the first to run and tell. long story short its a good paying job and that is a pro but the cons would be the hazing, poor management, lack of career advancement,lack of training, and no work /life balance. Also the forced overtime if your new is daily with occasional 8 hour days but plan for 12 every day for 6 days a week and if that is ok then give it a try but if you have kids or a family and like to spend some time with them i would recommend really laying out all options and make pepsi the last resort."
bad,"Employees take a job in good faith, expecting that when performance measures are met with excellent/good appraisal ratings - this will lead to good things not to being laid off.  Employees are left without references but tarnished reputations."
bad,Managers do not know how to communicate with other drivers. they do not know how to train drivers because they are not drivers themselves. they do not know how to operate a truck but think that they do  because they are managers and the training sucks.
bad,it was not that nice of a place pay was good never really got a descent raise the turn over rate was not good we received new unpre paired boss every six months
bad,El ambiente laboral después de la ley de sindicatos se ha hecho insostenible.
bad,I was not giving the proper support and tools at Pepsi to compete with Coke. The facilitates and equipment was poor.  The job was the worse experience that I have ever had.
bad,Pay sucks management sucks hr sucks and depending on what shift your own watch your back hours are shakey 1 week you get 50+ the next week u might get 30 it's a race to the top it's not worth it the only good thing they offer are benefits and free water company sucks as a whole 👎🏾
bad,"Industry on major decline.  Advancement opportunities only given to those brought in from Campus Hire program.  "
bad,Es mentira eso de la superación personal Rh pésimo la verdad me llevo mal sabor de boca con esta empresa
bad,"Work like a dog and they don't care if you work over your 12 hours, so your cdl is in jeopardy, manager has no clue, there lucky soda is addictive🤢🤢"
bad,"aprendi a relacionarme mas con las personas , aprendi a organizarme, a trabajar en equipo, trabajar bajo presión y estrés la administración deja mucho que desear ya que no son muy desorganizados me gusto mucho la libertad de trabajar a mi propio ritmo y a hacerme mi propio horario"
bad,"I like work at Pepsi Co. I travel in Gujarat."
bad,"Terrible here and management will bad mouth anyone who leaves,  very unorganized and two faced, they cant keep drivers long. Management is switched alot"
bad,I worked here as a computer operator & still working. Also worked as a marketing officer. I'm not satisfied from this job.
bad,"As a sales rep, management pushed volume, not profits. Management received bonuses based on cases sold, rather than profitability. This put a huge strain on store relationships."
bad,"Sempre exerci minha função com excelência pelo fato de trabalhar na rua, mas quando precisava contar com algum funcionário interno era sempre dificultoso"
bad,"Every evening shift was always busy. Learned inventory, sorting, write up damaged merchandise, supervising, check in, park semi-trucks, order building and team work. Co-workers are great."
bad,"Pepsi is one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. "
bad,"If you like poor benefits and short work weeks, this place is for you."
bad,"es una empresa en la cual se te pide mucho esfuerzo fisico y mental, en algunas ocasiones las promotoras estamos con demasiado estres.. sin ninguna motivacion de ganacias no se refleja en tu dinero el degaste fisico que tenias. ninguna motivacion para que sigas adelante con tus ventas."
bad,"What great products they have to offer! .It's a shame that in South Florida, they have forgotten their employees and what's important to them. They used to be a company about honesty, ethics, morals and values.......The great leadership they had has now gone to more about a stigma of ""how I look to my boss"" than how they operate as a leader in the market. Even customers as well as customer DM's in this region are shocked at the change in what's important."
bad,"falta de oportunidade ,etc quando mudou de dono nao foi do jeito que prometeram"
bad,"Fire firghting day after day with poorly traing work force. Expected to work a minimum of 50 hours a week which turns into 60 to 70 after all the audits, internal inspections and new process roll outs. The management team at Pepsi has world class thoughts with 1980 technology. They expect high performance with manual data collection, lack of controls to aid managers in making good decisions and they try to do most thing at the lowest cost rather than righ so it takes three times as long and in the long run cost more."
bad,"work wasnt bad here, they tried to make the day 8 hours only, if not you had to call in for overtime to be ok'd co workers were easy to get along with and enjoyable but managment made it rough, they were constantly on everyones backs over things and used favoritism on advancement"
bad,"PepsiCo is saving money in all the wrong places. Instead of looking at things such as waste due to force outs, costing the company lots of money, they take from employees and justify it in the worst ways possible. Management is fine...they are limited on what they can do. So while employees constantly plead and complain to management, it's a waste overall. Long hours, expected by management...you get coached if you don't hit a 50 hour work week at least...and if you don't hit 50 hours, money is taken from your check on a true up week....it's a horrible horrible place to work with NO room for advancement unless you're hired from a college career fair."
bad,Too much work for one person and not enough pay ...you are treated as a number not a human  ...descent pay but too much for one person I wouldn’t want to go back
bad,They will not treat you fair talk about you in group chats as a driver and find whatever way they need to fire you! I have documented harassment complaints from my supervisor with EEOC.
bad,"Coming into an entry level position as an engineer this job is a joke. They do not seem like they value your willingness to learn and grow, rather treat you like an intern. I believe that any engineer would be losing their skillset instead of gaining anything from an entry level position, not what i expected or what i was being sold at the beginning."
bad,"When I first started working for Pepsi, things were good. Management cared about the employees and work life balance. Several years later things change. The pay was always awful for office personal, but once they tried to be more competitive and hire less qualified people, they were making more than people who’d been working there 6 plus years. They also would only prepare a certain type of employees to advance with the company. "
bad,Management is constantly being replaced by new management. New managers step in and butt heads constantly with people to make a name for themselves. Everyone is always after you job. If you are not in with the in crowd your job is always on the line. Very stressful place to work. No work life balance. They lie to their employees and if managers don't like you lie and find ways to fire you.
bad,"If you like working 70+ hours a week with raggedy equipment and management who could not care less about you, then this is the job for you. The pay and benefits are amazing, though. However, you may go in to work at 4am, but your truck may not be loaded until 8am putting you on the road later. With 16-23 stops a day, you now have a 16 hour work shift, 5 days a week."
bad,"Communication is KEY!!!!!!"
bad,"Pepsi provides great products and their low level employees do their best to provide quality service to customers, but management is terrible. Local leadership is laughable, and two faced. Making good public gestures, while talking bad about customers and providing sub par service leaving product quality questionable at best."
bad,If you work at the one here in Nashville good luck to you. Don't say nothing when you start getting write ups and points for getting 1 min late. I hate the sorry as Management team with a passion.
bad,Ok company to work for but to high turnovers with employees getting fired laid off or quiting... poor management in some departments... learned new things and skills and met a lot of people
bad,"geared very strongly toward favoring minority employees.  number of hours worked in a week will vary greatly.  some weeks you struggle to get 30, other weeks they want you to work 50."
bad,Still deliver from side load trucks to most accounts. A full 10 years behind competative companies. The unwillingness to invest in newer sytems creates a massive employee turnover.
bad,"PepsiCo has a nice perk of half-day Fridays during the summer months and also from Thanksgiving through New Year's Day to promote work/life balance. There is a casual dress code."
bad,Not for anyone who wants work/life balance.  Never enough help and no available staff. Not a job I felt good about. Soda is terrible for your body and I didn't feel right about contributing to this nation's obesity level anymore.
bad,"I started out in the warehouse and ended up driving in the end. They say one thing and do another. Very bad management. They say you will have no more than 10 stops a day. That is a lie. They give you what they feel is fair. You have to drive , unload , get checked in , feel up cooler and shelves, pick up trash. You basically getting pimped. You are underpaid to do so many different jobs. This job should be making anywhere from 80,000 to 100,000 a year driving for PepsiCo, but you will be lucky to see 45,000 and your body will pay for it. Basically you deliver about a 100,000 dollars worth of product a week and bring home 800 a week if you lucky. Sometimes you will deliver over 100,000 dollars of product and still won’t make enough to consider what you delivered.  The last 2 years management has rated about 1 out of 10. Way down from the previous years with great management. Don’t work here unless you have no choice at all. Some supervisors and management are corrupt. Enter at your own risk. Don’t say I didn’t warn you."
bad,Underpaid and over worked. Would work 12 or more hours every day sometimes mandatory 6 days a week! Pulling pallets building displays takes a toll on your body!
bad,"if you dont mind waking up before dawn, driving 50+ miles everyday to a store 1 somewhere and then a few more stores in the area if your lucky or some stores counties apart, then 50+ miles back home, tired after working 12+ hours straight through lunch. Filling your gas tank up at least every other day, having little time spent with friends or family and only thinking about soda whenever you walk in a store, well then Pepsi is the place for you."
bad,"Working at PepsiCo comes with the good an bad. Great benefits, but it's almost impossible to manage work life balance. The company expects anyone in sales management to work 7 days a week, and on call 24 hours a day."
bad,"It was a fast pace production enviroment,great job\benefits,but poorly managed company.  Advancement for someone wanting to better his/her career is limited."
bad,"Alot of hard never ending work. thye had favorites of which they would cater too and it became a popularity contest.Equipement was out of date and some of the truckshave no heat or air conditioner and considering the nature of the job, thats pathetic"
bad,"Was once a good job to work but a new boss man of everybody started and everything just went down hill. The manager started hiring anybody who came threw the door, and never paid a visit to the warehouse to tell me and my coworkers good job. That little bit in my opinion is what made you want to work harder."
bad,very very poor management and training .company allows realationships with other employees married or not seen this happen and led to divorce.this was the rock hill sc plant
bad,The job was easy for me but i left because i felt targeted. Instead everything i do seemed to be not good enough or it just wasnt right so i decided to move on.
bad,"Management were absolutely distrusting displaying a poor culture representation"
bad,"PEPSI BAY TRUCK DELIVERY MERCHANDISER IS BASICALLY THE LOW MAN ON THE TOTTEM POLE JOB IN THIS TRUCKING INDUSTRY WITH A class A license. Be aware of your first 90 days there, they place you with about 3-4 guys to train you and depending on the person who trains you it's not easy at all !!! PHILADELPHIA northeast plant the managers are clueless on DOT regulations and does not care or want to hear why u can not get a stop done.. they favor the guys who are the fastest and being a new guy you will GET THROWN ON ANY ROUTE WITH THE MOST STOPS AND THE MOST PACKOUT PHARMACIES LIKE RITE AID CVS WALGREENS AND THE UNORGANIZED DOLLAR STORES.. after your 90 days you'll get paid commission and you have to bust your. Behind to get paid well. Usually have to work Saturdays to get a nice pay check with overtime. No help, barely able to take a break because of how many stops you have to get done within your 12 hours. The good thing about this job is the benefits and they give out free cases often to employees. I wouldn't recommend working here because other companies don't consider PEPSI being real experience driving their bay trucks! It's so many pay incentives that they don't really pay you for all of them, it's like you have to stay on top of payroll to get paid the money that you earned. WORKING AT PEPSI WAS ONE OF THE MOST STRESSED I EVER BEEN IN WITHIN A YEAR OF WORK. Your working in rain, snow no matter what ! THERE ARE NO AIR CONDITION IN THIER TRUCKS AND THIS IS A BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY WHO SAY THEY CARE ABOUT THE DRIVERS ' yea right ' ."
bad,"Not worth for the high caliber candidates. all they do is Jugad & a total mess."
bad,"Very fast paced, awesome co-workers who will always help, amazing benefits and great pay. Management needs to be investigated immediately."
bad,es una empresa universal solo que en esta ocacion el personal a cargo falla mucho en el sentido del apoyo en algunas situaciones con los jefes del departamento de las tiendas
bad,"that's all I have to say about that. its good pay and hard work. the benefits are good as well."
bad,"terrible management, very unprofessional, unqualified!, you're basically at war against them because you're Union, good pay but it's hard to advance/grow. In all it pays the bills but it's a job not a career. Goodluck if you do work for this dump and RIP to your back!"
bad,For one I was lied to in the interview about how many hours I was required to work and was told it would work in a 30 mile radius from my home.......complete BS. Compensation was good but I left a higher paying job because I was told my work load would be a 40 hr work week with 2 days off and turned out to be a lie. Unrealistic expectations did not allow you the time to diagnose and properly fix equip so you were constantly going behind somone on a call back because everyone was putting band aids on it to meet company requirements. I was being sent on jobs without a fully stocked truck even with my inventory was correct they would not replenish parts on my truck. You get sent to a call than have to go back and it puts you behind because they are to cheap to stock your truck correctly. They don't have a parts room so your at the mercy of there parts dept located in another state mail them to you . If  your not a family man and want a ton of hours than this is your job but beware of the BS you have to put up with
bad,Warehouse was rundown and company did not do anything to fix it.
bad,"Co-workers are great,management team is terrible, inexperienced and very two faced, lie to you straight to your face. they do the typical employee bbq,all BS. very unorganized company from top to bottom.Pay is good but no homelife. i have seen better management at burger-king.."
bad,"good guys to work with, learned a lot over the 40 yrs I was there"
bad,St Louis was a good place to work until new managment came in Feb 2012. It is all who you know not who is most qualified for the position. Moral is terrible because they manage you in fear of loosing your job
bad,Consistantly Short Handed
bad,It sucks when you have been waiting for 3 months to get hired and once your hired 45 days later your fired. From the get go after I was hired 2 days later I had to stop work because it took them more than 30 days to actually hire me in which I had to take another drug test and wait a week for the results to come back to work. Overall had some good workers there but management had there favorites...manager did houdini acts as well. Did not expect to get canned but that what you get when your not in with management.
bad,This company will work you to death and take advantage of you little to no training very bad equipment old and broken the pay is good the benefits are good but the rest is bad
bad,Great job if you like 12-17 hour shifts on scheduled 8 hour days and getting forced in on your days off which you don’t find out until halfway through the shift the day before which means never getting to see your family and forget about making any appointments or running errands. Warehouse supervisor likes to target and bully people while not doing his own job and forces it on others. I do not recommend this job to anyone.
bad,They don't give their associates enough time to do their job safely I feel it's a rush rush rush place and they are quick to terminate unemployment once a mistake is made do to the rushing.
bad,"The pay and benefits are good if you are full time. They also offer/require lots of overtime. Other than that there isn’t much good to say. You will be working every weekend and holiday. People will try to get you to come in of off days as well. Day started at 6 am and I would never know what time I would be off. I was scheduled off at 230 but would get stuck till 6 or even later with no notice. How can you plan childcare or any type of life when you have no idea when you will get off? Also the the work is very hard. Not difficult just labor intensive. On an average day I would have to unload 15 pallets of merchandise on to carts, take the carts to fill the floor then bring the extra to the back and organize. Each pallet has 200 cases and that’s if it’s 12 packs. If it were 6 packs or bottles it would be more. I am relatively young and in decent shape and needed a back and wrist brace after working there for a couple months."
bad,"My resignation was due to experiencing multiple reorganization, multiple yearly layoffs year after year over a decade of service.  In summary, it just takes a toll and simply couldn’t stand by and wonder if or when I’d be next to go."
bad,If your in the click you're good. If not....I think you no the answer to that.  As long as you're into whatever it is the upper level is doing your good. If not toy wont be there long.
bad,"Absolutely loved my fellow employees on the night shift. Management was a nightmare and zero flexibility. The lack of safety in the workplace-- especially for students, was absurd. ""Do whatever you have to do to get the trucks out."""
bad,Working for PepsiCo there is no advancement with this organization. Very little culture and no minorities or women in management. Trying to move around with different branches of the company is very hard.
bad,pepsi was ok for the most part management makes it a difficult job to indure which makes a very high and intense turn over rate for them beyond that the pay was well but always could improve
bad,"Warehouse management is absolutely terrible here at our Twinsburg OH, location. I think some of our managers and supervisors are going to get fired pretty soon. As they should"
bad,"Pepsi company was alright, but management was weak via telephone, but worse was the store you'll work at will not treat you well at all and never care about your other responsibilities, only theirs at that store."
bad,"Management over fleet treat you as if though you are trying to rob the company blind. Management has no real world experience in a shop setting. They have never repaired vehicles for a living.  Constantly hassled while at work by fleet management. Will not be appreciated for the work you do. In a nutshell shell the workplace culture stinks. Best advice, stay away!"
bad,"PepsiCo preaches worklife balance but when managers email you at all hours and expect a quick reply that is not obviously what they preach. Very clicky, i.e. My team was a lot of Baylor alumni and the ones that were not were slowly moved out."
bad,"it is a good laid back job if u like fast pace environment. "
bad,"Durante estes anos que passei pela Pepsico, aprendi várias coisas em relação ao mercado de trabalho e situações diversas."
bad,A racist place to work.  Not my chose of work company. Do not recommend this place.
bad,"respected sir this was a cricket tournament, which PCB had organized in 2003,2004.this was a great platform for the school boys to show there talents to PCB, and get a chance to play for PAK un19 team."
bad, this job is not for everone. terrible mgn. stacking in filling the stores with drinks.is the hardest part.
bad,Overall ok Supervisors nogood co-worker are lazy the best part is the pay check but they treat you like trash .driver get treated great with good pay warehouse not so much
bad,There's lot of money in the trough but it tasted like it.  Managers are as mindless as their consumers craving their precious diet pepsi and energy drink.
bad,This job is physical the hours are long and you work on weekends. You work around different people everyday. Come to work and be on time. Opportunity to work overtime
bad,Work 60+ hours a week want you to run all day and don’t care about hos this place is the worst place I’ve ever worked for all they care about is getting product out
bad,"I was hired as a night driver. Went for an interview and and when they ran my background everything came back clear, after almost a month working there they started sending me home for some issues they had with my application that they didn’t caught after been hired with them."
bad,"En el trabajo se hacían ,negociaciones ,acomodo, limpieza, saneamientos de Inventarios."
bad,I worked for this company recently. I was a builder. It was cool for a minute. Then there were many..many days of working 13 plus hours on a regular basis. The pay is good. But is it worth not having a life? It may be for some. But not me.
bad,Got hired 3 weeks ago did my drug test and background check was told I passed I did the orientation and 4 days before I was suppose to start I got a cal from the supervisor saying they were pushing my start date back and then after that I never heard from Pepsi again i called and asked what was going on and never got any answers just we’ll call you now I am unemployed because I left my old job to come to this one and I never even got paid for the orientation thanks Pepsi
bad,"the work place was very high paced and was very cut throat. When went to address managers about issues ,issues were just blown off . this company did a lot of things under the table that were not right."
bad,Goof place to work if you have no family. Management does not allow time off in case of emergency the job expects you to always plan ahead even for things not expected.
bad,"If you live in Oklahoma, I would high advise you to look for a different opportunity. The management here is awful and none of the managers are on the same page as the other manager. I ended up quitting this place for harassment from a manager, which I'm contacting a attorney about."
bad,"You will be working 12 to 17 hours a day even though they tell you you cant work more than 14 in a day. Mostly everybody that does this job suffers some kind of injury. All their equipment is garbage. The trucks are all old and dirty A/C doesn't work in half of them and they are full of roaches. Nobody likes working there, except for the people that been there over a year. Everybody else is searching for something better."
bad,"Jobs require a lot of driving ,surrounded by an environment that requires lots of labor and customer service. The competitive part is the hours that are require on your behalf of each route. Work 6days a week , with and average of 75 to 80 hours a week."
bad,it was an okay. No matter what you done if the customer was right or wrong if they did not want you in the store you were automatically terminated.
bad,los trabajos de los compañeros es salir adelante echarle ganas a las metas pero no sirve de nada ya que esto no permite que ganemos nosotros si no ellos
bad,"i was doing other peoples job, did really understand the job duties, manger couldn't explain how to do the job either"
bad,very long hours learned about the beverage industry poor management great co workers very long hours no home life leaving
bad,"Pepsi is a good company to work for , except the people that run that plant have relatives and there is a lot of favoritism."
bad,"Atualmente a empresa perdeu credibilidade, funcionários desmotivados"
bad,Working for Pepsi  /  Gatorade  You have no  Life always working The equipment is terrible always crying about production but they won't fix the equipment Worst place ever to work.
bad,I was full time and had to go part time due to back injuries but management could have found something else to place me at other then laying me off telling me their was no more work. It was a sad day for me newville managment needs to do better instead of just getting rid of a person quickly I feel as tho something else could have been done.
bad,I've worked for Pepsi for over five years and it's torture. The only thing good is the money and the benefits. Very bad equipment and management. NO EXAGGERATION
bad,Scheduling and organizing the quality department of the plant. New management was trying to come together as a team but not on the same page.
bad,"-Formation beaucoup trop insuffisante."
bad,"It was a Bad bad bad experience, very unpleasant. I hated it there honestly. I mean who wouldn’t? With a very dishonest rude boss. That’s all I have to say."
bad,They encourage and defends unsafe environments they don’t care until something happens they have no consideration for employees management don’t want to do nothing or should I say they job in depth and the company defends perverts
bad,"physical job must be at location at 6a they track your every move with smartphone stocking shelves at Walmart, Kroger etc. mileage pay 0.58 from location A to B"
bad,"Pepsico trước 2012 chỉ là cty gia đình, đặc biệt phòng bán hàng A77 Bạch đằng, chỉ toàn là COCC (con ông cháu cha...dây mơ rễ má) vì tôi là nv đã từng công tác 9 năm ở đây"
bad,"Excelentes beneficios,equilibrio vida laboral/profesional, sueldos competitivos."
bad,It was an okay opportunity coming with little cdl driving experience. Everything was running smoothly until I got hurt and then the real fun began. I was treated very different by management and once I was able to work full duty I was written up for nonsense things that otherwise they would ignore if you did all your stops. Un safe environment and they don't care for trucks. Don't get hurt or work hurt you will.
bad,"Unexperienced manager ( district sales manager ) , very rude and don’t know nothing at all . He’s always on point but your not , never worked as a salesman is his life so i don’t know how he got to be a SALES DISTRICT MANAGER ."
bad,"Don't bother applying with Pepsi, unless you have someone there to pull up your application, so corrupt recruiters and managers, save your time and efforts"
bad,4 to 12 shift. Job was stressful. know boss on that shift. Was supposed to get training and wasn't getting any. If ran properly the job would be good.
bad,Just wasn't what i expected.and you go on different shifts same week with little notice.I would like to thank rhwm for a chance and the oppurtunity to work there.
bad,"This was the most stressful job i have ever held.  Manager was to busy trying to be your friend, instead of doing his job.  Co-workers were very lazy."
bad,It’s 3 weeks of training equipment is old it’s back breaking for so little pay and overtime is not time and a half it’s some chinese overtime they do it’s a abuse carry 500 cases then pack them out into stores by hand
bad,"hours were far too long, and the work was far too physical for the compensation. We were required to sell the product, as well as merchandise the pallets of product we brought in. it was an average of 12 to 14 hours a day."
bad,not a good place to work. a lot of people got hurt. poor working conditions and poor management. felt like my job was constantly on the line. everyone around me was tired of working there.
bad,"Uma Empresa Boa de se Trabalha,Otimo Relacionamento Com Funcionario"
bad,Pepsi doesn't follow the union contract. The Pepsi union bows down to what Pepsi wants the union is no good at least it is that way at the Twinsburg location.
bad,"Always on your feet, was not paid for first three days talked to multiple supervisors about missing hours on my check, no help. ended up quiting after 2 months,  gotta enjoy counting for 12 hours straight"
bad,"I absolutely loves the money pay, and the benefits, but the strenuous labor of lifting and working out for like ten hours a days really sucked. I am done yet!"
bad,"normally the day is usually fast past thus making one to learn that time is of essence in that organization,the workplace culture is to accommodate everyone,the hardest part is beating deadlines which at times pressures the employees,the most enjoyable part is the freebies that workers are given every weekends."
bad,"Poor work life balance"
bad,"If you like being driven to the point of insanity, not given credit for anything you do, being talked down to by Management, being treated poorly then this jobs for you!!"
bad,It started off a great job but then workers became very unappreciated. Nothing anyone did was right or good enough. Management never gave compliments always complaints .
bad,"I disliked the fact that we always had to take a lunch to work and had to clock out but we could not leave the building to get lunch, that was the only con about this job."
bad,"I don't have anything good to say about this company or its management. highly disorganized, work life balance is terrible. the EOC should look into their practice of handling employee issues or complaints."
bad,"Rude, un-coordinated supervisors"
bad,"Pepsi was not the right fit with me. Too much was asked of me as an already swamped employee. I was expected to be a trainer, which was not my job and took away from my own work. I would not go back there."
bad,"Aunque el ambiente de trabajo entre colegas de grupo pepsico, es ameno, las jornadas laborales son muy extensas y el sueldo muy bajo, además de que nuestros supervisores son prepotentes sin consideración, lo que es deprimente ya que es una excelente empresa."
bad,Do not work here. No matter what you do it is not worth it they have no respect for their employees. Their turnover rate is ridiculous they simply treat employees as numbers and nothing else. To this day I still have back problems from working there. Seriously never work there.
bad,"It was a good job but there was no direction and Citrix XenApp servers were farmed out to another company and it was impossible to maintain security,"
bad,"good place to work at , learned about time management, great people, good management, hardest part was the parking lot not a lot of room for all the trucks"
bad,They will give you your schedule after you passed the interview and makes you think that you already had the job. Though you still have to make it through the physical they and if you fail..... Everything will be gone. GONE. Without any considerations
bad,I enjoy working with the people at Pepsi. I've been there almost 2 years now.  I keep very busy checking in the trucks doing inventory putting product away and loading product on the trucks.
bad,"order and organize merchandise, build display for monthly promotions, process orders from merchants, sale products, check inventory on shelves"
bad,"a very bad place to work with no help at all, very high in turn over"
bad,stay away if you have a choice. company does not respect employees time away fro job
bad,Worked from daylight to dark on a route delivering and stocking goods.
bad,I would Go from store to store selling. I would start my day around 4am
bad,Not a great place to work. Typical day includes driving truck to different locations delivering product to various customers.
bad,no siempre el mejor obtiene las promociones para mejores puestos devido  la falta de apoyo de los supervisores
bad,I worked as a bay delivery driver  out of the Orlando branch.The hours was long and the pay was very minimal(usually you can average 650.00 a week after taxes)working 60 hrs per week.On top of that you have to pull orders from the bay truck in pouring down rain and then go inside to deal with annoying store managers.I would not recommend anyone here.
bad,"Good company to work for, bad thing is no days off, great products and great people fun place to work."
bad,"High demand, high stress environment with minimal management support. High employee turnover rate with very little time allotted for proper training. Very little employee moral."
bad,pepsi was agood job but they are short staffed  allthe time but they do pay you good plenty of overtime and all of that they have good benefits and they have agood 401 k plan pepsi management is great two but don't get hurt or you will pay the price for it they will try to make you work outside of your limitations
bad,công ty làm việc ở môi trường chuyên nghiệp học hỏi được nhiều kinh nghiệm trong kinh doanh và nghề thị trường
bad,Fue el mejor trabajo que tuve uno de los mejores lugares para trabajar
bad,Ser mejor día con dia para superarme en la vida  diaria
bad,Stresli iş yoğun tempolu..........         Gfgggvvv
bad,The job over all was okay could use a lot better people to run the place an honestly none that walks in that place is satisfied at all coming from experience I worked there almost a year an felt like more of a slave but that’s just me
bad,"Sure they train and pay for your CDL, but then they OWN you, for 6 months anyway. Never been paid so little for so much work. The owners are delusional, typical millionaires don't give a hoot about the people making them rich. Do not work here. Made some good friends, though."
bad,Very poor environment to work for. With little advancement in a cut throat culture! Work you to death with no appreciation! Enjoyed my time working with the teams.
bad,"vending technician was the best job I ever had.  "
bad,"I used to be an employee for PepsiCo as a Merchandiser, and besides the poor management and lack of employees it has the potential to be a good workplace. I for one had a bad experience after over a year of employment. I was told to drive upwards of almost 100 miles out of my jurisdiction with my personal vehicle at least 3 times out of the week because of lack of employment. And I was also told to wait 2 years for full time while 3-4 employees that started after me got full time no problem with only 2 months of work. So overall I recommend not working here."
bad,Buen compañerismo y buen ambiente laboral. Lo único malo fue al despedirnos despues de 8 años a toda la plantilla sin opción de reubicarnos
bad,"Um funcionário que se entrega totalmente as suas funções atribuídas, dedicado,  proativo responsável, comprometido."
bad,"Crié él área de RH, en land produce, trabaje con presupuesto e indicadores de éxito, reuniones de avances semanales, dirigí él área de la dirección operativa tanto en Sinaloa como el ensenada BC., contactos con contratistas de mano de obra foránea, puebla, Veracruz, san luis, hidalgo, Chiapas"
bad,Mal por el poco salario y la exigencia mucha y absorvia bastante tiempo
bad,go in to works hear from supervisor about what do for the day and start taken out food items from boxes ans doping them on the table and repeat the table
bad,management no qualified for position the never treat anyone as equals late on payments didn't care about bodily injuries or getting people back on time
bad,"I am a former employee of this company and if you want to have no life and bad health this is the place for you."
bad,"As Merchandiser at PepsiCo the management and communication was horrible.I was new to the team so i was and I had to keep calling the supervisor and ask when, where, and what time do I come to work. I had no idea how long I would be training. I had to go all the way to Indianapolis for orientation and the other half was in South Bend and they both had the same material. You thinking that with PepsiCo being major corporation that you wouldn't be track your own time on paper still. Only thing that was good it the start off pay."
bad,It was a big company you were not treated very well by the management staff as well as the other employees long hours split shifts not a steady work schedule every week I was starting and ending at different times it was extremely difficult to plan things
bad,Pepsi Co is a great company but pepsi mid America is rough. You do the work of three people and get paid for one. you would work 60+ hours a week and would get in trouble for working OT by the manager.
bad,No hay muy bien ambiente laboral y no hay oportunidad de crecimiento.
bad,My onsite manager was very disrespectful and did not answer her phone when I would call with questions or information regarding my job.
bad,"There is no typical work day at Pepsi, there is alway a fire to be put out."
bad,This job I  was looking forward to for a long time. It took a month and a half for the whole process.  And the start time is 330 am.that's only the beginning my trainer did not train just expected me to know everything. It was my first day. If you are going to do this job take a lot of aspirin everyday because your back is going to kill you good luck
bad,"company is not properly supervised & functioned, inferior lack of hardship is created due to inferior ship , no change is done with time, no support of seniors."
bad,"My first week, there I was pretty much the cleaning crew or whatever they needed you to do at the time. I made banners for the sales people, and even mowed the company lawn. Then they threw me into merchandising and was kinda all over the place until they transferred the merchadiser that was working in my hometown walmart."
bad,"To many long hours, and no proper reveiw for advancement...."
bad,"Well my day starts very early about 5am. And I finish around 7pm or later Monday thru Friday. What ive learned from this job is if your not a healthy/ fit person you will not be able to do this job and another important thing is you have to have alot of patience with dealing with problem solving and customers that might be having a bad day. My co-workers are team players when it comes down to a fellow driver needing help with your route. I would have to say the hardest part of this job is the hot days of summer. My most enjoyable part of this job is enter acting with all sorts of personalities, and ofcourse pay day."
bad,I worked at the Mt Vernon one or about a year loved doing what I did mostly but there where changes made to my route and almost 2 month telling them I could do my route fully they added a random point to fire me for not filling machines
bad,"The job it self isn’t that bad at all very labor intensive and long days. The micro management from the transportation supervisor is very overwhelming, (Lansing terminal) after serving in the armed forces I figured I had worked with the most rough of men. And women that are out there, boy was I wrong!"
bad,"No structure, no work life balance, management completely disrespectful. Adequate training not provided. Limited support. No transparency or honesty from management."
bad,"Detrimental decision on my part to both pursue and take this job. Not suitable position for someone with a family. Work/life balance gets thrown completely off, and morale in the environment is extremely poor. Only those in management and the drivers seem to enjoy working conditions."
bad,I would not waste my time you will regret you did.  They care nothing for the people. It is not customer service based as it should be to give true assistance to the customers calling in. There is much favoritism there.
bad,All you basically did was work and sleep. No time for your family or friends. They say in interview that you’ll work 4:30-12 or 1 NOT!!!!! You’ll get off work anywhere between 4:30am-7am. And you’ll also be working at least one of ur days off so be prepared. But The pay is great!
bad,"Racist management "
bad,"merchandise stores in Soldotna, AK. Stocked all the shelves in the stores, along with cleaning, putting together and taking down displays, and rotating dates on the shelves as well as the warehouse in the stores.I Learned to work under pressure in a timely manner. There wasnt really anything that was hard about the job. There was never enough work to finish a full 8 hour shift."
bad,Pepsi has a high turnover rate. It’s basically a revolving door. You’re constantly overwhelmed with problems that should be handled by a manager. Poor management and lack of communication adds to employee frustration. Pepsi is not a place to grow and work long term.
bad,No work life balance even with the flexible productivity that is preached.  Company continues to go through change but has lost sight of its core mission and priorities.
bad,"I did not enjoy working there, but it was not because of the people there. they expected too much without the adequate training. and the description they gave of the job in the office was a 180 compared to what it really was."
bad,"I was temporarily employed there, so there were no perks. I didn’t like working there only due to the fact I was temporary. I felt there was no room for growth. Only for the people that were already there. Letting go the people that were temporary."
bad,not only the manager the the employees try to get u put out. I travel over a hour to work and have to deal with bs. over half the staff want to leave.
bad,Upper management does not care about Supervisors hours or days off. They will force you to work as often as every other weekend for 12 hour shifts with no incentive or comp days. They will force you to work extra shifts during the week and they still get their weekends off. When you request a vacation day they ask you to find someone to cover for your vacation. we have gone through over 75 Supervisors in the last 4 years.
bad,No work life balance. Expected to stay late and take no lunch. Employee moral is at an all time low. Management is manipulative and ignores need to hire additional employees. Overworked and underpaid.
bad,if you like a lot of driving and long hours . low pay no real benefits you work .daylight to dark.your always on the move. never letting up till your back at the plant.
bad,"They change there mind day to day. I was told this was 6 months to hire position. This seems to be how they work.  When you get to the end of the 6 months they say they never said that.They have 100's of people they have done this too. Therefore, not a happy environment."
bad,"absolutely no work life balance-13 days on 1 off. mostly 12 hour shifts, only 2 days off per month, management is horrible and implements unfunctionable ideas"
bad,I feel like I wasted my time and energy here. More was taken from me than I gained. He supervisor definitely had his favorites. I feel like I was simply a worker and not viewed as an individual who strived for excellence. Working long hours with few breaks and no cellphone use put a damper on my social life which led me to make the decision to quit this job.
bad,Salario muy por debajo de lo q ofrece el mercado en lo q se refiere a operador de apilador electrico y grua horquilla
bad,Empresa muito boa pra trabalhar bem localizada e fácil asseso manuseio de salgados  da Helias chips.
bad,Every job/career you choose is not for everyone.. this job pays very minimum for the work that has to be delivered.  There are no second chances if you failed to meet the job requirements for the objectives.
bad,"Get screamed at in front of customers, poor work ethics. Yells at u at the back of the warehouse. If u get trained over there get ready to get harassed. Made a complaint n got laid off good luck."
bad,"Long hours and poor poor management, as well as a weak training program."
bad,el ambiente que se tiene es bueno solo falta mejorar en las promociones para un puesto mas a escalar
bad,"Hard working fast pace with Managements focus is only on the"
bad,"el tiempo para almorzar solo duraba 15 min,era un lugar sucio,de malos tratos etc. (lo peor)"
bad,Not a very good place to work at. Management have their favorites. No communication between upper management and workers.
bad,back to back calls- over 170 per day either taking orders answering customer requesting and or repair issues. Numbers to hit for bonus. Written and verbal warnings for not hitting numbers.
bad,working with pepsi was the worst years of my life... there was no being able to plan ahead to do anything with my family because everytime I had a day off I either got called in or at the last minute the schedule was changed so I had to work on the day I was scheduled off which eventually ended up destroying my marriage. I ended up losing my job while I was in the hospital fighting for my life I attempted to sue them for wrongful termination but couldn't get a lawyer that would take the case because theyre too big of a company.
bad,"La verdad una empresa mundial mente reconocida, pero en el puesto que yo estaba (llenado de garrafon)la verdad muy malo. tu sueldo a la semana es de 750 pesos, de los cuales 250 pesos son bono de puntualidad y asistencia si llegas 5 minutos tarde o faltas un dia por X razón tu cheque te llega de 500 pesos,otra, que en el turno nocturno no pagan prima nocturna, aparte de que trabajas en sabado en la noche y sales en domino en la mañana y no pagan lo que deveria ser del domingo,  otra de las cosas que me di cuenta estando ahí, es que prefieren contratar gente de fuera a puestos un poquito mejores que el de llenado de garrafon, que promover a la misma gente que ya tienen trabajando ahi, otra no te dan uniformes si no hasta que tienes tu planta, y llegan creo que cada 6 meses osea que mientras no tengas planta te acabaras tus botas jejej amenos de que compres unas por fuera... saludos"
bad,I worked there on the summer night shift loading trucks working 12 hour shifts. The work/life balance was terrible. Most of the management and employees were not very nice and professional at all. The work output to compensation is not worth the effort and suffering. Unless your desperate run away!
bad,"I'm one of few females in this industry and I work 10x harder than most of my male co-workers yet i don't get the same advancement opportunities as them. It's like I work at the ""he man woman haters club."""
bad,"Work days are 5am - 5pm. Beverage industry is very competitive. Local distributor here that is not flexible in pricing or customer acquisition, Hard working young staff. Best part of this work enviironment is the people, both customers and on the ground staff."
bad,"em um dia tipico, era feito a descarga da carreta, apos isso, a separação de aproximadamente 20 pedidos de clientes e vendedores, recolhimento dos pallets, contagem de estoque e o encerramento do dia."
bad,very bad company bad managment poor pay for the work great place get cdl and run.
bad,"Long days whee dispatcher called you all day, to take you off your route, cause they promised something they could not deliver on, so they make you scape goat. Never see your coworkers or family."
bad,"When I worked at Pepsi in NY the average tenure of a position was six months, and work hours and performance requirements were oppressive."
bad,"I was driving there trucks due to the amount of driving and not being all9wed to stop and walk around my legs started to swell they told me that i was not aloud to speak about this but they can stickit, because of this job it mad me become over weight i was never like this and they never took care of me, just another company that trys to say it cares and really does not"
bad,Not good for health the continental shift even by U.K. standards no care for the employees wellbeing only numbers management lack the skills and knowledgeskills
bad,"Worked as a driver for 2 years, D- Bay. Typical day is 8-10 hours, depending how fast you are. $ is not enough to sacrifice your physical health. No promotions worth staying! O.T. $ explanation??"
bad,"Dysfunctional management. The most enjoyable part about Pepsi was getting off work. They have no leadership in roles that would have you excel, if the leadership was better. Everyone for themselves at PepsiCo. Stone Mountain location"
bad,"Prepare to work all night, hours were long, always understaffed, have to keep a pace so high its only a matter of time before you get hurt. Constantly rushing to make numbers."
bad,Management was terrible. You worked from sun up to sun down. Lack of communication.  They expected you to be all about them. No family time. It was like driving over the road.
bad,"Starting pay is  not worth the amount of work that is expected. Poor communication from management. They stress team work is a big key to success but it only goes one way. ""Favors"" asked from management aren't ever returned. I hoped this job would be the start of a long term career, sadly, it wasnt."
bad,Back breaking work. Good pay. But you'll be to tired to spend it. Plus Force ins. On your day off. Super physical and hot warehouse has no ac. Poor equipment. Managers don't care about you just want you to throw cases. Lil Room for advancement especially for minorities
bad,"In my position I was responsible for training almost every week. Was advanced one time, but then moved back to starting position due to the fact that they needed someone with experience; which would have been fine if paid more, but was not. Did not receive raises on a timely basis. I had nine different bosses in the time I was there. Some managers are really good at helping you, but most want you to do work on your own. Had some good friends while there. Lot of sitting and entering in information on computer."
bad,This is a poor company. The pay was not consistent. They will pay by the load for the day not hourly. They would take forever to get u ur own route so you are constantly doing somebody elses route. So it takes longer. And they want you to b a driver a 100% touch freight. So u have to unload the product and stock it. Yes merchandiser. Just very bad experience.
bad,Unrealistic expectations and no real management doing anything about problems between sales and merch “teams” but it’s every man for themselves. Sad cause it could be a great place to work.
bad,I don’t recommend to work there if you love your family and you don’t like to wake up at 3:00amevery morning and you work weekends lots and lots of work excepted of you
bad,"After you get your time in, you get paid decent, but it felt like they were tryin to fire you as soon as you were hired. Management constantly ""looks down "" at the employees. Sets up a confrontational work environment"
bad,"I hate bad management and job insecurity. My manager was not even technically sound and don't even know how to execute any project. He might have not worked in MNC sector. "
bad,"The company demands a lot from all of its team members.  If you are willing to give a lot, there is room for advancement.  It is also a competitive place to work.  The culture does make for competing against peers, and other departments."
bad,"Day starts at 3:30 AM and depending on the day you will be working 10 - 15 hours, covering anywhere from 3 - 5 stores by yourself. Expect to work through 6 - 15 pallets of soda each day, including pulling pallets, stocking, and condensing them to fit in the small amount of space each store delegates for Pepsi. The only break you will get during the day is in your car, riding to the next store you service. "
bad,This is a very demanding culture. You will often be short staffed leaving you in charge of your management responsibilities while running route 3-4 days weekly. Zero work life balance. Be prepared for 12 hour days as the norm.
bad,get used to being a tool. You will only get a promotion if you own some knee pads. Management is completely ignorant of what happens in the trade. held to unrealistic standards.
bad,"benifits bad"
bad,"Merchandisers were basically the bottom of the barrel. The district/ region, whatever, lost more money than what they made and had to cut somewhere to compensate, and they chose us. They took our paid sick days away from us and put us on a fixed schedule. You couldn’t even request a Saturday off cause there would be no one to work it. And if you call out sick, you don’t get paid for it, just a write up. Management turned our 1 week vacation to only 5 days and added our supposed sick time for the other two days. And working behind lazy sales reps isn’t so fun either.  Sooooo, yeah, pay is good, so are benefits, but management is sheisty and merchandisers are treated unfair."
bad,"Used to be a good place to work but over the years with different management changes it changed. There is no work life balance. "
bad,"It's a job someone has to do it"
bad,Much better jobs available. To many hours and not enough support. No work/life balance available. Management had high turnover because they had an impossible job.
bad,Management changes frequently to new personal that has never done the job and therefore doesn't exactly know how my job works or functions. Sales and management frequently clash and the frontline workers get stuck in the middle.
bad,Very physical job but good exposure in understanding how much a single individual can accomplish with minimal (if any) support of development.  Internal politics were very prevalent here and job performance/continuity was overlooked when promotional opportunities came about.
bad,Mismanaged organization in an economincally challenged area due to governmental regulations.  Constant rotation in management does not allow for goals to be achieved.
bad,Fast pace hard work low pay long hours no loyalty from the company luckily they have a union to look out for the welfare and treatment of the workers when a issue arises
bad,"management only cares about the numbers..to many yes man employees. always brown nosing to get ahead. backstabbers really. leadership is at a minimum, expects you to be loyal but shows no trust in you."
bad,"The pay is not competitive to the market for similar or same position. The demand for performance is extremely high to barely able to accomplish at a succeeding rate, rather than a average or below average rate. The inclement weather demand are extreme. This location prides itself on not closing the building since 1993. With that said show up to work no matter the weather conditions"
bad,"Horrible place to work, Managers suck and wouldn't recommend anyone work there. Benefits are descent, hours are long. the pay is pretty good but the work life balance is below standard."
bad,Stressful work conditions due to improper management. Over load work with no help. Company vehicles needs improvement and upgrades. Work environment stressful and hazardous at times.
bad,bad place to have a career they use their employees for their own benefit and have no regard for your life what so ever they lied about my promotion over and over and require you to use your own vehicle to travel store to store and don't pay you from your house for mileage part time employees don't receive benefits or time off and there is no time guidelines on how long you can be a part time employee.
bad,no work life balance as a bcr. pay is decent and develop experience for entry level. micromanagement is an issue and although you work 12-14hr days the company expects and demands more out of its employees
bad,"My main issue was the management,  job was never secure. Horrible schedule as well work as a part timer but worked full time hours with no benefits. No vacation time, no sick days nothing what so ever"
bad,"Very long days, no help, over worked"
bad,PepsiCo does not place a high value on it's human capital. The compensation plan is horrible and salaried team members are expected to work 12 - 15 hour days 5 or 6 days per week. IT causes burn out very quicjly
bad,"Very hard culture to thrive in. Everything is about the results and it doesn't matter how you get them or who you run over to get them. I have never had such little support from my direct supervisor in my life and human resources was there to put up more roadblocks for you than anything. You were expected to run full plant operations and do ad-hoc projects on the side regardless of how much overtime you needed to do to accomplish them. There was no such thing as Work/Life balance, they expected that work was your life."
bad,Management doesn't back their employees. Ask to do work 12+ hours in situations that you couldn't be successful. NO room to grow or advancment. Wouldn't tell a friend to work with this company.
bad,This is a fast-paced job in which as a merchandiser you a the middle man between store management the sales rep and your manager. Not the best company to work for as hours can be long and they demand a lot for a little.
bad,If you dont mind working hard while others slack this job is for you. Going in at 2 and dont know what time you get off really did suck. They know the problems inside the wearhouse but do nothing about it . I would not recommend this job to anyone
bad,I was hired as a seasonal merchandiser. Worked long hours. up to 14 hours a day. Treated poorly by management. Was eventually let go after summer ended with short notice.
bad,"Worked there a long time ago, but it was brutal.  Terrible pay, and management was awful.  Always worked holidays.  Low pay, and average benefits.  Free soda was the best perk."
bad,"When I first started the job was amazing. Over the past 15 years or so I've been promoted several times yet I still make what I was making back when I started. "
bad,No work life/balance. Work 6 days a week over 10 hrs a day. Management has no clue. Some workers do all the work while others do none
bad,"management is a joke, every department has had over 3 different managers in the past year. No one ever tells you what to actually do in your job, they send you off and say go work they don't tell you where or anything, then get mad when you don't go somewhere they wanted you to go. There is no communication what so ever between managers and employees."
bad,I worked as accountant for this company for a long time and pay was horrible for the amount of work they give you to do. Management never takes responsibility for their decisions. I got written up for a decision they made while I was vacation. After I got back I told them how this was going to effect them down the line and they ignored me until it actually happened. Then it was my fault.
bad,Days are filled with balance of internal and external investigations.  Upper management is not open to change or open door policy.
bad,Work through a temp employment service so I felt that no one wanted to invest any quality time in the training of myself and others like me.
bad,nothing good to say lots of racism in workplace management and employees. Not for minorities nothing else to say will not work for this company again
bad,"go in grab work orders then grab equipment need for the day but never know where will be , could trust anyone of the co workers really if you knew someone that was a wrap management was horrible  i was with my first kid and two months late laid me off i enjoy the most beautiful venues for weddings"
bad,"company started going south with new management. Customer service is not a priority anymore and HR will side with upper management every time. Best advice, DO NOT work in the grand island Ne location. You will be over worked and under paid."
bad,good company to work for . Change is always constant in this company . Fairly built a great connect with sales team market customers inter dept and the management team
bad,"Coworkers (which are also union brothers) hold no sense of loyalty or privacy with one another. Every little thing that is wrong is reported to management which is not how a union is supposed to operate. The management will make you feel like everything is good and there are no problem then they will pull you into a stores parking lot and fire you. I do not recommend this job to anyone. If one person doesnt like you, they will find ways to get you terminated."
bad,"Worked there over 8 years and due to their change in the way they go to market.  Alll the sales reps that had been their a while with no degreee were ran off, written up, or just fired for any reason they could fine. There is small group and if you not in that group then you are exspendable!!!!! Management will stab you in the back and only looks out for what benefits them."
bad,"Loved my job when i started 16 years ago we where a family.Went down hill when they took away chain stores from drivers and gave us a bunch of gas stations to make up for the sales.routes got bigger paychecks got smaller.The turnover rate for employees went through the roof.Then they came up with computers telling a driver where to go at a specific time and order,and we where told to follow that no left  turns even if u pass a stop.Management had to follow these specs.Why such the high turnover rate.The best part of the job is if u keep your head down and work time flies by.The most enjoyable part of the job i had was working together with the salesman as a team to hit numbers build creative displays, and build the long standing friendships with the customers over the years.This is now a job for the entry level trucker they have all automatic trans trucks.But a ton of physical work! U can make good money just be ready for the hours  and lack of training!"
bad,"There is no real training. Basically your shown how to do the job once or twice then thrown out on your own and expected to do the job perfect. Management will follow you behind your back to check on you then criticize your work when you return to the warehouse. You are required to cover the salesman jobs (doing their job) when they don't care to do it, and if you don't do it. You get in trouble. The salesman are not held accountable for their responsibilities but you are required to do it. Required to work 50hr weeks every week, which your paid hourly but for what you do the pay is very low considering you have a CDL and your doing the job of 2-3 people. The job is very physically demanding and they provide no help like other local companies do."
bad,Management needs to stop doing reorgs. The organization can no longer sustain itself and is seeing a quick downhill spiral due to inexperienced individuals being placed in the wrong positions.
bad,"para mi fue una esperiencia muy bonita por que aprendi muchas cosas, con mis compañeros y jefe a pesar de ser contratado aprendi valores, aprendizaje, enseñanza y siempre dar de mi lo mejor sin mirar a quien y sin dejarme llevar por los demás . solo hacer mi trabajo con entusiasmo."
bad,"Maintenance, programming, troubleshooting and use of multiple production machines. Utilized forklift for stocking and loading of the shipping trucks."
bad,"If you are looking for extra money this is where to go. just be prepared to work your butt off for about 10-14 hrs on Saturday and Sunday. You will have no family time on weekends. When you get off all you will want to do is shower and sleep. But the weekly pay is awesome and earning an extra $800-1000 a month is great. Oh and they don't like approving days off either. And thats why management sucks. They talk to you like a dog. Always threatening your job, and isn't very friendly...The most enjoyable part of the job was putting on my headphones and getting to work."
bad,Management at this company is constantly looking for ways to harass its employees. Typical scenerios are to impliment rules that are illegal and give cause to legal action. They are not supportive of family obligations and have demonstrated hostility when confronted with OSHA requiremnts. They have minimal benefits and they dont increase after 2 yrs.
bad,"Pepsi is not a company that you want to work for, if you have family the benefits are mediocre and expensive. The location at which I worked for the management was horrible and incompetent. The location manager was dis-concerning. Employees calling in occurs often and do not look for help from management because they were already gone by the time the shift started. Its not uncommon to work 12 to 18 days during peek season."
bad,Start your day by checking loads before leaving the plant. I learned how become salesperson . The hardest thing about this jobs was working long hours for less pay. The best part was the free sodas.
bad,Well have a meeting and get our sheet for the day. The manager will tell us what’s going with the business and who’s productivity is low. We start picking and wish we were home everyday.
bad,"Management doesn't care or listen, they have favorites who get away with anything and you're told to worry about yourself. If you have a wife, gf, or kids forget about seeing them. Pay is good but getting a day off is an act of congress"
bad,"I had two good managers and a few bad ones. You could tell that the good ones had their hands tied. This translates to a terrible workplace culture. The company always comes first so when customer accounts are in the wrong, they assure you that they have your back, but they never do. I worked with a sales rep that was incompetent at their position and when I would report the lack of work output, nothing was ever done about it and was just asked to correct (the many) errors to appease account management. Therefore working twice as hard as anyone should have to. When I found out that I was going to be a father, I immediately filed my FMLA paperwork with management, giving them 6 months advanced notice, then reminded them two more times at the second and third trimester markers. When my wife went into labor, I called my manager that I was at the delivery ward and he responded by telling me that he didn’t have anyone to cover for me and that I needed to come into work. I expressed to him my dissatisfaction and told him that I gave him more than enough time to figure it out on his end and that I fulfilled my duties and even confirmed it with backend HR reps. He again told me that he didn’t have anyone to cover and then asked me ‘what am I supposed to do then?” I responded “ your the manager, figure it out, that’s your job isn’t it?” Ever since that day, that was supposed to be joyous and supportive, turned into resentment, anger, and frustration. I was then consistently retaliated against by that manger. I filed complaints to HR and nothing was ever done about it. I felt completely"
bad,"Pepsi only cares about its bottom-line that's the dollar, they alluded as though they care about the employees but they don't, they'll feed you when they have meetings, don't get sick or hurt in there because the only doctor you're going to see is there Doctor Who's going to put you on light duty no matter what the injury is. I would never ever work for them ever again."
bad,There is absolutely no work life balance.  Do expect to work 12 hr plus days at least 3 to 4 days a week. You'll work all holidays except Christmas ; this sacrifice is'nt well compensated for in pay. Your family will definitely take the back seat most of the time. Half of management are college recruits with little experience in industry and management; or in life in general.  Culture is horrible
bad,"The job it’self isn’t that bad at all very labor intensive and long days. The microomanagement from the transportation supervisor is very overwhelming, (Lansing terminal) after serving in the armed forces I figured I had worked with the most rough of men. And women that are out there, boy was I wrong! You show up everyday for work ant you for anything he thinks your doing wrong d listen to the manager scream"
bad,Don’t work here they keep promising things they never happen plus pay it’s not any good for what you do! What customer said you do no matter if it’s related to your work! Call supervisor and they will make u do it to satisfied customer but u won’t be getting paid for it! Over all the big bOss is a joke
bad,"Empresa totalmente sem gestores experientes, com isso adoece os colaboradores e cai a produção. Sem apoio e preocupação com segurança."
bad,"Management feed me fuel for 9 months with no benefits... horrible experience "
bad,Pays good .. Self motivated position but how to do the job changes everyday .. Not very much help from supervisors .. Its like there is to.many bosses not enough workers to just do the job
bad,Pepsi Co. can provide a large number of experiences and growth for those who truly seek it.  Managers on site (Warehouse and Transportation) will be working with Union based crew.  Expect to work no less than 10 hours per day and 12 hours plus during high level seasons.
bad,"Good news first, pay and benefits are decent. Health insurance is excellent and while pay and mileage are good, expect to work/drive 5-10 hours per week without any compensation."
bad,Management just let's people do what they want with no plan to even attempt to improve the overtime hours. You have no life if you work in the warehouse.
bad,This may not be everyone's experience but my experience at pepsi was awful. As a merchandiser I was assigned way more work then I could finished in the allotted time. I felted pressured to work off the clock. I kept me at just under 30 hours so they would not have to give me any benefits and never have make me full time. The store managers and receivers were impossible to deal with. Basically I would call it modern day slavery. They get sued for it all the time but they don't care
bad,They pay well if you work six 12 hour days but it's long hours and more physical labor than sales the job title should be account maintenance engineer commissions are slim and customer driven. in this area you are neglected by management if I could give zero stars to management I would and that's why I am leaving the company I wish the best to those who remain but more will leave before it gets better many of the salesmen left merchandising to get away from the merch management but he followed them up and continues his harrassment in his new job as SDL good luck to you if you give it a try
bad,A very poorly managed  company no direction that anyone could follow. All kinds of in fighting among st all upper management. NO single goal to follow
bad,"Poor managment, favoritism to certain employees not on quality of work but personal relationship. Manager in summer spent more time on golf course playing golf not building client relationship, then building relationships with clients or new clients."
bad,"Job seekers beware.  PepsiCo has received decent reviews as an employer on this site. However, Pepsi MidAmerica is entirely different. PMA is owned and operated by the Crisp family out of Marion, IL. They are non-union and do not pay as well as PepsiCo. The pay rates they promise are acheivable only if you have a huge route and work 10 or more hours per day. Commission positions are salaried and you will not receive overtime. They will payroll deduct you every chance they get and you will have to fight for weeks to get your money back. Females will never advance in the company without at least a bachelor's degree. Hard work is not appreciated by the company as a whole. If you are lucky enough to work from a depot that has good management, you might be able to have a long, enjoyable run with this company. If not, one or two years at best before you get tired of the nonsense."
bad,"The company only values seniority. So, for employees who dedicate themselves to their respective departments. You can find yourself training an company employee new to your department and after one year lose your shift to that employee because your skillset and abilities are not valued. Non skilled jobs(warehouse) is the way to process with this company and after 15yrs of non skilled work then transfer to the good paying skilled job like(feild Technicians) so you can leap frog established technicians even if you have no actual knowledge or experience in the new department. That's the Pepsi way!"
bad,"Se trabajan todos los días del año, respetan pocos días de los festivos, poca empatía por parte de los encargados de cada área, cargas laborales excesivas se pone en riesgo la integridad de los trabajadores."
bad,"You will be expected to go above and beyond with little to no "
bad,"Heb hier graag gewerkt maar je wordt belooft de kans te hebben om door te groeien, maar je groeit er niet door omwille van wat je kan maar omwille van wie je kent."
bad,"I spent just under a year and a half and the whole time i worked there I never worked under 57 hours a week and my job was still never safe. Your salary is based on so many factors that are not in your control. For example, If I sell product to the store then I need the commision for that sale the following week. However, if the warehouse doesnt build the product then i dont get paid. If a driver calls out, I dont get paid. If that product doesnt make it to the store, I dont get paid. This happens regularly and there is no answer for it within their company, yet all sales people walk around under constant pressure with little time for family."
bad,"Management was hardly out on the floor most days sitting in conference room. Hourly people running the show. No accountability, I brought things to there attention and nothing!!!"
bad,"The hardest part about working here is seeing all these ""leaders"" making decisions on whats best for the team. Maybe intead they should come down and see how an operation actually works."
bad,No tengo mucho que decir a cerca de esta empresa..
bad,"The amount per hour was really attractive but I should have taken heed to the reviews I read beforehand. I would strongly suggest you not work here unless you want to be treated as a nobody slave worker. They have no regards for you or your personal life. God forbid you get hurt on the job they try to find other ways to fire you. Very poor upper management. No family life balance, they have unrealistic goals for you to meet and no incentives."
bad,"This job is a good starting career for a young driver, looking for experience. The work is back breaking and hours are long depending on your route. The more seniority the better route."
bad,"Worse management and leadership I have ever experienced in my career.  Promotions based on quotas and politics, not credentials, tenure, experience and performance."
bad,long hard days and the managment was getting worst every year.  the only good thing was you were able to manage your work days you did not have a set schedule.
bad,upper management never understood the daily work and struggles for supervisors. Co-workers was great to work with once the dead weight was eliminated.
bad,"Buen ambiente lavoral."
bad,"not enough employees for the production rate asked of from management, Needed to tape fingers up in order not to develop blisters from picking up and moving bottles and the speed demanded. tape was not provided. I feel like I should have been"
bad,on a typical day I never see management or supervision.  The pay is good.  No cross training on any jobs.Do one job and that is it.  No opportunity do advance or go to day shift.
bad,"Heavy workload, 12-16 stops for 1 person and equipment was second hand, and scarce. Trucks were old and driven down, Demanded your everything and you received nothing in return"
bad,"Pepsi was a decent job, until politics get involved, or if someone doesn't like you for no reason it is a miserable place. Pay was great, home time wasnt much"
bad,"Company gives you some latitude to make your own decisions. No longer promotes talented people who know the business, they solely focus on campus hires as their future. Many business entities that used to run well and were quite profitable are now losing ground to both Coke and Cadbury (7up) at an alarming rate. Fort Wayne location has gone from having a 70% share of the market to parity with Coke and fading fast. Many of the employees with decades of experience and knowledge have been pushed out in favor of campus hires that lack the dedication and knowledge to succeed in this very competitive market."
bad,"Im fairly new to the company, but ive observed that alot of the older employees live close by and have got accustomed to the corporate stuff and deal with it, the management is alot younger than the seasoned vets that have been there and makes me wonder why they haven't promoted from within because the young management team are pretty much college kids with little to no experience whatsoever. As a manager you should be able to fill the empty spots as needed, but they cant or just wont, so they put it on the bottom tier employees to do it, and if you dont agree to overtime, they have a point system and you get penalized. Very long hours and no family time, substantially low pay for drivers ($16,  but Coke pays $21 go figure that one), max pay achieved after 3 yrs on the job ( but its only 5 more dollars than what Coke starts at. All this from a company that makes 64 billion annually and treats employees like nothing honestly."
bad,Union isnt on your side.   All good management has left.   No one tries to do their job.  Just hangout for 12 hours every day.  No time off always asking for more than 12 hours.  No incentives no bonuses.  Low pay than all other warehouse jobs like this one.
bad,Managers don’t care!!! Don’t help. Pay is descent but no life outside of work. They like to mandatory you to work 6 days a week. Favoritism at its finest. Shift is terrible and don’t get injured!
bad,"Underappreciated, current management is clueless on how to actually run the warehouse. Large amounts of favoritism. Most enjoyable part of the day is clocking out to go home for the day."
bad,While the company was called PBG it was a great company. I learned a lot. Advanced in position many times in my 30 years at PBG. learned how to manager a P+L. Learned how to negotiate customer and company contracts. Took what I learned and developed over 10'direct reports to larger positions within the company. However when PBG sold to Pepsico the culture at the company become toxic.
bad,"Basic order picking job using an electric pallet jack, except with nothing but beverages so the work is EXTREMELY PHYSICAL. HR is helpful when they arn't over loaded with work to see you. Warehouse supervisor's never performed the job themself's so you can imagine how the leadership and chain of command is. Starting out you will get put on ""2nd"" shift. 5:00pm - until work is done which wasn't before 3:00am every night, and in the summer its usually 5-7am 5 days a week, and you only get Saturday and either monday or tuesday off. so you will have no life and sleep all day on your days off anyways because you're tired and sore af."
bad,"Pepsi is an extremely hard place to work with the plant supervisors. Work is demanding with no compensation for a successful job. Put in many years of work and being pushed out the door for younger, less paid employees. Pepsi also only wants to have part time employees to not provide health care."
bad,Maybe the experience at our facility was an outlier. But I recommend not working for Pepsi unless you literally have no other options. Management is inept and a constantly revolving door. Training is basically non existent. Upper management/corporate culture is BS. Work life balance is terrible if you're in labor positions.
bad,"Really enjoyed working with the other people, management was a joke,there's not really a balance of home life and work life there were several times when I had to go home early because my son was sick and they wouldn't let me go"
bad,If you just want to stay in the same position and work until your back goes out it's not to bad. You make decent money but don't think for a minute they will pat you on the back for going above and beyond.
bad,"work hours varied, and it was unknown how little or how much work needed to be done in the day, before arriving. "
bad,Was a great place to work 25 plus years ago. No so much about the people that work there or the customers. More about numbers then what the customers want and need.
bad,"Pepsi kept taking things away from us. Lower pay than in L.A. for the same job. We were union so, Pepsi I guess took it out on us. Upper management just kept getting worse and worse!"
bad,"To many poilitics"
bad,"I drove tankers over the road, so when I got hired at pepsi it was suppose to be my blessing. I intended to marry the job. Little did I know, the company in louisiana was in peril. Management treat drivers like we were the enemy and we intentionally chosed to bring back stops and believed we were lazy. I delivered in new orleans, anyrhing can happen in nola -- me and another driver had a gun pulled on us for holding up traffic. Theres too many factors that control your day out of your control, management does not incorporate. The epxectation was unrealistic. Even the veterans were having a hard time completing stops. Company was disorganized and equipment didnt work. But give it a try, you may be the lucky one."
bad,Besides being stressed all the time if they would've gave me enough hours I really would've stayed but the fact that they didn't was one of the reasons of leaving
bad,Management and culture is horrible there. Employees play cut throat to get ahead of others. Supervisors don't listen to anything hourly employee have suggestions for even safety wise.
bad,You will start your day at 5 and wont be able to leave until work is done. Only problem is no one will know if you did your work or not and you have to take all the blame if someone says it isn't. No accountability whatsoever.
bad,Dont recommend any one work here very bad company to work for no future they treat people like animals hope i helped soneone from making a mistake and working here. I think they need to be investigated .they have people working 17 hours at a time in one day and people do it cause they are scared to lose there job. Please help these people labor board.!
bad,"I would not recommend Pepsi unless u have no family and only plan to be there for couple months. The supervisors all lack communication skills , they try to write u up all the time and if u get injured your scrude"
bad,"The management was only interested in what you could do for them. I had supervisors take my ideas which by policy we had to give to your immediate supervisor, and use them as their own. There was a lot of nepotism and when the supervisor's favorites made company violations, the management always turned their heads and ignored the violation. At the location I worked at the policy was, ""If you ain't White, you're not Right""."
bad,not that bad of a company to work for. just high turnover and subpar management. I would recommend this company for people just starting out in the work force but not for someone who is trying to balance everyday family life as the schedules are never set and some days demand over 15 hours of work.
bad,"Worked here for about 15 months. Work load is heavy but steady. No AC in trucks during the summer and little help offered when truck loads are over 500 cases. Very physical. You're expected to pack out 80% of your stops at 45 min minimum depending on stop and case count. If you are new, you don't make a lot. The workload and pay do not match. New management, brought in new problems and lack of cooperation and support from management."
bad,"Change in constant, the roles and responsibilities are always evolving and often not clearly defined. It's easy to feel inundated and overwhelmed with tasks that don't fall within your bucket of influence. Lack of resources leads to an on-going feeling of under-accomplishment and the local ""leadership"" team is pulled in too many directions to help coach or development new employees. Onboarding training is disorganized and weak at best. "
bad,"Frito Lay is a great company to work for in the beginning of your career. It provides you with a platform to learn and develop your management and sales skills. However, the work/life balance piece of the organization is almost non-existent. The hardest part of the job is definitely managing the expectation of hours with the responsibilities. There are many days where it feels like there is no support from upper management. I have gained more skills than I realize during my years at Frito, and they are skills that will be transferable to many other companies and marketplaces I want to explore in the future."
bad,PepsiCo has a bad culture of do what I say and not what I do.  Management cares more about there product than there people.  No room for growth within the company.
bad,"Don't go in expecting to rise up in the company.  The culture is awful where you are rewarded based upon attributes that have nothing to do with work.  They make promises that you will rise in the company if you have acquired at least a BA.  In reality they take college recruits and advance them past everyone else in the company, no matter how well they perform their job.  They teach their employees to not take any pride in their work and to just look out for themselves.  No incentive."
bad,no raises no overtime inless approved needs new managers and they are far from being family based company they dont care about u or your family or there other workers.......STEER CLEAR OF PESPI MIDAMERICA
bad,"I was with Pepsi for 10+ years and during that time I have seen the Company change dramatically. In 2011 PBG was purchased by Pepsi co. since then the company has changed its company culture from a ""work hard, play hard"" company to a ""all work and no play"" company. When we were acquired we lost about 2/3 of our admin staff and 50% of our management positions and our entire bottling plant was shut down,  which cost the jobs of over 20 people. They restructured pay for our sales representatives several times, not only were we making less, but hitting bonuses was virtually impossible. The work load has continually gone up as we are required to grow, by obtaining more accounts, yet no additional routes have been added from a sales or delivery perspective to help with additional work. For sales a 50 hr. work week is required with NO overtime, NO lunch and NO breaks. They track these hours with a ""scan in scan out"" process that they use to micromanage your route and question you if they find anything they consider to look wrong. They have eliminated any kind of fun and almost ALL recognition. We used to have nice Christmas parties every year, that was eliminated, we used to get tickets to games for our families, and our customers, that is extremely limited now. We used to get gift cards, incentives, Pepsi gear ect. for performance, now that is extremely limited and we are just required to grow or they show you the door. The job itself is fun, but because Pepsi has added so much work to the sales force, you are literally running all day and stressed out in order to get everything done"
bad,"Fast paced, not rewarding, upper management is clueless, work is never done and there are a lot of angry people who work here."
bad,"We would arrive early to trucks poorly kept. "
bad,"Required to be at the office 7am, you end @ 8pm monday to saturday. May work during sundays. "
bad,"Pepsi is cut throat and brutal. people throw each other under the bus every day to stay out of trouble. Lies from coworkers and management are the norm."
bad,great company...have a great job...free all uniforms and great benefits..nice and fun co workers..management has time for employees.
bad,It didnt make sense for the driver to have to merchandise when they have sales merchandisers to merchandise large and small format store but it paid the bills.I couldnt get jiggy with that.
bad,"Good place for a employee that doesn't have a personal life. Heavy loads that aren't secured. You never know from day to day what your doing, or even hour to hour for that matter. Managers haven't a clue about the trucking industry except what a email says."
bad,I review orders to insure the right equipment is in the warehouse and installed where needed. I also reconcile orders to insure payments are made timely and customers are billed efficiently
bad,This company is apparently trying to tell all of its employees that their company is family oriented but if you are in sales or delivery they don't care about your home life. They want you to work 12-15 hours a day and then go home and answer your phone after words as well. They don't care if you request days off they continue to call or try and contact you. The management above you is clueless because they hire people off the street and don't train them. This is why they continually have to rehire and retrain. They need to promote from within when possible because you have done multiple jobs within the company you can see issues arise and will know how to handle certain issues.  But when your upper management doesn't care or doesn't know the process you will mess up alot of events and orders. The route salesmen (delivery guys) don't make enough to live off of. They work 5 to 6 days a week and 14 hours a day is ideal for them. The end of day paperwork is crazy. The company wants you to mess it up so they can charge you for what you already delivered. Their comission scheme is  weighted which means they can't tell you what you make on any one product. They have not come to the 21st century when calculating this. You may sell 5000 cases one week and make 700 dollars and the week after  you sell 6000 and won't make over your base pay. Most of their equipment is over due for maintenence and when they do proper maintenance it's done very very sketchy. They don't replace bald tires they don't work on their lift gates and alot of the time you can send a truck in to get fixed and it
bad,"The days were spent with client accounts and working to provide them with a way to better their business and income."
bad,"PepsiCo only cared about their product.  I got penalized for going above and beyond my job.  As a seasonal hire, I didn't expect the job to last long, but was released right before the cut off to become full time for ""performance issues"" even though I was fixing everything wrong from the person before."
bad,Sales employees relatively have no rest days and day-off. Sunday routes are mandatory and Philippine holidays are not in their vocabulary.
bad,Worked there for 9 years in production.  Supervisor's have their favourites.  Dog eat dog environment.  Watch your back I suggest.
bad,"The average day was 12-13 hours, and then your boss could still call you and ask you to work another store. Constantly being yelled at by back door receivers, and store managers because the BCR's did not do their job. Over all terrible place to work. The only real break you get is driving to your next store."
bad,"Aprendi a trabalhar com coletores, também aprendi a trabalhar sobre pressão,ea fazer inventários,a gerencia bem ruim,os colegas de trabalho maravilhosos unidos,a parte mais díficil foi quando precisei sair de lá por questões pessoais e eles não fizeram nada pra ajudar, a parte agradavel era a união dos colegas muito gratificante."
bad,"New career opportunity with advancemet to grow."
bad,"there is no professionalism should be need well train and educated person.no proper system is so far even salesman doesn't know about daily or weekly sales target because most of promoted from helper ,also no proper routing system implement there."
bad,"Typical work day was consisting of me recycling can's and plastic bottles. Was always asked to help out other areas of production or warehouse. I learned how to operate filler machine, can packer, bottle packer, palletizer, depall, and how to work on pneumatic and hydrolic driven machines. I got along very well with my co-workers. the hardest part of my job working outside in the elements. The most enjoyable was employee appreciation day."
bad,95% Sales organization 5% operations. If you fall into the 5% category you need to find another career. The company is too focused on its image.
bad,"Started my day visiting each assigned store to do inventory and merchandise product.  Filled shelves when needed to keep a stock available to the consumer.  I unloaded delivery trucks, and placed product in the stores warehouse.  I found the job enjoyable except for the lack of communication between management and employees.  I found my opinions did not matter.  Since my leaving the company, they have changed management."
bad,"Empresa de grande porte porem sem plano de carreira."
bad,"For a 6 billion dollar company, they're run incredibly poor.  The politics are ridiculous and they could care less about employees as long as their butt is covered.  This company pinches every penny and is only about the bottom line.  Health benefits have a 2K deductible."
bad,"A nice place to work if you like little to no structure, employees run the warehouse instead of management...."
bad,"Check in delivery drivers, daily deposits, filing, work with invoices to verify product matches daily deliveries, use change and currency counter to process full service route money.  Over and short payments process in the daily deposit system and other task.  Learned how to work with invoices, work with spreadsheets, and work with large sums of currency. "
bad,"Be very prepared for long days little pay and a bad back.The most physical job out there and all the retailers treat you like dog meat.Management has learned everything from books and manuals not from actually doing the job.its always your fault no matter what goes wrong.The company forgot how to sell they rely on all the ads they have purchased,the space on the shelf is all bought and paid for,and if the weater is bad and product is slow..your fault..but on wallsteet they are telling investers bad weather is why sales are down......for the last ten years."
bad,"Building in the warehouse is hard enough already. No matter winter or summer it's a tough job, but the hardest part of the job is being away from the family."
bad,"The employees are used and abused in this company, the highest rate of personal injuries i had experience in my career, and when an employee is injured the company's treatment to the employee is rude. Management is not well prepared at all and disregard for the employees is amazing."
bad,"Typical day at work is full of challenges and a new experience everyday. I have learned good end to end recruitment skills and various other skills related to Trainings, payroll, performance Management process, how to work in a corporate culture with great co workers."
bad,"Don't transition into management if you want to retire from Pepsi.30 years from driver to territory sales manager to operations, was let go at age 50. All performence reviews were on target or above.Age discrimination?You tell me."
bad,"I worked for pepsi for 6 years. You are a number and will be treated like a number. Managers stab you in the back and hope you like overtime and not get paid in real overtime dollars. No balance between home and work. Nice bonuses, Decent compensation and benefits."
bad,Pepsico is a horrible employer if you plan on having any friend or family life whatsoever you work till your done every day every weekend every holiday. You could work from 5 am to 6 pm easily every day with few breaks if you can get one. night warehouse works 2 pm to someday 4 am. there is no advancement opportunities what so ever! i have personally seen 10+ current employees passed up and then they hire people out of house with zero experience instead
bad,Didn’t like the union rules.... had to travel to 45 miles to work at 4am to clock in by 5am.   Had to call in to clock in... if you called in at 5:01 am you got a point... just very strict on that...when the job gave you the freedom to work at your own pace...
bad,"Heb ruim 15 jaar via het uitzend buro gewerkt (capac,tempo team en randstad)voorlijn,messen.bordes ,smaakstof bordes,line supplier....en geen een moeite of mogelijk heid voor vast werk binnen het bedrijf terwijl een ander wel word aan genomen met minder ervaring"
bad,"Manager is horrible. No respect for the drivers. Company had to send one of the manager to anger management class because 20 drivers quit on him. It use to be a geat place to work at. Now, not so good. Alot of hard labor and dealing with horrible customers. Must have a good attitude to put up with this place."
bad,Get treated like horribly by managers!!! There a lot of people who still work there who are stuck and hate it. Managers pick and choose who they give good stores too. A lot of separation between employees/employers. No growth in company. Not worth it.
bad,"It depends on who you know. Most people who get promoted have a prior involvement with management before being promoted. If you’re not a top selling, instead of working with you, you are put on a mandate to either get better or be disciplined."
bad,This job puts work load or employees.The 100 days of Summer is crazy. 6 days 12 hours or more. Ridiculous. Not worth it to anyone with a  wife & kids.
bad,Empresa falta benefícios seria bom ter benefício além de deixar os empregados animados e mais valorizados
bad,Gestores e diretores nao se preocupam com deslocação do funcionario nao pagam banco de horas corretamente
bad,"Very demanding, 13 hour days, base and commission pay, overtime pay is not worth it, I would work 15 hours overtime and only get paid an extra $200. Managers have no respect. You will not have time for a personal life. 4am mandatory weekly meetings for nonsense."
bad,This is a job in which has things being routed by people in a totally different state.These people have never been in the city in which they are giving directions for.  Theyll have you double back to the same place 3 or 4 times because customers are in the same shopping ctr. And not do them all at one time. Its senseless. Plus is that there is minimal micromanaging going on.
bad,Great company to work for. It has its ups and downs The benefits are great and the pay is also competitive. The only downside would be upper management.
bad,A typical day at work is long with heavy costumer service. I've to learned to maintain inventory in a heavy volume warehouse while managing union workers.
bad,"Being a small format sales rep was very challenging!!! You can never get caught up. It’s the good ole boy network. If they do not like you, they will find anything on your route and hold you accountable for the smallest things knowing you don’t have much time having 15+ stops a day. The favorites have more issues on their routes and do not get held accountable. Management is cancer and will use employees to save their job. Vrot is what Pepsi pays for overtime. It’s not regular overtime and comes out to 15.00 an hour after 40 hours. Working a 50 hour week when it’s slow you will be lucky to gross $850 for the week. Money is only good 5 months of the year.  You use you own car for running your route and running product to customers if they run out. Mileage that they compensate you for is not enough for the wear and tear on your car as you kill it!!!!Good company but they put the wrong people in management!!!!! If you have a family don’t worry, you will be able to support them but never see them!!! This job is good for the resume that’s it!!!!!! Stay away from st joe nothing but snakes. I did my job and chose to quit. I’m not a mad ex employee!!!! Take it for what it’s worth."
bad,"When I first started it was great, but I quickly learned that there was nowhere for me to move to from admin. All the positions are only available if you start at the bottom in another department - which is almost impossible. The managers also suck as they are very rude, demanding, and are never there when you need them."
bad,"Pepsi is great business to work for however, there are more cons than pros correlating mainly to the overhead. I don’t wish this job on my worst enemy if I had one."
bad,"The only downfall was management is constantly changing, they were always hiring from other divisions and never giving local location employees a chance.  Employees were very unhappy at Pepsi due to this.  The turnover was not very good for business."
bad,You are just a number and they will work you till you break and then replace you with a new guy. There is a ton of turnover so the veterans get forced into picking up all the extra work that doesn’t get done. The whole grocery industry are a bunch of whiners
bad,"Terrible hours (13hrs per day), no home life with kids. Early start time, late end times, very physical job. Very pushy to hit sales numbers and plan. Will send you hours away and expect you to stay overnight in (company paid) hotel."
bad,The company has you solely unload/merchandise roughly 600-700 cases daily with no help. Also no room for learning mistakes. Pay is not comparable to work load or work intensity
bad,I wouldn't reccomend this place to anyone. Supervisor is disrespectful and has no people skills. Management doesn't take complaints about working conditions seriously
bad,They wheel you in during training the hourly pay is good with overtime.  Once training ends and get on salary and commissions it's terrible. They hired too many people and now there's not enough work for a full 5 days. Get to work 530am leave at 730pm not worth it
bad,Working for PepsiCo is a great opportunity to build my experience in the market but has no real manager to subordinate relationships. There is also hundreds if not thousands of dollars lost in waste and inventory at the lowest level. Employees are not held accountable for their actions and it takes an act of congress to write an employee up. The company doesn't look at you as an employee but as a number.
bad,"The work life balance is non existant. They expect you to work 60 hours a week and nitpick about everything that isn't finished. "
bad,"Leaves a lot to be desired. Less concerned with performance rather than who you are, which university you graduated from, and who you know. Get your experience and move along"
bad,If you have experience don’t do it. This is a great place to get your experience then leave. The pay changes twice a year from hourly to commission whenever they feel like it. They want you to drive illegal just to get product off the truck and I even had a manager tell me I’m just a number. Management has no experience in the trucking industry. Terrible Equipment
bad,"Driver management have no clue what is going on behind their backs or has EVER been a driver. There is a WAR going on between the drivers and managemant. The drivers deserve an Oscar nomination for the act most are putting on. Pensions , seniority,education and personal debt enslaves drivers to go back to that exhausting ancient labor process."
bad,"The management is disorganized .There is limited equipment and it is not family friendly.Disciplinary action even when you are sick .The pay is ok ,but usually understaffed"
bad,"Most days are spent on more conference calls and in more meetings than actually doing your job. You are left continually playing catch-up. Everything is a fire drill and you are expected to drop everything to get the job done. Good luck making a Doctor's appointment. You will have to cancel them more often than not. Most weeks, you end up working over 50 hrs or 6 days a week. No time for personal life. Company preaches Work, Life, Balance, but does nothing to support it. If you like to work yourself to death, this is the place for you!"
bad,"typical work day is waking up at 5 am depending on the route you are assign to. must be at first store location by 6 am. when u get to the job site you merchandise product, and move on to next location"
bad,management was horrible unorganized lack of communication trucks were raggedy routes were all over the place poorly trained and the delivery supervisor very disrespectful to people also disrespectful in stores to store manager good luck keeping your job or even being trained properly
bad,"What used to be a challenging family culture has completely changed.  Leadership has degraded and the sole focus on cost reduction only has reduced creativity, innovation, engagement, and created a hostile culture.  Salary and benefits are some of the best, but you can only buy someone's soul for so long."
bad,"Insanely run. Youll always be worried about being laid off. Managers are awful, executives are awful. I could write a book on the insanity ive seen and dealt with."
bad,Great opportunity to learn and gain valuable experiences. Unfortunately the location I worked at had very poor leadership. The values of the company did not filter down to the higher managers.
bad,"Buen empresa, pero poca calidad de vida y recursos para desarrollo de mejoras"
bad,"If your ready to work yourself and work yourself hard, deffinately apply. they will crush your will in the summer and make you earn every cent paid while working in 90 degree evenings and 115 degree days."
bad,"poor management, to much favoritism, , mess rolls down hill mentality, unless you pucker up you are pooped on, don't recognize hard working individuals but if you kiss enough butt you will get far..."
bad,"ok place to work"
bad,Not a bad place to work if you want to work a ton but there is not a good work life balance.  Politics are lousy and its difficult to advance if you don't know the right people.
bad,"Good team members to work with, Union reps are very helpful with Training and information of duties.  Free perks like Breakfast and lunches along with employee apprication day when we meet out Goals on Sales and Safety."
bad,"negative change in morale and atmosphere, culture is changing and we are no longer making wise strategic business decisions.  Too many hero chiefs not enough indians"
bad,I would not return here or refer anyone here. The pay is not worth the work and management doesn’t care about the employees. You will be under appreciated and underpayed
bad,Typical front desk work. Cashiering and accounting work. Computer knowledge a must. Sales and advertising also included. Auditing product on trucks. .
bad,"Management here is not good and is more worried about themselves rather than making sure the employees are happy and taken care of, work long hours (12 hour days) with low compensation, paid Chinese overtime instead of regular overtime"
bad,Poor management.  Will sacrifice their own workers in order to advance.  They will side with customer no matter what the situation.  Manage through fear.
bad,Excelentes produtos de se trabalhar. Oportunidades de crescimento.
bad,"Pocos beneficios a empleados, jornadas muy largas de trabajo y poca remuneración económica"
bad,The people are the best part of the job along with flexible hours and work from home. Challenging. Always changing.  Communication and pay  needs to improve.
bad,"Going into the position I thought that I was gaining a career, I was widely mistaken. There is zero chance for advancement and I topped out just after 3 months. I have worked for pepsi for over 6 months now and I still don't know all the facets of my job because the lack of management and training. "
bad,"This job is good if you dont care for a personal life and just want to rake in the dough. Would routinely work 14-16 hour shifts, occasionally a 19-20 hour shift (in the summer)."
bad,"Pepsi is a giant corporation where you are just another number. Give it a try if you like conformity and communication, lots and lots and lots of communicating"
bad,I did not enjoy working at this office. The office demeaned and makes women and minorities feel miniscule. I would never work there again and would not recommend it.
bad,"Que para que funcione bien un trabajo es importante tener comunicación, y estar en equipo."
bad,I did not feel like i was necessary to any team or anyone. They have great co-workers as they give you tips here and there while also collaborating with you about your typical day.
bad,It's 85% networking and who you know and 15% of your actual work to move up. There's favoritism towards campus hires and contractors are treated like 2nd class citizens.
bad,Empresa con muy mala administración en la cual no tienes tiempo para nada
bad,Unless you like a stressful work environment. Managers who write up workers for little to non infractionsr if you want no life this is the job for you.The only thing good here is money because your working 15 hours a day 6 days a week with only Sundays off!
bad,hard working part time job would be a great job for kids out of high school or college good benefits and a nice schedule its early and you get a work out
bad,"IF YOU WANNA WORK 60 HOURS A WEEK, EVERY WEEK, THIS IS THE JOB FOR YOU! In all honesty, the pay received for the work performed is very fair.  Raises are straightforward earned based on seniority and earned regularly.  However, outside of that every single other thinkable aspect of the job is bottom tier.  You will be treated as a number, not a person, there is not a single member of management either shift supervisor or higher up that cares about you or the job.  Miscommunication is rampant between management and employees leading to discrepancies in workflow creating large problems throughout the day.  Any complaint you may have or even a positive suggestion given to HR will be ignored.  If you are sick or have a family emergency there is ZERO leniency on top of being forced to work a minimum of 50 hours a week, (only 3 weeks in the last 2.5 years have had no forced overtime).  10 hour shifts with absolutely no flexibility in scheduling or days worked.  This job should certainly be avoided it will bring you nothing but continuous stress and grief."
bad,"All the manager have NEVER done the job and honestly, do not know how they know nothing, the manager managers are even WORSE and QUALITY is a bunch of idiots who were about to get fired, to begin with. Horrible and hateful people who know nothing and do nothing, I wish I would sit around all day and gossip. No help no empathy for employees just work work work only reason I stay is job security OH and the raise and I was one of the top percent .21 cents!  WOW"
bad,it pay manager really only care about get product off the truck no matter what if you broke down  the can careless litterally asked how many stop left  if you out of DOT hour  how many stop you got left
bad,"I found that working at pepsi would have been much more enjoyable if one felt that they could succeed in the company. In my opinion, preference is giving to select indivisuals based on how supervisors liked them not by job performance."
bad,Good benefits and a good salary however the amount of work and lack of teamwork is astonishingly bad. Management never seemed to really care how long you worked as long as the work got done.
bad,"Decent job, just no room for growth unless your 21 and a college grad. Very physical and not too much concern from management on your physical well being. Not too many perks when you're a merchandiser."
bad,My time with pepsico was short due to the constant demand to sell product in areas where product isn't a top seller. Management needs extreme overhaul. Work environment can become uncomfortable if not use to this type of environment.
bad,"Some poor management - especially the Zone Management in Evansville, IN, very poor training, poor HR support, overtime pay is the unconventional reduced sliding scale so beware, no standards, everyone does their own thing. Work/life balance is horrid. Breaks are discouraged in the 10-12 hour day. Many will 'say' they are concerned about the employees but that is simply false, absurd and unnecessary early daily start times. On the positive side, pay is fair, base employees try to be helpful. It is hard to recommend a company that's incapable of creating a standard method to perform a job."
bad,"Management would attempt to get ahold of you on your day off to fill in for another employee. My location was #1 in North America. If you did not fill in for the other employee, they would count against your attendance even if it's your day off."
bad,"PepsiCo is a good place to start your career and build your resume to get ready for your first real job.  They have a very good atmosphere to learn new skills, but they won't give you the opportunity to build a successful, long term career.  There is very little movement in the company and those spots are primarily slotted for their campus hires.  Once you get in a role, prepare to stay there longer than what you are hoping for."
bad,In the beginning the job was great but over ther years with new management coming in it seem that the only concern was to hit the numbers and as far as the employees the morale continues to drop week by week
bad,"In the time I have work with this location, we have had three PSRs leave the company because the direction of the company has changed from customer service to numbers. I have an excellent manager but the individual who runs the show is rude, disrespectful to the sales reps and unprofessional. When you become a target watch out and expect a sit down with your manager. Extremely difficult to move up within the company, even if you have a degree. The campus hires get everything handed to them even if  they pass over an individual who has worked with the company for multiple years.  Difficult to trust anyone because they all seem to be for themselves and have no team mindset involved. I enjoy the customer relationship greatly."
bad,Fast paced environment for anyone wanting to work lots of hours with poor management and no room for advancement opportunities. No time fir family or friends.
bad,"Pepsi is a rough company to work for, you work long hours with very demanding accounts, you don't get to stop til you're done.  You're constantly picking up slack for everyone else, at least I was."
bad,"constant cost pressure coupled with hard business challenges due to the customer landscape cause a very difficult environment for senior leaders."
bad,"Stressful & Unorganized. Just that."
bad,"Production side is gone now, and for good reason. Management would allow its employees to sleep on the job, ride the clock and show up for work just to punch in and go back home....no kidding, management did nothing to stop the crazy!"
bad,"I work as a delivery driver for Pepsi. If you are willing to break your back with hard work, then this is the place for you. If you don't want to see your family for more than 4 hours a week, then this is the place for you. If you want to lose 20 pounds in 4 months, then this is the job for you. If you like eating bags of chips and soda for ""lunch"" then this is the job for you. "
bad,bad management not a good environment for long term open door lack of care for employees. Decent pay but a lot of physical work with no regard to safety. Out dated n poor equipment
bad,"good fellow employees, they stress on family values but truly do not care when it comes right down to it."
bad,"Typical day and work was unclear and misdirected. I leaned fill station repair and support, but department had no formal training system in place nor any SOP procedure. The culture at work was stressful but manageable through co-worker team support. The hardest part of the job was lack of managerial support and direct as well as functioning guide and allowed time to properly maintenance equipment/PM. The most enjoyable part of the job was being part of a prominent product line, as well as the people that work on the frontlines of production."
bad,High speed environment that constantly had you working your hardest. Unexpected jobs and duties on a day to day (besides your hired work position)
bad,Made good money that about really didn't care much for they way management handle things it was always about the drama. Every single thing was made into a huge isssue
bad,"Would be a fun job, making control drinks of different flavors of soda, but there is no work life balance with this company's particular location.  Working 60-70 hours a week because there is a hiring freeze and they refuse to get more help in the door."
bad,"A empresa em si não é ruim, mas a direçao e péssima só vê o lado da imprensa não vê o lado do ser humano."
bad,mandatory days average day is 10 hrs or more have to start to early in the morning 4-5 a.m. you would work larger order about 4-6 pallets full of pepsi product
bad,"Empresa suga muito todos os funcionários de todas as áreas. Vocêe perde sua vida social, vive e respira  24 horas Pepsico. muito amadorismo e apadrinhamento nas Lideranças."
bad,Good pay! Undergoing lots of changes leaving the company changing rules on a weekly basis. Company also sharing with Amazon which brings little confusion.
bad,Always changing management to train transient managers to move to different territories. Very little consideration for the delivery staff and their needs.
bad,"10 -12 plus hour days of lifting soda cans, bottles and boxes at 4 different stores. Alot of work and hardly never no help."
bad,"Pay was alright for the position and the work, but the job was tedious and rarely satisfying. Management strongly focuses on results; ergonomics, safety, and positive workplace culture slipped significantly during my tenure, with minor achievements along the way. Retiring employees were given little or no fanfare. Numerous lifetime employees were forced out of the company or given little consideration during a so-called 'Kaizen' meant to reduce operating costs. Employee recognition heavily favors specific positions in the plant. Management occasionally catered meals and bbq lunches if employees met specific production, cost, and safety goals. If you're okay picking up a mercenary paycheck, you could do much much worse for less."
bad,Management won't hold lazy employees accountable. Only a small number of employees do the bulk of the work in the warehouse. The supervisor won't lift a finger to manage the bad employees. The bad ones will take 15-minute breaks that last 45 minutes or half-hour lunches that last an hour. They would make an 8-hour shift last up to 15 hours or more.
bad,"Words cannot describe how sneaky and shady the management are.   Decent pay and benefits, but forced overtime and weekends constantly and the so called ""Union"" is just as bad as the management,"
bad,"Uma empresa boa, mas sem muitas perspectiva, era terceiro e não tinha chance de efetivação, ambiente sem clima agradável, a empresa é boa, mas os colaboradores nem tanto."
bad,Pay is decent compared to other places. Don't expect fair treatment or opportunity to advance based on your qualifications or work ethic.
bad,Very defensive approach to growth and stability.  More passive of cutting cost rather than promote effective initiatives to combat the market
bad,"I don't have time for my family I've been working for seven days a week, pressure, loaded of work. unsatisfied of salary."
bad,Overall Pepsi is a good place to work because of the great insurance.  I have enjoyed my time with the company and have had my own route and now am in relief sales
bad,"The place is poorly managed, pervasive internal ""PR"", endless sessions of useless training. benefits were horrible, high premium high deductible plans."
bad,"Buen clima clima laboral entre colegas. Aprendí a especializarme en el puesto de compras, análisis, licitaciones, etc. "
bad,"The job was easy and straightforward but the lack of competent management made the days long, unorganized, and horrible."
bad,good pay but no chance for advancement and I would look elsewhere for advancement.
bad,"10 hour work day, relationships, poor management, great co-workers, hardest part high turn over, best part customers"
bad,"poca estabilidad pero un gran quipo de trabajo solo q mucha gente esta muy sacada de onda con el nuevo esquema de pago de pepsi pues a sufrido cambios para crecer como empresa pero para los trabajadores les a perjudicado les bajaron el esquema de pago ya no ganan comision solo sueldo base algunos puestos"
bad,pay is great but if you're looking fir a career than this isn't for you.  getting a promotion is very hard to come by.  management will not back you up for nothing.
bad,"Es dificil trabajar con jefe autoritario, con uan persona despota, que no sea lider..."
bad,"This company does not have many standard processes for day to day operations and the ones they do had are not followed with any regularity. Most locations have their candidates already selected before the interview process begins leaving growth opportunities limited. The peers in the company typically form a strong bond helping each other, which is a positive aspect. The jobs continuously increase in demand, both physically and mentally, while the compensation stays stagnant or slowly decreases. Every year the company presents that compensation is increasing by changing up the balance between base and commission, but the result by the end of the year is a reduction is gross earnings across the board."
bad,"It's a decent place to work."
bad,"Use to be great place to work from 2000-2010 but right now is a total mess..management is horrible,plant manager got already 2 body count on his resume..expect 16 hours a day..dont go there!"
bad,"Be careful if you transfer to another location, they can be very different, I transferred from Michigan and had a great life, very balanced and worked with strong management, transferred to Denver and was shocked, weak managers and no life, all work 24 hours a day, due to young managers that were unable to make a decision, very simple work, Denver location has a lot of transfers in and out,  I know all the managers I worked with were miserable and looking to get out quickly, I was fortunate to have others options, be careful, lots of hours and low pay."
bad,alot or work. bosses only care about you getting the job done. alot of over time
bad,"Management is terrible and an unsafe workplace"
bad,Colleagues were great but sub-par management and pay. Not as great as a company that you would hope for.
bad,Early work hours lead into late night work hours.  The management at depot is good with what little control they have.  Very Micro managed business. High Turnover. Turnover is expected.
bad,All the benefits you need without the security.  You are always working with time against you.  There wasn't a balance of work and life.  The best thing I can say about this job was the fact that I was able to lose a lot of weight in a little amount of time.
bad,manager would rather give overtime to full time employee's then give more time to part time.                                                                  fast paced day's co workers were alright keeping the pace at first it was a all day work out that i liked  
bad,"As a salesman you drive one of their trucks delivering product to various accounts on your assigned route. You start around 5:30a, and if you are lucky, done by 2-3p. Most cases you are done between 4-5p. Management doesn't know how to recognize accomplishments, nor motivate you to do your best. Hardest part of the job is dealing with management saying one thing and doing another."
bad,Company is not what it should be. Terrible management and backstabbing.
bad,Horrible Turnover Rate
bad,"Wasted 12 years of my life there. It was a good company to work for until manager changes in 2006. Insurance sucks. The 401k plan isn't bad, but HR department will increase amount taken every year unless you tell them to stop. Managers- you might work for 4 different managers at one time, each giving out conflicting orders which feels like you are working 4 different companies. I had a manager once tell me if you turn in overtime worked, they would find something write you up about. (US labor law violation). Very hard work. You have to pull 2000lbs of soda in grocery stores and most of these grocery store's equipment is in very poor shape. I had 2 surgeries repairing torn ligamets. The last injury I had was in my back. Once G & J Pepsi finds out that you are hurt, they find ways to get rid of you. I'm still battling them with a lawyer for workers comp."
bad,There are so many egos in this company. If you are looking for a career and a place to grow... do not waste your time here.
bad,"My review of working at PBV is from my opinion. The day of work is started by prioritizing the service calls for that day. The calls are roughly located within one county. I learned that you cannot attempt to plan out your day. Sudden priorities from sales reps, route drivers,etc make it nearly impossible. The calls completed per day quota increases every year along with increased accounts. Management has no reality of a typical workday and likes to think all repairs can be completed in 20 minutes. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting customers and resolving their problems with epuiptment or other company issues."
bad,Pepsi is the kind of company that pays you well but seems to have its head screwed on backwards.
bad,"- No much guidance from mgmt team"
bad,Serious issues with employees not handled. Pay was good but not after you divde how many hours you're working on salary.   The head manager was great just not in thenknkw of
bad,Management sucks big time. The company falls under the guidelines of play it by ear. They try & plan strategies as the will see them but when the plans crumbles they seem to blame it on the merchandisher which they told us to carry out the strategy. Company needs a serious make over & more professional goal setters in place to run more of a successful business.
bad,The work is very strenuous on your body highly recommended if you're looking for something that is physical. the work environment itself is not very conducive to a healthy lifestyle long term factoring in the start time and weather conditions. Management don't seem to protect merchandisers from the ridicule of store managers and receivers when involving unfair conduct.
bad,"Lancée à 300% dans mon nouveau poste, j'ai été très déçue par le management inadapté (aucun suivi, formation bâclée) et le poste en lui-même car on ne m'avait pas présenté tous les aspects de ce dernier : enchaîner les journées de 9h et faire de l'administratif encore 2h en rentrant, se lever très très tôt (2h du matin) pour faire des réimplantations de produits dans les magasins, pas le temps de manger le midi ... BREF ça s'est mal passé pour ma part mais certains collègues avaient l'air satisfaits. Ce n'était pas fait pour moi."
bad,U work at least 60 hours a week if u want to make good money always wanting u to work Saturday high turnover and no communication with the loaders management tries to be flexible
bad,The Phoenix location is run unfairly and practices favoritism and discrimination regularly. If you are not part of the leadership team or management your opinions and ideas are never included or as considered.
bad,"Worked for Pepsi from 2014-2017 Pay was Excellent. Started at 3 p.m ended when work was finished. No cut off time was the only downfall, Management was Horrible might be different now but you have to watch out for Gerrett Hall. Very sneaky guy"
bad,Pepsi give you a headache because of the BS that they put you through. they treat you like a number not s a human. dont waste your time unless your very energenic
bad,"Poor management and poor communication between management."
bad,I would prefer not to comment on this due to my unique experience with the company.  With it being a large company with varying jobs everyone's experience will differ.
bad,"Not the best work life balance .... amenities with the company are great but it comes at a price of your time, happiness and sometimes...sanity. Good company ... however, not the best management talent"
bad,"You could work there for years and literally make the same as the day you started, they give no sick days and only 10days of vacation and if your are sick they use your vacation days"
bad,"The day to day work is little to no fun, it is simple work. Lifting, pulling, squatting, and bending all day long to stock and organize products. Extremely early mornings that wreak havoc on your evenings when you are finally off work. Just awful work for your health. Schedules are a mess and routes make absolutely no sense. Management is nice but useless when it comes to supporting you. You don't see your other co-workers but are constantly cleaning up after them at different stores, unless you are lucky. Most stores are pushy and overall you are worked to the bone. There is way TOO MUCH stress for the job considering it is JUST SODA. The pay is okay, and the mileage is nice if you get lucky enough with a good route. Overall would not recommend."
bad,Didn’t like being there. Management was ok but they expected way more than someone should have to do for that type of job. Customers were not very friendly or helpful. Wouldn’t recommend this company
bad,its a job that requires a lot of physical work in all weather conditions management is understanding at certain times nothing is hard to do here you just have to be willing to do the work
bad,I get there. We create and stack pallets to be sent out to stores. We get an hour lunch. Managment is difficult to work with at times. Sick time is rare. And if you are sick it is rare to get to go home. Fhe hardest part is managments standard. The best part is the other employees.
bad,Management does not listen to legitimate complaints on addition work required of you're working larger store. Example...they expect you to move store merchandise like several pallets of wine or other vendor products (multiple pallets of soda) to be able to get to your product.
bad,"Manager didn't keep my job duties as set in the interview.  Hired new person and gave them job responsibilities meant for my position. "
bad,My time there the mgmt was great until they moved us to maumel. The mgmt system in maumell was terrible during my time with Pepsi. Had they left the warehouse in hot springs I'd still work there
bad,"Good hours, good work, bad benefits, and some bad management."
bad,"* I wake up early in the morning"
bad,"VERY UNSAFE work place. Zero Training. "
bad,"In my experience PepsiCo was great at the bait and switch. I was told that the job i was hired for was much different than it actually was. It did not seem like anyone truly liked their jobs. When the company is not hitting sales, they take all employee incentives away."
bad,"Good place to work, culture is awesome, and also a great pay. Planned production needs, workforce needs, managed the budget and track results for reporting purposes."
bad,"Getting hired at Pepsi was one of the most exciting days in my life. Coming from working outside I was ready to try a new chapter in my life. The job is great but the real struggle I had was the people. If you are not liked it will be known to the point that you become uncomfortable. You really never get any feed back and if there is a mistake made everyone will know it’s allot of gossip and backstabbing, just be prepared if your hired"
bad,Worked here as a geo box driver for one week. That's all it took for me to realize that this job will kill you mentally and physically. Looking around at the other drivers who you can tell hate there jobs but they look as though the life has been sucked right out of them. Whoever is running the show up the corporate ladder either has no clue what these guys do for the company or doesn't care and I don't care to work for someone or a company like that. The great geo box invention is only a great tool for the company not the drivers. They can cramp as much product and stops on everyone now and basically work them to death. All of this would be things you could probably look past though of the compensation made any sense! Sure you might clear $800 bucks in a week but if you're working 60 or more  hours that week and you're somewhat good at math it doesn't add up.life has been sucked right out of
bad,No life balance for a family man...to much work load and no balance with family or friends due to forceing and favorite place a joke better of behind a dumpster truck
bad,"Keep looking only apply if you want to spend your day stocking convenient stores and CVS, Walgreens, dollar generals. 60 to 80 cases to stock after waiting 20 to 45min to get checked in and only have 17mins to get in and out to your next stop."
bad,Workload expected was way more than they inform you during the interview. Early Mornings to Late Nights. Poor Communication. Supervisors do not give you the info. needed to complete your job. It was a disaster.
bad,Decent pay but management is horrible! High turn over rate with operators and higher amongst supervisors. 12 hour shifts and 3 breaks ( two 15minute breaks and a lunch break) that’s if you get them all. Getting promoted is all about who you know
bad,For minorities it all depends on the location for your success. If you ha e a di verse team and management it's the best and rewarding. Management sets the to e for every company and here it makes the difference.
bad,"I was hired on as a temp and was there for 7 months as a forklift driver. I was told through the temp agency I was with to apply for full time with the company so I did and a few weeks after that I was let go ! I was told there was a lot of complaints about my work which if that were true, I wouldn’t have been there as long as I was"
bad,"ambiente bastante ameno."
bad,"Good company overall, but as a driver you will experience bad everything ex: equipment , trucks , salesmen , manager dont always communicate properly,  rude customers and hard work for 12 hrs a day  ""Chinese overtime ""  pays definitely not worth the things you put up with everyday"
bad,"Culture is toxic, work environment is a sweat shop, leadership doesn't provide direction or handles change appropriately.  IT is being outsourced and business is paying for the decision."
bad,"Management had no clue how the job was done, no excuse or care for personal life, you devote your life to this company. All to be shown that your the lowest on the totem pole for a reason and you will never be treated with respect."
bad,It's an okay job if you are higher up but not for anybody trying to stay a float its more of a second job after a primary for a little extra pay so it's okay for teenagers in school but that's about it.
bad,Pay was low for work performed easily worked 70 plus hours a week management turned over and was poor. Pay was under other similar jobs. Lots of turnover
bad,I believe how I rated this company speaks for itself.  PepsiCo as a whole seems to be a great company.  Severally decisions that were made in the upper management was spot on.  The problem again lied in its lower management.
bad,"Working at Frito-Lay-Lay has great pay but horrible work life balance, they basically own your life until they don't need you anymore. You feel guilty for taking vacation because you know you will come back to a nightmare. No weekends, week nights or holidays to yourself."
bad,"If you want to work at a place (Pepsi Orlando) that under values their employees and will keep unloading managements responsibilities on to the frontline then by all means this is the place for you!"
bad,"Pepsi has become focused on their Campus recruitment program to a fault. New ""interns"" are pushed into management roles while front line managers and employees are left with very minimal advancement opportunities. Internal hiring is a nightmare sometimes you wait up to 3-4 months without hearing a word about your application. Jobs get reposted multiple times and the existing candidate pool never receives an interview. Managers are treated like a number instead of someone who adds value to the company through their hard work and dedication. SDLs have no work life balance. You work 7 days a week and you hours are until your phone stops ringing."
bad,"Everything is a panic. No planning by the management team to correct problems, just get it done today no matter the issue. Run old machinery past its useful life and no matter what you should have known about it and fixed it before it broke."
bad,"This job was tolerable when management actually did it’s job but under this new management the job has gotten very stressful. Consecutive 10 hour days almost 7 days a week, switching to a new system was a tough challenge for everybody. The turnover rate was high because employees had lack of training and knowledge of the new system so it was harder to accomplish the job. Management barely worked with you they just put everything on us because they couldn’t explain why everything was going so bad."
bad,"Every divide environment, i regret giving them so much of my life. But if a person who doesn't mind not developing growth in your life or inspire to only to 60k a year, its a perfect place to be at."
bad,"WAY To Much labor , stressful , time consuming, don’t really have a life , just work for 12 hours more go home , eat sleep & repeat. Don’t recommend ."
bad,"hard work, rewarding work, many hours thou to make ends meet with same job in area offering much higher wages. very miss managed from out of state. very dog eat dog world."
bad,"Definitely a great job when it comes to pay and benefits but you'll grow to hate working there after a few months. Management is hired by who they know not by how they work and what they know. Zero communication and zero support. Employees tend to be decent but you'll run into a few who will say anything to move up, so just put your head down and work"
bad,"If you want a very physical, stressful job with workers who constantly try to knock you down with management backing this cut throat mentality, this job is for you. If you want to work 50 or more hours a week with mandatory overtime added on top of that, working every weekend and holiday with no family life, this job is for you. "
bad,"The daily job is based on seniority, you come in each day and bid on your route for that day,  the trucks are preloaded and you spend your day delivering to local stations and stores."
bad,Fine whilst I was there but overly aggresive when I left regarding IP and images of me whilst I was at the company with company logos and so forth in the background.
bad,long house needs better management there is really no team work at all the house suck and there are no way you can move up in this company unless you are a friend if the management
bad,Aprendi trabalho em equipe segurança no trabalho saúde organização boa condição
bad,Hard to get promoted at this job.  Very rough working conditions for little pay.   Alot of negative and alot of postive acts.  Overall I dont like working here.
bad,The way management has its rate set up for your hourly production is absolutely ridiculous not even the manager was able to do it everyone that does make it is done by cheating which is supposed to be not allowed but is if you're a special person I guess
bad,"They just want robots. Its physically and mentally demanding and if you dont play politics then be ready to lose your job. Hours are long and you never know what time you will get off,and they expect you to do way too much with impossible deadlines and do it 100%. They dont care about theyre employees or appreciate hard work. Its impossible to move up in the company. The company changed around 2011 and they got really cheap with theyre employees. Cut things like christmas parties,incentives,giveaways,ect...."
bad,"Consistently cleaning up after others, workplace environment was unsafe and discriminatory (OSHA made an appearance), workers were entitled and rude. Upon inquiring about advancement within the company (transitioning from a Temp worker to legitimate worker) my supervisor informed me that despite my flawless record there and my excellent production, I would never even be considered for legitimate employment because I ""couldn't possibly have the drive required because of my stances towards the company."" I was both confused and irritated by this statement and assumption. After seeing that I would not progress within the company, I requested a transfer with the temp agency that I worked for."
bad,"Did not like working there. this was not Pepsico, this was G & J Pepsi in Lexington kentucky. This was a franchise bottler. I have no experience on how it is to work for Pepsico"
bad,"At first the job was great. But once you get used to things you see how it's really ran. Management is so poor. They really don't care if you're sick, hurting, car ran off the road, or dying. All they worry about is the product getting off the truck and all the stops getting hit. Which is fine because that is what you sign up for, but it's a way to treat your empoyees. A lot of us really stay because the pay is awesome and the benefits are good. But we don't care for the treatment. You're never in the same area everyday so you can't get use to every account and their system. And the routing is horrible! Stops could be an hour or more from each other and you have 15 or more. The warehouse just throws the pallets on the truck any type of way which causes some of them to flip over making your day longer having to pick it up. The salesmen send way too much in the stores and either have too many credits coming out taking up too much space in a already fully loaded truck or don't write them up causing the people at the account to refuse the order or curse you out when you haven't done a thing. The days are long so by the time you get home you don't do anything but get ready for bed to do the same thing the next day. Management doesn't listen or care about your issues. They just want to look good and if they take a downfall you're getting the write up or suspension. We do our best but we get treated like the enemy. And they wonder why they can't keep drivers. I believe the job wouldn't be as bad if our management had our backs and supported us, seeing we are the true backbone of the"
bad,Pepesico Is a nice place to wirk.  Very fast paced if you are looking for a for a job that offers a lot of overtime this is the place for you.  PepsiCo is also union based so you have them on your side.
bad,"While I was only here for a few months and first few weeks were fine the wheels fell off."
bad,"We just started a new contract and with that we have split days off and worse hours. At a time when workplaces are making more time for family, Pepsi believes they should be your top priority and only concern. We receive no sick or personal days so if you have a family issue its unpaid and you receive a reprimand. If you're looking for a job that allows you to sustain a balance between work and home then RUN away from Pepsi because the only way to have that is with another company. Stay away from Morton, Illinois Pepsi branch if you want to be happy."
bad,collecting potatoes from farms difficulty in finding farms . long hours . management not flexible.delivery to customers nightmare pump truck job. sacked for minor infringement
bad,Typical day consists of fast paced work and constant moving. The hardest part about the job is the hours that are needed to get the job done. Deal with customers on a daily basis.
bad,"Pepsi is a beverage company that needs to improve on their salary and their benefit pack. A slow pace but growing, maybe with the growth it will become better"
bad,"Poor management. If you're not a ""yes man"" they don't want you.  Workers are fine on a personal level but when it comes to being professional they're quick to throw you under the bus to make themselves look good."
bad,Place is ran by people who think they know the job market but don't. They rarely leave the office to see what its like in stores. Employee appreciation week is mostly manager goof off and play basketball week. They'll pat themselves on the back for work you do and rarely show gratification. Double standards everywhere.
bad,"I don't want this to be a dumping session. Working for Pepsi has been one of the best opportunities of my life but the recent change in culture have left a lot of employees feeling unmoored and unsatisfied. Lop-sided and strange commission system where higher performing, more efficient reps are paid less than slower, less effective reps. I worked for Pepsi for 13 years and in that time, I have grown my route at least 8 of those years, yet even with the increased volume, I have consistently made less every year due to their new VROT overtime system which pays employees more for working longer than for selling more cases. It should be illegal. On top of that, the local management are largely out of touch and unprofessional, often resorting to bullying and questionable management practices."
bad,"Fed me a line of bull to get me in the door. Story changes from day to day, don’t know what your doing until 12 hours before next shift, no communication between different areas"
bad,Poor work life balance. Hold you accountable to standards you can't achieve due to budgets/company policies. Discourages good frontline employees from moving up in the company. Cannot promote without relocating.
bad,"What was stressed on the manufacturing floor in terms of values; was not practiced by members of management.  The hiring processes appeared to be fair and diverse, but comments made by members of management were insulting and non-inclusive."
bad,"Poor Management "
bad,"Es una empresa muy buena en varios aspectos, lo malo es la administración y los supervisores ya que tiene muy mala organización. Uno no renuncia a la empresa si no a la gente que la maneja. Por eso es la razón que constantemente estén contratando gente ya que no duran por lo mismo."

bad,"PepsiCo is a great company to work for but their Oakland Gatorade plant is a hole. Stressful work  environment due to out of date broken down equipment high turnover rate of employees their constantly hiring because  employees and management are constantly leaving for better Opportunities. Oakland Gatorade is dirty, their equipment is out of date and broken down. Gatorade doesn’t sell in the winter time so you will be laid off around September every year until end of December/January. You have to work 850 hours to become  considered  permanent employee and get union, medical, dental, etc benefits, no paid vacation until a year after You become a permanent employee. I recommend you apply for another PepsiCo location if you want something long-term.  If you are looking for somewhere to make some quick money until you find something better this is the place for you.  Every day at least two people call out because they’re exhausted from fighting with the broken down equipment so there’s a lot of overtime, No home/work life balance Until you’re laid off"
bad,Bad situation at the Gatorade MFG plant in East Oakland.  Finance department consisted of only two people and the manager of the department was super old school and a tyrant.  Insisted I escort her to the bathroom on occasion.  Not the type of place you want to work at.
bad,The job is physical and stressful at times. Must stay at your position until someone comes to relieve you for your breaks. Too much drama between employees. Diversified culture. Management should have to be able to perform the job requirements of their departments. I disagree with hiring someone straight out of college to run a department without the proper training. Lack of confidentiality in Human Resources. The benefits and the pay are above average. The company has dinners and activities to recognize achieving goals throughout departments. don't have anything to say.
bad,The communication here was inconsistent and difficult. The work was manageable. The position wasn't full time but the experience gained was appreciated (forklifting).
bad,I worked there for over 8 years until my pride determined me to find another career. The managers are a joke and they taught sales reps to be unprofessional. No chance for promotions if you’re over 35 years old. They only like to recruit young college campus hires. You have to work about 60 hours a week or else they’ll punish you. Heavy turnaround ratios. Run!
bad,"As above - okay if your face fits.  I learned here that you have to be of the right social class, right colour and right background to fit in. "
bad,"Like all jobs and Careers it will come with ups and downs, Depending on the leadership the ups and downs can be smooth or stressful. Expectations are high, As they should be for a company like PepsiCo. The pay is good in my opinion but it does come with high demands of your time and dedication.would be nice if  Work/Life balance was more balanced. Leadership does make it feel like your life should be pepsi and nothing else."
bad,required to drive 40 to 50 miles just to start the day. must take own vehicle. not paid for mileage until you arrive at first store. very tough on your vehicle and gas bill.

bad,"I spent most of my day waiting on instructions from supervisors who was too busy to take time to give them. When asked could I get work for the day, I would get answers like "" I will get back to you""..We were basically seats for if they need calls made for the hundred days of summer and wasn't given any change to show our worths"

bad,"I worked At Coventry for almost 10 years.  The factory was hot and sweaty.  Employees on shop floor were great and made the job bearable. Managers on the other hand were bullies.  Event referred to some employees as villains in newsletters. Money was good for what you had to do.  I left during a period of big shake up where good workers were made redundant or demoted. The company took 5 days holiday off us and started messing about with the pension. I was lucky enough to escape you a job on days Monday you Friday and closer to home. "

bad,"Buen trabajo, solo que la cantidad de clientes era muy extensa y no conté quizá con el tiempo necesario para adaptarme debido al lugar en el que vivo."
bad,"You must play the corporate game in order to advance.  Your job performance is not enough to move up the ranks.  You need to be a yes man.  They will not listen to issues you have on a route.  They only listen when a customer complains, and then they are down your throat.  Management will not back their employees.  It is a ""Protect your own butt."" atmosphere.  Continual threats.  If you can't meet your quota's, we will find someone who will.  You will lose your job before I lose mine.  Just a few examples that we heard in some sales meetings."
bad,"The management staff is full of individuals that are there not to help you, just to make sure you do your job and they don't have to have any headaches and can just hide around the street and beat around the system."
bad,"Quality benefits"
bad,"The typical day starts around 6am-7am ( unless you get an early call, you are on call 24/7 even weekends). you then visit your accounts and sell for incremental space. you manage 8-12 people that you develop into better salesman in order to grow sales."
bad,Drove tractor trailers. Pay was not what they said it was. Management need improvement. Routes were not always coordinated appropriately. They need to improve overall.
bad,"OVERWORKED!!!!"
bad,"no habia estabilidad de trabajo, empresa tercializadora"
bad,"benefits and career path policies change very frequently"
bad,"Work hard, long hours with little pay when you break down how many hours a day you put in.  You start your day at 5:00 A.M. and you're not done until your truck is empty, your end time changes every day so you can't set up or make appointments."
bad,Employees are mistreated. There not understandable. No type of incentives or employee appreciation.This is only speaking about the Baltimore/ Columbia region. Pepsi's slogan is about fairness and its a thin line between fairness.
bad,"I was a helper with this company, i found it that the salary was very low. rain or shine must work in the field...no free foods, i bought my own.I experienced walking at night going home because i hve to save my salary"
bad,"Pay rate is pretty good. It was pretty hard to balance with family. Management, you have to buy them drinks to be able to be recognize. Managers only care about productivity."
bad,Aprendi muchas cosas y retos que jamas pense lograr pero si los logre superar
bad,"This review is for the Burnsville, MN location. Because all plants are managed differently. At this Pepsi location you can never be fast enough. The day never seems to end, 12 plus hours is a normal day, even if you aren't feeling well. If you are new, low on the seniority list, you can expect to work 6 and 7 days a week."
bad,Very unorganized and no room to grow. Currently through temp service which I was promised to be permenant 3 months ago and now claim they are on a hiring freeze.
bad,"I don't think PepsiCo. is a good company to work for, let alone retire from. The management at this place is a 0. The equipment at PepsiCo. also is old and The Union here is not good at all. Overall, PepsiCo. is a bad place to work for. Don't waste your time."

bad,High turnover in department. Processes and procedures sometimes inconsistent and not applied to all customers. Great intro to learning inventory management.
bad,Managemer from warehouse was excellent. Did not have enough employees to meet the constant demand of customers. The routes needed to be shorter with less to do
bad,Pay not worth the amount of work and managers have an unreal expectations of how much work can be done in a day. Its very hot and don't receive much support from bosses.
bad,"Challenging, lack of strategy and very tactical environment.  Little use of technology and light managers in key positions."
bad,"Started out as a packer and made my way into a machine operating job. Was constantly asked to perform more and more tasks during my 7 year employment. High levels of expectations under a tight time frame with not much acknowledgement or reward for performance. Management regularly indulged in nepotism and favouritism. Cut throat environment, although staff are hard working and generally good to work with. Not a lot of budgeting for training frontline staff. Watch your back, cross your T's and dot you I's."
bad,"Management was poor and did not balance jobs accordingly."
bad,"Like the work, the people suck.  Not as noticeable to newer employees, but longer term people know how fun this place used to be. Backstabbing, lying, laziness, nepotism, favoritism, management taking credit for others work, all negative aspects running rampant company-wide.  CEO is great, no complaints about future of company."
bad,For the first couple months I couldn't say enough about how much i enjoyed this company and my job. The people here are great but there is no communication between management and other staff. Everything is last minute and disorganized. The admins get dumped with everything regardless of whether or not they actually have the time or the advanced knowledge of systems and programs to perform these tasks. There is no follow up or follow through on anything. Definite lack of leadership. They advance people that are under qualified with little to no work ethic just so that someone else has to deal with them. Very mundane job once you get the hang of it.  Salary is average and vacation is good. Benefits are mediocre at best. They do put on some really nice team builders and other activities for their employees. This would be a great company if they could get some management that actually manages and not hire mediocre sales staff just to fill the gap because they were in a hurry.
bad,"While I was working there I put my best into the job as I do everything in life, but  due to management it made the job harder to enjoy, as well as messing with all the employees hours so management could make the management look ""good"". As for the job its self i loved being in control of my day once it was given, although the days could be stretched out to 13 hours depending on what needed to be done, but as I mentioned above the hour cut backs made that only a 1-2 day occurrence. I've learnt that I definitely need a job where everyone works together instead of a massive chaotic jumble of employees with an incompetent boss."
bad,"A strong relationship and leadership skills that are evident in my Business Analyst (BA) responsibilities. "
bad,"I have never worked so much in my life. In 5 years I never work less than 60 hours each week. An average normal work week was more than 70 hours. My longest work week was 110 hours."
bad,"Was a lot of fun and a lot of money when I first started. Times have changed and so has the company, not for the better. Less focus on employees more focus on image, scorecards and political correctness. Advancement is not based on knowledge, seniority, and effort."
bad,The fleet management at Pepsi is terrible. They don't get along with other departments and do not pay attention to anything but PM schedules. They are supposed to give 40 hours of training to each technician every year but you get none. Elyria fleet department is a joke. One mechanic is responsible for all the work including the managers work.

bad,Provided an opportunity to grow personally as a manager and learn about logistics in the beverage/distribution industry.
bad,the most enjoyable part of the job was building the display for sale promotions..
bad,Management is unorganized and they do not work together to make work any easier for the employees. They work their employees extremely long hours and do nothing but complain and give no thanks   or recognition of the hard work the workers do. Money is great but this job is not worth it if you have a family or a life.
bad,"Unskilled disgruntled work force with no accountability. Leadership seems to be distracted, working on something else as they appear to be deaf to qualified intelligent suggestions. way too much salaried turnover. Tons of empty accolades, Shallow relationships, embarassing suggestions of world class status. Attractive looking facility, poor infrastructure, frustrating systems. Extremely anti-union."
bad,I worked hear about five years and it was great at first when it was a family business but they have really destroyed the work environment when they went corporate. Twice the work for half the pay.
bad,"Further confirmation of its who you know, not what you know."
bad,"Many promises are made in the beginning, but the truth of the matter is that this is a very large corporation where shareholder are all that matter and you are just a number and expense. The training is also lacking and employees are not very willing to help one another. Many people have held the same position for 10+ years while the company hires from the outside instead of promoting from within which creates a very negative workforce. Looks great on a resume but not a place to stay for long if you are looking for advancement opportunities and growth potential."

bad,"I spend a larger portion of my day than I would prefer to merely TRACKING the work that I do.  All emails need to be entered into a spreadsheet for tracking purposes, not to mention a tracker for EVERY single task that we perform.  I work in SAP helping to virtually create materials for record keeping purposes and also aid in the assignment of universal product codes (UPCs) to new products.  I enjoy the actual work that I do, but the amount and length of extraneous meetings is wearing on me."
bad,"High Supervisor turnaround rate. Too many employees, very congested workplace "
bad,"pepsi was once a great place to work but now it has turned into a job where they use you up for a few years and then look to replace you with new hires. they have no interest in workers retiring there. the management in elyria is plain awful and will lie straight to your face. they also have a favorable contract with the union with language that allows them to fire you for various reasons. the teamsters are not strong and will not protect your job. if you work there, do not get used to the money. it doesnt last."
bad,"All work are done on consistency in a timely manner base on each work order. It must be accurate. This would be one of the most enjoyable things about this jobs. Co-workers and yourself are pretty much each other competitor on a daily basis. At the end of day, we just give ourselves a pat on the shoulder knowing we give a hundred and ten percent doing our jobs."

bad,"There is good money to made working here , but there is no quality of life ,very little chance to advance. And Management is a Joke ....surprised they've not shut it down yet."
bad,Be prepared for really short shifts or really long or last minute hour cuts because it all depends on retails selling product.
bad,hardest part of the job is just being there 12 hrs a day. 13 days straight before a day off
bad,"There is no balance between home and work life, the job left me no time to spend with my family even though I was a local driver."
bad,A typical day would include receiving calls from customers to take their pepsi order and upsell customers with new products.
bad,I have been an employee here for going on 8 years and I don't make half the money that others make in my position. I am very dedicated to my job and love working here but my family and cost of living is making me start searching for a new job!
bad,"PepsiCo is worried about PepsiCo’s bottom line and nothing else.  They are loyal to you as long as you are putting them first.  They allow for flexibility to some extent but they expect PepsiCo to be your priority, family comes second in almost all instances.  They pay you well but because they do, they expect you to place them first."
bad,"* Typical work day was filled with unrealistic goals "
bad,Management and higher ups have no respect or care about employees. You work over 50+ hours until you have been there for multiple years. Drivers are given no respect.
bad,"Pros"
bad,"The pay was decent for a non-college graduate who needs a good income to support a family of two. The hours are long, with no set time to get off,so you have lazy co workers who will milk the clock to get as much pay as they can and your stuck there till every one is finished. There are no advancement opportunists unless you have a college degree but its not worth the headache and stress and abuse you get from your employees or even superiors who take advantage of you. Management doesn't stick around to help if things get far to busy, instead they hide in there office or leave early for the day."
bad,"I worked at Pepsi for close to 4 years, in that time I had SIX different managers. They play favorites and once you are on their bad side you might as well look for another job."
bad,"It was all too good to be true!! In my very 1st week I was thrown out in the field all by myself because they never had coverage to do the stores. There’s no work life balance you better not have a life if you want this job. I had no training, management wasn’t helpful they just bossed you around all day. After about a month they fired me because my productivity wasn’t up to par, when most of the times I had to cover other people’s routes!!"
bad,"Working for pepsi I realized that in order to be happy and successful it's really going to depend on what you do, and what shift you work. It's not a job I would reccomend to women for sure because its 90%men and if you have a family that has needs dont expect to ever see them for one, and for two they wont allow you time off unless its paid. Your work days require complete dedication to work and work alone. You get two days off. Theres no such thing as unpaid days off. You have to call in and get points. It's a very hot environment and some positions are very physically demanding. They favor only certain shifts there. Like the morning, and afternoon. They dont care at all about their overnights and 3rd shift, even though those are the shifts that get stuck with most of the work with even less people to do it. They do pay well and there are still employee health benefits, but the supervisors can fire you at random. They hire people during their peak season as full time associates, but then quickly fire them at random during their off season. They really should just hire seasonal instead of what they do. Overall I would reccomend that those who apply know that its risky. Enter this company knowing that it's very likely going to only be temporary."
bad,Very unclear during interview how the position actually works. You will be by yourself all day doing the work of 3 people. No paid vacation sick or personal time for a year. If you do have something come up you will get written up. Expect to work 12 hour days normal. No work life balance. Pay is good if you have nothing else to do but work. Would avoid.
bad,Management sucks...   They want you to skip your lunch breaks even though it’s taken out of your pay.   They expect more then what your job description states
bad,They will lie to you to get you in the door. There is extreme turnover rate. Each day is just a grind to get through. You will be working on average 12 hors a day. Some days 14. They ignore DOT regulations just so they can get there soda moved. Btw love their products. Hate this company.
bad,"To be a global brand, and as large as they are, it’s a horrible company to work for. Maybe not in other locations, but in Winston-Salem it’s ridiculous. They will tell you it takes about a year to learn your role, but will demean you for not knowing everything in your first couple of months. Management does not express expectations, and treats you like you’re incompetent. The pay is great, but not worth the pressure and anxiety placed on you everyday."
bad,"management sucks"
bad,"You are just a number working in the SRDC warehouse."
bad,Unionized plant. The opportunity to move up is slim to none. Everything is based off seniority and favoritism. You may never get the chance to make an upward move in departments. Unexpected schedule changes at the last minute. Communication is poor.
bad,Management has no clue what there doing. They like to act like they know what there doing.. get ready to do a 2 persons job by yourself. Oh yeah get ready to kiss management  feet to get a good review of 50 cents or less for one year of busting your a**. THIS PLACE SUCKS.
bad,"The place is falling apart and safety is the last concern right under the needs of the employees, management is almost non existent and when they are it is almost always in an in appropriate and unprofessional manner. The pay and almost everything not within the locations scope of responsibilities or call is great. The company it’s self is very reliable and trust worthy. The biggest issues come with the management not following standard S.O.P and leading in any manner."
bad,Typical day may include your tasks along with helping others complete goals for day/week. I learned to handle work assignments in a fast paced environment where priorities may change along the way. Management for the most part will assist if they can. Hardest part of job was that it is focused on numbers and has strayed from customer satisfaction. Most enjoyable part is working together.
bad,Driver makes the world go round you do everything just to get the order in the door .. all your customers hate you.. from the last driver.. they pay per day after dealing with the customers and delivering.. your driving that truck for free.. long hours but not worth the pay
bad,"Most jobs within Pepsi are decent. However, STAY AWAY from their warehouse positions. You will be treated like a robot and if they could whip you to work faster they would. Instead of whipping they will dangle write ups and discipline over your head everyday even if your a top employee for most of their metrics."
bad,Management doesn’t care about how stressed or exhausted the drivers get. They only care about products being delivered. They don’t care if a customer holds you up for 45 mins just to get checked in. They have no regard for hours of service. It’s a sales environment and not a safety trucking environment. Poorly maintained equipment to the point where the mechanics don’t even want to work anymore.
bad,"I was hired as a relief/driver merchandiser, but the amount of work is absolutely crazy, you are expected to deliver 14 to 20 stops, majority of stores merchandise and put away overstock, if you want to drive bulk, good luck, they dont give you that until there is a position available and also people bid on it, UNION."
bad,"While i was excited to be joining a large company and I was welcomed well from the beginning then after a month I discovered all they cared about was sales. Sell! Sell! Most of the employees were unhappy sole refused to shake hands. My manager was unavailable some of the time while sales were good here the underlying issues at hand of new vans, income handheld failures, rude store people,,etc. I was a relief driver and it was one the worst jobs I’ve ever had.  After I was let go about 1 year later they shut the group down and gave the work to the regular Pepsi  for that and many other things I’ll never buy a PepsiCo product ever again and encourage others to do the same. Horrible company!"
bad,"Drive around and deal with unhappy customers, then hear from unhappy managers from Pepsi, doesn't pay overtime. Only positives are good benefits and salary."
bad,Company is doing massive layoffs and outsourcing overseas. Management does not listen to employees concerns. Management creates an uncomfortable environment for workers.
bad,"Not sure if it is this way now, but you are going to be promised $20.00 per hour and then when you hit the scene you get paid $30.00 a load and for a short haul drop and hook, that isn't bad when you can pump out 10 loads a day. However, the plant you get your load from in oak cliff goes down more than I care to remember. Its a union warehouse for non union drivers. So that in itself poses a problem because there is no incentive for them to continue pumping out loads. Working for the warehouse would be great I'm sure. They rely solely upon that little GPS box on your truck and you can't tell them its nothing but perfect... trying to prove you were at a loading facility that has cameras where someone could look and physically see your truck there just isn't going to prove the magical GPS system box is wrong. Management there is very young."
bad,We have been told the organization is going to be leaner and leaner over the next 5 years so there is no point of going there unless you want to get laid off.
bad,It is a great job the problem is there are no consistent hours and no we dont always get our part time and they change our schedules without telling us
bad,Pepsi is ok place to work I have been there for 12 years it is a good job . They put more emphasis on college hires than promotions from within the company
bad,En el tiempo que yo trabaje en el cargo que yo  tenia no nos tenian mucha consideración por el mismo hecho que teniamos contrato con una empresa service.s
bad,Work life balance is ok but there is no opportunities for growth. Job security is next to nothing and no peace of mind. Some of the recent management decisions are questionable.
bad,Times for the bbq and breakfast were not communicated to employees very well and when I did show up at the time stated for the breakfast the food was nowhere to be found. The same for the bbq. I showed up at the time stated and no food to be found or being cooked. After doing some asking around it seems like the office workers got the full benefits of both events and that was it
bad,"If your looking to do the same kind of work everyday in a relaxed environment with many meetings, events, and free lunches this is your place. However if your looking to gain new skills, grow your career, and be productive this is not your place."
bad,"they were a ok company to work for until they had new management come in."
bad,"I honestly tried to prepare myself for the relief driver position but It was way worse than I expected. There is no structure. I guess the employees train you coming in as a new driver, which is crazy because everyone shows you different ways, some right some wrong. The pay structure is insane. Its better to stay in training your whole career at least that way those 12- 14 hour days wouldn't be so bad. Its rough. I have never done one of these reviews ever! But I had to for this place because It's pepsi!! I only lasted a week and that is sad. You can really hurt yourself because everything is so fast paced and heavy. But when you are getting paid 18cents a case you cant take your time and be safe because you will be there all day literally 14-16 hours"
bad,"Management always pushing against workers."
bad,inefficiency in pay. would not recommend to anyone to work. this is a last resort for employment. the pay rate is low and they pay by Chinese arithmatic
bad,40hr work week 4/10 schedule starts at 5am ending at 330pm. Hoildays you could be working until 6pm. There is room for growth and even managment opportunities.  Lots of driving and customer service. Its a stepping stone position to get your foot in the door. Hardest part is dealing with Rude managers or Backroom Recievers. Best part of the job is you manage your own time and route. Paid weekly with full benifit package. I would recommend this position for young adult that isnt in school.
bad,Pay is way below average especially for the work you do as a driver. Management can be very shady and show alot of favoritism. You work about 12 to 13 hours and when you take to long be prepared to be asked what's taking so long while your supervisor is in their nice cold office drinking Pepsi. Benefits are very good with a pension is about as good as it gets! Be prepared to deal with rude customers all day
bad,Excessive Workload with no support - Management doesn't know Processes. Jobs outsourced to India causing more processing mistakes and loss of customers.
bad,The company changed over time. They changed all sales people into merchandisers. They were able to phase out people who were not able to keep up with pulling pallets and stacking cases.
bad,Trabajo organizado y bien distribuido...buen trato entre trabajadores
bad,"Extremely dull place to work. That's not a terrible thing if you have privacy. But when you look out at the sea of frowning faces where everyone is as miserable as you are, it starts to wear on you."
bad,"Its a typical warehouse job. You pick items. If you are willing to work your hardest, both physically and mentally for 10 hours straight, this is the job for you. The job payed well."
bad,13-15 hour days during the summer andblackouts for time off around all major holidays. Not a day or two more like week before and after. Seeing my child is too important for that . Work would be great for a single person and the Benefits were reasonable and outstanding.
bad,5 days a week but are mandated for the 6th day so you only get 1 day off. No family time. No time for anything but work and work. Long hours not a problem. Give employees 2 days off in a row for christ sake.
bad,For a temp job it was a great learning experience with friendly staff. It was not a permanent position and the salary was low. I enjoyed the management as well.
bad,It used to be a great place to work. However due to lack of change and keeping up with those changes management has lost focus resulting in poor performance.
bad,"hard to  maintain a work life balace when you see 3 or more 15 hour shifts back to back weekly. physical labor, nonstop lifting of 20-30 lbs cases of product."
bad,No work life balance. Poor management. Most of them have no idea what they are doing. No room to grow. Long hours. Pay is ok but compare to what you do is not worth it
bad,If you like working ten hours a day six to seven days a week than this job is for you. Pepsi got a new warehouse system called geo. It takes twice as long to do half the work. Management cries about not hitting numbers. They love to compare Apple's to oranges.Management wonders why we can't hit the numbers we hit last year.
bad,It is a hierarchal company with many levels of leadership.  It taught me alot and strengthened my analytical skills and interpersonal skills.  The hardest part of the job was working with union personal
bad,"Many managers within PepsiCo were very good, however some left much to be desired."
bad,You'll make pretty good money and have lots of benefits and your family will have everything they need.. EXCEPT YOU! Youll enjoy endless days stocking cold coolers and nasty dollar general shelves.
bad,"As a part time job, this company is great. However, for full-time, there is very little recognition from management about your job performance. Management also does not generally follow their job descriptions and are usually in ""meetings"". In a merchandising role, it is expected that you align your work day hours with the delivery times of the orders you work. This could mean that you start your day at noon if your orders are on a late truck, and you do not find out until maybe the night before, but most often the morning of. As sales, it is expected that you work a 10 hour day minimum, even though your salary is based off an 8 hour day. You are given no sick days, and your holiday days are very ""negotiable"" in the way that if management has already cleared your holiday but decides they need you for one of the days, they will just take away that day."
bad,PepsiCo looks to hire and promote younger employees and older employees have a tough time getting promotions.  Management continues to add more and more to your work load.  A very stressful place to work and the demands are overwhelming and you are not compensated enough for the work that is demanded.  If local staff don't like you then you are doomed.  Every day is stressful.  The hardest part of the day is balancing all of the work that you have to get completed.  You are treated just like another number or machine.
bad,"The role is drastically underpaid. Huge amount of responsibility and not provided the resources to be successful. Success comes at a price of high price, constantly on call, and lack of respect."
bad,"A typical day at work for me was doing many things outside of my job description"
bad,My group was  a sweatshop with little if any opportunity for upward mobility. Unreasonable deadlines and too much work. Support units are constantly being asked to do more with less people with little appreciation.
bad,Pepsi was a very Physically demanding fast pace not enough realistic manifest time. hardest part is figuring out where to pull in to unload at very tight gas stations.
bad,"La compañía en términos generales es muy buena, la cultura y política q manejan es excelente, lo que ocurre es que hay algunas cabezas que imponen su ""política"" sobre los de la compañía"
bad,I worked for Pepsi/Frito Lay for 7 years. Started out part-time and ended being a supervisor of warehouse operations. Started out good when they needed me! Once I needed them they turned their backs on me. I was injured while at work and once I was Short Term Leave they exiled me from the company. Not one manager called to check up on their employee. I had plans to make this job a career for me and my family and that dream was ripped away from me once I was hurt on the job. Oh I passed the alcohol and drug test following the work injury.
bad,"Took orders from drivers packaged orders, operated fork lift, loaded trucks to order, moved trucks in and out of facility acquired minor fork lift expierience"
bad,"Far to many Contractors and Foreigners, Culture is not belittling. No advancement. No forward thinking. If you are not part of Producing or sales, you are not important."
bad,I started working there with no problem but then they started treating me with disrespect and no hope of advancement.they also didn't have much of structure.
bad,"- everyday is a work day including sunday"
bad,"Everyone always tried to throw eachother under the bus. There was no unity, very negative work environment. I was promised I was not going to have to work as many hours as I did when I got hired, i was promised a bunch of things that never happened when I was hired. I was just thrown out there to cover to departments with minimal training. I do not recommend this on any person, you have no life and no time really for your family, this job is only good for single people with no kids."
bad,I wasn't supportive of PepsiCo as a company due to the lack of support from management as well as HR. I enjoyed learning and networking at PepsiCo however I wouldn't recommend this company to others.
bad,I was very unhappy with Pepsi. A lot of wear and tear on my vehicle. I was a merchandiser and I traveled a hour every morning to my first location. I explained to management that this was unaccapetable and they did nothing about it. I asked for closer stores to work and they did nothing about it. They don't care about you!
bad,"I did this job !!! Manager transferred  from sales thinks if you tell him your out of date tech is malfunctioning you are making excuses. You must deliver to 95% of the machines on you schedule ever day . The route has been neglected and machines are full of out of day product. So you take it out , put all new in . And take All out of date back to truck .Three jobs, not one . I was working 14 hours a day and driving 30 mins!!! Pays good. But you earn ever penny putting up with the bull. Good luck to the person who gets this job . Pepsico is good . Just not full service."
bad,"When interviewing, try to get something in hard writing about your schedule. I was told work the week was Mon-Fri with an occasional Saturday, but was guaranteed one day off a week - typically Sunday. However Pepsi production runs 7 days a week. You may have a day off and then the day before mgmt will change the schedule without any notice and you're expected to work. The most I saw was warehouse working 27 days straight, no days off, with 'no end in sight' according to their mgr. In the winter time production slows and you'll then only work a few hours a week. Pepsi doesn't have a union and discourages you joining one to ask for better work hours.  The schedule isn't consistent and mgmt can't seem to find one that works. Dept heads constantly butting heads. Production, lab, sanitation, and warehouse can't see to agree on one schedule so things are always erratic. Be prepared for NO days off. The machines constantly break down. This is a pro and a con: when they break down you usually have a lot of standing around time to clean or take a break. The con is that you get further behind in production and have to work extra days to catch up. But you never catch up."
bad,"On your feet working from the time you come in typically for 12 hours straight. You have an hour lunch break, but they try to make you only take 30 minutes. The managers are careless and don't have you properly trained. The pay is a great, but its a stressful environment."
bad,"job requires long hours on awkward shifts."
bad,very stressful and management is unfair. forced to work other co workers load and treated unfair with favoritism. management did a unfair job giving job duties and did not take extra step to make sure everyone is done
bad,"Management pushes all of their responsibilities to those lower leaving too much on ones plate and no on theirs "
bad,"Keep very busy in in repairing bottling and canning machines"
bad,Its a nice job got room for moving up and raises. Pay depends on you and your work ethic. Management wasnt so good when i was there but its new management now so it may be better. I enjoyed the more you sale the more you make process.
bad,"Local management has no clue of how to manage or lead a group of great people.this is not normal ,a few bad apples can ruin a career environment,the products in there portfolio are dominating in a changing environment"
bad,A typical day at work is pretty much ok. Hardest part of the job is keeping the machines up and running. Management isnt all that great. Its ran pretty poorly.
bad,worst training program ever. I got some experience with popular brands but honestly sold my soul to make it happen just not worth it. management is horrble
bad,"There is little to no advancement opportunity at current location unless you are the favorite of those in charge. More work is placed upon us each year without increased composition. Multiple employees do not perform their jobs properly and still keep their positions. The rate of pay is great and the benefits are wonderful, but the demands are stressful, without thanks or true appreciation."
bad,"incomo todos los dias muchas juntas todos los dias, el compañerismo no es bueno"
bad,"-a lot of walking back and forth through out the warehouse"
bad,"llegar temprano a diario para escuchar la junta de los planes de trabajo, aprendí a buscar nuevos clientes y estrategias de gerente, haci como una buena relación con mis colegas, lo mas difícil fue no tener un horario ordenado para comer y lo que mas me gusto tener reconocimiento a mis resultados."
bad,No la considero tan buena xq también la promotoria la lleva una agencia y la agencia no respetar tu contrato
bad,"I would never work for or reccomend this employer to anyone. Expectations were not standardized. Meaning, not every person was held to the same standard"
bad,"As an employee in the IT (BIS) department and ISG (Information Security Group) you will spend most of your time managing the two MSSPs (BT and HCL) to ensure work is getting done. Similar to other large organizations progress is slow and includes many layers of bureaucracy. Much of the environment is legacy (00's or older) with little movement to upgrade to new hardware or architectures."
bad,"As a merchandiser you're required to meet with management at every account you visit and anyone who has ever done this job will tell you that occasionally you come across the manager that has a power trip or is just a completely rude person. Well aftrr 4 years of dedicated service i was terminated without hesitation for simply asking a manager where he wanted me to move pallets to. No exaggeration no attitude just a legitimate question. Said manager felt it was necessary request me out of the store. So despite never having a write up for 4 years!!! I was terminated for asking a simple question because said manager apparently wanted to make someones day bad. Sad part is my ""supervisors"" did nothing to take up for a loyal employee and a single parent who's child is soley dependent of me. So if you dont like the fact that your job is in the hands of another that you dont even work for i advise you to seriously consider another opportunity."
bad,"pay is great and the guys on the floor are amazing. But the management and most supervisors are clueless. They have children running the warehouse floor who don't know nothing about warehousing. They talk down to employees and treat them with no respect. They fired me the day I was suppose to get hired, I had 5 hours left on my probation. Real classy bunch of people. They work you like no tmrw. Its a unionized place but the union here is useless also no one care about the employees. Prob one of the worst places I have ever worked."
bad,"My typical day is responding to work requests as well as handling routine duties in multiple PepsiCo locations in Westchester."
bad,"1.-visitar todos los puntos de venta logrando el volumen del dia"
bad,"I owe a lot to PepsiCo. I've learned a lot about being a good sales person, a great manager and other need to know knowledge. But it came with a cost. The company offers no work/life balance. Your hard work is paid fairly."
bad,"Over worked and under paid is the Pepsi motto.  Don't worry about getting fired, they have so many people quitting that they can't."
bad,"worst place I ever worked ! The management was terrible, the people that worked there were horrible ,long hours sometimes 15-16 hour days just a horrilble place to work !"
bad,up at 4am and heading to my first store. check to see which stores have loads or displays going up. refilled all coolers and shelves as well as maintained the stock rooms with our product.
bad,It was nice organisation and provide platform to each one to grow in their career.It is a nice experience to work with such a big FMCG company and running worldwide.
bad,il est désagréable et les chefs ne sont pas compétent mais franchement j'ai eu une très belle expérience dans le travail d’équipe
bad,Every Pepsi plant isn't the same.  The Pepsi plant in Indianapolis is not a good place to work for.  The management was very poor.  Many of the managers do not care anything about their employees and it is hard to have a life outside of the job. The employees know more about the jobs than the managers.  The managers do not like to listen to the employees about their thoughts and views.  They would rather treat their employees as slaves and just tell them what to do.  There isn't much room for growth unless you are willing to kiss butt.
bad,A typical day is spent driving around filling machines. Road conditions are rarely taken into consideration by management. Work is not that hard. The only thing that is hard on the body is the working in extreme elements. Cold or hot
bad,"i worked at sikeston depot just recently. they dont live up to their ""promises"" they make to you. i was a route salesman and would work from 6 in the morning to around 8 or 9 by the time you get your paperwork done. poor management and poor communication skills. this is not a career type facility, my check was screwed up almost every other week."
bad,"It's expected that you work overtime hours. LOTS of them. Sure, they pay you for the overtime hours, but what good is it if you can't find time to spend it?  And even though you dedicate your whole life to the company and pay in to disability and insurance etc...  If you get hurt, they basically brush you aside until they can get rid of you all together and leave you with nothing."
bad,life and work balance really is not good and the management is not good
bad,Job itself is ok when there are enough people there to do them. Mgmt is not very helpful and there is no ropm for advancement because of this.
bad,"lack of control by management"
bad,"The days are long and hard.  You start at 04:30a.m. and could end up working until 7:00p.m. You work alone, so micromanagement is not an issue and the benefits are great."
bad,"Paid weekly, delivered and stocked product in stores.12-14hr workdays can get old really fast."
bad,"Worked with some really great people in Johnstown plant. Worked in maintenance. Guys don't work together at all. I never worked anywhere in maintenance like Pepsi. The union was horrible. All it done was protect the people who should have been fired. Management consists of mainly fresh out of college kids. They may have a degree in underwater basket weaving but it got them the job. I took a different job making half the money but I have a home life and I don't hate going to work."
bad,"A typical day at work involves operating a forklift and selecting cases of soda for orders, through a voice pick headset. Management and warehouse employees are separate entities at Pepsi. Warehouse employees are under a union contract and it leads to a lot of conflict between the two. I love my coworkers but it seems that management will not work with you in any way, shape, or form to help if there is an issue. They talk down to you and like you do not matter when they want something done which is a terrible way to manage people. "
bad,"When I originally started as a merchandiser I was making full-time pay with ""fluctuating overtime"" which means I mad half my original hourly pay when working on overtime. I was moved to the warehouse and made to take a pay cut of almost a dollar an hour. I worked a lot of long hours in the warehouse and enjoyed some comparatively large paychecks. Eventually the overtime dwindled down as the high volume sales season was over and experienced a dramatic decrease in pay. Working at the Pepsi warehouse was a constant struggle with trying not to accumulate too much overtime so that one could stay healthy and enjoy valuable time with family and trying to make the time spent there worth one's while."
bad,The job promised isnt the job being carried out. The everyday workload creates a unbalance work and life balance. The hours are not matching up with the salary and commission.
bad,"The quality of people is what makes people stay in a very tough environment (multiple years of layoffs). Over the past several years senior management has had difficulty prioritizing thus making everything a priority with no relief to deadlines or resource constraints, unequivocally beyond reasonable."
bad,"If you are looking for that first job or looking for a job for the summer while in school then Pepsi might be what your looking for. If in fact you are looking for long hours to make money. A typical day for a pack out guy is to go to his stores build displays, manage the inventroy and place orders. Very labor intensive and you must be able to work on your own."
bad,"They are always hiring every quarter. You will be annoyed by many overseas cheap recruiters calling you with insulting rates at short term assignments. It's very easy to get the job but, very hard to keep it because of budget and office politics. It's been almost 8 years since I've worked there. The companies are made up of various consultants and it's a revolving door no matter how good you are as an employee or a person."
bad,there Is absolutely no home and work balance do you work five days a week most likely being forced an extra four hours each one of them days you will also be forced on your one day off up to 12 hours! Personal time can be denied and is often done so! The place refuses to qualify for people to prevent wearing others out!
bad,The pepsi plant off Laporte freeway racism is very much alive. I quit not only because they break their own policyl but they also treat their hard working employees like the dirt off the bottom of tgeir shoes
bad,I worked for Pepsi in San Diego. you will be working 6 days a week and 1 of your days off you will be on call. they will call you pretty much every time and if they don't you won't get paid for waiting. also you won't know your 1 day off until the Friday before. if you can deal with the schedule the job it self is ok.
bad,"Don't bother, the district leaders are not what you think. Filling in for sales reps, some will pound into their DG's, not rotate product and make what appears to be easy, a rather large misconception. Pay is good, but you get the blame when drivers don't do their share of stocking."
bad,People that know the managers get management positions even if they don't do quality work. Hiding a bad job behind good facing was encouraged where possible.
bad,"Its a good place to make money, but forget your family time they mandatory you to work all day, they give you 12 hours worth of work for an 8 hour day"
bad,"Quality money to be made, poor management and long work hours.  Union dues, pretty good health insurance.  Poor relationship with venders, less talk more work."
bad,Fast pace working enviorment with good pay. Management has some political issues and they work their employees hard with not much time off to spend with family.
bad,"Me gusto trabajar ahi , pero  es muy demandante y competitivo"
bad,I have learned a lot about patience and what I should do in my career o proceed. PepisCo has taught me how to work based on process and  the way to improve it.
bad,The working team was excellent but the leadership needed improvement. The company promoted people for the wrong reasons. If you are excellent at a job that most people can't do then there is no growth opportunity.
bad,Very poor management peple not caring about the quality of their work management not caring employees not climate controlled very hot in summer very cold in winter
bad,"Management has a very hard time taking suggestions from employees. They take it personal as if you're disrespecting their ability to manage. Communication is horrible between departments. The different departments do not work as a team, it is like they are competing against each other to see who is more right, and which department is worse at doing their jobs. There are very simple fixes to these issues that management refuses to address. This is why there is an outrageously high amount of turnover at the company."
bad,Ok time there is stressful. Long hours. Usually 16 hours per day 5 - 6 days per week. Good money but no home life at all. Management succs and they are always stressed
bad,"My first day I started with three other people. We were all sat in a room and were rushed through packets of paperwork with hardly any time to read it and sign. Some were pertinent to our job, others were not. We weren’t given a copy of our union contract either. The manager, who apparently didn’t even work at that location, but somewhere in Maine, then proceeded to hand us off to a trainer. This was literally no more than 15-20 minutes after we had walked in the door. No mention was made on benefits offered and how to sign up, etc. We then proceeded to follow our  “trainer”, I use this term loosely, around the warehouse as he used a powered pallet jack and selected cases of drinks. We did this several times as he completed the orders and brought them to the truck. About two hours into the shift we were then thrown to the wolves to do the jobs entirely on our own. There was no training on the powered pallet jacks, which I’m sure OSHA would have a field day with. Good thing I had already operated them before but someone without any experience may have had a tough time. All in all, my first night I worked 12 hours with just a half hour lunch, no breaks. We were told by our trainer that’s all we were allowed. There is no set end time and even when the orders are all finished we had to spend another hour+ sweeping and cleaning. I guess my point is if you like to work almost non stop for 12+ hours and receive little to no on the job training this job is for you. The starting pay is decent (21.15) but isn’t worth the effort."
bad,Its full of chanllenges and there is new learning everyday. The culture is very positive and working environment is very nice. There is work and fun together so there is no dull moment.
bad,Expect way too much from an employee in 40 hours. They always are seeking you to do wat too much. The pay and benefits are good but the work life is terrible
bad,"Learning the Core aspects of the job was easy because, the job is extremely hard. Your superiors expect you to work like you are professional. What i meant with professional is that they want you to know everything about the job even if you are a newcome in this side of the workforce. Job's work to salary ratio is the worst 'cus you work so hard and it's not enough for your superiors. they always expect you to do more. it's 7-6 job and they expect you to work non stop during that time. It's just not humanly possible. You barely have a chance to eat something 'cus there's too much work to be done. Even if you do everyting by the book your supervisors always seem to find something to call and yell at. Again work is too much so you can't have a personal life. You basically go to work come home and sleep instantly 'cus you have to wake up way too early."
bad,"The hardest part of the job"
bad,"Je verdient er goed je boterham, maar om de paar jaar voeren ze een reorganisatie door waarbij het management verplicht wordt om te veranderen van positie of te vertrekken.  En dan is het ellebogen werk of 'marketeer yourself' om een mooie positie te bemachtigen.  Je wordt niet gepromoveerd op basis van je competenties maar op basis van hoe goed je jezelf kan verkopen door mooie presentaties te geven.  Als je dit fun vindt, ga er werken, anders blijf er weg."
bad,"PepsiCo needs to improve on their overall business. Everything from their lack of a solid training infrastrure, to systems and services, to creating a clean safe work environment for employees --- need focus and improvement. In all honesty, it was likely, the most difficult place I have ever worked."
bad,They will not work with your schedule. Not an Equal opportunity employer. It’s a mans world at Pepsi. They do not accommodate for your life outside of work.
bad,Management is terrible. Little to no training for incoming employees on all levels. employees definitely use the union to their advantage. i would never suggest applying here.
bad,"seria melhor se nao tivess as contratações por empresas tercerizadas que pagam muito pouco em relação ao serviço prestado,e sem condiçoes básicas de trabalho com intervalo par uma ginastica laboral,horário não muito bom para as refeições."
bad,Long days and weekends. Nothing is very consistent except for the inconsistency. A very high turnover rate. Upper Management Lack knowledge of production equipment and unrealistic expectations.
bad,"I was a sales rep in the San Francisco Bay Area for a little over a year and half. I'm not sure if it was a Bay Area issue, because I had heard more positive reviews from my colleagues on the East Coast. Turnover rate in sales at Pepsi is incredibly high. Pepsico is an wildly antiquated and unorganized company from a sales perspective. The CRM is outdated, all processes are ancient. Sales reps are expected to confront customers who haven't bought for their coolers back, and bring in the police if they don't comply. If you don't schedule this, you'll be asked weekly by your manager why it hasn't been done. Sales reps are also doing physical site surveys of restaurants - something typically done by licensed installers. They are expected to answer their work cell phone all hours of the day. KPIs (key products you're expected to sell) don't match the market you're selling into. There is no commission and you get a bonus as a sales rep that is MAYBE less then 4% of your salary."
bad,The pay here is awful.  Days on the job can be quite boring.  You don't feel included and work is just given to you with no real thought pattern to innovate.
bad,Come to work at 3 am get off work when route finished. Enjoyed supervisor liked job okay. Working the Elements hot or cold.Enjoyed the pay.Learned Merchandising and Display work.
bad,"The pay doesn’t compensate for the work, the work load increases every week, any complaints you have falls on deaf ears and to say the job is physically demanding will be an understatement"
bad,This could be a great place to work if the company truly evaluate their staffing and equipment. If you’re a new driver don’t apply! You’ll just be setting yourself up for failure! They have the blind leading the blind in instructing how to drive their horribly outdated trucks! Yes trucks in their fleet are 20yrs plus old and they stick new driver with them! Yet they’re still hiring! Go figure!! Ha ha What a joke!
bad,"Not a career. No opportunities to take initiative. Your managers are worried about one thing: Speed. If you don't have it, they'll tell you every day until you have it. Managers want to be there less than the employees. If someone doesn't show up, it'll extend your shift by 1-2 hours per person."
bad,"They work you to death.The pay is great, however the management is a joke.You can’t win at this place it’s rigged for you to fail.I would not recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"Management did not address the issue of harassment from coworkers, slowly cut hours to make getting to work and paying bills impossible. Basically forcing employees to quit. Unequal working conditions"
bad,"It's all about money not there employees like most of corporate america, gotta watch your back, do your job and always expect the unexpected it's safer that way."
bad,"Long hours were worked when I would ask for help on my route so that I wouldn't violate DOT regulations I never received help."
bad,"Worked for Pepsi for about 5 months, (have to travel for orientation) and a position came available for full time, I applied for the position and then they transferred someone else in and told me I wasn't preforming to their expectations and brought up audits from months prior that are supposed to be reviewed by management and employee on a weekly basis."
bad,"Not a bad job at first, positions open up frequently offering chances for advancement or other assignments.  The job itself isn't bad and can be quite rewarding.  Some of the management there have a sincere desire to make it a batter place and are great to deal with.  Others are on power and control trips and will question your actions until you can be found at fault.  Monday morning quarterbacking is an art form and in a meeting typically you get questions you cant answer, followed by what you should have done, then more work.  They walk away all puffed up beating their chest and you slowly build up a deep resentment."
bad,"Good place to work if you are all ready stable in life."
bad,management required more of others than of themselves. The team aspect of the job was a lot of fun though. I learned a lot about team building while working for each other.
bad,Average day you get there get the updates and get to building pallets. This was my first warehouse experience so the biggest thing I learned was how the warehouse environment works.
bad,There is a high turn over rate thus extending the work hours of current employees in addition to not providing adequate coverage during each shift. Work/life balance is poor
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working at Pepsi to anyone.  The managers are horrible, their behavior and work ethics give the company a really bad reputation. The worst part is the pay and benefits are so good, no one stands up for themselves."
bad,"easy job and layed back. hardest part is no weekends off with family. working with the public is a bonus, always changing environment. not a lot of options to progressing with the company."
bad,"I began this job to help pay for school and to be able to move as a young student. The first year went smoothly until management changes created a year of troubles. Poor scheduling, lack of accountability all ending in a random email telling me part time postions were ending and that either I sacrifice school or my spiritual beliefs to maintain the job. i was hired as a student to provide support and did that extensively over an average of 30-40 hors a week for 3 days a week. I feel like management was very incompetent in the handling of our team and refuses to help out its employees while expecting 50160 hours work weeks."
bad,"I think it is important when reviewing PepsiCo to call out the group that you are working in, as they are very different from each other. I have good things to review on NAB (North American Beverages) Supply Chain, Transport, Finance, and other groups that I collaborated with. The Control group is where I worked full time. The group is completely overstaffed and the people do not realize it because it they have never worked outside of Pepsi Control (it's just a matter of time before corporate realizes it). A lot of complaining, a lot of politics, lack of management support, no leadership vision, no career mobility, and no real complex challenging work. If you are coming from a tier 1 company with a good culture, and good people, you will find the transition very difficult. I was in role for 2+ years and there were literally zero learning opportunities presented, no live training, no real development plans for people, it's a mess and I was shocked. People are nice, but there are too many employees that have been in role for 20+ years with no movement, stuck in the same inefficient processes day after day, with no motivation to change, and simply waiting to retire. Reminded me of a parking lot for retired airplanes in the middle of no where. The groups culture is awful and very low performing. If you are a high performer and looking for a high performing environment, control is a career delayer like no other."
bad,"I went to PepsiCo proud that I would work for a prestigious Company, but found the place to be competetive and cut-throat. They would keep good people by improving the work culture"
bad,They are always reorganizing some part of the total organization.  They can't decide what to call areas of the world and shuffle around markets to other sectors.  IT is always in an upheaval with changing of organizational structure and outsourcing.
bad,I loved my job and loved what I did but am constantly fighting for my check they hardly ever paid me right and would take their time to get you back what your owed
bad,"Things started out great, but took a turn for the worst; lack of training, no accountability, dishonest management, treat employees poorly, and poor and old delivery trucks."
bad,Los horarios de trabajo son muy extensos y tienes poco descanso
bad,"They have a lot of Good people. But it takes 6 Signatures/Time for most decision. Payroll in All Departments Suck, your Supervisors will Correct Payrolls constant mistakes. They would rather Hire , Hire & Hire than Pay a Good enough wage to keep Good employees."
bad,"Felt like a part time job. They want you to hustle through stops. Trucks and trailers are garbage(beat up). Union dues take most of your check.  Printer always failing. They're vary strict , write ups for every little thing. New guys get  routes no one wants to do. And work Saturdays. "
bad,Deben mejorar la calidad de vida de sus colaboradores y equilibrar la jornada laboral excesiva que están manejando.
bad,"Could be a lot better, but poor leadership and stale mentality creates low performance and terrible culture."
bad,Very hot and unclean environment..We often do not have the necessary specialty tools or common parts and consumables such as lubricants to complete our work..They pay very well which is the primary reason I held the position so long.There is zero communications in an environment that is changing from day to day.
bad,"Manage 20+ stops a day."
bad,I been at the company for three years and have learned a lot about being productive and achieving daily goals. Helping others and having strong communication skills. Can be a little tiring at times but overall make good money and good co workers are very helpful and understanding.
bad,"Managing my day and putting customer first."
bad,Pepsico was a good stepping stone and I learned a lot about team work but there was no over time and the pay was ok but not good for starting a family.
bad,"I will say the pay sucks for the back breaking work you do. A person who works there q day gets the same pay as a person of 20 years. Advancement in company is impossible. Save your back, joints and time and DO NOT apply.  Turnover is outrageous"
bad,Typical day you have 14-16 stops and you have to unload the whole trailer with a hand cart. You have to fill coolers and shelves in all drug and dollar stores. Average pay is about $650-$700/week. Good work/life balance. Home every night and off on the weekends. Management is clueless as usual. Trucks are horrible. They have heat but no ac for the summer time. If you are a experienced CDL driver there are plenty other local jobs where the pay is better with less physical torture on your body.
bad,"I experienced some politics based on positioning of jobs. "
bad,"Work is never over when you clock out.  My typical day is normally 12 hours if I am lucky. You take the job home and when you're swamped management is nowhere to help you.  Management is quick to find your faults but never praise you when you do something well.  If you have a family, forget it, you will be too tired and occupied with work. For a company that makes billions in profits our benefits is subpar and the pay is decent.  Pay will change year to year so expect paycuts."
bad,"Buen ambiente de trabajo en todo lo necesario , se requiere.."
bad,Working for PepsiCo is a strenuous and physically demanding job. The pay is decent the management is not. you are required to keep your hours under 40 for the majority of the year. You must do so by any means.
bad,"Good place to work, but union will bring you down.  Too many tenured disgruntled employees.    Nice location in Burnsville.   Strong leaders many move on too quick."
bad,"Not enough drivers; typical 15-16 hour days, great co-workers. Perhaps when the company hires more drivers and works out the kinks in a new delivery system the job will improve."
bad,"I joined PepsiCo nearly a decade ago and was promoted once during that time period.  The company has changed significantly in the last several years where there is little to no room for advancement unless you have been hired in under the graduate program.  Because of this, managers are out of touch with front line operations and cannot provide appropriate coaching to front line staff.  When I took my promotion I was given a huge pay cut and told I was lucky to even get that despite working nearly 12 hours a day producing exceptional results (as judged by their score card)."
bad,"A empresa com seus benefícios é muito boa, já sua administração é falha e quando há uma redução do quadro de funcionários não tem retorno, fazendo com que todos que nela trabalham ao sair levem ela na justiça do trabalho para reaver alguns direitos perdidos durante o trabalho, tipo horas extras e outras."
bad,"While I had great work life balance, being in infrastructure, there was no growth as it was hard to surpass seniority in terms of number of years. I had resources working there for several decades. I couldn't compete with them even after staying for 5 years."
bad,This company is good but the management are not that great. The employees are come and go because of the management who are currently running the administration.
bad,Its an alright job but you have to up sell on products they don't sell already and you get it trouble if you don't but usually the customers are in a hurry so it doesn't make since to try and up sell when they just swear at you and say no.
bad,"they focus on product and sales other then there employees they make you do things that you don't want too"
bad,good working culture good mamagment .....learn to many things
bad,"Pepsi MidAmerica requires long hours with less than competitive pay.  Regardless of the job title, they offer little in the way of training.  My HR manager complained on multiple occasions that she was never trained.  She did the best she could, but with a 94% turnover, she couldn't ethically continue to hire people into that environment.  New employees are expected to work at the same level as the veteran employees, but are not permitted commission until after their absent training is complete; which could take months.  The company has issues delivering orders accurately.  Commission employees are not paid for shortages which the warehouse fails to send out for delivery.  The worst part is that top management is either not informed of the issues, or is in complete denial that there are problems in the company.  I was hired as a territorial sales rep.  I did more work with route sales than I did with other TSRs,  After two months I was fired without a clear reason.  Pepsi MidAmerica also requires every employee to have a CDL, even those who will never sit behind the wheel of a truck.  They will pay for the test, but the employee pays for the medical exam.  After the test, the employee is locked in for two years or else said employee will pay the CDL fees."
bad,"You go into a grocery store and often see people filling shelves that don't work for the supermarkets, they are vendors. On the outside surface, it might sound like a chill, laid back job where you get to work by yourself, not have to have a manager constantly over your shoulder, and you can work at your own pace. If you think that is the job description of a merchandiser, you couldn't possibly be more wrong. "
bad,"Way, way, way, way, way, way, way......way too much merchandising! Store managers expect you to do all the work in the messy/trashed coolers. Pepsi management will treat you like dirt. Sales reps are lazy, don't do what they are supposed to and will try to get you in trouble/written up every chance. Insurance is decent, BCBS, you will need it to get those back problems fixed. "
bad,This was one of the worse company's I have ever worked for in my life. They have to many chiefs and not enough Indians. It is like a sinking ship with no life boats. I had to watch my paychecks because if not they would try and jip you every time.
bad,"Only way you can have life outside of Pepsi is to be on a 12 hour rotation shift, or be a first shifter.  They will change your schedule and not tell you till the day before and expect you to change your plans, i.e. doctors appointments, family time, ect.  If you want to advance in your job good luck with that you can have the ability to do miricales but unless you are a friend of someone higher up don't expect to get a promotion.  Insurance sucks for families and they are trying to make everyone use a HSA plan."
bad,It is a sales position and have to be able to handle some stressful calls
bad,"Pepsi initally was a good place to work for but, over time they show their real colors. Pepsi is first and family is second always. Management could care less about you or your personal family issues or health issues. The union is weak and is in the back pocket of the company,over the years the renewal contracts get worse and more benifits are taken away from us. Pepsi and their insurance providers have cut many health plans conviently blaming Obamacare. Oppurtunity for advancement is next to none,they only hire management from the street and they hire the freshest ones they can find so they can meld them into mindless corporate pop militia who follow ridicoulus mandates and production schedules. Work here is unappreciated by mostly all  management and a large group of employees who don't care to do their job or they pass responsibility unto other employees of lower senority.these people show up just to collect a paycheck and have no pride in their work or no respect for the company.In conclusion if you a looking for work here do not unless you want to be treated like an mindless automaton and want to have no appreciation for the long hours you stay or the hard work you do.To let me reiterate i have worked here many years and over time the contracts get worse the job culture gets worse and the overall appreciation of the company by employees gets worse and it will not get any better there are no current plans for change as far as management is concerned for they don't care how the place is run as long as they don't get nasty emails from corporate and they are left alone to sit"
bad,"Fun job, lots of independence.  Little room for advancement either monetarily or professionally.  Watch your back if your not one of the favorites. They keep taking away the little things that made the job rewarding."
bad,pays well but the work load is very heavy. Competition has four or five employees for the task of one Pepsi employee.
bad,"Eat, sleep breath Pepsi..if you don't there is no advancement and there was a reason Pepsi Ventura had a 90% divorce rate..but perfect for single men and women. Horrible communication and terrible support most of the time work on your own."
bad,"Engarrafadora da Pepsi Cola, de origem argentina, não tinha estrutura definida de atuação no país, sofrendo com suas próprias crises, gerando problemas de gestão e de comprometimento com a equipe."
bad,"At the plant I am at, there is a double standard, the people with the high level of work ethic, are held to a higher standard, than the people who are weak in work ethic and effort. To much information to selected few, open communication to the select few. To much ""not want to hurt feeling"" attitude in stead of, work ethic, skill level, effort and results..oriented thinking.."
bad,Building loads for stores and loading them onto trucks. Wrapping and sorting drinks.
bad,"Customer service and satisfaction is emphasis of the team, from Sales Managers, the sales teams, merchandisers and the warehouse. I have a lot of great co-workers!"
bad,"Not a good company to work for if you value having any family life. Upper management seemed to find flexible scheduling a ""joke"" and would make promises they didn't intend on keeping. Employees were team players and a joy to work with, immediate Supervisors were amazing (But most left because of upper management)"
bad,poorly managed company doesn't care for there drivers you are a number and that is it. Little to no communication that is just the start. good health insurance the best I can say
bad,"I worked in IT all 7 years. The business culture has shifted to a primarily contract culture, with no room for advancement/growth as they continue to downsize/complete turnover."
bad,"The hours were long and there was good leadership at first but then came change. More 'bosses"" brought in with minimal experience in sales. To be truly successful you would need to work over 60 hours per week. The job became more about how many customers you can get in and out of each day instead of going in and providing the best possible service. Too many accounts to service each day with the amount of tasks that were expected to be accomplished."
bad,"Union facility, you are paid the same if you're a hard worker or the laziest person around. Pay is nowhere near the rate of LA or Riverside. The pension the union has pays out so little you'll never be able to live in Southern California without getting another job to supplement your income."
bad,"Great place to work it was bit stressful as a relief driver. "
bad,The hayward factory ran my a bunch of managers that think they have power over everyone. Worst company to work for go to school kids get an education.
bad,"D Bay  delivery  driver  was  a  hard position. I was at work by 4am off around 4 to 6 pm.  I had to rotate and, stock shelfs, coolers ,all around fairly hard heavy fast pace work."
bad,What time I have been at Pepsi the staff and managment are all super friendly. They are outgoing as far as anything you need to know or help learning. but equipment is worn out and pay is not very good.
bad,"Overall the job was good, I had to venture out for better. The job is great for learning warehouse. The staff was friendly. The job is not climate controlled."
bad,Did not like the management that was in place. This company was not employee friendly to say the least. Management did not hold individuals accountable for their actions.
bad,Work to many hours for the little pay that you get and management doesn't make any better by being bullies all the time. Management only cares about themselves.
bad,If you are young good place to work and get started with driving skills and people skills learn how to use hand helds dollies and weather driving cause always have get out and make deliveries
bad,"I have been working at PepsiCo for over a year now.  The pay is quite good. However the structure is one of seniority over merrit, because of this it is difficult to move up as everyone has 10+ years on you. This means with everything, you are at the bottom and the system is built around keeping those guys with seniority happy at your expense. On heinsight I would not have taken this job. "
bad,Issues with crazy coworkers and low pay. Long hours and poor sanitation schedules everything was breaking due to never cleaning and stickiness of syrup on everything.
bad,"If you're looking for a short term job, this is for you."
bad,Bad and rude sales reps merch supervisors make you work 6 days for ALL holidays Work loads are extreme they can track where you’re at 24/7 and sometimes store managers are very unfriendly and blame you for another workers mistakes
bad,"Ambiente agradável,pessoas interessadas a compartilhar seu pós e contra e uma visão ampla da empresa.eu recomendaria pessoas a trabalhar nesta empresa.seus benefícios são bons e estar por dentro da produção e fantástico."
bad,The customers I delivered to were extremely rude and difficult to deal with. A short day is 12 hrs. Routes were determined remotely by someone who has never ran the route or has even been in the state. Trucks and equipment were constantly broken. In several instances you picked up more out of dates than you delivered. Very well paying job and even better benefits.
bad,building was very dirty and the structure of the center is that you are on your own. There are teams but they have nothing in place it one team does better than another which does not encourage team work among co workers.  Team builders are gear toward 1st shift workers which is when management is in house.
bad,To much to do in one work day and some of the sales reps there ordered way to much product. I was always yelled at by the stores to clean up the backroom.
bad,Great company for benefits and pay. Trying to advance from within is extremely hard and can take multiple years compared to campus hires. I seen a District Manager of 20 years loose a position to a campus hire of 2 years. To many leadership changes. Average hours company wants per week are 52-55 for my position. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the change in leadership. It is also very hands on and physically exhausting at times. Leadership can tell you one thing then change there decision the next week. I like that I get to see the inner workings of many large businesses. Incentives are great and attainable! Many sales are pre-sold and your pay is pretty consistent with what your told it will be.
bad,This place is super stressful and going to hourly pay only made it worst. If you are a brown noser this is the job for you the more you interact with higher ups the better you are. I liked to go to work and then get home to my family so i didn’t chitchat as much as other and i was treated a lot worst even though i did my job better than the majority.
bad,"-Long work hours start at 5am or before and ending after 5pm or later"
bad,"Work 10-12 hours a day with low compensation. After a long day out, you get back to the plant and management will send you back out with a reload to another account."
bad,"It has good foundation , most of the things are in black and white in terms of expectations , roles and day to day errands."
bad,Management has plenty of issues. However most of those issues trickle down to merchandisers. Fairly easy job if you know how to work hard and long hours. Definitely not rocket science. Unfortunately not many know how to run a team of merchandisers in order to get the job done effectively and efficiently.
bad,"PepsiCo is just another dinosaur based in Westchester County, unable to keep up with the times and focused on cost-cutting to drive profitability.  There is no innovation within the company.  It is very cutthroat and people at the top are only focused on survival rather than managing the company forward.  Senior leadership is incredibly focused on short-term goals to generate shareholder value and is not making the necessary investments needed to grow the company in the long term and to compete with new challengers in the food & beverage industry.  The company's products are bad for society and are killing off the population.  Health and wellness is never discussed nor is it in the company's vocabulary.  The organization is very political and there are numerous levels of management from entry level to CEO (significantly more than there should be).  The company is incredibly top-heavy and is no longer the gold standard when it comes to corporate governance and oversight.  Avoid working here if you are interested in working: in a meritocracy, in an entrepreneurial spirit, in a fast-paced environment, in a flat organization, in an organization that rewards intellects and out-of-the-box thinkers."
bad,"sales, customer service. nworking in a warehouse style enviromen with deadlines that are hard to meet  , some times its fun but not all the time, a lot of double standards"
bad,"Fast paced environment. No work life balance. Expected to be on call 24/7... even at 3am if someone calls out."
bad,Did all that i could to achieve a full-time position with the company but union employees always received positions over me. The work environment was a typical production/warehouse environment. Union employees can use their senority over you because you are a seasonal. Work schedule can change DAY to Day. Dont make any plans for your off time because your days off can change at the blink of an eye.
bad,"Muy buen ambiente laboral y mucha flexibilidad en horarios. Mucho que trabajar ya que no tiene buenos jefes no hay crecimiento, repartición de trabajo no es igual, no hay retroalimentación de tu trabajo, burocracia al momento de asignación de salarios y crecimiento, dan preferencias en cuanto tipo de escuelas donde realizaste tus estudios. Empleados externos el trato es diferente no tiene las mismas oportunidades de crecimiento."
bad,Buena empresa salí por falta de materia prima y acuerdo mutuo
bad,"Management is constantly looking to fire people. Job itself is great, but you are constantly having to fight for your job. Thingsare constantly changing."
bad,Pepsi is a good company with great benefits. Schedule is a little crazy hours are long. I worked overnight as a loader but sometimes were required to work 16hr shifts. Job is physically demanding and can be very stressful
bad,just dont get enough hours and most quit the job when they cant transfer to other departments in their current state.several months with less then 40 hours
bad,Es una empresa que no da estabilidad laboral ya que solo dan la oportunidad por un mes y lo sacan
bad,Bad management  and corporate take over was the main issues with this location I was there before corporate came in and forced good people out and took away all perks
bad,"Extremely heavy workloads, long days, no team support, very little communications between associates, usually causing miscommunications and complications throughout work days."
bad,If you dont mind working long hours.The money is good benefits are also good. The goals set out by management are high and achievable . Managers are helpful and will work with you to achieve your goals
bad,The dynamic of the busy is forever changing. Shows that you can be here for 30 years and gone the next day. mixed emotions about the descriptions of the job duties and responsibilities.
bad,The company has more chiefs then Indians. Another big issue is that you get moved around a lot even though you have your own personal route day to day
bad,"The job required you to work 8-12 hour shifts. There was no set time of when you were to get off work management could keep you for however long they wanted. Had to push metal crates full of orders all day long, that could weigh easily 250 pounds or more. Only get one 15 minute break. The only  upside is the bay was decent."
bad,"This job pays well, but not well enough for what you are asked to do on a daily basis. The work loads are not evenly split amongst the routes. Some people will have to give there whole life to the company to complete their day and other do next to nothing. The management doesn't fix problems for you and often times betrays your abilities to temporarily fix a problem. If you want to stay at this job as a career prepare for a lot of politicking and lying, If money isn't everything to you and you want to have a job you love to show up to this isn't the job for you. No one I know actually likes the job they just like the pay."
bad,"Challenging and upbeat never a dull place, learned a lot about the flow of product and cleaning procedure. Love the environment but needs better management. it was very exciting to learn all that information about the filler and maintenance of the machines."
bad,"Working with Pepsi requires you to work long hours, and does not give you time to spend with your family. Co-Workers are great, the hardest part of the job is long hours."
bad,"There is no support from upper management, ball gets passed around on tasks with no one taking charge to get something done. Lack of communication between team members, don't follow protocols evenly between employees. Meetings are never taken seriously and have poor attendance. Poor training procedures and outdated materials. Only good part of about this job was going home at the end of the day."
bad,"You visit your assigned accounts sell and merchandise. Long hours on variable route overtime, which means the more you work the less you get compensated for OT. Management was constantly changing I went threw 3 supervisors one year. Your co-workers are in the same boat so they relate. I met great co-workers who moved on as I did. Good work experience if you are just entering retail but if you have a family it's not worth it."
bad,"Worked multiple 16+ hour shifts and had to be back within or less than 8 hours, most days were within the same week. Short breaks"
bad,"poor work enviorment "
bad,"the job was good money up until last year when i took a $40,000 paycut. Instead of the ceo who makes 16,000,000 a year taking a pay cut you  have to take from the working man who makes this company who it is today!!"
bad,Go to multiple stores and bring stock forward to the floor.  Load shelves and take excess back to warehouse.
bad,"Manually move freight, stock, or other materials or perform other general labor. Includes all manual laborers not elsewhere classified."
bad,"Tenias  que  trabajar  en  zonas  inseguras,  consumia   mucho tiempo.."
bad,"fue una experiencia buena por que nos dejaban trabajar sin presion de tiempo de descarga, nos apoyaban cuando existia algun problema con los camiones eran atentos en cualquier problema."
bad,"Typically work from 530 am to 7 pm. Many Saturdays and Holidays. on call always."
bad,"A normal day of work usually starts before the sunrise.  It involves building displays, making orders, and being in constant communication with store managers.  I've learned how to resolve problems by communicating with your boss and store management until both parties are pleased.  I've also learned a lot about sales projections and how many steps are really involved with production.  For the most part you only see management once a week at meetings.  Most all of communication is handled by phone and email.  At Pepsi I have responsibility over one route.  Co-workers in a sense do not exist, you are working by yourself day in and day out. The hardest part of the job is making sure you stay on schedule.  Many stores have specific times that they want you in and out.  If any problems occur, it can mess up the time schedule for the remainder of the day.  The most enjoyable part of the job is never staying in the same place.  It just makes the day seem to go by faster by traveling from location to location, and never being at the same place the entire day. "
bad,"I was trained in many fields like QC, microbiology and chemist"
bad,"I learned a lot about food science, I liked many of my colleagues, but my direct manager was unprofessional and zero as a scientist."
bad,it was a good place to work about 6 years ago thing have change a lot there sense then no fun at all.....................
bad,"There is an abundance of yes men. Some people are great to work for (one manager comes to mind) but, as we call them in the office, there are a lot of stooges. Let the inmates run the asylum."
bad,"worked lost of hours for little pay, often mistreaded by store managers. hard work not a long term carrer"
bad,Stock soda in numerous grocery stores. Tons of driving in your own vehicle while losing resale value on it. Not knowing when you were getting off work which is very difficult when you have children.
bad,"Day to day is very different. Your start and end time varies and you are usually only in the office about twice a week. Other days you will be doing manual labor in the stores. Workplace culture is not a priority, no inclusion, no support, bad communication and very disorganized."
bad,"Although I was only there for 6 months, I left due to the terrible work life balance. I worked 4 am to 7 pm almost daily. They do not appear to care or take care of their employees."
bad,"Very stressful, back breaking, hard work.  I got robbed while I was at work and supervisor told me not to call the police.  I worked an entire week where at the least I get 14 hr.  That week I got nothing.  If it was easy laid back work I would be still there because the pay was good.  But other then that it was one of the most crazy experience."
bad,Really poor equipment.  Trucks with no ac. Pallet jacks don't work half the time.  Poor management.  They seem more confused than new employees.  Can't get HR on the phone.  Took a month and half to get direct deposit.  Had to wait 3 weeks to get 2 paychecks. Still haven't recieved uniforms at almost 2 months.
bad,"Pepsi is an awful job for most people however the environment is very free spirited it's not a well organized company but the people are great for the most part, for the average person I would not recommend working at Pepsi-Midamerica but I personally liked it. They do not give their raises on time, their health benefits are very poor, and the starting pay for the type of work it is is very low."
bad,"Very physical  and fast pace, high energy job, lots of pulling and pushing of hand truck, friendly  environment. Lots of different  ethnicity friendly  customers room for growth. Merchandising  to truck driver to trailer driver. It a union job with good benefits"
bad,Great salary and benefits but poor work life balance and stressful culture
bad,"the company gave me some sales lessons that I've used in my current jobs."
bad,"Long hours ,no family life.  Good pay....... the location where your working is important. Often you are spread as thin as possible to do the most amount in a designated amount of time"
bad,"Uma Empresa muito boa, mas o trabalho e muito pesado deixou a desejar muita pressão, não gostei"
bad,"Everyone tries to backstab everyone, managers have no clue about the animosity. Easy work if you can deal with unfair biased management. If you are a brown noser you will do great here"
bad,Worked a year here and gained experience. Tough tough work. Benefits were surprisingly good minus the health insurance which was trash. They cook for you time to time give you free shoes and shirts
bad,Sometimes I'd be given a task to complete as a merchandiser and the person that was sent to work with me wouldn't show up. I'd be left to complete the task by myself. Managers rarely would offer any help.
bad,"Great place to begin a career and learn new skills. Management loves to allow freedom and development of talent, however, will not promote or advance based upon it. Most employees are well under market value for their skills and years of experience. Promises of promotions are always given, but never come to fruition."
bad,It was a great job for a highschool kid. Working evenings after school and mornings or evenings on the weekends. But holidays were crazy busy though..
bad,"I was originally hired in 2016 to work 5 days a week (Mon - Fri) and an occasional weekend on call. Shortly after I started I was advised we would have to work weekends (every 4th weekend). Which wasn't terrible. About 6 months after that we were told all supervisors would be moved to a Sun - Thurs or Tues - Sat shift. But, we weren't given much of a choice on hours. And now our schedules are changing again. I will work only 3 days a week which is great but, it is every Sat, Sun, and Mon. I will have no time with my family on weekends. This isn't an option. It was a decision made by HR and management so they do not have to work weekends."
bad,"Okay, if you're not ready to put 40 miles on your car a day. Keep it moving. Now, after gassing up for your 6am start up. You will be working 3-4 stores in random areas for 10 mo. They can be easily 5-10 miles apart. Your management will be sup par, but you grow to like them from a distance. (THATS A PRO) Once you become ""Full time"" life will get slightly better but thats 18 months in. You don't get respected until you get to full time. If you know your life is bigger than pepsi get your money and leave. If this is the place for you. Go get some time under your belt and go to Coke-Cola."
bad,"One of the most stressful jobs I've ever had; typical day you could easily work 10 to 12 hours. Chaotic warehouse with little to no training; most of the things you pick up by trial and error. Management is focused on your meeting levels of production quotas in order to be successful. They have over a 92% turnover rate, and I can see why. If you're one of the rare individuals who can succeed in this environment, you'll be ok. Otherwise, it's a rude shock for the rest of us."
bad,Our day usually started around 4 P.M.  and we would get off normally around 6 A.M. Some days we didn't get off till 9 or 10. We would use forklifts and electric pallet trucks to perform our duties. Our warehouse manager would only complain about how the day shift staff had to do the cleanup for us despite the fact that we were still exhausted from our 12+ hour shift the previous day. My whole time there i was constantly sore and tired and felt as thought management did not care about our health and safety. The long hours made it hard for us to rest which made it hard to focus. As the day dragged on it got harder and harder to safely operate the equipment needed to fulfill our jobs. The turnover rate was extremely high and we rarely had someone on shift with more than a year of experience at the company.
bad,Management was not open to new ideas unless it came from certain employees. Not much room for advancement. HR not familiar with circumstances as much as they should be
bad,"Empresa de grande porte, visa crescimento de seus produtos."
bad,"I assist in all processing of product in the warehouse. i clean and organize product in the warehouse. Book in, in going and out going trucks. I pack and store all product in the warehouse."
bad,E uma empresa muito boa salário ótimo la tínhamos 1:10 de almoço final de ano ganharmos um cartão de 150 de natal tínhamos u vale transporte vale alimentação cartão de compra de 150
bad,some days are longer then others. management was not the greatest. could do a little better about caring for employees.best part of the day was feeling free.
bad,"PepsiCo Detroit is poorly managed, struggling financially, and is not organized well enough to provide job satisfaction. There are options to relocate nationally, but very little within the location."
bad,"unless your in it for the money I wouldn't recommend this place, at least the Mesquite, TX location I cant speak for others just know that management is a joke"
bad,Your typical job as a local driver. Pay is weekly which makes it nice. Other than that salesman determines your pay. Hope for a good route or good salesman
bad,"I would drive and deliver products then rotate, merchandise, and stock. Management is not the best, but will give you more work than you want. Teamwork can be the best part of the job."
bad,"Strong management and talented people work at PepsiCo."
bad,"el trabajo diario es mas que dinámico, se aprende infinidad de cosas ya que tiene infinidad de areas con las que te relacionas."
bad,"Trying to run from one site to a next, management cutting down time to get work done, very hard to get all your task done.  Management is making all the money not enought o make a good living for general laborers."
bad,aonde agente fazia toda processo de expedição desde separa os pedidos a conferir e carrega as mercadoria arrumação do estoque
bad,"Working for a corporate company is always a challenge because of the amount of people involved that want to have control over situations. The company in general provides fair hours, fair pay, and good benefits. the hours however are hard hours. A lot of work that happens behind closed doors is work hard, NOT smart. being a merchandiser you have to many people that have control over what you do, and how you do it which can be frustrating at times. Merchandisers have to answer to their salesman who runs the route, the sales manager, the district sales manager, the merchandising manager, every last assisant manager in every store serviced, ever manager, every grocery manager ect. It is not the kind of environment in which some fit. Too many people in your ear at all times. Too many times you will see mabye 10 new guys hired, and within 2 weeks 9 will quit. It is a hard job, and although advancement is definatley there, it just becomes more stressfull the higher you work your up."
bad,"As a order picker you see alot of hours 10 to 14 hours a day. Tiny little 10 min breaks and a 30 min non paid lunch. Job its self is very physically demanding and repetative. The turn over rate is crazy, just simply said it is a revolving door. Not to mention the physical stress it will do to your body. Since I have worked there I have developed Planter fasciitis, carpal tunnle, tendonitis and back pain enough to take aspirin every day. People are always getting injured, I have yet to see past 20 days accident free. I don't recommend this job to anyone."
bad,"This is definitely a position for men. You service corner stores with strangers and spend the majority of your time in a  corner store cooler. Management rotates frequently, so you end up working for someone that doesn't understand the territory so they enter the market with biased views and unrealistic expectations. They believe that the Customer is always right, so be prepared to drop hotshots and other things on weekends and etc."
bad,"Helping costumers for there orders of soda"
bad,Set up printers on all lines make Shure employees are doing there gobs correctly.
bad,"Good job experience, Learned a lot about merchandising, more experience with interacting with clients"
bad,"Long drawn out days, everything is in repetition, they expect you to work fast and safe, just overall not an environment i would work in again"
bad,"When I had applied for a in-house opening, there was no notice for an interview before being called out in front of everyone that if I had the time we could procceed ASAP. Then a week afterwards, when they had reached a decision I was told in bassing by someone else that I was not being moved forward and they moved onto somebody else."
bad,"My daily routine would include being at work at 6 am. I would sign into a store then meet with a manager to discuss the needs of the day. Then I would unload pallets of drinks to the shelves and coolers. Then I would sign out and let a manager overlook my work before I left. That would be repeated at three to four stores a day. I learned better people skills, how to work on a steady pace and to be self motivated. My managers had there good days and there bad some days they would help and be there to discuss any isssues at hand, other days it seemed like I was just there and wasn't important. My co-workers were easy to get along with but were not there to help much. The job environment was look out for yourself, hardly ever any teamwork. The hardest part of my job was the poor teamwork. No matter how much I tried to help others the favor was never returned. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to work at my on pace."
bad,Company is disconnected from customer's needs. The benefits package is actually good as far as insurance. but there is not a lot of work life balance.
bad,"Company is awesome to be with and retired, benefits and stock purchase but here in San Antonio the management is unprofessnal no communication with each others no work ethics"
bad,Okay job to work for go ahead and try it out you might like it you might not it’s all up to you but honestly I didn’t care bout it  much cause I own it
bad,"Do yourself a favor and keep looking! Mechanics scheduled 7 days a week, an hour before your shift ends they’ll tell you they need you to stay over, mandatory OT for a minimum of 4 hours with no notice and no regard for anything other obligations  union dues, city wage tax $500 a month for medical  it’s a hokeorregard"
bad,"I started out in the warehouse which wasnt bad but you did go home sore, pay was good and you got feed good about once a month. I was talked into moving to a delivery bay driver which was a awful decision. It is way more brutal than the warehouse plus you have to deal with hateful store managers. You will work 55 to 65+ hours in the summer and hardly ever get any extra help. upper management cares but not enough to do anything about it. Then in the winter youll be lucky to get 40 hours. If you need to get CDL A experience then come here because they will hire you due to turn over rate being so high but i would leave after your year is up."
bad,"Chế đổ lương bổng ok . "
bad,modern day slavery. no work/life balance. company only cares about themselves. work you 13 + days with no days off. if payroll messed up on your check you have to wait until the next pay cycle to get your money. not organized.
bad,Hope it has changed. When I worked there it was like a zoo. The pay was not worth the amount of time you put in on the road. Good job for a single person. In my opinion
bad,"Very disorganized and managements view of what a supervisor responsibilities are unbelievable, supervisors are over worked and their managers lack the skills to do the job. Very high turnover rate for supervisors and managers. Piscataway is a horrible place to work. All of the numbers are fudged to make the score cards look good and if the numbers are not hit all (h) breaks loose at the weekly meeting, supervisors are under constant pressure to run lines and hit number and that's is only one of a number of other project that are assigned to you. constant verbal abuse, and they recruit a lot of college recruits and if your not political watch out."
bad,"To much harassment, always getting yelled at for absolutely no reason at all. Supervisors that treat everyone with disrespect. And a boss that doesn’t know how to run his own company."
bad,"Good company build great friemdships with many workers, management can use work with meetings. Merchandisers can use better uniforms due to alot of sweating in the field."
bad,This company hires contractors who are never given the opportunity for full time employment. The management and freedom are good.  The policies are bad.
bad,A typical day at pepsi as a driver consists of your starting around 5. you may have 2-3 bulk stops and about 10-13 regular stops. The job wouldn't be bad if they didn't overload the trucks plus the moral is very low amongst the drivers because the pay just changed from hourly to commission which makes sense for the company but sucks for the driver because we're still out there for 10-14 hours a day for less money. Occasionally we stay out for 16 hours. I don't think they appreciate the driver as much as they should....
bad,Pepisco was a great place to work the did a lot of wonderful thing for employees like bought us lunch give us adward give us time off when need  it every holiday they give us case of drinks they give us bonus  they have  a area we're we can go and get free drinks they have it we're you can get a better job opportunity
bad,"If you would like to advance in your career or have time to spend with your family, do not work for this company. They do not care about their drivers in the least and would sooner give a better position to a lesser competent employee if they at least gone to college over you even if you've been an employee for years."
bad,Pepsi was the first job I was offered out of college so I agreed to take it. I was not a fan of the corporate atmosphere and was never challenged intellectually while I was there.
bad,"This company can be simplified down to a few sentences in my opinion.  Come ready to sell soft drinks until you drop.  Time, energy, and personal cost are of no particular worry to people at least in my experience at the Fort Stockton office.  I saw people use personal vehicles, deliver after hours, and still have to go to stores to work product.  You could work here for the rest of your life very easily.  Very easily, in fact many people do."
bad,"This location did not have good management and did not seem like"
bad,"no way to advance poor management "
bad,"I left a great company for the opportunity to work for PepsiCo. It offered me great vacation time, salary, remote days and no weekends. Unfortunately, once training was over that was not the case. I now have to work one day on the weekends. I was never told that I would be scheduled to work 10+ hour long days and be overtime exempt. I don't even have the chance to get up from my desk and take a lunch break due to everything that's on my daily schedule. I have told my manager repeatedly that I can't do 10 hour days because I have family obligations that I mentioned prior to being offered the position and accepting it, but no one seems to care. I deal with alot of stress and anxiety in this position which I do not care for at all. I'm routing soda not organs and to me the stress is unnecessary and unwarranted. Do not take this position unless you get your schedule in writing and they adhere to it. PepsiCo​ is notorious for hiring individuals in and then assigning them a riduculous schedule. I wish I would have known this beforehand. For a company that prides themselves on ""work life balance"", someone really dropped the ball with this department completely. DO NOT TAKE THIS POSITION unless you plan on looking for something else 2 months in like myself."
bad,Not a horrible company to work for but needs better communication with management and employees.The company should put more attention into employees in order to have better work environment.
bad,"Career dead end, at least with my set of skills."
bad,"I only worked here for 8 months, so I do not think that my opinion is as important as others who worked there longer. I worked in a satellite office and it was very cut throat."
bad,"It was a very interesting place to work.  Interesting, yes, that's how I would describe it."
bad,You can make a decent amount of money here but plan to work your butt off. You can start work at 4 am and sometimes not finish work until 7 pm or later
bad,In Las Vegas as a Large Sales format the sales and merchandising is done by one person it consumes much of your personal life. Is stressful trying to satisfy the customers and supervisors.
bad,You have to run from store to store doing tons of labor stocking shelves and building displays. So much of a workload by yourself and everyday feels like you're going to throw your back out. Not to mention you get called back to the stores if one bottle of soda is not perfectly lined up on the shelf. Store managers are on a power trip and think you have all the time in the world to stay at their stores when you got 3 other stores to still do.
bad,"Great work life balance, great management, I did not enjoy working based on commission and some days I had to put in a lot of hours when there was a trade tour"
bad,"Each day an employee was scheduled to work in one of the three sections for the entire shift: numeric data entry, which consisted of typing numbers at a computer; scanning, which consisted of sending papers one at a time through a scanning machine; and document prepping, which involved properly separating and categorizing invoices that were mailed to the site. I learned about working with others and effectively training new employees. Although most of the managers were decent to work with, I did not approve of the fact that the ones who worked most closely with the temps had little or no say in deciding which temps were to be hired on permanently. (such important decisions were made by complete strangers in HR who were more interested in hearing rhetoric about ""teamwork"" from their applicants rather than about the applicants' actual accomplishments and/or their value to the company.)  Pepsi prides itself on its diversity within the workplace, but unfortunately prioritizes this above employee performance. The hardest part of the job was training employees who were unwilling to learn. The most enjoyable part of the job was document prepping."
bad,"I worked like a dog, supervisor was not up to code on many things around the job & took advantage of others while promoting himself as the good guy...."
bad,"I worked for this company for thirteen years. I had seen a lot in my time there. The one thing that was consistent was change. Never could you have the same co worker for too long. never could gain cohesiveness with anyone. Always felt disconnected and never part of a team. Then the management door always was rotating and different rules and codes that nobody could keep up with. One day ""X"" is okay to do and then the next day ""X"" is no longer viable and you are fired for it. It never really made sense to me and always felt as if they never really cared about employees."
bad,"Typical day at work would be coming into a store, and walking around observing product that's missing from the shelf and coolers and write down a count of things you will need. I developed strong communication skills throughout the past 2 years at this job. Management was fair most of the times. co- workers were pretty okay as well. The hardest part of the job was pleasing managers, some didn't really care for the merchandisers. The most enjoyable part was the pay."
bad,bid for routes in the morning  do a pre trip on our trucks to the prouduct to the stores and put it on there shelf and in there coolers and print out invoices for the customers
bad,"Decent job, but HR does not trust employees and will go ignore management's evaluation. Management is rarely in the field to observe/train employees."
bad,easy job decent pay but not great management kept changing constantly coworkers were nice learned a lot from them as well
bad,"The learning was easy and fast, it didnt take long for me to be on my own."
bad,"I love the job at first, but soon it starts to take a toll on your life. NO WEEKENDS OFF. You either have to wake up 4am to be to work at 5am or 5am to be to work at 6am. In some cases I was waking up at 3am. I had a female boss who was like a detective. The job was already stressful with the loads having to work, but she would ""nick pick"" about every single thing. With that being said, do not be fooled about the less supervision annotation. Pay was great, until you realize its not worth the amount of strength,effort or time, especially with a family at home. The salesman and higher ranking have it made. Merchandisers are ""water boys"""
bad,Lots of extra curriculum activities to participate in. although it is a big company very family orientated . Lots of room for growth
bad,Hard Work and over night shift from 6:30pm until 6:30am Picking orders. Alot of sweating and bosses staring at you to see if your making your quota which is 200 cases per hour.
bad,"Day to day work is hectic,"
bad,It was nice to have a job close to home and be home every night.  Then in September 2014 I had an abdominal aortic anurism and was hospitalized a month in Barnes Hospital in Stlouis Mo.  and during my recovery period Pepsi terminated my job November 2nd 2014.  I was not informed of the termination til March 2015.  I feel that the medical issue should have not terminated my job.
bad,"i was on a short term contract. To be honest I felt they stole my ideas and took off with out paying me for the ideas which they could then incorporate into their products. Great pay, but short term."
bad,The place is not somewhere to stay for a long time as the hours are absolutely long and you have to work like a machine in order to keep up with the machines. The managers are just horrible as you can tell that they have lost all joy in their lives because their happiness has been drained by their jobs. Will never ever work there again.
bad,Being a girl in an all male work enviorment was challenging at times
bad,"If you begin your tenure at PepsiCo as a contractor, you will continue to be a contractor indefinitely. Some are converted after 5+ years, but most never are."
bad,The company only takes new hires as part time. However be aware you will be working as much as full time even more. you will need a blue tooth if you want any work done (constant phone calls) management is great but the work is harder than unloading an 18wheeler full of frozen christmas trees.
bad,The schedule is great a work day begins at 4pm and it ends when you load all the trucks up the overtime is wonderful thats where you make most of the money
bad,"Working for this company was instrumental in my decision to go work for myself. They expect a lot out of their employees - to be available evenings, weekends, lots of OT but no extra pay."
bad,"walk into office, talk with manager to see what the day has in store for us, get to work."
bad,"It's no fun work place were just there to work and go home. There some good people there , we just packed Cereal n pat meal in boxs. For the other workers can rap and get ready to be shipped out."
bad,"Trabalhava e fazia equipe pelo trabalho."
bad,Company isnt too bad of a place to work. But the company is top heavy and cant seem to do anything without another manager assisting or just tag along for some company to do their duties. Also turn a blind eye to people the help promote and dont train them to do the job the best way possible or even look at that persons work ethic once promoted.
bad,Nothing to say about review just I’m seeking job in very Difficult time  I need company near a hard worker please contact me I need job immediately Because I have family here
bad,"Una experiencia positiva"
bad,There was so much going on in this organization I would not care to talk about but as far as the benefits I was happy to have been a part of this organization.
bad,"Nice work environment and nice co-workers. The work itself is overwhelming on your body. Management does not assist workers in crucial situations. Overall, the job is ok. We are working 12-14hr shifts."
bad,"After being there a short amount of time, there was a reorganization to a 3rd party that undermined the feeling of job security and despite reassurances that all was well, after less than 2 years later, a 2nd reorganization occurred, resulting in the loss of additional jobs."
bad,"customer service , dealing with product stocking, rotation."
bad,pepsi co is an okay job is youre are hired as a temp and if youre used to working in a warehouse
bad,para mi el trabajo fue fácil porque?? me gusta es lo que se hacer mas sin embargo todo lo que yo aprendí fue gracias a una promotora por que el que era mi jefe ni atención ni explicación de algo sobre mi responsabilidad me dio. aparte de eso es una muy buena empresa. me agrado trabajar con ese equipo.
bad,Pepsi was a pretty good company to work for. The hours that they offered was also pretty reasonable. A typical work day for me was working the forklift and loading products on the trucks to be distribute to different companies. This job was pretty easy for me since I already have experience in operating a forklift.
bad,"Not what I interviewed for ,was told 8,10 or maybe a 12 hour day but come to learn after only one week that 14 to 16 hours days was more the norm.If they have that much work why not put on 1to 2 more people instead of making everyone suffer.During opening day shift meeting that only 3 people out of 14 had more than 1 year of service."
bad,Una empresa muy grande que t da la oportunidad de creser laboralmente
bad,"Es una empresa que se destaca la valoración que imparten desde recursos humanos hacia el personal, muy atentos a fechas de cumpleaños , regalo para fiestas como navidad y año nuevo, y en el ciclo escolar mochilas con utiles escolares,"
bad,The job is great if you can get over the people that work with you. The management picks and chooses how is a good worker with out seeing them work...
bad,Be prepared tow ork your butt off and get screamed at by customers and mangers. Never get help and basically get thrown out there in with the best of them.
bad,"Es un trabajo muy bien remunerado, pero exhaustivo, absorbente y la vida familiar es escaza. No vale la pena arriesgar mi familia, por un buen trabajo."
bad,"Great Job Culture, employees who really care, but needs more diversity particularly in the Pittsburgh area.  Managers do a great job as well."
bad,Work is easy...Coworkers is fun to work with but POOR Management in the warehouse
bad,"Not somewhere I would recommend anywhere to work. They are very uncaring of employee needs and requests. Really enjoyed the fast paced, physical part of the job."
bad,el equipo de trabajo es lo mas valioso desgraciadamente se le exigen jornadas extendidas en promedio de mas de 12 horas
bad,first timer having to drive from one location to another with a big teritory along with cardboard in your car. wasnt the experienced i expectioned and didnt make much in sales.
bad,"Was not there long enough to give a good review but for the time I was there, it was worth being there.  I was laid off before I could really get into the job that I was employed for."

bad,"its total work with happiness at PepsiCo "
good,"Hot in summer, cold in winter. No a/c and a furnace that barely worked. Lots of heavy lifting to stay in shape. Long hours in the summer, and pulling trucks inside the facility in the winter to keep them from freezing."
good,"Long hours, pay is horrible. No team help, selfish managers dont even lend a hand when they can. No care for home life or family. Have to drive own car and that doesn't even pay off!"
good,"that job gave me a lot of problems, they really racist. the management was not good they let certain people do they own things ,but they got the bills paid"
good,"Rough day, old equipment, working in dangerous areas. Unpaid and hard work as ever."
good,felt their was to much family interaction need to have family in company or in corporation felt that majority of the people where on my side and other co workers where not and human resource was not helpful to employers
good,"O trabalho lá era gostoso, aprendi a conviver com diversas opinião mesmo não concordando com elas."
good,This company is poorly managed and culturally insensitive.
good,This is not a great place if you have kids or want a life outside of work. The management are rude and unprofessional. And they will only need you for there vacation time. After that they will get rid of you!
good,my typical day at work starts with small talks to people at production floor. we usually do it before we start to work. i have learned so much. culture wise the site doesn't agree to discrimination no matter how old or young you are. the hardest part of the job is being a contractual job and the happiest part is we still manage to smile inspite and despite all the work load we had.
good,First five years were good but then it felt like u was just there to work and go home and dont ask questions because nobody has the answer or wants to be held accountable for the situation
good,This job was okay but could use some improvement in the training process along with better communication with the employees.

good,"In the beginning things seemed great. They talk about career possibilities but no matter how hard you come in and work there is no focus on truly advancing qualified people (unless they are your friends). "
good,Muy mal trabajo no se respeta la vida social y familiar
good,Pepsi could have been an okay job if they cared about their employees. As a merchandiser you were expected to be responsible for so much with very little pay.
good,They work u like slaves they don't want u to take a break an wen u do it's 10 mins u hav to do at least 60 to 70 pallets an hour to meet their numbers an it's back breaking work
good,"Uncertainty looms large at PepsiCo for all IT employees."
good,"As of right now, the morale at Pepsi is terrible overall.  Most employees are looking for new jobs, as new management seems to be trying to get rid of everyone with any kind of seniority and knowledge of the business.  The only people to get promotion opportunities are those that are fresh out of college."
good,No work life balance. No room for frontline to grow. Too much for work fo one person. No support. Management lacks intelligence. Bad culture. Labor intense.
good,"Interviewed and hired for 1 route, given a more inferior route. Told 48 hour work week, averaged 60+. No holiday pay until over 600 hours worked. You are told you are in charge of your route but not really. You are told you will receive proper training, but not even close. You better have a great understanding of the grocery business and of the soda business and of dealing with LONG days and 18 bosses and 40 texts daily."
good,"Good company "
good,"I don't know about any other location but the Tulsa location is terrible. Want a life outside of work? Won't get that here! Want management that listens to your needs? Won't find that here either! Want to move up in a company? Nope. Want job security? Just another thing that your not goin to find at the Tulsa location. Ever since I started there I felt like they had it out for me. Talked to a few coworkers about how I felt and they said the same thing. They moved me to nights because 6 people walked out and a few got fired. I now understand why they walked out. All the management cares about is how high your cph (cases per hour) is. You have 3 months to get to 192 cph. I was there 2 months. They let me go because I wasn't where I needed to be with my cph, I spent a few days in the hospital, and because I kept asking to move to fleet to be a mechanic for Pepsi since I couldn't get my numbers where they needed to be and I'm a certified diesel mechanic in the national guard I knew I would be a better fit as a mechanic. But since my numbers weren't where they needed to be and fleet pays more they said I can't move up in the company and to quit asking."
good,you have a lot of product. they want you to stock shelves and condense backstock within a unresonable amount of time. they dont tell you a lot. they leave you out to hang yourself.
good,"Pepsi as a company is a great place to work. But as far as local facilities go, problems arise that do not get solved for a long term solution."
good,start off in the morning and load my truck. gather everything that I needed for the day suck as hand held computer and money bags and begin my route. finish my route and come back to the warehouse and do all the paperwork for the day and county money.
good,Processo de abastecimento de produtos / Empacotamento de operador de máquinas / Manutenção na linha de produção.Empresa agradável para trabalhar.
good,there is no growth in this company you arre able to work 40 hours but with no offered health insurance only if you are company to those who work 40 hours even thought you are hired part time but work 40 hours
good,It was a living . Very difficult enviroment to work in with little help.
good,"The hardest part of the job is it is hot during the summer and winter. "
good,"I liked my job title sarting out but never advanced positions although I recieved 3 different 25 cent raises which made no sense at all to me. Igot along with everyone eventhough I obsrved several coworkers sitting around on there phones gaming or listening to music and got treated equally to the workers actually doing there own jobs and picking up others slack to make sure that the quotas was met for the day. When someone approaches management about any issue they might have they are ignored, lied too and made false promises."
good,As a night crew member we were responsible for completing the day shifts quota as well as ours which occasionally kept us on a 12 hour a day work schedule.
good,If you are looking to get promoted it is almost impossible.  The company is hiring students directly out of college and moving them to Frito Lay Headquarters within a year.  i have seen ten to 15 year veterans of the company passed by for college graduations fresh out of school.  The college graduates call those same senior drivers for advice.
good,"Muy mal pagado, te explotan, siempre te ponen excusas para no pagar las horas extras y cuando te haces valer te dicen que ya no formaras parte del equipo!"
good,"If you're looking for work life balance, then no, this isn't it. If you want to grow you can but regarding the culture here there is hypocrisy and warehouse itself is toxic."
good,"Most days are really long days, most of the time the equipment, including tractor or trailer breaks down very often. During the busy season spring through summer, they're hiring many drivers to cover the routes and when, it turns the fall and winter, they're trying every way that they can to get rid of drivers so they can have new drivers buy the season start the next year. I would not recommend working at Pepsi as a Geo box driver."
good,"No time for personal and family! Work is ok but the time you spend in your work is not enough in your salary and commission, make no mistake they have a very competitive commission rate and incentives."
good,"Work days are usually 10 to 12 hours 5 days a week. The management is generally young and not always knowledgeable in the mechanics of your position. Little room for advancement without a  degree, 23 years of service in a variety of positions is not enough. The culture is to sell sell sell, push the customer to take the product. The most challenging thing is maintaining a good working relationship with the customer after the product is sold. There are 3 parts to the sell, selling, delivering and merchandising.  After the sell your have little control over what happens next, so when there is no follow through on the next two steps it creates problems.  Being the face of the company, you have the responsibility to resolve the issue and make things right. . The culture in the company has changed in the past 20 years, more expectations for less compensation. I always give 100% and take pride in what I do regardless of the work environment. It feels good to meet my numbers, rise to challenges and complete what is expected. Accountability and reliability should be expected in every position, this could be expanded upon in the culture of the company."
good,Pepsi Values and Culture needed to Practice what was Preached. Management was only supportive in a very closed atmosphere. Working conditions were below the industry norm.
good,I had a great manager and a job away from the factory so my position made a huge different. It was a good job but no incentives for floaters. Work was demanding but fun. Bad weather was a con. Pros: Home early in evenings.
good,"very stressful trying to rotate, stock, keep customers happy, reply everything to your boss and get them to try to understand. You're the middle person.  Very physically demanding position. Get good work out."
good,The workplace culture was centered around a all boys backyard BBQ mentality with no regard or respect for the women and minorities that worked in the organization.
good,"The management was horrible, they did favoritism and only wanted the people he liked to do things, if you weren’t on his good side, you were worked to the bone"
good,Management was not very knowledgeable of the requirements in my department because she was transferred internally. This led to a number of issues that affected daily productivity. Favoritism.
good,"Pepsi Daytona cant keep drivers. Drivers are a dime a dozen, only care about delivering product. Routes are sent from Denver and make no sense. Hours are 430am til complete which usually  is 6, 7 or 8pm. 12 + stops a day 600+ cases a day. Wait in line in the am to leave and wait in line in the pm to check in then complete paperwork."
good,"If you are a robot, you should have no problem keeping up with the ever increasing demands that management requests. However, for humans the physically demanding nature of the work, especially during  holidays, grind away at the body and soul."
good,"Es una empresa trasnacional que no remunera de manera equitativa el desempeño de sus trabajadores."
good,It was a very good place to work in the beginning but it took a turn for the worse because they started bringing in the kids from college making them management and they don't know how to handle the role they didn't have the skill set or knowledge of how to deal with adults they allowed the position go to their head I think they should be trained before putting them out there like that
good,"Clocking in before 5 am everyday and loading the truck was the way to start your day. Everyday you delivered to a whole new route. You met new people, drove to new places and worked your butt off. The hours were never set and was near impossible to have a ""home life""."
good,"Hard work, long days and not fair on pay.  Pay is not close to the amount of hours and work you have to do.  Get paid per case but payment is not what they say it is per item."
good,First you work in an office with 70 others. You have to schedule all vacation a year in advance by seniority so don't plan on getting Christmas or thanksgiving off. No flexibility for taking time off. No advancement. Plan on working holidays when regular offices take them off. No support or help from management or push back to locations. Better off applying for plant position where movement is greater.
good,"i have been there only 5 years so far. apparently it was a really good company to work for but cut backs upon cut backs has made this company terrible to work for."
good,Was looking to start a new career here but soon after little under a year the companies true side came out and the requirements of its team is unrealistic
good,"Very hard work w/ high expectations . Expected to pull 200 cases per hour, with slow , worn out malfunctioning equipment ."
good,Supervisors who have never been in production are production supervisors. Last minute scheduling for weekend postings.
good,only as good as good as your back !! long grueling hours 5 a.m. - 7:30 p.m. !! money was good working conditions were bad !! back breaking work for a guy of my age when hired !!
good,"Same routine day in day out."
good,"Dia a Dia muito corrido, ao longo dos 14 anos de empresa tive a oportunidade de coordenar equipe reportando diretamente a gerência, gestão de contratos, auditoria e negociação de contratos."
good,"un día tipico :bastante trabajo poco tiempo de comida y poco salario."
good,"Yeah though good company but the culture and values are not followed as it should me.Lots of discrimination between new people. between bosses and lower floor level employees. Some bosses are quite kool and nice here but some are not that decent. Company dint look into the potential and the devotion of the employee rather it look into the gain or profit assessment from the employee."
good,Haber laborado en esta empresa fue  una buena experiencia de todo se aprende
good,"management is cooperative , I learnt to be a hard worker, I work on all days"
good,"My expirence at pepsi midamerica was not very swell hours are good but the labor, pay andvances, and total sanitary in the plant is unsounded."
good,"es una empresa buena lo malo es la gente que esta de encargada no sabe nada del sistema en ventas.la gente aprende a los cursos que dan si mucho una vez al año.los compañeros de trabajo y el ambiente son buenos,lo bueno que aprendi fue a conocer muchas formas de trabajo,aunque a veces fuera bajo presion"
good,"When I first started at Pepsi I loved my job. I loved it so much I took it home with me every night. Then they seemed to take advantage of that and they gave me even more work to do, no raise, no thank you, no appreciation at all. I learned to treat people the way I want to be treated no matter what situation you are in. You never really saw and of the management unless there was a problem. Thank goodness I was blessed to have wonderful co-workers around me to help lighten the mood. I liked everything I physically did for Pepsi, I just didn't like the way I was treated."
good,Our office was just kinda toxic and not a good place to work. (I am now writing to just adhere to indeed's minimum requirement of characters need to continue this process.)
good,"Work day is partly routine"
good,When you work for a company for many years and retire and NO One in upper management contacts you that is a problem. When you here someone from you regional office make a comment about people from Ark are not very smart and that people with many years of service do not know how to motivate.
good,This was an okay place to work. Felt under valued as an employee from management. Best part about this job is the coworkers.The place is disgusting from a food and beverage perspective.
good,"I worked with this company for over a year. It wasn’t the worse but the lack of communication makes it more difficult to work. Also the for all the tasks you do, all the hard hours you put in, all the driving you do, the pay is not worth it."
good,Easy to do well here. Not for everyone. You must be amazing at adapting to sudden changes and managing through uncontrollables. To succeed and maintain sanity you must master time management and be extremely detail oriented.
good,This employees on this role are overworked and stressed.High turnover and tons of complaining. Work life balance is okay. Lots of layoffs and hiring of younger employees.  Typical day begins at 8:00 Am and ends at 5:00 PM.
good,"Al ser parte de la region de Latinoamérica-caribe, las oportunidades de crecimiento ocurren a empleados de otros países porque los de Puerto Rico son muy caros. Traen extranjeros para las posiciones gerenciales y son personas machistas y son una cultura totalmente diferente a la cultura puertorriqueña/americana."
good,"We get treated like children, the people who get promoted are the ones who complain the most and work the least. Everything is about production numbers. They don't care about their people, even if you get hurt, have people call out or are on vacation, they still expect the same amount of production. We run a skeleton crew and produce more than other facilities just so management can get their bonuses. We get talked to like we are stupid, yet a majority of management can't do a quarter of what we do. We have family members working with family members. HR, local management and senior management can't agree on policy so we never get a straight answer. Management doesn't like when we have ideas that are better than theirs or when we try to make things easier for ourselves. We try new things to make our process more efficient but even if it works, if they don't like it, we can't do it."
good,"Long hours, stressful sales plans, low maintained equipment, some trucks don’t have AC in southern Arizona. Small possibility for advancement without a degree."
good,You will work long days with a heavey route and no help and no overtime pay. This is a very fast past job and even busier in the summer known as 100 days of pain. There drivers are salary paid. The jobs says Monday thru Friday but you will be asked every Saturday to work if you are not already scheduled
good,"Uma empresa de cultura razoavelmente boa, porém não tem plano de carreira algum, oportunidades não são dadas e muito menos promoções."
good,Plan on being in the same role for a while if you don’t know anyone in the higher ranks that will push for you to get promoted. The compensation is great but you don’t really have a work life balance
good,Poor management and rapid changes such as micromanaging and tracking you via gps on work provided cell phone shows lack of trust. Multiple apps that don’t work but you have to use makes you lose focus on the actual job itself. Unnecessary stress put on employees for corporate greed. Unrealistic expectations is the name of the game. Once a decent place to work has become a daily place of dread. Shame on them. This is the down fall of most places unfortunately. If you’re young and single it’s a great place to work because that’s all you’ll have time for. You’ll work every weekend and all holidays except Christmas. Say goodbye to your family.
good,Worked there for 10 years and was pushed out for people fresh out of college with no experience in the field. This also happened to several other reps while working there.
good,"fast paced; learn positions of products"
good,"over worked and underpaid, working for pepsi with very liitle advancement if you don't have a college degree.  working hard and not being shown appreciation after making someone else look good is hard."
good,. i learned alot from working their learning to work in a fast pace a typical day a pepsico is ridding a auto pallet jack and picking different kinds of soda  the hardest part was learnding how to find your way around the wharehous to find different kinds of soda
good,The hardest part of the job was finding equipment that would work properly or any equipment to work with at all on a daily basis. Team moral was extremely low.
good,Underpaid and overworked management is terrible . They have no work life balance and make you feel guilty if you do need time off. Never ensure you have been properly trained.
good,"I enjoyed the quarterly fun party to motivate employees."
good,nota 9 e uma otima empresa que pena que foi tercerizada
good,"Work days start at 0330, and tend to go up to 12 hours long, if not more. Usually short staffed, meaning extra work. management tends to care more about the bottom line then the people working for them. As a merchandizer you tend to get qworked till you drop, but if you miss days it is a write up, doesn't matter the situation. While the benifits are fairly good, and the pay good, I would not recommend working for this company"
good,"Although this is a large and stable business, the lack of adequate computer system infrastructure, there is constant stress.  Poor planning and inadequate critical thinking by management creates additional stress for those that must perform the duties necessary for the executives to succeed.  If you are young, straight out of college, this would be a great way to start your career. All you will need is an inquisitive mind, a pair of safety shoes and a boat load of energy.  This is a perfect place for young people.  I don’t recommend this environment for older employees, leave it to the young people who can handle the mega work."
good,"i was working and get paid weekly . never one time i did not get paid. The reason why I want to do my own thing, I believe it's better anyway because i decide to make money when i want without anyone stopping me."
good,all these answers are ridiculous i should not have to fill this out.. ir is none of your business what my opinions are. i will not participate in answering this survey.
good,"The continental shifts are not good for a work life balance."
good,"Such a stressful job! You are put through 5 weeks of so called training and then just thrown out on your own, not really knowing what you are doing or even where you are going! But you are expected to make no mistakes."
good,"Self-explanatory job responsibilities with managing a territory. Retail and sales skills were necessary, overall company goal was clear. Working extremely long hours, driving and traveling extremely long distances was paid with getting laid off."
good,Bad management no respect for Employees. Long hours with little work life balance. Management promotes only who they like wouldn't recommend this company for long term career.
good,"If you are in the IT organization and a woman, your chances for promotion are slim to none.  The only women who have been promoted to anything above a manager both had worked for Deloitte.  The rest of the organization is approximately 80% male and anything B1 or higher in the SAP organization is 97% male.  This is much more about who you know than a meritocracy which can be demoralizing.  It makes it incredibly hard whenever any woman makes a complaint, it is dismissed, if it's even heard in the first place."
good,"12 + hr work days, great pay, sorry management. they will work you into the ground and still ask for more out of you. Great benefits and insurance, 401k and pension"
good,"The company has great benefits but the position is easy but a lot of work. Nick the manager for Sales Rep/Large format is not the best manager. I would recommend working for the company but not under Nick in Aliso Viejo, CA for Sales Rep/Large format."
good,I have worked at PepsiCo for nearly two years and the plant I am at is in it's 3rd iteration of management. Unfortunately each one has gotten steadily worse.
good,"O turnover é elevadíssimo o que faz com que a empresa não tenha uma cultura e nem um ""norte"" definidos."
good,Muy buen lugar para trabajar pero no valoran el trabajo de un vendedor mucho menos de un promotor y no dan oportunidad de crecer o de mejorar por qué te limitan a un sueldo ya que uno como vendedor quiere uno desarrollarse para mejorar el propio estado económico con iniciativas y  persuaciones ( Asia los clientes) para mejorar las ventas tanto de uno como la de los  clientes y así tener lo que es ganar y ganar.😉
good,aprendi en pre-despacho hacer inventarios y almacenar la mercancia mis colegas eran buen trabajadores. trabajabamos en conjunto como un equipo.
good,"Out of the four years that I have been there, I have grown to become a more responsible worker, along with being able to exercise my interacting skills."
good,"Typically start at 5:00 am and work until 5:00-6:00 pm."
good,"Worked at the plant in Columbia, MD"
good,"In this  compny we are enjoy our wrok and help in wrok"
good,"Es una empresa con muy mala organización y liderazgo, contratando empleados con una clara negatividad y pocos deseos de superación. Además la empresa esta en pésimas condiciones para laborar."
good,No hay posibilidad de crecer. Muy mal pagado.mal horario.n o hay un buen hambiente laboral
good,Good pay.  Work is never slow even when the economy omy is. Somewhat clean work environment. Three day weekend every other weekend. Company paid uniforms.
good,"This company is a good place to work, BUT, you are just a number. Here in Las Vegas, the turn over rate is unbelievable, you never know its your turn. During your first 90 WORKING day probation, you will worked liked a dog, expected to work through all your breaks to make their 50 case an hr. The faster you are the more you're liked, and the more you get away with. For 21 dollars an hr, this is slave labor and way under paid for what you do"
good,"It was a transition time, By the time I started working at Pepsico Britsh closed the deal to manage the Pepsico network worldwide. The enviroment was not good. Coworker was being lay off. But still a good time to learn new posture. I had to take over of the network projects, manage the helpdesk, implementation, etc..In the real transition of the network I was being whatched by the BT managers that like my Job and oferd me a position at BT."
good,I would wake up at 6am and drive to my store. I would work at the location for several hours stocking Pepsi products and making sure the back is properly stacked. I would do this several times a day at different stores. Sometimes it would be stressful and hard to get everything done but for the most part isn't a bad job.
good,"Descent company, but they need to determine who they are and what they want to be.  The speak of performance, but their overly relaxed environment allows their employees to run and ruin the company."
good,You get over worked and under paid sometimes the managers get ill and take it out towards the workers. And it makes you have a bad day
good,Replacing management with out of towners is not the best way to run a chicago warehouse. Some of the best workers i've worked with are friends till this day.
good,great benefits but job is very stressful.  alot of continuous calls.. I really  wouldn't recomend anyone to apply.. the  turn over rate is high because they dont listen to the wants and needs of the employees
good,Good paying job. Good hours. Stable Company. Bad routes bad work system. pay doesn't match amount of work especially if you have a salesman who over-orders.
good,"My experience with PepsiCo is form a Merchandisers perspective.  I was hired to work weekends and holidays.  I knew that going in.  I am fine working weekends and holidays, however I do not get holiday pay.  When I work a holiday its at my regular pay.  For two years I worked 35+ hours a week (minimum) with no benefits, including sick pay or vacation.  After two years the management at my local plant changed at which point I was told I was to average no more than 26 hours a week at the end of the year.  I asked if this was due to Obamacare and the 30 hour full time clause they added to that.  I was told no, Pepsi considers anyone who works over 30 hours to be full time.  I then asked does that mean for over two years I should have been getting sick/vacation pay?  To which I was told, I don't know that wasn't me you got screwed.  How nice."
good,"Pepsi wants robots, does not care about employees. No job security at all."
good,"Over the course of eight years employment with PepsiCo, there was a time of growth and advancement. However, 2014 has seen a restructuring of sorts. Many plants throughout the country have been shut down as PepsiCo continues to streamline. At present, job security is rare and advancement even more so."
good,"Fun to drive tractor trailer, long days in the summer, mgmt. drove employees hard - all about the numbers"
good,"Booking Over time when enployees called off"
good,"First off, because of the way I'm treated, I dread going to work at Pepsi now!"
good,manager to maintain the documents like mailing checking an dcourier
good,"Un día típico de trabajo era muy interesante, personas con muchas capacidades e ideas asombrosas."
good,"Management concetrated on pointing fingers at employees. they need to work on solutions,not who makes mistakes.  "
good,En el trabajo el ambiente era muy agradable por lo compañeras mas antiguo te enseñava lo q te faltava aprender
good,you never know what the day will bring. like what time you get off.
good,Compensation was fair. Had a tight budget that slowed our abilities of production. The employee's were great people. Safety was priority  as about as everyone else as to be expected. The work schedule was the hardest with 10 to 21 day straight work periods without time off. most of the times you would work 9 days with one day off and then another 9 day stretch before another day off. They promise advancement and then tell you straight up that they will not pay for it in compensation. I feel it was a good place for what the experience was learned. Received much experience in the electrical troubleshooting and electrical repair of the industrial machinery.
good,"They are forced to train and secure those who hustle and brown nose the management.  Supervisors are too young and inexperienced which are placed in that position because they follow the upper manangement.  You NEVER see the Superintendent, or Manager except for maybe in a safety meeting."
good,"Trabalho na carga horaria de 6x2, onde em relação não tenho reclamações, aprendizado e mais aperfeiçoamento nas resoluções das tarefas  agilidades e técnicas, em relação a gerencia acho que pecam na busca de melhorias para toda equipe, em relação aos colegas nada a reclamar pois sempre procuro fazer grandes amizades por onde passo, dificuldade no trabalho dificilmente acontece pois sempre procuro estar aprendendo com técnicos superiores a mim, onde sendo assim consigo dar conta das minhas tarefas sendo preciso de poucas ajudas."
good,"Learned at a fast pace a lot of information and gained a lot of experience. Was involved in many new projects. Worked multiple shifts, and in various departments. Hardest part of the job, learning when technology was downgraded instead of advanced. "
good,"Not liked much working with PepsiCo, yes company has given chance in my opening carrier "
good,Great to work with a brand that sales itself. Lots of accounts to manage and very fast pace.
good,I valued my time working here. I learned a lot about the workplace as well as working with and for others. I gained knowledgeable skills and experiences.
good,"Aprendi a trabalhar em equipe; A lidar com muitas pessoas ao mesmo tempo, pois é uma empresa de grande porte. Difícil de lidar com a roupa suja de peixe, e o corpo também. Mas eles tem vestiário com vários chuveiros pra tomar banho na hora de ir embora."
good,Everyday was 8-12 hrs. I learned some much about all aspects of the business. Management was terrible at the end. Worked with some incredible co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the unreal expectations at the end. The most enjoyable part was earning the respect of and making the customers happy.
good,"It is a good Company to work for, but they need to get a better Management team."
good,"Pepsi Bottling Group is well suited to those who are just starting out, have no children and are not married. The hours are extensive, the labor was intense and in general, it was not a very family focused place to work."
good,"Free lunches, employee events and give-aways have been majorly scaled back over time. Longer term employees are generally unhappy at their jobs and joke about becoming stuck due to the good starting wage."
good,The environment was unsupervised often and had no regulated backbone to its foundation. It was often unpleasing to not have the manager be set in place and the workers were it there figuring what next needed to be taken care of.
good,Very unhappy when i left due to no opportunity for growth. They made promises that they did not follow through with. I felt strung along for more time than I should have let myself be.
good,"The warehouse loader position is very stressful and physically demanding. If you don,t mind these characteristics, then the pay is worth the time spent to earn it."
good,Pay is ok. Advancement is little without a degree. You work holidays in the warehouse while the drivers have it off because they are in the union. You have no set time off. You work till the job is done even if it means driving a forklift for 20 hours straight.
good,"I worked for Pepsi for several years before going into Sales there.  Overall, the job was not difficult.  You started early, and finished whenever you were done your stores which was nice during light times, but heavy during busy seasons.  The only issue was that there are so many moving parts that you as the Sales Rep have to take a bullet for:"
good,"I enjoyed working as a merchandiser for Pepsi. It was a challenging and physical job, that brought something new everyday which I love. I also was still able to interact with customers which was great to me, because I enjoy helping others."
good,"I expected a better company culture and work environment but the dept. I was in didn't live up to my expectations. It was implied that a temporary position would turn permanent if I exceeded the job expectations, however I learned from other employees that this position was never hired on FT because they could pay the temp. employee less and constantly hire someone new. I was disappointed that my hard work didn't result in a FT job."
good,Probably the hardest job I have ever had but very enjoyable. My supervisor was decent most of the time. I loved building relationships with some of the store managers at my accounts.
good,"Money is good , work is fine if you are working in sales or marketing , but if you are a technical person , you are considered an expense . which can easily be replaced"
good,"There is no work/life balance continuous issue where they needed a quick response! I found myself working 14-16 hour days, high pressure from leadership across all channels."
good,"Bad company to work for, they don't care about there employee's. No PTO time, they work you to death, you never see your family, they show special treatment to certain employee's. You never know if your going home after your shift."
good,"The pay and benefits are great but you will live here,stupid work schedule 13 days straight with one day off then 12 days straight with only two off.management sucks,only way you’ll get ahead here is by snitching heavy and kissing lots of butt."
good,"Lots of management turnover"
good,"As a relief driver the pay was not exceptional for the intense work that was required day in and day. limited personal time off(2-3 days per year), poor vacation process."
good,The culture of speak up is a lie! Shareholders do not know the truth about the performance of the plants. Misreporting is the standard to insure performance bonuses for Plant Directors. If you report the truth you are asked to leave. The company has great employees and management staff but the Directors and dishonest and vulgar.  Never worked for a company that allowed its Directors to use profanity as a mainstay for communication.
good,"Started on side bay route, was fun and cooperative with coworkers. GeoBox now for almost a year and it’s less money with longer days. Also ergonomically it’s a real pain and stress on the body. You push and pull 1/2 pallets loaded with product and they weigh so much more than a hand truck load. Routing is absolute garbage.  Management is a yes man for himself answering to the corporate machine and plant supervisor who is merely a trying to advance his own big toothed career."
good,They gave me a good career but I worked my tail off to get it. Who you know is twice as important as what you have done.. College kids do great in this environment..
good,"Worked here for over a year part-time. I really liked it at first. The job was pretty hard but once you get used to it, it’s pretty easy. My manager was really chill & nice, but then new managers would pop up and they were the reason everything went down hill for me. Wouldn’t understand my concerns or anything. Some days there would be stores where the person the day before me didn’t do anything at all and I had to pick up for their slack and I would inform the managers but they wouldn’t even care. Every week I was in different stores all over the city which I hated. I would’ve loved to stay at the same stores instead of going everywhere. I always finished early because I was a hard worker and just did my job quickly. Then they would ALWAYS ask me for help with other stores where other employees needed help. Which was fine once in a while but it literally was everyday. The pay was ok. I was getting paid about $12 an hour and then after a year was getting $12.50 I believe. Not worth it for the amount of work to be honest."
good,"The company itself offers many opportunity, I was unfortunately working while a management change happened. The new District manager we received was extremely hard to work with and hours were lost and schedules were messed up, eventually had to find something else as pay checks were not enough to cover living expenses"
good,I had a good experience at first but as time went on you see the true colors of management. I've seen favoritism and experienced work drama that was unnecessary. They didn't really want to help if you needed to try and switch shifts there was no room for advancement or any pay raises.
good,"This company hires outside young college students to manage drivers that have way more experience and knowledge than them. So don’t look for any advancement if you start driving. The only way you will advance is out the door to another company. They love to say they are taking care of the employees by giving free food and work shirts and hats every now and then but will write you up without no facts. They are always on the customer side!! Not yours!! If you speak up on different things, you are a target and they will start finding everything wrong with what your doing to fire you. If you call in for any other reason besides being sick you will be wrote up. I tried to have integrity and tell the truth LOL! Wrong! Be sick no matter what. You will work about 45-50 hours only for you to bring home $500-600 if that because they have made your sales goal to be so unachievable that you can’t hit plan to make the most money. Only the senior reps will have weekends off. Even though you get off at a decent time in the day your so drained from the BS at other store, there goes your work life balance cause all you want to do is rest.  Set your alarm to be at work for 3-4am and I hope your handheld work, your truck start, wait you better hope it’s loaded and loaded (correctly), just to bring home $600 after a long 50 hour week. Everybody start out covering vacations, more power to you!"
good,"A grandes rasgos la dinámica en esta empresa es muy buena, pero des afortunadamente la jornada laboral era muy larga (16 horas comúnmente). Tienen un muy buen producto y la gente se compromete con el trabajo."
good,"A typical day involves intensive labor. Constant bending, reaching, pulling, lifting, raising of cases weighing between 20-60lbs. I have learned more of what it takes to maintain body stress & fatigue. Department management provides negative corporate cultures. The hardest part is to witness this happen to less informed employees or unaware rights simply just to control alongside advantage(s} serving its specific purpose. The most enjoyable parts are the conversations had with each other."
good,typical warehouse job with waves of employees. little no to no margin for error. not enough breaks for extended work hours. crabs in a barrel type of job
good,every day was a struggle to make management notice your good work. Every day a lot of emplyees were forgotten and never noticed for their contributions to the company
good,"Overall not a horrible place but certain people in management took advantage of their positions.  "
good,"This was + 30 years ago.Processed the wages weekly, learned about team work. i was a school leaver and new. management was fair. Culture was casual. enjoyable part was the constant learning as I was a school leaver"
good,"Long hours and very busy schedules.  Associates typically wear multiple hats, as headcounts have been reduced.  Associates are expected to perform at high levels.   "
good,"Great place to learn your trade and good compensation, but don't plan on a long career there. "
good,"The job would be great if management didn't force product that customers don't want, just to try and get numbers. The best part of the job is dealing with different customers. The worst part was the micro-management and pushy managers to force product. It is also a very cut-throat environment and they, as well as the competition, sabotage each other by trying to take each other's space in stores."
good,"Long term employees hold much clout and their transgressions are met with indifference but while the work is hard the compensation package is good. "
good,"Too many days and hours a week and one day off will have you exhausted, a very fast pace job for too many days and  hours a week, and the supervisors are always looking at you"
good,"Have managers that have no idea what all the job entails, extremely overload the workload each day and they don't care about your personal life ever.  They are all about quantity over quality level of work.  They pay you decent but enough for what you have to put up to work there."
good,"You find yourself always rushed."
good,Si tuviera que comparar el trabajar ahí con alguna actividad distinta la compararía con la legión extranjera.
good,"Very fast past and stressful environment to work in."
good,"overnight hours starting as a temp you have to work hard to get hired all summer long, 5 years later you are still stuck on 2nd shift working 6 days a week 12 hours a day not good for people with familys good for young single men or woman looking to make money and thats it. Management is careless about employees life/health/safety"
good,I held 3 separate positions at PepsiCo.  All 3 were stressful.  I enjoyed supporting sales as it was fast paced and a fun environment (although very intense).  My final position supporting Finance was extremely dysfunctional.  My manager was not supportive nor did he communicate well with his team.  No transparency no work life culture.  I gained tons of experience and worked with many amazing people.
good,"I would say the company provides good experiences. Competitive work culture, good compensation, aggressive business goals, but, frequent reorganization"
good,"The managment inplace isn't what you expect them to be. They preach safety only to cover themselves, not so much the worker. The location makes up the rules as they go."
good,Best advice to anyone taking a job here fresh out of college is to take the skills and training that they provide and build them towards taking a job outside of the company.
good,"Long hours, stress level is ridiculous, your always on the clock. You are responsible for the merchandiser as well as the driver. Early mornings, long summer days. There’s a lot that isn’t told to you when 1st hired."
good,"There is no life... I was on job there by 3rd party. I left that job after accident in August 2017."
good,I learned to service my customers effectively.  Typical days at work are about 11 to 12 hours in stressful rushed setting.  Workplace culture was good. Most enjoyable part of job was being out on the road compared to inside a building all day.
good,"Expect way too much from employees and pay did not match daily tasks, drive in outdated trucks, managers not supportive, no ac in trucks during summer heat and heat in foot wells from engine block made cab of truck over 100 degrees every day."
good,"The Pepsi Cola distributor in Texarkana has changed ownership many times.  The compensation always seemed below par.  I stayed with the company as long as I did because of potential for advancement, but once that prospect was gone, so was I."
good,IT was thankless. They cam out with 77 new products the year i was there and it was a pain to sell to the same people over and over again. Very fast paced.
good,"working for Pepsi is a okay company to work for just for a bit, they push to much hours are too long, some people are great but managers don't realize the stress they put on the employees"
good,"A lot of hours for little pay. I worked for a franchise of Pepsi Co., not Pepsi Co. itself. There wasn't much room for growth. The management was good and the benefits were fair."
good,The treatment that I received from my male counterparts that were in management was not fair to me or my team. I never had a chance to grow with this company.
good,my mgr very jealous which I thought was weird the place ghetto and unprofessional she would stare at my body like she had low self esteem. Sad and miserable
good,Not an employee friendly place to work. It is more about company politics and less about productivity. I wouldn't recommend a career in this place as there are many people who have been there a long time that never advanced.
good,"it is an awesome job to work at the beginning, really fun. and lots of freedom, on your own with no one over your shoulder. pay wasn't the best and employee value wasn't the best."
good,"Pepsico es una empresa muy dinámica y que sin dudas te permite comprender los procesos de una empresa multinacional."
good,Not the best place to work. They hired supervisors that had no idea about the beverage industry. You had to go to college to get ahead your experience wasn't enough for them.
good,"it is a chill industrial environment with crazy hours though "
good,it was ok to work there just very stressful treated you like a number. be ready to work right up to the dot driving limit every week. soda is heavy and they will expect you to deliver 300 to 600 cases or more pre day for 0.13 per case
good,"Long days with little concern for family matters. The job culture is clear at Pepsi, get the soda off the truck. No excuses, deliver the product. The only communication received from management is when I do something wrong."
good,Not The Best company to work for mangement sucks the best thing i liked about pepsi was the way you could advance in the company what i hated was they tried to make the driver do more than his job to cover the sales reps
good,"Since I start work here a lot of changes happened , a specially in management . Company hiring supervisors with low or no knowledge about their duties, how to manage people , respect experienced workers. This creates pressure and stressful situations . Top management support  this. Union very very bad."
good,"The management is good,most especially with my workmates.I'm used with shifting schedule, no holidays and overtime. There's no much work during night shift."
good,"Company was a great work place until they decided to do a big switch in the companies direction. involving pay, hours, management. There fore causing lots of disgruntle employees and a more hostile work environment."
good,This job was a 60-70 hour a week job.  The hours were horrible managing 3-5 stores at a time from 4a.m to 7p.m at night.  This was a salaried job with commission.
good,"Business is always changing and innovating new ideas, for a healthier culture. Lots of communication to sales team from management."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo buena capacitación me gustaba el trabajo las labores a realizar era la colocación de producto y la promoción del mismo
good,Good luck getting a holiday off!  You will only get Thanksgiving day and Christmas Day off.  Unreasonable sales goals led many employees to find dishonest ways of selling extra product into stores.
good,"Etant jeune et nouveau dans l'entreprise, les vieux loups (anciens) craignaient pour leur emploi. La prise en charge était minimale. "
good,Its a good place to learn . where you can use your knowledge to improve the productivity. Management is bit hard to manage with them and if you manage then you can manage to any one .
good,"satisfactoria."
good,"Cada día realmente es distinto ya que cada promotor tiene una forma distinta de trabajar, así como promociones diversas."
good,"Load pallets as quick and effective as possible, "
good,I worked at PepsiCo in Orlando fl for about 6 months but left because I found something else overall not a good place to work long nights sometimes 14 hour days backbreaking work which didn't bother me but management wasn't very active and you feel lost at work the machines and equipment there were very old and rundown making it tough to meet your numbers.. A lot of back pains still to this day The pay and my coworker were the only thing I loved about the job i meet so many different people from different background. If your the type of person who love money and is not worried about a personally life perfect job for you
good,"Trabajar en grupo pepsico es una experiencia nueva cada dia sumado a un reto diario el cual el objetivo es cumplirlo en conjunto con el equipo."
good,"Working at Pepsi was a great experience for someone who just got their commercial drivers license.  Be prepared the days are brutal, the South Florida summer heat becomes oppressive, and be prepared to throw 50+ cases an hour.  Management here needs a total overhaul.  Management by threat is not how to motivate people."
good,"No work life balance, expectations are to stay until the job is done., Very hard to advance unless your a new college grad.  Good benefits but your just a number in a large company,"
good,They hire young managers out of college to brain wash them into believing that working 12 hour days plus weekends and most major and minor holidays is what you have to do in order to support yourself in the real world. Everyone was quick to tell you what you did wrong but never said thank you for going above and beyond your job expectations. There was also a huge mistrust between management and the front line employees which created a negative and pessimistic environment to work in. I would not recommend this job to anyone!
good,long working days. productivity is key. opportunities to learn new things. team work is critical. reserved comments on co-workers and management. hardest part of the job is to get started. most enjoyable is a sense of accomplishment at the end of day to leave after a very long day.
good,its a really good place but it is really hard to get hired onto the company. overall its a really nice enviornment to work.
good,"The company overall used to be a great place to work. Due to morale issues with mgnt., it has made it difficult to enjoy working at Pepsico. They aren't thrilled to be here and it shows in the lack of communication and execution."
good,"If they did not make a product that sells itself this company would have closed its doors a long time ago."
good,It's ok. Long hours and pay is not good. No real processes are put in place for your position. Things change too much AND JOB DESCRIPTION IS NOT SPECIFIC.
good,"PepsiCo is  a good company to work for if the management team is the correct team. You have to be able to put out fires on a daily basis. I learned how to use new programs on a yearly basis, How to negotiate a deal. Very good benefits."
good,"very stressful work environment"
good,Serves as onsite human resources administrator. Process payroll. Manage all status updates for employees. Maintain employee personnel files. Conduct new hire orientation. Serves as the primarily point of contact all HR related concerns
good,they push work life balance but its just a front . Pepsi co really does not care at all. 7 days a week during the summer and lots of layoffs during the winter months.
good,Pepsi Co is a place for someone willing to work a lot of overtime with possibly one day off. It's good pay and benefits. Management doesn't keep there word. I learned a lot of new skills. Fellow employees are enjoyable.
good,"Third shift had a excellent group of guys to work with. too much favoritism on different shifts,was always having to carry the load for other employees"
good,Long work hours. Heavy repetitive work. Struggle with work/life balance. Good pay and benefits. Little to no support in the trade.
good,"Start your day at 4am or earlier if told otherwise at your first stop (store). Check in with store managers to go over any changes or builds of endcaps or displays. After checking in, check your back room for any backstock to re-shock the aisle, endcaps, coolers, etc. If a load has dropped to your account (store) you must work the load and organize the left over into your section in the backroom. Everything needs to be filled and organize before checking out of the account (store). If you're assigned to write orders you need to keep track of inventory and breakage to send back. Need to order to fill everything in the store, have backstock on products that are desire by your manager, TSM manger, and store manager, and specials. Once your first stop is done, you repeat this method to other stores listed on your route (list)."
good,"Hostile work environment, Managers have no respect for hardworking individuals. They put slackers on a pedestal  and praise them. On the bright side of things the pay is good and the benefits are good as well."
good,I have gained so much knowledge from working here on how to complete jobs in an orderly fashion.On this job you have your good days and your bad days but in the end you feel like you have accomplished what you needed to do.
good,"Overall good company, early start time and long days with lots of physical work. Not a lot of interaction between management and workers or told of your performance."
good,"Worked with many good store and grocery managers.I liked being out in the stores selling product. Didn't get much support from management other the the negatives. The day started at 5 am and you worked until 4 or 5 pm. Myself being a salesman I did more merchandising than sales, needed better compensation for your hard work."
good,"A typical day at work start with the shift time. We are given a production plan & where have to give production as per plan by controlling wastage or any breakdown."
good,"Realmente es una empresa que está muy acostumbrada a trabajar con hombres, yo era una de las primeras supervisoras de ventas, es decir, que una mujer estaba en la línea. "
good,"It's a good company to get your feet wet in, right out of college.  Decent pay, benefits, job security.  Most job functions are fast paced.  Local and regional management seem like reasonable people.  If you haven't obtained a bachelor's degree, your chances to advance are slim to none."
good,"It was a hot envoriment,I got a chance to get introduce to teem work, my co-workers were very helpful in leading me in the right direction, the hardest part of my job was the maintance repair,what Ienjoy most of the job was the knowledge I consume as a young man"
good,"I review my route.  Than I proceed to do a pre trip on my work truck to make sure the truck is in a safe operating condition.  i make my deliveries in a safe manner.  I've learned time management skills and building customer rapport.   My co-workers and I have a great relationship where we help each other out if its as simple as parking the truck in their location or directions to it.  The hardest part of the job is the unknown of what time I will get off of work and or working 12 to 14 hours a day.  The most enjoyable is the people I've meet, Co-workers and Customers."
good,very physical job with terrible management in the warehouse!!
good,"La compañia es excelente, las prestaciones son buenas, pero el salario es muy bajo."
good,"Empresa em transformação constante e sem apoio necessário para suportar as mudanças (processos e pessoas)."
good,personally this is a great reputation company with the worst management culture ever i seen in my life. Particularly upper manager
good,The company has entirely too many buddy buddy situations which causes fiction among employees. No organization
good,"review request from Bottlers, (field techs) recolect used equipment. anaylized if they worth remaning them or recycle. send them to the remanufacture facility. reseach where the equipment came from."
good,"Service Technician PBG - Pepsi Bottling Group Sept 2011 - Nov 2012"
good,"When an item was close to their expiration date my job was to sell them to discount stores such as Big Lots and the 99 Cent Only stores."
good,Physically hard and demanding work on the body. Long hours and drive times.
good,"La empresa ofrece pocas opciones de crecimiento y promoción. Sin embargo logré ganar la confianza de mis jefes y compañeros en corto tiempo, así como realizar diferentes propuestas de mejora que deben ser aprobadas por varios niveles antes de poder ser ejecutadas."
good,Limited upward mobility
good,"aprendí mucho , me ayudo a crecer profesionalmente . con las responsabilidades asignadas ."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job was the pay and you were union.
good,warehouse is to small for all the product thats being warehoused there accidents waiting to happen alot of blind spots people coud get hurt
good,"Bottle inspector. Prior to going into nursing. No longer in business in Longview,Texas"
good,Being at work 30 min prior to my shift to get a clear run down on production for the day.I've learned that being under staff causes
good,Main focus was on AHT. Customers needs were not put first but rather speed of calls. Very nice office and generous with incentives for matching company profile.
good,Supervise 40-50 people daily. Ensuring that the daily deadline is met. Major part of my job is to raise productivity which I am greatfully sucessful at.
good,In my point of view Its a nice place to work some of the superviser are to bossy in meaning I think the pressure from there boss is on them so then they lash it out on the plant worker you can get grilled for the smallest thing I know its a bussiness there is a way to talk to people not like a dumb monkey or something.And that I have been unfairly judged on my job performance and got not a cent for a raise the pay is low and its just not fair I think greed is really playing a nasty roll from the top of the chain and has people afraid for there job . Im looking for a another job with more money cause I cant keep living like this they give temps the run around one guy told me he been there a year and not hired yet and hes a good worker that gos back to my point of greed and no one giving a care in world but about self thats my thought as a worker there.
good,"Overall PepsiCo is a good place to work. As with every job, it has its good days and bad days.  It is a high pressure, results oriented company with promise for someone young and willing to work on the Sales side of the business, but has  outsourced about 80% of their IT department over the last 5-7 years so IT opportunities are diminishing."
good,"Pepsi was good at thanking you for years of service by giving decent gifts every 5 yrs. However, it's really hard to move up, or get relocated if needed. It's all who you know and how much you're liked.  And you won't make more than a new-hire. Everyone makes the same which was unfair."
good,"You will get plenty of hours and the pay is very good. The benefits used to be better. However, if you have a family, kids, spouse, or significant other, maybe reconsider working here. You will miss important dates. You will also be working with people who either don't work or work half as much as you but yet they are not penalized. There is no organization, communication, or support from supervisors. All in all if you want to make money I would say work here and focus on just doing your job."
good,I was there on contract so did not receive any benefits or vacation. Was required to work rotating shifts supervising unionized workers. Colleagues were great.
good,"empresa dinamica , coorporativa "
good,I was told that i would be getting a promotion just to find out that there was no promotion to be given. They consistently kept giving me empty promises. Your start time is no later 5am and you would have to finish your route no matter how many stores they would add you. I would have days to where i would be out there till 8pm at night amd no one would come to help.
good,"The job requires the employee to be able to work 10-12 hour days, rarely do I ever have an 8 hour day, when they're short handed it is mandatory for certain workers to work a sixth day, the workers that are chosen is determined by seniority. A good job for anyone seeking for plenty of overtime, but not so good if you enjoy more time spent with family  and friends."
good,If you like stress this is the job for you. Long hours with pressure to work a lot of overtime. Can be rewarding at times but you definitely go unappreciated.
good,management sucks they are completely unfair and looking to cut costs as fast as they can just so they can get a better promotion and get back to Toronto or wherever their from as fast as they can not caring who they hurt in the process was not like this for most of my career there just the last 2 years.
good,Pepsi is a great company however Pepsi Latham is not a organized place to work the management is terrible however you make money. You will work a lot and even work on your days off! Forced OT daily forced to work on days off too!
good,It’s an ok place to work.job can get stressful at times.be prepared to break ur back.hours are crazy anywhere from 8-14 hours a day depending on how fast the crew picks the orders.u are expected to pick 200 cases per hour.management sucks and u gotta be in with management to get promoted or get recognition for ur hard work.the pay is good but it’s like management chooses who they wanna see succeed management is the reason why the turnover rate is so terrible and they don’t know how to run a good system.they take advantage of u and they write u up for every little thing even for calling in sick or family emergencies
good,Not a very stable environment which drives down employee morale. There are constant senior leadership changes in the Chicago office.  In 15 years I experienced reorganizations with PepsiCo every 2 - 3 years and in recent years reorgs were closer to 1 - 2 years.
good,I wasted the best years of my life working for PepsiCo and the refurb center started off in final prep in the year 2000 was never gave one promotion one job advancement for 18 years you had management change every two years supervisors and leads that have no work ethic don't want to problem solve very hostile environment
good,It is a fast pace work environment. Sometimes orders never came in so we just sat around with nothing to do they never taught me how to run a forklift yet they expected me to know how just poor management.
good,Management does not divide orders evenly amongst  the workers....and certainly does not roll their sleeves up and contribute.....to me this is a bad example and makes it seem ok for the new llLeads....coming on to flat out disrespect and threaten our most hardest working employees......it all starts in office
good,"The hiring process was very unorganized and different people with the same background got different salaries and different levels in the workplace. Your hours are your hours. You cannot leave early, you cannot come in later. "
good,Hard place to work with management.  Numerous projects without regard to your main job of  manufacturing.  Terrible work/life balance.  Supervisors are held to rigorous standards.
good,Ni un apollo para los trabajadores  despidos y no hay seguridad de trabajo
good,"El equipo y ambiente de trabajo en cd juarez, es demasiado toxico, desgastante, muchas preferencias ante colaboradores que no hacen nada más que hacer más tenso el ambiente y ser ¨barberos¨. "
good,It is hard but also a fun place to work at.You stand for long periods of time(8-12 hours). The requirement is that you have to throw one-hundred cases of soda an hour.
good,"My experience may be different than others, but a lot of times I felt left out to dry by my manager meaning there were a lot of times getting to a big Walmart or Kroger and there was a lot more of a load in the warehouse  to break down and get out on the floor of the store then was expected and you are trying to hurry and get it all down so you can get to the next store on time. The times I requested help when it was way more than a one person job for the time frame you have, I had a really hard time getting in touch with my manager and getting any kind of help."
good,The job is based on you if you work hard you get off early if your not fit for fast pace work you want like it. The management is okay they let you know what you have done wrong.
good,If you wanna work all the time and be so tired when you get home that you cant do anything else for the day then this is the job for you. You will need your two days off to recover. Required OT little to no help when things start to get busy. Expected to work till the job is done which could end up being a double several times a week. Say there is room for advancement but instead will hire new graduates instead of advancing hard working people who always meet and exceed sales goals. If you not in with the managment then dont even bother applying to advance.
good,The most stressful work environment I have experienced.  You are not given an needed direction or feedback on how to be successful at your job.  It is 100% appearance driven culture.
good,Management Suck at pepsico.  I would never have a friend work for pepsi ever again.  Certain people should not be in management because they don’t have a leader ship to lead a team.
good,"Start early but trucks never on time so you end up working 15 to 16 hour days. No work life balance. Poor management. "
good,"stocking shelves all day "
good,"Not a great place to work if you have a family. You start off as a relief driver and don’t have a set schedule so if there are no routes available you get laid off. I was laid off for 3-4 weeks in a row and then they would have me work like a Friday which would pay for my gas, union dues, and insurance. They had side load trailers and you had to climb on tires and in bays to get the product off the trailer. The worst part for me about this job is the merchandising. You could have 100 cases to merchandise at 1 store. If your low man on the totem pole your gonna get the worst routes which will have anywhere from 2-6 merch stops and will hold you up all day. Management was cool, pay and benefits were decent. They have really bad equipment. There trucks are junk. For a billion dollar company you would think they would be better. There all old. They give you two wheeler so you can’t scoop product and have to fight to get one everyday cause they don’t have enough. I went from food service to Pepsi and the commission at Pepsi didn’t add up for me so I went back to food service just more money and no merchant dising. $79 a day base pay is garbage"
good,"The people you work with are great.  Everyone supports one another, and works together to get through daily tasks.  Can be a very fun and productive work environment."
good,Management was hard to deal with. They have a severe lack of communication. Management has their few “chosen ones” that receive prefered treatment.  If you do not fit into this group you are singled out.
good,Easy work but low pay. Will need a second job to work here.  That is all. No need to say more. All is good with coworkers. Great people . A typical day at work.
good,After 19 years forced to resign because someone in management  did not like me. Bosses would not fight fo me did my job went above for people and still had to resign work 60 hrs a week doing 17 to 18 stops a day very physical
good,"great place to work and grow your career, fair wages, fun environment, great people. wish the pay was a bit more for this fortune 500 company but hey it is what it is."
good,One of the most demanding jobs I've ever had. You will make great money but i worked third shift and when i got off i was always tired and never had time to do anything other than sleep and work lol but i didn't mind because i saved a lot of money and bought a new car and apartment in little to no time of just starting this job.
good,Easy to finesse. Managers don't care if you go above and beyond so it is not necessary to try hard. Don't over exert yourself for no reason because they will just make you work more.
good,I plan on leaving for a better paying job. typically day is me cutting the plastic of the gatorade boxes. This job should be used as a second job in my opinion because it will not pay the bills alone.
good,"Live working here the is no work life balance. Was given paid time off but was made felt guilty when taking it,not a team player. Would love to advance but work schedule is overwhelming."
good,"Very long hours, start at a certain time but you are there until whenever the work is finished for the day. Management is very family biased, to the point where they will not fire someone FOR ANYTHING, including employees that come to work clearly under the influence of drugs/alcohol. Because of this, there is little to no opportunity for advancement. Part time workers are expected to complete and work the same hours as full time employees, but earn around half the pay."
good,Work hard and don't get recognize for loyalty and over achieving like you should. need to upgrade trucks and offer better discount price on products to employee's
good,matrix organization and global groups approach has created a harsh environment with a lot of pressure and uncertainty. Unfortunately company culture has not been improved in recent years.
good,"Terrible management, terrible business model changing every other year. large turnout rate as well as people being fired... Not trustworthy management."
good,Empresa grande em volume de produtos e colaboradores!
good,Reviews were short.  Didnt seem they were interested in my opinion.  Pay was always wrong on check. Didnt care about deaths and bereavement.  Father in law passed away had to report to work the next day
good,work life balance is poor.....management doesn't behave like a mature MNC...People are not good and supportive.a not recommended organistion to work...
good,"en salario todo esta bien, pero en horarios y trato de personal es muy decadente y hostil"
good,"tiene varis beneficios entre estos recorrido, alimentación y seguro médico privado."
good,Wouldn't recommend as a career but not bad pay for entry level work. Time off is hard. Only one day odd first year and one week vacation after a year but can only take vacation certain days.
good,"Pepsi in Tulsa OK, All around is a great company"
good,Good place for retail connections and advancement in related fields.  The work ethic naturally came alive with how focused the job entailed you to be.
good,once moving past the entry level position be prepared to sacrafice your personal life.  Management is wishy washy and constantly changes things so your always playing catch up with execution of daily tasks.
good,"Attend meetings, discussed remediation, vulnerabilities and process and risks to stakeholders."
good,"Manage union employees in an extremely fast-paced environment, with too much management changes. This combination increases the stress and work hours. The life work balance will be sometimes be none exciting when your work 12 to 14 hours per day 6 day a week for several months a year."
good,"PepsiCo has great people and great products, but their management has created a bad culture in past few years.  Pay/Benefits not great. Upward movement has been limited."
good,Boa empresa para se trabalhar só deveriam de valorizar mais os funcionários
good,"Cultura laboral deficiente"
good,If you enjoy a fast- paced work environment and physical labor then Pepsico is the place for you. The work hours leading up to the Super Bowl and summer months are very long with minimal assistance from management overall. Fellow employees typically stick together to help if possible.
good,I enjoyed working at Pepsi and made it into management.  However it took far too long to get there.  The hard work I put in and the long hours were not worth the pay I was getting there.
good,Ela peca em Qualidade de Vida 6x2 e muito ruim e a Liderança e fraca também
good,"management is the only problem really, as well as the pay for the amount of work done each day. this is pointless to have me keep typing words that really do not matter."
good,"a typical day at work have a 12 hours of duty, i learned to become more responsible and being a leader of a small group and giving more attention to every details for handling one of the most sensitive part of the company.workplace is fine.the hardest part of the job is the unpredictable schedule"
good,Prepare to start before the sun goes up. Work at least 12+ hours during high sales periods. Expect to help merchandiser work deliveries or have deliveries no touched on your day off.
good,Transferred to this job not what I thought was willing to change jobs now or at least see what over possibilities are out there and to see if another job would be a good move
good,"Pepsi needs to figure out who they really are & not who they need to endorse to bring their brand to where Coca Cola is. They have made the job a true back breaker without true support on the lines. There were some perks, but I really cant tell you what they are."
good,"New management is stressing everyone.  Due to company change within the last year and 1/2, everyone is on ends whether or not their job is safe or not."
good,"Good money, but you will be treated like a dog. "
good,A typical day at work with Managers not being on the same page.  Co-workers behavior always conflict with their Production work.  I learned that people really don't want to work as a Team Unless all of the work is done by somebody else.   Managers constantly change shifts with confusion and none of them will take the blame when their poor decisions making go Horribly wrong in Production.  The workplace culture is pretty much Diverse.  the hardest part of the job is when other Co-workers cause more work for others and never pull their own weight.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when Production becomes relatively Moderate and the Management confusion is decreased.
good,"PBG (Pepsi Bottling Group) was a nice place to work. After it was acquired by PepsiCo the culture changed.. more rules and structure, competitive coworkers, just a general feeling of uneasiness. ."
good,The job is fast paced and grueling on the body. The hardest part of the job is not knowing what days you will be off. The most enjoyable part of the job is working/traveling alone.
good,"I had a good experience but management was very poor and cut throat. The pay is good but it is very stressful at times and how you feel about things does not matter, its all about pleasing the customer."
good,"Um dia de trabalho é muito envolvente e desafiador."
good,"Trabajo donde te exigen por metas de los diferentes productos q manejan y donde no llegues a las metas te disminuyen tu comicion , es de lucha constante."
good,"Decent company but they are very strict on breaks and they really have a terrible training plan and also scheduling is so up and down, you never know what exactly to do. Along with not being told what is supposed to be done at stores when the managers are supposed to outline the new additions for your stores is frustrating."
good,Overall not a bad place to work. Compensation and benefits are excellent. The managers don't listen to the employees and make unnecessary demands. No one seems to like working here.
good,"At Pepsi you are just a number. If you enjoy family time and your weekends, this is not the place to work. I'm not saying that to be ugly, but it is what it is...."
good,"Buena labor ,trabajo administrativo,atencion al cliente."
good,this place is the joke of the truck driving/service industry!!! they hire guys straight out of school and give them CDLs. they think they are making the big bucks! you have to put customers product up where other suppliers just leave on the floor.
good,"Management was very strict with absentees regardless of the reason unless you were a full time employee "
good,"Empresa com metas muito arrojadas, alto investimento em equipamentos novos e segurança de produção."
good,"trabajo facil, pero siempre con prisas."
good,"Un trabajo en cadena al que no estaba acostumbrada y en el que me adapte desde el primer dia."
good,"Your work/life is obsolete with pepsi-co. In others words you have none! Most times you are on call basically, as you pretty much get forced in 7 days a week and given little notice as to whether you will be off or not. The pay is spectacular if you are willing to work overtime. But say goodbye to assisting your kids with anything, dating you significant other, or planning anything with family. On most occasions you will either miss everything or be overworked so you will never enjoy the day off, you'll only sleep."
good,I loved this working at this company until recently.  I could not stand the constant complaining of the frontline employees.   On a daily basis the employees would complain about their routes and daily tasks required of them to complete their jobs   The atmosphere became toxic because no one would do anything to stop the complaining.  These employees were told of all the job requirements at time of hire yet they continue to complain and make life miserable for everyone around them.
good,"pepsi is out dated in macon, ga. the equipment, the trucks, the trailers and even the uniforms. have the worst way to deliver product. managers did not help the situation."
good,"A typical day was setting up everything for that days soda product. Testing the syrup,carbon dioxide,and the bottles prior to production. Once standard are met, an actual is pull from each line and test.  The product is tested and approved for production. My job was to test the product off my line to maintain standard and to make adjusted accordingly."
good,"A ver, la empresa es numero uno en el rubro de snacks por lo que siempre se es bien recibido por los clientes."
good,"long hard hours with an unpredictable schedule, leaving very little personal time for the workers. i also found no time to enjoy the money or time to spent on anything long term aside from work"
good,empresa reconocida buena imagen a nivel comercial desgraciadamente estava mal controlado a nivel administrativa
good,not the best place to be if you have a family the hours are long 16-18 every day 30min break for lunch the management and the coworkers are all very unprofessional
good,"high volume call center with a focus on sales. Must meet targets set for each agent and little opportunity for advancement. Seems to hire from the outside as opposed to hiring from within, Not a lot of investment in their employees"
good,"self train"
good,There is to much favoritism and harassment that happens and working the 60 hour weeks or more just began to not be worth the stress or sadness. Also unfairness according to certain plants such as requirements from one plant should apply to all with some exceptions.
good,During the winter months you'll get 8 hours or less but in the summer you could be there for 10+ hours. Moving fast paced which means 200 cases an hour in almost 100 degree warehouse.
good,Worked overnight picking orders for bulk then we would load the side load trucks some days would go smoothly but mostly it wouldn't because a lot of people would call in and we were always short handed
good,"No advancement available. Interviews for advancement are just a formality as someone is already chosen to do the job role."
good,I drove sometimes or went out and merchandised. Also as a swingman you had to go store to store and merchandise the product.
good,"Trabajo 24/7 sin calidad de vida y un ambiente laboral terrible"
good,"I worked here for two and a half years, they want so much out of you but are not willing to help when you ask for it. Again, good job, bad management. Keep your head down, don't talk to anyone and don't do your job like you think you should, cut corners and your be just fine."
good,"Pays well, but in need of a union job security is an issue. Work days are long and work tends to come home with you.(Filling out time sheets and gas mileage sheets everyday.)This job is very physically demanding and get over-whelming at times. Yet some days are very relaxed"
good,"Management is very lean, there are not many avenues for growth unless you are willing to relocate. It was a great initial job, but I am looking for more responsibility in my role."
good,"I have worked for pepsi for three years now. communication from management is awful, along with  them not holding people accountable. Managers are nice but they play favorites. This was a union facility so no matter how hard you work you still have to have more seniority to get a job over a coworker. The turn over rate is super high therefore if you can stick out a few years you can switch jobs. The job itself isn't  bad if you are willing to work hard. There isn't a shift so you work till the job is finished. I have worked many 70 and 80 hour weeks shorthanded. The management will let you get as much overtime as you want as long as job gets done which can be quite annoying if you don't want to spend your whole life at work. If you have a family you will not see them very often. Pay is great and insurance is pretty good."
good,"i drove around from machine to machine and filled them with soft drinks, food, hot or cold, typical work day included driving and working both inside and out side alot, in any weather condition. My coworkers were quite and helpful we all worked independently and at the end of the day you might be lucky to count money and deposit it into the bank drop box together. the most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom to work your own schedule and not have someone watching you constantly."
good,"Um trabalho que exigia muito sendo difícil conciliar vida pessoal com profissional. Aprendi muita coisa nas áreas administrativa, financeira, controles, logística. Apesar de uma rotina muito puxada havia um bom ambiente de trabalho entre os funcionários. A parte mais complicada era o suporte e fiscalização a área de vendas, onde era responsável pelo controles e alguns deles não dependiam exclusivamente da administração mas sim da área de vendas. A parte mais agradável era quando atingia os resultados em meio a tanta pressão e tinha a sensação de dever cumprido."
good,"We were trained to taste colas. We had to then be able to rank it on a scale of 0 -15. We were a group of 8 and grew to a panel of 14. This was so very interesting to learn what goes into making a cola. Our panel leader was a great teacher and really got us to perform as ""one"". The most challenging part of being part of a panel like this is getting everyone to agree on things"
good,PepsiCo was a good place to work at first and then the leadership tanked; meaning poor leadership. You are required to work all weekends and holidays and ten to fourteen hour days while being harassed for running over.
good,There is not enough Diversity very intimidating work environment for minorities.There is no room for growth. Major disappointment with this company.
good,"High expectations, but still attainable goals . Required to build pallets with a minimum of 200 cases per hour .With pratice goal was easy to reach , but still high."
good,"Working for Pepsi was a great opportunity. Being in the field allowed me to be a self starter and competitive. Management was overall good but understandable to all needs. The hardest part of working for pepsi was the lack of communication, And there was a lot of that. What i enjoyed most about the job was all the people i got a chance to meet both in and out of the field."
good,"The driver position begs for young able bodied individuals who are willing to work extensive hours (60+) per week.  Individuals interested in earning a good wage, while sacrificing personal/family time should inquire."
good,The Indianapolis location is horrible and very racist. New hires and old quit everyday due to the conditions and the machines continue to break down.
good,"The marketing organization is constantly in flux due to two factors: 1. The company's rapid rotation policy (a net positive) and 2. A fast-moving, Type-A culture which can be great if you fit a very specific (read uptight) mold known as Pepsi Pretty, but which also has a tendency to burn out people; creating high employee churn."
good,This could be the best place in Orlando to work. There are a few issues. The pay is very low compared to others doing the same job.
good,"maintained daily and weekly invoices, purchase orders, and packing slips.  Cut checks for payables and commissions weekly."
good,"PepsiAmericas was a family owned company with approximately 28 plants and distribution facilities. The work was fun, fast paced, and detail oriented to an extent."
good,"El área de ventas especificamente donde estoy ya que el ambiente es bueno sin embargo las codiciones físicas del lugar dejan mucho que desear de acuerdo a la capacidad de una marca de talla internacional."
good,"Management does not care about you"
good,It is an enjoyable part of my job if there is big breakdown and you are troubleshooting that kind of problem. It is hard to make a decision when there is a big risk considered. I learned from this company how to become a good leader and develop my strengths.
good,"The lack of good management during my time with PesiCo, made it a very difficult enviroment in which to progress to the next level. Very low employee morale."
good,I learned alot at pepsi how to be more patient and to have alot more people skills and i learned how to balance my day s out and how to properly manage my time
good,"Fast paced environment. Imperative to stay on-top of all production and processing lines. Need to deliver shift reports to all members of the company (HR, Maintenance, Engineering and Planning)."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo,buena relación con los compañeros"
good,"Working with Pepsi had a challenging daily routine. "
good,"- Attitude of manager and other superior is not good example to insult at shouting the employee."
good,"Mucha rotación de los vendedores, y falta de promociones para otros mandos. Ese fue el motivo de mi marcha."
good,"This company is very poorly managed. Internal communication is poor and there is no accountability. The pay is good, but not a long term career choice."
good,"Very poor communication and no support from management. Good pay , long work days."
good,Poor place to work and seek advancement. Since new union contract was signed many people who have worked there for many years have quit and moved on. Wages are low and work is tough for the salary.
good,"I drive to my first store and count what I need for the shelves, displays and coolers.then i go to the back room and load what i need onto a cart. then I fill the shelves, displays and coolers. once im done i condense the back room so we have as few pallets in the back room as possible. once im done I go to my next stop and do it all again until i have gone to all of my stops."
good,"long work hours"
good,"tally and pepsico customized software,day to day transaction entry level"
good,"Inicio labores a las 7.00 a.m. coordino acciones y objetivos para el día transmito al personal  las necesidades del día y el objetivo a lograr general , avances etc, etc, etc..."
good,"The Account Management position was a very fun position to work."
good,"Typical day starts at 5:30am driving to the 13 to 16 accounts that will cover 100 to 125 miles.  Greet customers, counting inventory, writing an order and selling new products to store managers is the start.  Looking over everything to make sure company standards are met in regard to flavor flow and space allocation.  You will eat in your car, make signage, take calls and live in your car.  You will arrive home at 6pm-7pm only to now read emails and reorganize for the next day.  This time which is critical for being effective and keeping your job takes at least an hour.  From 8pm to 9pm is for family and personal life, so enjoy. Finally, the phone will not stop, 1 of your 60 accounts will have problems with equipment, products, pricing or other pepsi employees constantly."
good,"Muito dificil atingir resultados sem estrutura, a burocracia engessa o processo ,, tudo e muito dificil, a cobrança e muito grande para que se alcance as metas, mas o respaudo e muito pouco"
good,Its fine just as long as they keep you after the seasonal period is over
good,"Worked at high pace, had to hit deadlines and guidelines on work ethic. Learnt a lot about everything that comes with working in a Warehouse and a Production area. My co- workers were one of the best parts of working there. The Management wasn't that special but they did what they had to do to get by. There is no such thing was the hardest part of my job but if i had to choice one it would have to be putting up with some of the people that work there. The best part of my job at Pepsi would have to be the benefits and the wages."
good,"I worked for pepsi and frito lay they are both owned by pepsiCo. They are both pretty decent jobs to have. If you are not a morning person and do not like to wake up extremely early these might not be the jobs for you especially frito lay.Your work day at frito lay can start anywhere between 3 am - 7 am depending on the type of route and you can expect to work anywhere from 6 -13 hrs daily. You will have your easy days and you will have your hard days , the hard days can be very stressful and can break you if you let it I've seen and heard of new hires that break down and cry and call a supervisor to help them finish the route. your easy days are great sometimes you don't even work 8 hrs and you get home and have the majority of the day to yourself.A good thing about being a frito lay route driver is that if you take care of your route your supervisors don't bother you your basically your own supervisor and can do what you want and can make good money if the store managers on the route like you, you get paid off of commission and base pay so u make money off of what product u sell into these stores so the more you sell the more you make. the hardest part of the job to me was the extremely early mornings and sometimes long hrs it just wasn't for me."
good,"- Average number of hours worked per day = 14hrs"
good,I was hired by pepsi beverages which was bought by pepsico who brought all their people in and slowed the whole company down
good,Certain level of job security & great workplace setting nothing more good or bad. Not great growth opportunity for experienced staff but pretty good for new college grads
good,"I am a Bulk Account Rep. I have a route of 5 stores I do. One of them is a Wal-Mart (they are annoying). I order the product for the stores, and put it all out at each store. It's hard on my shoulders and wrists. Plus, as a ""salesmen"" I have to sell new stuff in all the time and change displays....  ready for something new!!"
good,The company is ok but you put in some hours.  Good company with benefits.
good,Long and Hard Hours nice co-workers very good training program
good,"Resumindo esta empresa em ""Escola para profissionais""."
good,Plenty of lay-offs and not many full time employees. Most of the company is contractors. Challenging position and many projects in which I gained a lot of experience.
good,leave early come home late
good,Pepsi Co is a very physical and labor intensive job all the way around.From the Merchandisers to the Managers.Building displays
good,"Uma empresa ""boa para se trabalhar"", porém, de pouca oportunidade para funcionários."
good,Coworkers were a great unit to work with. The upper management shielded themselves from many incentives proposed by employees.
good,"Pepsi is a good company that pays decent and provides decent benefits but the oppertunity to advance in the company is very limited unless the management above you favors you over the other employees. It's hard work that doesnt allow you to have alot of time off because you are needed every day except your schedualed days off, no wiggle room on special days needed off."
good,Working for Pepsi is rewarding in the sense that you can place it onto your resume they don’t train much and just throw you into the field went on maternity leave and no one really helped
good,"Great company to work for. "
good,"Your experience at PepsiCo will be dictated by your manager. The skills you develop, your advancement opportunities, your work life balance will all be based on who your manager is. The up side to this is, managers tend to rotate pretty frequently, usually every 18-24 months. The down side to this is, you nor your manager are never around long enough to really retain skills learned in that position. But if your looking for a super fast paced environment, where by your managers and peers expect you to be a veteran within 8 weeks, this is the company for you!"
good,"Je moet komen werken om te werken, meer hoef je niet te verwachten"
good,"Being a salary employee ,they want you to work until the job is finished with no extra compensation . When hired on the job was supposed to be from 1:00pm until 10:00pm I never saw those hours at all . I was working on average 12 to fifteen hour nights and this was supposed to be a midday shift ."
good,"En general no me gusta el ambiente , hay mucha envidia y mucha preferencia."
good,"Lots of stability, little to no work life balance for the hourly associates. little to know appreciation or recognition for going above and beyond. not real clear guidance from management"
good,"It was ok, lots of hours and very difficult to schedule time off. The salary personnel are very limited so youre stuck when it comes to getting help. They need help"
good,"Do not work there unless you really need a job. More work, less pay with management that micro-manages. You have to sale, sale, sale even when the customer does not want the product."
good,Management does not work as a team. Doesn't bring a positive vibe to the workplace. Needs to work on their people skills and show their employees that they bring a lot to the table
good,It’s an ok place to work pay sucks. But it’s fast pace and very easy pay jus not good. Good manger and ok teammates. But overall I like and it’s and ok
good,"It was a good company before PepsiCo bought it out. The training is very under par. Work hours are never the same each week.pay grades happen about every 2 years,makes it hard to survive."
good,DO NOT TRUST ANYONE ! ABSOLUTELY NO SAFETY  ! Bad management. If your not related to anyone or drinking buddies with co workers you will not last. Lazy co workers who hide behind the union and being buddies with management.
good,The shifts are much longer than described in the job posting and is volume based. This was not explained in the interview therefore it caught me by complete surprise.
good,Have been a loyal and dedicated employee exceeding company expectations year after year and have always worry about what pay and life balance will be the next year. Commission s have been lowered benefits that were part of compensation now are out of pocket expense. Stock options taken away. Christmas party taken away. Expected to use personal phone with now compensation
good,"Pepsi was a good job my days consists of early morning like 12 am until 11:30 am delivering to Walmart,Publix,and dollar Generals truck was loaded for u it was a alright job"
good,Repetitive work just packing aways product on crates ready to get sent off and trying to make our daily pallets and reaching our goal somewhat a calm work environment
good,Work starts in the middle of the night so having work life balance with a family that is on a  9-5 schedule is impossible.  The communication from management was challenging.
good,build pallets load trucks. no room for advancement. most enjoyable the guys i worked with. very long days. teamwork. once in a while free lunch. little to no safty
good,"I have worked with PepsiCo for 2 and a half years. Over that time I have made great achievements and learned a lot of jobs, The benefits and paid vacation are great."
good,day starts at  6am take care of drivers with any issues before going on road or fork lift problems .Then go on to scheduled work for the day. Manager may change jobs as day goes on depending on priorities.
good,"Dont do it it’s not worth the"
good,Unfortunately they are moving management to not so well prepare persons in Latin America that don’t know that people in North America have profesional And human rights
good,"The admin staff, at all levels, were super nice,  helpful and have your back. I happen to support a senior level executive, that no matter what you did, it wasn't good enough. I found out later that she has a habit of going through assistants. Wish I know this before I accepted the job."
good,I actually like working for PepsiCo. There will be things at every job that you may dislike buy the main thing for me were the amount of hours they wanted me to work. I'm a single mother so the fact that tr they wanted me to work 16 hour shifts almost five days a week was absurd. The pay and benefits were great though. I had no complaints about that. Management needs to do better though.
good,Mangers only support managers not their employees. Home office listens but once the management team hear about you calling home office. Your now in the hot seat.
good,"Pepsi is a great company to work for if you do not have a family. Pay is great, but the management is poor. Management is actually controlled by the Union. Job is numbers driven so if you do not meet the numbers you could lose your job. If you excel in the number department the Union stewards will slow you down. Every union worker must be at the same pace and the union looks for Teamsters commitment instead of individual career advancement."
good,Pay and benefits are great.  The days can be very long especially when you have to wait for everyone else to do their jobs. The worst thing about this location is management and their lack of willingness to actually manage.
good,"I have 30 years of experience to draw from. Very quickly I realized that Pepsi's executive management was nepotistic, mendacious, political, and ultimately, a stain on employers everywhere."
good,Consists of watching a machine cleaning and data entry. There's a little forklift driving at times and package changeovers. Also one may be asked to work in a different department if short handed.
good,"Πολλες χρονοβορες  συναντησεις"
good,"Se aprende a ser pasiente "
good,Fair to below market average for payroll. Limited room for advancement.  Remote positions available. Long hours. High expectations. Little career growth guidance.
good,"I was in desperate need for a job when i started, but its something you wouldn't want to do forever. The work will get to you. No advancement in the company."
good,"The senior management team and the sales employees had a strained relationship due to the attempt for the salesmen to become unionized. Trust was never regained by me and the work hours were unnecessarily long. The salesmen were given duties that weren't under their purview, like having to tell lies to store personnel and be held accountable for merchandisers work even though we weren't their supervisors. I liked the system I came from in another state where I was responsible for the work and I was responsible and rightfully so for the condition of the store. A typical day was getting up at 3:30 am to start my day by 430am and being out in the field until up to 12 hours a day 5 days a week. The downside was not spending enough time with my wife, this lifestyle was unhealthy in the long run."
good,Plus de 50% du temps de travail passé sur le trajet à cause de la disparité de magasin à gèrer
good,Pretty much as the title describes. You're paid well for what you do. But management is clueless and your co-workers can be the worst people you've ever met.
good,"My day to day work experience at this company was great and most interactions with my coworkers were pleasurable. However management was rude, offensive, sexist, stereotypical and was often reported to higher management or HR. I personally had to have a meeting with HR because my executive chef asked me in front of everyone if i had missed work because i was 'getting my weave did'. Once reported no immediate actions were taken and the behavior continued until i eventually left the company to work elsewhere."
good,"Excellent place for those just starting out in their career. As you age, it becomes harder to get promoted in this highly political and competitive environment. Little training provided, sink or swim mentality,"
good,One week you could make a good check the next week could be 3-400 less. Inconsistent hours causing for your schedule to vary week to week with last minute notice.
good,"I worked for Pepsico for 3 years, it's a was good experience as far as driving, but other than that I wouldn't recommend it. You get paid $24 to deliver the product and you also have to merchandise the product as well. Believe me when I tell you, you will be over worked and underpaid, and management does not have your back when it's an issue with the customer, and the equipment sucks. They dont care what's going on with the equipment they just want the product delivered anyway possible. So if you just got you CDL and no one else will take you than try Pepsi."
good,"Loved working with the long term employees, management is inexperienced which drove division among the employees and poor morale.  No one cared who was working and who wasn’t....,"
good,"not bad place to work just alot of changes with management at the moment, a lot of constant changes to how things are run on daily basis . low moral on shop floor"
good,This job requires too much of employees for the pay. There is no asking from management on time off just that it needs to get done. I spent more time working then I did with my family. I left the company because I got sent on a deployment. Thank god I did.
good,"I began working at Pepsi Co at a West Texas branch. They were willing to train me until I could take the driving test to acquire my Class A CDL. After a year I transferred back to my home town, and worked another 2 years at an East Texas branch. There was little room for advancement. With such a small location the chances to advance to a supervisory position was rare, and raises were steadily declining, as were work hours. I was offered a higher paying position with a larger beverage company, which is what nudged me to switch company's."
good,"quick pace and need to be fast learner in order to make it in pepsi, I worked part time and since I am a fast and quick learner did not had any trouble learning"
good,"Overall, Pepsi was was an interesting experience. I joined Pepsi right after graduation and like most fresh graduates, I wasn't sure what to expect. It took me a few months to adjust to the culture of the company. Pepsi is a fast paced work environment and they truly believe in the idea of rewarding employees based on results with little politics involved. How those results were achieved, well that's where it gets a little grey. In multiple situations, I found myself questioning whether to do the right thing or to do something that would get me promoted. It's a warning sign when those two options don't often match. The management culture at the site I worked at was the opposite of what fosters a productive work environment. Confrontations and shortcuts were viewed as aggressive and ""go-getter"" while logic and calculated moves were not recognized. I would like to think this was an anomaly and can't represent Pepsi as a whole, you don't get to be a fortune 50 company with this type of culture plagued throughout the organization."
good,"the job is easy to do the enviroment created by bad managment "
good,"it doesn't matter now, the job didn't give me a chance under management keith washington, i find him to be unprofessional when dealings with him. he wouldn't be the guy i would have supervising one of my locations"
good,Really hated the weird routing system. Why would they have somone in Atlanta Georgia doing the routing for Tampa??? Makes no sense. Many times there are customers next door to each other but they will have you go far and then come back to that customer. I wish they would update the trucks  and system like they say they would.
good,Empresa boa falta uma política Boa de reconhecimento e remuneração
good,"Great benefits, the job is a physical job so either you can do it or you can't, a lot of overtime, the managers cannot perform the job at hand which makes them unable to help you do the job whic is the main reason that my stay here is short lived."
good,"Pepsi is a messed up company.  The management that they hire does not care about anyone but themselves.  Fellow employees are great, but it is very cutthroat.  If someone doesn't like you look out.  A lot of backstabbing and drama"
good,The company is still mechanically backwards and there is no room for development coupled with a long hour of working on a shift. It usually tiring as people with higher educational qualification are not given room to progress on the job.
good,"Very poor Work-Life balance"
good,"muy puntuales, trabajo pesado, piensan en la salud de una forma si y de otra no, horas extras pagas pero son muchas."
good,"Long, early shifts. Very active job, lots of time on your feet. Pays well and is union. Management always seemed flustered and confused. Need your own car but paid mileage."
good,"I was slightly overworked since I completed more tasks than I had to. I had to do some work that wasn't covered by my contract. I was underpaid and they cut that payment regardless of my attendance. With a change in these few things, it would have been a good experience."
good,A typical day at work is picking orders via headset for 8 to 10 hours per day then getting on a forklift for the remaining 2 to 4 hours. Meanwhile workers with lower senority were sometimes only picking for 2 to 4 hours. Management did not know how to spread out the workload nor put higher senority guys first. Also there was no room for advancement. They did not promote from within the company. The most enjoyable part of my job is working with some of my best friends whom i met through the company.
good,"Right now, lots of executives focused on ""Innovation"" who don't really understand how things actually work.  Many firedrills and extra work for things that are forgotten about with the next manager."
good,"Excellent pay and benefits. Fast paced,I ran 4 lines that changed over frequently ,hard to find space to put product and difficult to move product for lack of time. Would have to put product in isle blocking other departments of molbility. After i made space ,I would have to move that product from the isle to the space I emptied. Causing myself to fall behind and make errors"
good,Pays well for the area but you will be taken advantage of. job is easy but requires too much mental fortitude for how easy your job requirements. They dont hold all employees to the same standard
good,"Pepsi runs a very lean work force, therefore they overwork you. Management has an issue of relying on the team they've assembled and micromanage every little detail."
good,good people badly managed building. work employees overhaul. need more people but the turnaround is so high they cant keep enough staff. a typical day at pepsi is 16 hrs on average.
good,"Over worked, over worked and extremely underpaid. "
good,"When I started all anyone could talk about was how great the job USED to be. I was happy because it was seemingly less work than my previous job with similar pay. Turns out the work itself while simple in nature is subject to the elements. You have to work outside regardless of the weather conditions. Its not just a walk from the truck to the store its pulling things off the trailer from 14 different bays in rain sleet sun or snow. Its hard on the body. All I do is deliver cases but it used to be that the drivers were also the sales reps and built orders and made more money i guess??? Who knows! About 4 of the more senior guys quit at the end of the summer and after working a few 14 hour days I'm starting to see why. Even the senior guys that stuck around have said that this summer is the worst its ever been, so its hard for me to know what to do and if i can plan to stay here and trudge through the BS or not. They pay to train and give you CDL-A but you have to stay for 3 months to keep it. No PTO until a year of service."
good,zero possibility to make overtime  its really boring slow paced they track productivity but everyone fights over y theirs is lower than someone else  its drama
good,You will get paid less than a driver while working more hours. Your cost of benefits will be double theirs and management will not believe you’re smart enough to do the job. The drivers really have all the power and rule you. Good luck with this position and average life span of one is 5 months.
good,Management would find any excuse to fire someone they did not like personally.  More time wasted taking merchandise out of the plant and bring it back to show sales.
good,Working as a laboratory analyst in Pepsi is very challenging and time-constraint. You need to do multitask in a fast-paced everyday working scenario. Overtime are well-compensated.
good,"Due to constantly being under staffed we're frequently asked to work our days off, or pick up extra accounts. Then when you do have a day off most of the time your cover will do a poor job leaving extra work for you when you return, and again because of being under staffed, management is reluctant to fix the problem."
good,I was in a hit and run and was not treated fairly. When released from comp leave I was told I had to take a pay cut and move to garage. I did not do so and waited until my manager returned from vacation. He also offered the same returning position.
good,I am glad that I had my job there but was not a positive employment experience.  Some management was okay but others were very self focused and hard to understand and work for.
good,"PepsiCo competes with global, regional, and private companies across the food and nonalcoholic beverage space. In the food industry, the company’s rivals include ConAgra Foods, Inc. (CAG), Kellogg Company (K), Kraft Foods Group Inc. (KRFT), Mondelez International, Inc. (MDLZ), Snyder’s-Lance, Inc. (LNCE), and Nestlé S.A. (NSRGY)."
good,"I like working here as far as what i o i just dont see any advancement and no further pay raises, if i was to get a pay raise when i was told i was one year after i started i would not be looking integrity is important"
good,"supervisors are great to work with but lack in areas, alot of mis communication. pricing issues with customers on various products changes daily with that and scheduling alot of conflict on delivery times with customers as well as conflicts on billing"
good,Management has no idea what they are doing. Won't listen to employees for help. Co.pay doesn't follow the contract between the Union and them. So many violation and grievences. HR falsifies people's person information. People are fired because of this misuse of authority.
good,Start of day was to check truck to make sure it was in safe operating manner. Selling company product to local convenient stores. The hardest part of the job was the early morning hours.
good,"I managed the four Pepsico shops in South Florida. I managed different shops some directly with union labor and others with company labor with specific attention to providing a good working relationship between the repair shop and customer requirements, address their issues and still enforce production, safety, cost control, revenue growth, profitability and company priorities. I managed all the fleet department processes. From managing the budget P & L and inventory of parts, to coordinating the mechanics daily schedule, equipment PM scheduling, tasks and objectives to meet company needs. I also managed and approved all expenses, purchases and the payroll. Extensive knowledge with repairs of refrigerated trailers, generators, dry containers, chassis, dry trailers and all types of fleet vehicles."
good,"Job is ok but benefits and compensation do not commensurate with the labor requirements of the job. There is job stability for the most part, though. The problem is with local management, their decisions are not employee friendly for the most part."
good,"Typical day at work was from 8am-5pm.  Load reconciliations, customer service, answering phones, end of day register, proof and post, A/P filing, A/P invoice coding/entry, process check run when needed, statements, researching past due invoices when needed, boxing files when needed. Covering for absent employees at minimum once a week."
good,Great company with great benefits. Ideal for young people. You have no life outside of Pepsi. No set work schedule. You work until the quota is met for the night which may sometimes be 18 hours a day.
good,you are compensated very well but work life balance is at a negative.
good,"I learned a lot at Pepsi and appreciate it as a place to really cut your teeth in the sales field.  The pace and  stress was always high as were the expectations for product sales and the securing of additional display space. "
good,I had a long career at Pepsi and was able to work in several different departments. It is all consuming and you need to be able to establish your own guardrails or you will work 70+ hrs. a week.
good,"Learned a lot, always have meets keeping the employees up to date with their new product, management was terrible, had to kiss up with management,  ez"
good,No way to advance no warning on overtime trucks would usually come and your or more late sometimes had to work 3 or more stores in one day always shorting you on checks
good,Not a career I wanted to continue. I really don't have anymore to say about the job. I'm just trying to type enough characters to move forward with this.
good,"Ambiente muito bom, colegas ótimos. Gestores tendem a confundir vida pessoal e trabalho, acabam fazendo desligamento de funcionários bons pelo simples fato de não gostar deles. Aprendizes possuem pouca ou nenhuma chance de efetivação."
good,"Werken in de customer service van Pepsico is een boeiend job."
good,Supervise warehouse loaders within the warehouse
good,"Καλός και τυπικός σαν εργοδότης,πολύ κακό το εργασιακό κλίμα και περιβάλλον"
good,"Company believes in culture where they hire talents from engineering college with very poor package, where operators get higher salary than executives. They seriously need to change such policies."
good,"Co-workers get along great and make the work worth the time. "
good,gostei muito de trabalhar lá também tinha oportunidades de crescer na fabrica
good,"Very stressful days, long hours, lots of deliveries. Customer accounts were the best part of the job. I loved getting to talk with our customers every day. Healthcare was great for families."
good,"Job is very physically demanding, so you definitely get your exercise. Management doesn't really understand your day to day challenges and is fairly clueless about the driving portion of your job. There is plenty of overtime in the summer, but they get very slow in the winter. There is pretty much no chance to move up in seniority or into a truly full time position. There are drivers who have been there for 3 years that still don't get full time hours in the winter. It is a good job to make a bunch of money over the summer."
good,"Coworkers are easy to get along with everyone is down to earth. Is a good experience in warehouse , manufacturing, and machine operation skills. It's a good first job but not a good long term."
good,"Driving most of the day, sales; outside, Customer oriented. Breaking down merchandise, put out on shelves, shelf reviews, shelf rotations, ordering products."
good,"Most training is done on the job. The management had a high turn over rate so it's difficult to say, anything could happen and change here. Alot of good people work here and that is what made it enjoyable to work long hours."
good,their OTR fleet is run by people that have no Idea what over the road is about they treat it like their delivery fleet and that just does not work and they refuse to see it
good,Trabajo muy bueno pero sin tiempo para descansar tiebe unos horarios nada flexibles tiene altas comisiones pero no reconoce horas extras
good,"I delivered soda products and was salary Monday - Friday I was told I would work 6-3 and ended up working till 8 or 9 p.m. I worked hard, communicated well. I loved driving the semi. I was trained quickly."
good,"A typical day working as a pepsi merchandiser isn't always pretty. sometimes u go in to the work day and can be smooth sailing all the way through, besides the regular fill ups and spinning labels on the bottles for décor. But most days you will not be a happy worker. sometimes you go into work and think its going to be an easy work day but then walk into a disaster of a work area.. shelves and coolers blown out (empty) product that could go out the day before but is still sitting in the backstock.. it had its ups ands downs but overall is a good environment to work in."
good,"Being a merchandiser for Pepsi starting off a pretty decent job, but then management started doing what they do best and ruined things. I was frequently sent to work an hour away (not compensated) and other guys were sent to work in the city I lived in. A lot of the people there were good people, but the ones making the decisions weren't."
good,I would not recommend this company to anyone unless they just have a passion for this business.  Grossly underpaid for very hard work.  Significantly improved my territory and did not receive the recognition or rewards to show for it.
good,"Buen lugar de trabajo, comodo, horarios rotativos.."
good,"Worked on a temporary basis for several weeks. Not enough time to assess the company. Slow paced, friendly atmosphere. Good work / life balance but low salary."
good,Only back part of this job is nothing is ever set and stone. everyday you go into the job you never know what to expect. But it is nice that your able to kind of be your own manager when your on the route.
good,Flexible hours to start in the morning. Was able to get help when needed and there was someone available. Part of a union and received the pension plan.
good,"Unorganized, professional, very cut throat type of atmosphere. However is you are just getting started as a driver then this is good experience. You will work hard and really get to understand how long shifts are when driving and really understand DOT rules and regulations and the importance of knowing the law and the importance of pre-trip for tractors and trailers."
good,A typical day is high volume call filled and most calls extreme emergency. I learned about the operations of a call center and a lot about manager employee communication. The hardest part of the job was the inclement weather requirements
good,There seems to be a group or faction that is working only to get through the day. This group does not perform as team players and can make the work shift very tedious.
good,i worked in the warehouse and in summer you'll get 70 hr easy during winter yo should get 40 but sometime 38 over all good place to work but you better be ready to work
good,"Get a lot of independence moving to grocery stores around the city and surrounding area where you stock pop that is dropped off by the delivery trucks."
good,Fue mi primer trabajo no me gustó mucho pero lo necesitaba y. Era temporario por tres meses
good,PepsiCo is a nice place to work.  They are very dedicated to their employees.  I have learned alot working in the Consumer Relations Department and will use the tools where ever I go.  The people in my department are wonderful.  They are very nice and so very helpful.  Always there to answer any questions or help out with any situation.
good,"if you are bored with your life and have nothing better to do than just working and you do not care who you are working with, go ahead and get a job with pepsico"
good,"PepsiCo is a great and fun place to work. Lately has taken many decisions that put their employees and talent not in first place as it used to be. Leaders used to be well rounded executives with a lot of knowledge of the business and the market. Today, there are a lot of leaders that are not capable functionally and their leadership skills are very poor."
good,"Excellent Company to work for. Always trying to help and advance employees. Work life balance is Rather pleasant helping satisfy your schedule, depending on schedule."
good,"work from home opportunities"
good,An independent contractual work. You manage your own time. One enjoyable aspect is traveling around Visayas as part of your job. Co workers are very friendly and accommodating.
good,"una empresa reconocida internacional mente ."
good,"Constant rotation of employees and managers. Lots of injuries, and no time to really manage a life outside of the facility. Short breaks, constant back-riding...you get the pic."
good,High requirements to meet targets. Job requires sometimes a lot of overtime in meeting production targets. Plant is not managed in the correct way and on most decisions workers are not considered
good,"Typical plant environment with a major focus on house keeping, cleanliness, and safety over all. For a supervisory position, I believe the salary is not as competitive with similar roles elsewhere however growth possibilities are apparent."
good,Satisfactory work environment without many opportunities for advancement for the salaried or hourly associates. Unionized workforce making lower wages.
good,Working at Pepsi is a experience in itself .With warehouse and production combined I have work in both and currently work in production  maintenance.  The work load I've taken on has not fit my lifestyle comfortable so I am seeking to find an employer that may fit myself in a better environment for a well balanced life.
good,"No human rights, infiltration in the market and the various price in the market which giving you a hard time to achieve your target and no action from the management"
good,eu gostei da esperiensia pela a empresa em si nao gostei do gestores pelo gual eu trabalhei
good,"habilidades com empacotamento agilidade com manuseio de pale teira ,organizaçao da linha."
good,"They have trainers that have been working there for 20+ years. It is like they have forgot how it is being the ""new guy"". Knowing what to do at each stop or the correct way of moving product...they act like you should just be able to come off the street and do it the pepsi way. Just two trainers for that location and they both do things different so if you are working with a other person and you are doing things the way that you were trained the week before and its not their way its like a crime in their eyes."
good,I went to 4 to 5 accounts a day and serviced the stores. Cleaned the shelves and restocked with Pepsi products and kept back room stock area clean for our product.
good,"A typical day at work I managed the front line employees on the given shift to ensure all customer orders were loaded properly on company vehicles for delivery the following day."
good,"work day is from 6am-6pm."
good,Management will tell you any and everything to get you to do what they want to fill their large egos. They think because they have their names on a door that they know everything. They lie to get drivers out of the gates over weight or over hours. The safety of the drivers come second to their numbers (bonuses.)
good,"PepsiCo was conveniently located and a great place to work. Not a full-time job, only in summer busy season. Managers and coworkers made a great team, just need full-time employment."
good,"Didn't allow for a good work life balance.  Worked most holidays because accounts were open.  Great local team, poor market level management and HR was not supportive.  Successful on the local level but not recognized at the higher level."
good,"regular por la gente que tiene mayor cargo, no saber manejar a los trabajadores de la empresa."
good,The company became to numbers oriented. It lost it's personal feel it had when I first started working there. Took most of the jobs I liked doing there and moved them to another site.
good,"Ngày lễ tết của công ty luôn có chương trình giao lưu cho nhân viên"
good,"Clock- in. Pick a Pallet Jack Forklift. Grab List of Merchandise to be organized."
good,"I was wrongfully terminated by a lacking support of my management team. I worked for exactly one year for this company, and was never acknowledged for my hard work and dedication. I was asked to do several different jobs and work much more overtime than anyone else and always did what was asked with no problems. I never caused problems or argued with anyone. No subordination. I always had a good positive attitude. Very positive, dedicated, dependable individual and was let go for a stupid reason and wasn't even given a chance to speak or explain."
good,"Typical day was 10-12 hour shifts."
good,The work is not very satisfing in any way. You will have job security as long as you perform your duties properly. The benefits are adequate .
good,"You have to have alot of patience, and work diligently to meet the standard requirements. The pay was worth it. Wish I lasted longer."
good,"Empresa boa para se trabalhar com bons salários, gostava muito de lá, aprendi a valorizar a vida a família e amigos "
good,"It's a ok place but I just don't like thier pay rate,it's just too low for today's captialist world,I'm just there till I move on to a better job,and my career entrepreneurship,thankyou that's it"
good,"Great problem with management since they replace the guy before. I do what I need to do, what the boss ask me to do and that's it, I do not complain. I learned so much at this place but now I can't learned anything else. I love working with my co-worker because we have fun together and help each other if something goes wrong or the job isn't finish at the end of the day"
good,"I enjoy the Logistics field, as well as the work and the people I work with. I achieve satisfaction through supporting the people that rely on me to do my job safely and quickly."
good,"Fast paced job that involves delivering product to gas stations/supermarkets, dollar generals, etc. Typical day, you'll be delivering 300-400 cases, avg 10-12/hrs per day. Poor communication from mgmt, day in and day out is a mystery. Commission rate was recently cut in half. End result: Work harder for much less money"
good,"10 - 13 hour work days"
good,"They don't tell you how many hours you can work in one night for a reason. They know people wouldn't stay or better yet, want to work there at all. Management don't listen to you or give you an opportunity to try to make things happen for yourself."
good,"very nice place to work and feel apart of what a beverage company is about."
good,I liked working there as far as good pay. its easy to move up in this company but your position is not always secure if someone else wants it. its a lot of actual physical work if you are doing what you are supposed to do. the pay and being able to work by yourself is the most enjoyable thing about this job.
good,"You rarely see other people you work with so at times it can be peaceful, and getting paid weekly is also nice. starting a 4am sometimes can be a huge negative though especially if you aren't really a morning person"
good,"para empesar, la entrada es obligatoria de 20 minutos antes de entra a la linea, ademas de que dentro de este plazo es de suma importancia la realización de calentamiento de ejercicios para evitar algún malestar."
good,Walking about ten to fifteen miles a day and a lot of heavy lifting. I learned how to use a voice pick head set. I had no problems with management or the employees. The hardest part of the job was all the walking we had to do per day. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to use the voice pick headset
good,"Overall very relax, as long as you have a right manager. A lot of people have been working here for a long time. knowledge is a little bit out of date."
good,"Things I learnt were:"
good,Se realizan varios trabajos en el dia asique se presisa de mucha calma para trabajar bajo presion. Hubo muy buena rlacion con mis colegas y supervisor de trabajo. La parte mas dificil fue ponerle a la altura de los operarios (HOMBRES) ya que las tares relizadas eran igual para ambos sexos. Mi contrato fue por 3 mese por agencia de trabajo asique mucho trato con la direccion no tuve. Lo que mas me gusto fue la experiencia ganada en el puesto.
good,Pepsi is a good place if just starting out on a truck. Side load makes for loads not falling over. Typical work days range from 8-14 hours a day with up to 24 stops if not more. Co-workers were friendly to each other and usually would answer any questions you had.
good,"I was there in Pepsico at my industrial training from college."
good,"Good pay and benefits, but lacks management skills and advancement. Overall not happy to work for company"
good,"liked starting early and finishing the day early"
good,"•	Appoint distributor & Spoke"
good,"Decent job, as a merchandiser my day consists of going to about 7 large format stores and placing pepsi products on the shelves. Not a bad job because you can practically work as long as want but it is hard work. ITs easy to get stuck at this job because they pay you just enough to keep you but advancement is a longshot unless your a female."
good,"Trabalho comum com alguns problemas esporádicos, liderança um pouco desatenta, dificuldade para subir de cargo, trabalho leve, mas corrido, convivência harmoniosa com colegas, horário de refeição meio complicado devido revezamento."
good,Company has great brands which are exciting to work with. The most enjoyable part of the job is the entrepreneurial spirit of the company.
good,work day consist of making deliveries to large accounts filling vendors and some merchandising.our management team is very week and most co workers are a pleasure to work with
good,"14 plus hour work days, not much time for family time. Most weekends off but 6 day work weeks around holidays. Parking issues at some accounts. Lots of time spent merchandising. No hourly wages or overtime paid."
good,A merchandiser is a physically demanding job and is a good stepping stone for those who wish to have other opportunities with Pepsi CO.
good,el trabajo es bueno y bn pagado solok a mi no me gustan las ventas
good,"Aunque bien pagados, las jornadas laborar eran muy largas de 6am a 8 pm en promedio, lo que afectaba la estabilidad de la pareja."
good,Not a friendly place to work. No concern for employees. Ethics are questionable
good,"Spearheaded the entire gamut of function such as sales operation, marketing, administration, planning, team management, brand management, distributor management, coordination, implementation, training, safety management etc. "
good,"tiene un buen ambiente laboral,la gente es muy tranquila,los descansos estan bien distribuidos,el catering es regular."
good,"A typical day for a warehouse manager consist of long working hours, lack of appreciation.  Sales manager is manager over warehouse manager and they don't have to have warehouse experience, nor do they have to know your daily responsibilities.  Pay is good; however, you are treated poorly."
good,"Learned various aspects of business operations."
good,"A normal day is to develop and continue to build relationship with all clients. "
good,"•	Manage inventory outside/inside of warehouse by performing physical and visual checks per truck upon entering and leaving the facility"
good,"A good management stating days are very typical"
good,If your lazy. This isn't the job for you. you have to hit a goal of 200 CPH(Cases Pulled per hour) If goal is not met you will get wrote up for it.
good,"Otima para Trabalhar, nesta empresa pude crescer profissionalmente e a empresa acreditava no meu trabalho, por isso era sempre feito job rotation comigo."
good,Good job for full time employee's but lack the benefits for part time to stick around long enough for full time.
good,learnt many new things and how to handle more stress and pressure
good,"Good hours, not enough pay for work put in. You are pushed to get done soon but are paid hourly. So the harder you work the less you make."
good,"CO-workers are very familier,due to that i learn alot of knowledge to him."
good,"sou vendedor B,  motorista de caminhão também administro dinheiro das vendas e carregamento de caminhão"
good,"A great avenue to break into the truck driving industry, but not recommended as a career. The job is actually a pretty fun job and once you get the hang of it, is pretty easy. The drawback is the pay is very low for this field and the management treats you like a number instead of a person. My favorite part was starting early so I could be home about lunch time to be with my children."
good,Good company to work for as far as a company always being around but there isn't a balance between your personal life and work. You basically become property to earn your living. I would recommend it but not recommend it at the same time
good,o dia era de muito trabalho infelizmente não tive muito aprendizado  superiores não tinham muita comunicação com seus comandados o contato com os colegas era pouco mas agradável devido a grande quantidade de trabalho e cobrança de produção era bastante estressante e a parte mais agrádavel era quando se batia a produção
good,"Diariamente nos encontramos con situaciones en las que tenemos la oportunidad de decidir bajo presión para beneficio de la produccion, aumentando asi nuestro criterio apoyandonos con nuestros compañeros basándonos en experiencias de las personas con mas antiguedad en la empresa lo mas agradable es la disponibilidad de los compañeros con mas experiencia para compartirnos sus conosimientos "
good,"as any other day, repair and maintain all refrigeration equipments"
good,Maintain and stock merchandise in daily store route.
good,A typical day of work would consist of going from store to store on your route stocking and placing daily orders and asking store mangers for displays in the busy part of there store. I learned how to merchandise inventory and display new items to catch the eye of the customer. Some co-workers would help if you asked some of them would not. The hardest part of the job was making sure that you did not over order the amount of inventory. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new customers and introducing them to the new product.
good,"typical day is from 6am to 5pm, selling product rotating and building displays."
good,Things have changed since i was there form what i have heard but there was not anything other than the co-workers that i enjoyed about working there.
good,"Although I credit them for the experience I received, it was not a great fit for me. It was a Mid-West location and being from New Jersey I ran into several stumbling blocks with Co-workers,I started there as A Forklift Operator, however i did manage to receive a promotion to the laboratory which allowed me to learn about the quality assurance side of production, as well as filling in for supervisors for overtime and weekend work. The most enjoyable part of my job was setting production goals and exceeding them on a constant basis."
good,"Typical day at work throwing cases, having good communication with Managers and store employees"
good,"Long hours for little money. They say you make commission, but at their rates its almost impossible. They want you to do spend 14 HOURS A DAY working for 300 a week."
good,"When I first started the pay was great. They had the system in place and it was a real fun place to work. Over time they decided to take away alot of the perks and benefits, and cut the pay. delivering products during the hot and cold months was always a challenge. Going from a three man crew, down to just one was the biggest challenge. All in all, they created more work, less pay, less help."
good,"Good place to work if you are physically inclined, hard labor, long hours"
good,"Como empresa, una de las mejores en su genero."
good,"Arrive at work at 5:15 am. Grab computer & paperwork. Circle check the truck, then drive the truck through verification building & head to first call on the daily route. Go over customers order & payment before delivering product via a hand cart, from the single axel A-Z vehicle. Complete order, print bill, and proceed to next customer as per the manifest. We generally work alone which is well siuted to me. The job can involve taking large orders down or up stairs, in various conditions."
good,"Very Physical job, long hours, no time for family. Not a very team orriented enviroment. Not much room for advancement."
good,"E bom mais e sempre a mesma rotina, sem dar valor ao funcinorio"
good,"Llegar puntual, trabajos administrativos."
good,"pulled orders using an electric pallet jack. didnt learn anything i didnt allready know.co-workers were fun and easy to get along with.hardest part of the job was the quota was way to hard, at the time only 2 of the 12 employees could make the quota. most enjoyable part of the job was the people."
good,You will get up really early and deliver potato chips; you won't make much money.
good,"Fast paced physical job with repetitive lifting. Inventory delivered to customers in bulk loads where employee assumes responsibility for merchandising product to consumer point of purchase in sales areas. Pay is average for area, but far outweighed by the work load. Management highly aware of budget issues and sales figures but seems to have lost touch with outside work environment. Union and management have created a good'-old boy environment. An inner circle exists within the organizational structure. Advancement and promotion rarely evaluated by job performance."
good,The managers were very cooperative with both new and old employees
good,Frito Lay is a great job to have for a entry-level student to have to learn values and an importance of a work-life balance
good,"I had a very long career with the company and due to a merger in 2010 my employment ended in 2011. I worked within the IT department and was exposed to a variety of technology in a fast paced environment. If you'r looking to work for them it's very hard moving up the corporate ladder. The Pepsi company is very differnt from the PepsiAmericas company I worked for. There appears to be more silo areas and so many people to speak with in order to get things done. If you are looking to start your career, it can be a great launching pad, but don't stay as long as I did. Keep yourself on the market and always be on the look out for new opportunities."
good,Build and maintain product displays within company standards.
good,"The location I worked at is smaller than most locations, but it is hard because the employers and company make an already hard job even harder. The trucks are side loaders, so if you have 15 stops with 500 varied cases, you are touching them at least 2-3 times."
good,"This place is all about pushing product, whether it is needed or not. There will always be conflict between you and anyone else. It is a very cut throat job."
good,"Management are very racist and rude , my first day in the interview they look at you very bad, i don’t recommend this company to anyone if you want bad looks from this manager’s"
good,I worked about 12 hours a day. Which isn't much but you have about 10 mins to stock a whole store. Or you'll be late getting in. They hate when people get in late. Makes it harder for the night crew to load the trucks.
good,"No rotation between your department. "
good,There seems to be a gap between PepsiCo beverage and snacks business like Simba(pty)Ltd.The integration is not yet there.Paraduim shift is very minimal
good,Night a bad place to work at good benifits and you are inside of a warehouse so you don’t have to worry getting rain on unless you are a forklift driver
good,"Great company, poor management on the merchandiser side.I have nothing else to say about Pepsi Great company, poor management on the merchandiser side"
good,Large company with no compassion for its employees.  Communication was few and far between between same causes tasks not to get done. Multiple people performing on same route and no one held responsible for work not being accomplished.
good,Drove a sideload truck.  The workplace culture did not value individual contributers.  Best part of the job was interacting with cutomers on adaily basis.
good,"We come in each day with a set amount of cases that have to be pulled and loaded we couldn’t leave until each product was pulled. I learned how work a scan gun, more supervisor and shift leader experience also. Management weren’t bad it was very good. It would be a good company if it could get you consistent hours"
good,"Ok place work if you like working 12 hour day. Pays well, I guess, but you work for every penny. As long as your manager is experienced and can reasonably manage expectations you will be ok."
good,"Management promotes belittling their employees. Culture that they don't fire their Supervisors regardless if the assault or batter hourly employees (it has happened several, different ocassions, on video). Long work days and schedules, if you don't want to work don't go there work 12 days off 2 or, 13/1 day off."
good,"multiple tasks given with a short timeline "
good,"I was a weekend merchandiser for Pepsi. I was responsible for breaking down the store product order and stocking the shelves. This was a lot of hard work, but financially rewarding. Work was stressful during the holidays and big events, such as the Super Bowl. Safety was a top concern. I only left when I didn't get promoted. Then again, the position I wanted was filled by the manager's nephew."
good,"If you really enjoy selling then this is the company for you. I, unfortunately, did not and there's a lot of very gritty, unpolished negotiating that has to go on with bodega, corner store, and gas station customers. It's a very interesting environment because Pepsi sells product to distributors that then come in and undercut the actual company on prices (???) but then you're asked to go out and compete. It was uh, interesting. Expect daily calls from your manager. They're often stressed out thus by transitive property you will be as well. Most sales jobs are bonus eligible and you may get a car with free gas and insurance. That adds up. It's honestly why I stayed. It was worth the headache for a couple of years but I decided if I was going to sacrifice my mental health it would be for people not a corporation. If you are just a hard working lady or fellow who can grind it out and doesn't mind competing for an extra shelf then this is the place for you. Again, if you hit  your targets you'll do well and have opportunities for advancement."
good,"Fast paced environment.                    "
good,"Start early and go as fast as you can. Any time not selling chips is a waste of your personal time, like all warehouse work and driving and talking."
good,"During the interview ask what your work week will look like.  How will it change after you've qualified."
good,See how many soda people drink the company good but it has its down falls last few years pay keep dropping but more work  we have to do more money thats all we need to mane tane
good,I prefer not to discuss this. I do not think this is appropriate nor does it have anything to do with my current job search. I do not like to bad mouth any former employers.
good,"Fast paced environment, work overload. Not the greatest of salary, but average. Don't know about career progression since just recently joined. Good experience to put on your resume."
good,"When working at PepsiCo expect to have a very discipline team with productivity in their minds. Management is constantly looking for ways to improve production. Also expect to put long hours during the summer when orders pick up, and working on the weekends is required."
good,As a sales representative is really hard labor work. You work 10-12 hours a day and with time you start feeling a toll on your body. Good company but management is complicated at times. The pay is good but for all the labor you do I don’t think is fair.
good,"Contras: inestabilidad laboral e imposible quedar efectivo.  "
good,After over 10 years with the company they went away from actual customer service to treating everything as a number. They don’t care if a store has too much stock they continue to push in more especially if you take time off then leaves a mess for you when you get back. You only have about 2-3 people that actually care about doing the job the way it’s supposed to be done the rest are more or less causing issues with deliver or taking
good,Se deberian replantear si lo que desean en realidad es la calidaad de vida como ellos lo.manifiestan en sus diversas reuniones. Solo son palabras. Abusan del empleado y los maltratan . Y ni que.decir con sus distribuidores.
good,Pepsi as far as benefits and compensation was great roughly 65k a year and that was starting pay there insurance is good you get two weeks paid vacation a year and you will accrue more the longer you’ve been there.only down side is you have no home life at Pepsi anywhere from 12-16 hrs a day was normal schedule changes at the last minute ridiculous expectations and managed that has zero compassion or h serdathng the job is very stressful and faced paced .
good,"The company is focused on building talent and driving forward a sustainable organization.  Although the company promotes talent, compensation is on the low end.  This is not a surprise given its bottom-line focus."
good,"Pepsi pays very well and offers above-average benefits. Can't say much more positive about my experience working for them. The work is extremely physically demanding, management does not stick up for employees and plays favorites. They expect 12 hours of work to get done in 8, then add extra stores on and tell you not to complain. Reliable employees get rewarded with heavier workloads that they're expected to accomplish without going overtime."
good,I worked as an intern and I learned a lot in terms of professional marketing. This actually made me interested in digital marketing. There are no benefits whatsoever but we were not overworked at all which is good.
good,The job is not hard but communication is very poor amongst team leads and supervisors. The job is also inconsistent with hours. I got hired on for for 12 hrs and it was reduced to 10 after a month. Of recent 8 hrs. That’s not good business even in production.
good,Pepsico is a good place to start a career for young people. It is no longer innovative or creative. There is a lot more bureaucracy and mismanagement. Upward mobility is limited in some departments.
good,"I worked for Pepsi for 10 years, and in that time I gained much experience and learned many things that I will be able to use in any new endeavor.  Over the years the culture declined, making the work/home life balance not as rewarding."
good,This place used to pay very well they got greedy took away commission and expects higher number for half the money was worth it but not anymore pay weekly and salary with good benefits but a lot of hours also fired a ton of our pull ups so stores complain and we have to take care of that my District sales leader sucks bad of course outside hire trying to prove a point by writing everyone up without even being able to do my job
good,"Good company to work for, but very unorganized. Decent pay but not enough for the work load.It was good to be able to gain relationships with customers."
good,"A typical work day at PepsiCo for me working in the warehouse consisted of marking, organizing, loading and unloading of cargo."
good,"relaxed but fast paced, the team lead is pretty flexible with breaks and progress. But the faster you work the faster you get to go home. so it was a very competitive work environment everyone wanted to be the one leading in numbers"
good,I'm looking for a great company to work for .not a work place at hate the employees. That is willing to work with the employees.  good day and do not work to hard.
good,Enjoyable and fun managing my accounts. My coworkers made it a fun and positive work environment. Learned good costumer service and how to grow a business in sales. Management was mostly good but some are not. Worked between 7-15 hrs on any given day.
good,Pepsi is great place to work for when it’s union but besides that it’s not a place you wanna retire from . Poor management at our location was the biggest issue and what forced me to leave.
good,"Minimal room for advancement. Very segmented roles where you don’t really see your manager or even other team members. Lots of on campus perks like summer fridays, on-site gym, on site nail salon, sculpture garden, etc"
good,Management had their favorites and when it came to easy premium jobs they were always the first to receive those benefits. pay was great but it meant spending 60+ hours a week in a warehouse
good,"Grab a head set, set up your carts & the headset sends you to that location to pick product, you go in circles around the warehouse, boxes are light weight. You do this all day until all orders are complete. If your fit it’s fairly easy. Some orders stay on carts that are pushed h into semi truck, other orders have to be down stacked & loaded into trucks by dolly.  People who pick faster then others, get to leave early towards the end of day sometimes 1hr 2hr earlier, nobody really picks faster then that. There is no set time off time, you work till case count hit zero. All management care about is accuracy, as long as you picking the right box from location, they stay off your back.  *90% who quit during my time there, did so because of the physically*"
good,"work was not to bad but sometimes not worth what you get paid for"
good,"Worked for PepsiCo for 17 years, training is fantastic and everyone I worked for were supportive, only problem was not moving up within the business, can move sideways as many times as you want but not upwards, promised loads of advancement but was never fulfilled, spent my own money to get qualified and move up but still no opportunity arrived just more promises, decided to move to another company and finally doing what I wanted. Don't get me wrong the company is a good company (17 years proves it) but if advancement or a career is what you want you have to be a brown nose or know management to move up the ladder."
good,"Overall Pepsico is a good company to work for. the benefits were good, you can make as much as you want if you hustle. The upper management was not good though, they were never there to help when you needed it."
good,"This company focuses more on shareholder dividends, profitability , excessive business controls, micro management, and finding ways to creatively reduce wages."
good,If you like to do repetitive laps this is for you. light lifting but around and around is monotonous. They hire on contract so employment security is lacking.
good,"PepsiCo has always worked it's employees hard.  In the past, they also treated them well though.  You saw opportunities for growth and advancement, as well as appropriate compensation.  The culture has been going down hill and can be a very difficult environment now."
good,buen trabajo y excelente clima ventas agradables y
good,You start between 4am-6am. You stop working until you’re either done with the route or run out of hours. Management has terrible communication skills and most of the trucks would barely pass DOT inspection. They throw new drivers on easy routes and once you are semi familiar with the job they put you in the east or west side or Buffalo. You’ll haul 800 cases per day with a wheeler while having to pick up 500 shells because drivers don’t do their jobs. It’s extremely frustrating especially when you do run out of hours. They get mad when you don’t finish 17 stops when there’s 3 feet of snow on the ground. Very high turnover rate too. You will make very good money as long as you don’t mind working 60 hours per week.
good,"At the time I took the Pepsi job I was a single dad with a young child my work schedule was all over the place as merchandiser I had to work mornings, evenings all in the same week this was bad when you are raising a young child."
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job at Pepsi was the people. The hardest part of the job was quickly getting things done because the execution and communication were extremely poor. I learned that to move up you have to accept the fact that it could take years to advance to management. There was no advancement opportunities for my position so that was discouraging. Salary workers worked a lot of overtime and often took work home. We were not offered very good incentives to work or sell more product/displays. The general manager made it so we did not get much of anything for the holidays and that was discouraging to many people. Moral was down much of the time and no one wanted to put forth the extra effort because they complained about their wages. Many people were working part-time jobs to supplement income because they were not making enough. Overall, it was a good entry level job but I wouldn't waste my time staying if you want a real opportunity to advance quickly or expect to make a lot of money. The benefits are good."
good,"Typical work day included pulling reports, analyzing data, vendor relations, supporting accounting functions, meetings, etc. Communication in the company was lacking and management did not always work on your behalf to help in job advancement. The workplace culture was poor and lacking in ""can do"" attitude. The hardest part of the job was dealing with lack of communication from all areas in the company. The most enjoyable part of the job were the friends made along the way."
good,"The team was nice, but my supervisor did her own thing a lot like leave early to get her kids, go to the dentist... she left me with almost nothing to do a lot. "
good,Being a merchandiser for this company take a person who is good at working with little to no guidance. If you are someone who procrastinate from time to time.
good,The position was really nice but sometimes outside influences can make things difficult and unnecessary. The Berry Hill location has administrative offices connected with an actual Pepsi Beverage plant--which is cool to watch soda being made from beginning to end.
good,Early hours and long days.  Equipment was less than ideal. Many trucks were on the road that would not pass DOT standards.  On a positive note the RDT's were excellent and great trainers!
good,"Stayed very busy making the days go by faster."
good,"As many hours you want to work, needs a better way to get in contact with overnight supervisors. Some people not pulling their weight during shifts. Easy going."
good,"Empresa muito dinamica, porem com muitas interferencias gerenciais do México, nem sempre bem vindas e acertivas."
good,"El trabajo era en centros comerciales promocionando las marcas, y el ambiente con los compañeros  era agradable, aprendí mucho en ese tiempo en  desarrollar mis habilidades de venta y contacto con clientes negociación  y persuasion."
good,buen ambientede trabao buenos procesoslogistivos y administrativos
good,My day would start as early as 3am...I had a route that included five stores and my job was to restock each store before going home. I had three stores in Athens and two stores in Commerce.
good,Buena empresa aunque había robos internos entre compañeros
good,A solid place to work. Management is poor. Rarely receive positive feedback. The pay doesn’t match the hours and energy you put in. Benefits were good. Stressful and fast paced.
good,Its okay work for a small town job pay is fine work isnt to hard but should be somewhat in shape to be able to do the job effectively invest in decent shoes for concrete floors and possibly a back brace. management is pretty decent you can call them directly and let them know whats going on and they listen to you and help you deal with any possible issues all in all its an alright company to work for.
good,PepsiCo had a great workplace culture! Football season was very exciting because the whole company got involved.  The NY Giants used to make a guest appearance.
good,"things move slowly."
good,Not a horrible job. Poorly managed at this time.  Start as early as you can to get out earlier. 10-12 hr days typical. 15hr days have been worked. Can be very stressful at times.
good,if you adapt well to constant change this is a good job for you. once you get past the politics of the union/company relationship.  you can gain some vast experiences as they serve such a diverse portfolio of customer accounts. i enjoyed my time there. and would do again but in a different position.
good,"Very competitive, cut throat, & cheating.  Supervisor encouraged this behavior so he would have high numbers & look good to mgmt. Very stressful place."
good,My experience was a sink or swim job. They give you little training. There is no training coordinators or anything. You may get stuck with somebody who hates training. My supervisors didn't seem to care if you sink or swim. They just want bodies in there and will straight up tell you it's survival of the fittest in there. They expect way too much from people. Their union is a joke. Their union does not care about new hires at all. They will pretend you don't exist and let you fail. No exaggeration at all.
good,"Poucas oportunidades de crescimento em cd , que não sejam as fábricas"
good,"My experience overall was not bad. I received a lot of great training and experience, and met some really good people. There were many great memories along with some that could have been better. My pay was based on delivery of products ordered by the sales team. The company has been struggling to meet the transportation demands therefore negatively affecting my earnings."
good,After moving operations from the territories the turn over rate was extremely high. Often they didn't want to pay their employees fair competitive wages. This showed in the inability to get product drivers and even few competent workers.
good,Left the company for a competitor to better my career and more financial security.   Most enjoyable part of the job was travel and flexibility.  I was in Sales with Key Accounts.
good,"Not very good. No work life balance. They promote who they want not based on work experience, but only if you are in the loop. They push all the inclusion practices, but if you are a white male well you are not included."
good,Good place to Start if your barley getting in to manufacturing. Everyday is a very productive day and fast pace. Good pay and benefits for now but NO Growth at all.
good,"long hrs but pay does at least reflect the hrs worked."
good,A typical day at pepsico was long work days with almost to much work to handle.Truck drivers were basically considered on the bottom.Thier were no set routes so alot of favortism can go on.the trucks were less than good and the trailors were hard to operate with the doors hard to open .The pay was good and the benifets were ok
good,"The work was never too hard it was fun to travel to different stores and rest them even have the opportunity to open a few brand new stores "
good,"Hit stores, coach employees, and build relationships with managers. Make sure employees are executed each and every day with the companies' best interest in my mind."
good,"Very demanding environment"
good,Lots of pulling pallets through bulk stores (10-12 pallets each store during peak promotions).  Building displays and keeping them full during promotions.  More physical work then actual selling and allocating space. Compensation should be more.
good,"They keep you as part-time forever; no benefits, no paid vacations, no extended insurance. The just dont care ..................................................."
good,"Never a dull moment, great people to work with (Employees and Customers). When things are good they are really good, when bad they are really bad. Good outweighs the bad for sure."
good,I enjoyed being trusted with running my route independently with little management interference. Other things could need increased like pay and more communication. Always seemed short handed
good,"It's a place where you can grow tenacity but there is little to no room to move up. It takes a long time to move up here, it's a small warehouse with lots of turnover, expect to do the job of 2 men every day as a driver. The equipment is in poor shape and most of the trucks did not have A.C. when I left."
good,"Did not like the culture in Pepsico Guatemala. My manager was very open to new ideas and changes, but the culture in outside my area was terrible. People were overworked and most of them were unhappy."
good,Hard work and long hours. Very fast paced and competitive. Early morning hours and long days. Lots of driving and rushing to finish the job. Very strict on the job to be done and expectations were high with very little support.
good,"It’s not an hard work place, but can get rough at times, basically because of the people, the job is slow-paced, we never know what time we are getting off, we don’t have an designated time to come in, and on lunch we don’t really have an designated time, nothing is difficult, but it could be a whole lot better, with just simply better management"
good,The job was up and down not enough hours to work to pay my bills . I got a month behind. I'm just wanted to get a better opportunity of moving up. I'm a hard worker and a quick learner.
good,Pepsi had a very antiquated workplace culture. The hardest part of the job was working for a rude manager. The pay wasn't great either. I think that's why they have such a high turnover rate.
good,"Very long days from the get go, not a good working environment. A couple of really good people holding up the team. Very annoying structure as they do not listen and not quick to react to the changing market."
good,They should look at some of their policies and try to do things better. Give people more days off without there having to be a point given.  If all you want to do is make money and have no life this is the job for you. I would love to go partime and work but not sure if I would be accepted if I put my application back in. Pepsi can be very stressful if dealing with the wrong people. Overall my experience was ok. I appreciate being part of such a good company.
good,"This is a big global company, and you know it. If you don't know it, you will find out very fast. "
good,"The time I worked at Pepsi was arduous but the pay was good.  The hours were long and the task at times daunting but great coworkers were a big plus.  The work/life balance was difficult and some tools needed to perform the job like onsite floaters/uboats at store locations made things harder.  All in all, I did enjoy my time at Pepsi and it was a great learning experience."
good,Truly values their employees however with any corporation you will have a lot of black and white and no grays areas when thats not reality.  Very high expectation on working long days and your phone is always on.  You take care of the customer no matter what happens. High expectations and low recognition for middle management.
good,"Co-workers were great people to work around."
good,"good place to work in terms of flexibility and payment. too much work, too much people from outside the territory taking important decisions, many Top Management Changes."
good,a surprise everyday at Pepsi. Start time was about 4-6 am and didn't know what route I was running until I picked-up manifest. about 18 stops on average with about 500 cases per day.
good,"Good learning ground as the learning curve is extremely steep.  However, gaps remain on developing and retaining talent and overall employee engagement due to yearly layoffs"
good,"There 14 day straight sucks, really 19 days without a day off. Have no life.You have to wait till thursday to find out who signed up for the over time list for the weekend. then they will fill positions from the bottom of the roster."
good,The job wasn't bad.  We work longer hours per day to be able to close at 10:00AM on Friday.  That was probably the best part of the job.  Were always changing how they needed things done.
good,they weren't good as being family oriented they over worked me and didn't give me the opportunities i could have in house as moving up in the company always giving someone from college and no those that have the experience and been with Pepsi a long time
good,"Tough repetitive job. its a 2 man job, yet your sent to do it solo. Bad management, the safety isn't important as long as the job gets done...its a good job to start from but not long term"
good,"I worked in a remote office. I found getting exposure difficult and my coworkers were much older than me. This held me back."
good,"this job is non-stop you will not have time for sleep, family, or any other activities. Management is awful they don't make any effort to help their employees with solving problems they tend to be the ""get it done and i don't want to hear about it"" type. I put in 6 years and finally had to part ways after i was made a target for refusing to take a commercial vehicle on the road that was not road worthy. They do not follow DOT regulations and their equipment is horrible you cant make a decent check because you cannot finish a route due to breakdowns. 14 plus hours worked a day they run you into the ground. I've never seen employee turnover like i have with this company."
good,"PepsiCo was een leuk bedrijf.  Veel investering en uitdagingen, maar de bedrijf was aan het downsizen."
good,This was an ok job but it is definitely a hard and stressful job. You could go in at 4 AM and work an 8 hour day and be done by noon or so. On the other hand you worked weekends and holidays.
good,"I interned at the Jacksonville, Fl location for Frito Lay. While onboarding the management provided around the clock support to us interns. This location at the time was understaffed in management positions,  DSL, RSR, RSA, also I was integrated into the new payment plan restructure which made a lot of the employees I worked with very unhappy and unmotivated at work. The pay is very manageable and most of the time you will be reimbursed for travel expenses, however, I am still waiting to be reimbursed for my July and August travel expenses from this location. Tip for all DSL interns do not wait to submit your time card and travel expenses before you will no longer have access to your account. After the final report out make sure to log on to your MyPepsiCo account submit your expense report and time card right when you get to your car at the airport so you do not end up like me who is still waiting for over $300 in travel expense reimbursement."
good,"I was bumped from my position, I tried to reapply after a few months got an interview and that was it, they never called me back again. I believe it was because I took the severance package they offered me. I feel like I was black balled."
good,"Ok company to work for, I believe some of their goals and expectations are unrealistic.  Need to go back to the days where we just sold as many drinks as possible."
good,"lack of focus, too ambitious, with no focus, no commitment to strategies. they think they move fast but that is not the case. too many layers, although they tried to do away with that."
good,"Good job... Decent pay.  No room to advance career.  No raises.  A lot of incompetent managers,  hiring managers right out of school with no experience telling you how to do a job that you have excelled at for 5 years and they have no clue."
good,I don't feel like I want to share much on the experience since in my opinion there management at the Lufkin plant was just horrible and the main reason why I left
good,The Resource Manager role at PepsiCo requires much more than advertised. The manufacturing environment is very fast-paced which can be a physical as well as mental challenge. Good pay benefits and flexible shifts. Work life balance is a major challenge especially if you end up on an off-shift.
good,"Frito Lay has been a good company that has recently become very stressful."
good,"Falta Feedback, carga horária exaustiva, refeitório deixa a desejar, falta plano de carreira, plano de saúde muito bom."
good,"Pepsi is a bottling facility, production is counted by the minute. When I worked there the can line could produce 1700 cans a minute so if it went down there was a lot of pressure on the mechanics to get it back up. We did a lot of preventative maintenance and we were always very busy."
good,"Comedor en planta, servicios de transporte ,vacaciones"
good,"The employees are more individual here than the other pop companies.  They seem to really stay independent of those they work with, and avoid helping out.  The culture has changed from the days of helping each other to a more of an ""8 and Skate"" mentality."
good,"En esta empresa me desarrolle en el área de contabilidad y administración de la empresa partiendo por generar informes correspondientes a los robos que sufrían los despachadores, para así generar un valor determinado y poder evitar de alguna manera la perdida de mercadería. "
good,"-milieu de travail productif"
good,The management is very poor. There is a lack of communication and patience by the warehouse manager among others.  Lots of negative reinforcement to move faster or to meet production standards.  everyone no mater ability is expected to reach the same goal as opposed to individual goals.
good,"Cadre agréable, bonne ambiance, salaire faible, Evolution longue"
good,The pay is good for the area especially for people without degrees.  But the abuse on your body and Home life may not be worth it.  I heard from many people that they seenbthe work hours break up families.
good,"this company gives higher salary and benefits. given that, a very serious responsibility and accountability accompany with it. higher management is very eager to achieve the objectives."
good,working at pepsi is an ok job if you wanna settle. dont expect much though. they can be pretty hard to deal with at times especially the managers. good job though
good,We are being challenge to hit the daily targets.we should have to improve the number of our outlets to increase also our sales.My coverage is entire General Santos City.
good,"Équipe incroyable. Lors de mon arrivée le gestionnaire était une perle. Mais lorsque nous avons changé de directeur toute la boîte a changé. Les clients sont parfaits, les employés aussi."
good,"Great company, lots of overtime although there's a lot of mismanagement from the management office which affects worker big time at times. Other than that, great compan."
good,This was my first job in this company.i have learn more of my job profile related.Management was very best in this company.this was my most enjoyable part of the job
good,"It is fun and productive working in automotive since it will give satisfaction to the customers. "
good,"In the short time that I've been here I noticed that the company (warehouse management) only seems to care about your productivity.  They over work most of their employees by working them 12+ hours per day, six days a week.  There is obsolutely no balance between your work/personal lives."
good,this company doesn't maintain the type of structure that would be fitting for any one. The advancement process is based on how well you know upper management.
good,always giving new products to their employees to sample.  As a temp worker I felt very alienated from the actual workers.  My cube was moved multiple times with out asking me.
good,"Great place to start. Great associates, Great Culture. People are over-worked and cost cutting is getting extreme. Department lacks consistent direction."
good,Outsourcing killed most of the advancement opportunities and the culture has changed. The benefits are below average. Raises are average to below average. The management overall is pretty good.
good,"Hard work!  Days are very long!  You can't leave until work orders are done for the day.  They never have a complete crew, so you can count on being there late.  Not much room for advancement, not unless you are thinking of becoming a driver or merchandiser.  This over a period of time will kill your body."
good,Work/Life Balance is horrible and not having the follow through from management is insane.  As management there should not be the failure to communicate and stick with processes that are put in place.
good,Not your typical sales job. You are the sales representative and the merchandiser 5-6 days a week. The only thing you don't do is deliver the product.
good,working with customers is the best part of the job. They do pay well and sell a good products but advancement wont happen unless you are willing to relocate.management seems to be more out to find what your doing wrong than help you do better at your job.The culture seem to be every man for themself.
good,"This is a night time and weekend position. You will not be able to go "
good,Pros - job security...........compensation........benefits............ability to learn different jobs...OT......Cons - majority of management is totally clueless....lack of communication....forced OT.....time away from family
good,Day was very stressful every day had new challenges. Dealt with over 20 different managers at different major grocery chains. The reason why job was mostly stressful was because managers at the store level wanted to present Pepsi products to their own standards not completely meeting that of Pepsi.
good,"There are a few good people working at PepsiCo and the pay is great, especially if you are willing to work over-time. Those are the good things. The bad: management will make you feel like dirt while you are on probation and they don't mind using threats of firing you on the spot also; most people would love to see you fail, so they won't hesitate to stab you in the back."
good,"manejo de efectivo sin custodio, conducir con precaucion, manejar arqueos de producto y efectivo, muy inseguro (robos) sin horario de salda."
good,Repartidor de agua Santorini salario mínimo mucha presión por la venta
good,"Employee's are great to work with, long hrs. could work over 12 hrs a day more in the summer months. Hardest part of the job is having no    family life to speak of, working 6-7 days a week, 12 or more hrs a day. the most enjoyable part is working with a great bunch of guy's working to get the job done."
good,"okay company, decent pay, bad management"
good,"Job / life balance is in the company's favor.  "
good,Very long hours with no work life balance. Love seeing my customers daily and knowing i was making a difference in the way there stores looked. Good pay and good insurance.
good,"This is the second time I reviewed this but as I said before, Decent place to work. Biggest problem is low pay. Hours can get long during holidays but that is expected."
good,If you are willing to work long hours and heavy work this job is good.   Benefits are great.  No communication with the people you work with.  I've worked for PepsiCo/Frito Lay and they are great but the beverage side has really disappointed me.
good,I would come in and there was nothing setup for my shift.  I would have to run around trying to get supplies situated for the midnight shift.  I did receive my BS while working there.  They do help with that aspect of you time with them.
good,Great job but management has away of showing favoritism to certain employees. That's something I don't want to deal with inside of a work place. For one it's unfair
good,Maintain 3-4 stores daily. moving heavy pallets of merchandise. dealing with store staff to complete daily tasks. Hours vary daily depending on loads.
good,"Management is unorganized, doesn't listen to employees"
good,No respeta el horario de salida y casi siempre uno tenía que trabajar mas de ocho horas sin un pago extra.
good,Typical day was getting up very early and doing physical labor for 10 hours. They will work you hard and know that you are replaceable. I saw real no advisement so that is why I decided to leave.
good,"I like the fact that when you driving the truck your main responsibility is safety, you are not concerned with bosses or customers. There was much time being spent driving, sometimes in heavy traffic. The management seemed very stressful, deadlines had to be met superfast. I was very happy at the fact that the job paid well. I didn't consider it a career job for me because I am more of a happy and relaxed state type of worker. I did very much enjoy driving their tractor trailers."
good,Pepsico has a great portfolio of products with a strong emphasis on innovation.  A mature product in an industry with increasing economic and political headwinds creates an environment of significant challenges for growth.  Pepsico takes an aggressive stance on short term improvement which sometimes leads to a skewed or even unrealistic expectation for annually targeted objectives.
good,La enpresa es adecuada para cada trabajador ya que es exigente.
good,There is a good few things to learn and take advantage of in experience. unfortunately there is a set pay with no raises. Its a decent pay to survive but not much to live. In the summer time you can be working 70 hours making money but then when winter comes it'll slow you down to 20 and you have to manage with what you have until it picks up. Just basically hard labor work.
good,"Independent  working. Learned about energy drinks and sampling. My boss was great but upper management was very inconsiderate. it was very relaxed and easy. Working with bottling partners, Sampling events, NASCAR."
good,"4:30 pm to whenever work load was complete"
good,"early arrival to the stores, do some heavy lifting sometimes, its really easy once you get the hang of it no one really bothers you are free to work on your own and what's really great about it is that you can finish your work very fast and they'll pay you for a full work day."
good,"Depending on the week we are in, a typical day in the office would consist of answering emails, preparing for forecast meetings, pulling actuals, setting up shopping carts, processing invoices, accruals and cross charge needed.  Analyzing the data pulled each period helps me find the forecast misses so we can plan for the next period.  I enjoy my job and what I do analyzing numbers and talking to project managers on a daily basis.  Customer Service is something I totally believe in and I like to provide the best service just as I would expect in return."
good,"My time at PepsiCo was pretty fun and interesting. "
good,Loaded product to carts and loaded carts to trucks.Learned what grueling work is. Management was Abysmal. Coworkers were nice. Hardest part was working by yourself when 2 or 3 people are required to do the job effectively. Enjoyed free chips and cookies.
good,Te privas d la vida personal y te matas trabajando largas jornadas laborales.
good,"This company is a wonderful place to work, but there is a definite ""corporate culture"" vibe. Advancement is tough depending on the department in which you work and there isn't an overwhelming sense of camaraderie between colleagues in differing departments. "
good,There is no leadership at most locations. You are sometimes treated as a number rather than valued. No advancement opportunities for most frontline team members.
good,"Gostava de trabalhar na empresa, salário compatível com o mercado, assistência médica, vale alimentação"
good,"As an experienced sales agent and a sales supervisor in my past employment, my key achievements were, I was a bigger contributor in performing in sales aspect. Since then, I'll never experience failure/s in my monthly quota because of my mentality in life that only losers will accept defeat. In my Pepsi Cola life as I was a Key Account Manager, since from the start, I was always at the headlines as a top perfomer for achieving my monthly quota. I just resigned last November 3, 2016 because of some compensation failures. If I get hired by SOME prestigious company, I would be honored."
good,"As a driver, not much interaction with other employees, but got to know a lot of people at the stores I delivered to, Hours were good for me"
good,en todas las empresas me brindaron una experiencia diferente y de cada una de ellas aprendi mucho y obtuve una experiencia unica.
good,Really a job for a young man who just got a cdl to get experience back breaking work and not paid by the hour so fast fast fast is all they preach and if your speed is not meeting the numbers they need they will give you days off with no notice to keep you under 60 hrs
good,"es un trabajo en líneas generales decente, lo malo es que no hay mucha continuidad"
good,New leaders joining the company does no follow the values of pepsico. seems that everyday resources are less and reduced and the workload is more and more. the pace of change is out of control and not well managed.
good,en general lo considero q esta bajo de las espectativas ya q pues es una empresa reconocida
good,"The pay was what kept me there"
good,"My previous jobs are all about sales and distribution."
good,Training and development skills with my company is at maximum level where I was honed and developed. Competitiveness and excellence are vital attributes needed to survive. Improvements need to be made with life/work balance and employee's welfare being.
good,"Distribution and merchandising of Pepsi products to large format, small format and food service customers."
good,"work with soda. good management, mediocre pay but little room for advancement. dealing with some of the idiots at the stores gets old though."
good,"Management roll offers little work/life balance"
good,Good company to work for with good benefits but Management sucks. Superviser are straight out of college with no experience on how to work the machine. or on how to schedule employees work shifts.
good,Great place but you have to choose between a personal life or family there is very little common ground. Everyone speaks of life balance but only the upper management actually gets to practice it.
good,"empresa tem um ótimo espaço para trabalho, tranquilidade para executar a demanda do dia dia ."
good,fun its because we always play basketball during our free time and thrilling because of our quota that we need to reach. the company gives us quota to be reach and in return if we hit out quota the company gives us incentives and commission.
good,You come in to work not knowing if it is going to be a 8 hour day or a 16 hour day. Very strong union enviorment.  With the union ounce people are hired on they dont care no more because the union has so much power at the company. i have seen people falseify papers to get paid even though they are not at work and they get descoverd the union still fought for them to keep there job and wone.
good,es una de las empresas dentro del ramo de promotoria en autoservicios que se encuentra por debajo del salario de otras marcas de menor prestigio a nivel regional.con muy mala ejecucion por parte de r.h.
good,"It was a workout job, one of the things i loved about the job and it was fast paced. What i learned from the job was watch others techniques  to learn your own way of doing things to make the job easy for yourself. Management was pretty shifty.co-workers were helpful on training. the hard part of the day is when the order is canceled. and the enjoyable part was the work out and traveling."
good,Typical day of work from 2 pm to 10 pm but usually end up early morning hours of work especialy end of the month. Patience and hard work is a must to sustain long evening of paper works ; encoding. Co workers are fun to be with; most enjoyable part of the job is we work as if we are in a call center..we own the office no boss around due to are late hours of working sometimes it finished morning already no sleeping hours straight 2 pm to 6am .
good,"Boa empresa, porém o Equilíbrio trabalho e vida pessoal e muito difícil, como se trata de uma empresa de vendas, a unica chance de crescimento e promoção só no setor de vendas, (para quem trabalha em outros setores nos CDV da cia fica esquecido), onde o funcionário e valorizado, para os outros setores não existe valorização"
good,"Dealing with customers on a daily basis, Trained other drivers new to delivering and using handheld and dolly, driver staff was great, the hardest part of my job was making sure we delivered 100% due to high volume, meeting and making new costumer relations with customer routes and driver staff"
good,Small family owned company with no advancement. Long hours with little tiime to self. Liked working with my co-workers and having my own route.
good,"Excellent money.  Lacking is training and support for route reps in rural areas.  "
good,demasiado trabajo con las promociones llamadas promorack
good,Not guaranteed a full 40 hrs. Only overtime for seniority Employees and summer time basis.  Extreme heat in warehouse during summertime.
good,Not much work life balance.  Expected to work and work for low salary.  Middle management needs improvement.  Good job security and opportunities though.
good,worked for a very short time to fill in the gap until newly hired person could come on board. Didn't spend a siginificant amount of time with the company to develop a more insightful review.
good,"Begin work at 4AM performed cycle count on raw materials, paid bills, and post, reconcile, then repost.  Email results to operation manager and plant manager.  Go to gate and pick up invoices and packages that were dropped off.  Participated in daily solve by sundown meeting.  If the schedule changed, making sure there was enough material to cover the schedule, if not, had to discuss with planner and operation manager to see what can be done.  Made sure there were enough pallets and shrink wrap for the next three days. Pulled production schedule from Avail/ Prevail and started ordering for the next weeks production.  The environment at Pepsi was don't have syrup in the tank with no materials to produce.  Justified why there was waste, had to physically count every empty bottle, cap, label, corrugate, and wrap.  The leadership team didn't want any input from the front line employees or myself.  Every 4 weeks we closed the period with no support from leadership.  After Labor Day, the closes fell on a holiday in which leadership did not pitch in to help nor train a back fill."
good,"Environment is not bad. work life balance must be flexible. Opportunity for advancement dependent on initiatives, not merit"
good,I really liked installing and fixing the equipment. The pay was really low and benefits too expensive.  The 700 pound Vending machines were getting too heavy for one person to move but we were still expected to move them by ourselves.
good,"uma grande empresa,onde todos são tratados da mesma forma ,exelente para se trabalhar,aprendi muito com essa empresa,nunca tive cargo de gerente,todos maravilhosos de gerente ao faxineiro,a agradavél do  trabalho são as pessoas."
good,"Make sure all salesman needs are met early am, orders built properly and time windows achieved.  Drive key account initiatives."
good,"Lack of communication between management and employees."
good,me parece que es una buena empresa para todo aquel que va empezando en su carrera como promotor de autoservicio sin duda es un buen comienzo y un buen escalon para crecer dentro del medio
good,Fast paced enviorment with new challanges everyday. Competitive benifits. Work life balance is challanging. Overall good place to work .
good,Pepsi was a very tough job and it gave you no time for family life. Although the pay was good it takes a toll on your body quickly.
good,THe job pays wells but it rwquires that you do a lot of work and put up with a lot of bull in order to get that type of pay. The people that you work with are what makes the job enjoyable. You have to have the ability to go with the flow and push through long nights at this job
good,"Great culture environment that embraces diversity, promotes health and wellness, and provides many outlets for young progressional looking to grow their networking skills. New Organization structure has put stress on finance department and has limited manager potential for lower level analysts."
good,"Company as a whole seems great when you enter but if you're not a, ""campus hire,"" then you're timeline of movement can be limited. Very weak raises when the company is doing bad, very weak raises when the company is doing good. Leadership primarily does not care about careers but rather how you can help them"
good,"Não havia uma parte agradável do trabalho, era um trabalho corrido, onde pude aprender muitas coisas. Um dia típico era chegar na empresa e começar a separar cargas até a hora de saída, quando não era mudado de cargo e ia para a conferência. A direção em sí era boa, porém haviam muitas coisas que poderiam ser mudadas naquela época para deixar o ambiente de trabalho um lugar melhor. Gostava de todos os colegas, me dava bem com todos."
good,"My manager was a micromanager."
good,"Solid company but poor local management.  I worked long dedicated hours here, and in the end hard workers like me were either made miserable and left like I did, or were fired over nonsense.  We used to have a great crew of dedicated people there."
good,A typical night at Pepsi was loading trucks for 12-16 hours a day. Very repetitive work. Learned how to operate motorized pallet jack and got free Pepsi products while working.
good,"work life balance ok, Upper management only cares about numbers and cost. Pay is ok"
good,Lack of team work and communications when working hard you don't get recognized for your hard work
good,"Being a delivery driver isn't a job for everyone. The job requires long hours an being at work between 4 am to 6 am everyday. Working for Pepsi, most of there routes are setup for 12 to 14 hour days because they are so short handed. "
good,"empresa con un buen ambiente laboral,donde aprendi todo sobre medicina laboral,los gerentes son muy dinamicos y colaborativos con el personal,mis compañeros de trabajo muy dinamicos y proactivos, los viajes constantes a los cedis foraneos,el ambiente laboral"
good,"Can be a very stressful and physically taxing job, but salaries are comparatively good."
good,"My thought of Pepsi is they need to retrain some of the management"
good,"A typical day at work at pepsi is started with a meeting of all the supervisors and selectors of that particular shift. You will be expected to reach the number assigned for that day. All new hires case count are expected to increase by100 each day of the probationary period until 2400 cases is the norm. The physical part of the job is extreme,lifting cases of soda and water for 8 to 16 hrs a day with minimal breaks can be dangerous.The most enjoyable part of the job the pay,16.55 is a good base pay"
good,"Has great compensation,  but little reward for success.   Business is always changing whether employees want it or not."
good,This was a temp job with long hours in the heat and all physical labor. As a female I was written off as unhelpful so I had to prove myself. Its hard work but the plus is that you get paid every week.
good,"Be prepared to work your butt off average 15 stops a day,and 590 cases a day may not seem like a lot but your averaging 12hrs a day.the pay doesn't add up for the amount of work you will put average 600 ish a week on a good week."
good,"Generally all the managers were pleasant, co-workers were very easy going and fun to work with.  I learned to make banners and to do recon on the product.  The hardest part of the job was the recon of product."
good,"It's fun and enjoy,always prepared for what happen or for the unexpected.Respect the management as well as the co-workers,the hardest part of my job are the account who don't pay there credit or the account receivables,I think the most enjoyable part of my job is the bonding of my co-workers as well as the management"
good,"Nothing much to go over about this job since the job position was an only 5 month job. Had a great time there, to be honest. The co-workers were nice and the Team Leader for the group I was stationed at was a really great leader and friend."
good,I enjoyed my job as a Route Sales Specialist.  I left this company because compensation was too low for the amount of hours required to work each day.
good,"1. Resolving customer issues and complaints and selling in key initiatives."
good,a typical day starts at 5am. i go to my acounts to service them and sell in product to obtain as many cases as i can. ive learned that the customer is always right no matter how wrong they are. ive learned how speak to managers in a professional manner. the hardest part of my job is trying to obtain the goals from my company while satisfying the customer and their needs. the most enjoyable part is when my stores tell me im the best salesman they have ever had
good,"fast pased consistant work fun inviorment.. to work hard and enjoy being a part of the team.. management were ok but could use improvement fun coworkers, the hardest part of the job was clocking out and i learned alot about the company and its produtcs"
good,Very stable job if you do what your suppose to do. Good benefits. Decent pay. Job security is excellent. The biggest con would be work/life balance. Expect a 50-60 hour work week with most positions. Few breaks. Work holidays.
good,Its fun but some of the bosses don't like to help if you are having problems.
good,"Very great job, but very little pay or advancement opportunities."
good,"buen trabajo solo de paso por no te dejan efectivo,jefes mediocre que no valoraban cada tarea"
good,"Wear many hats and serve as liaison between brands and sales.  Developed deep relationships with key stakeholders.  Have to be creative  in order to balance all priorities and create solid programs that are a win for all parties.  Great team, Great customer.  Learned a lot!!!"
good,"Not the place to stay after a certain amount of year, too many politics."
good,el trabajo es bueno pero ala ves es muy pesado al estar ya trabajando si es pesado trabajas 4 y descansas 2 el mucho el trabajo y la paga es poca y no suben sueldo por antiguedad no hay utilidades
good,"Aprendi a utilizar motocicleta, a foguearme con los clientes para la labor de ventas entre compañeros muy buen ambiente lo dificil es que es una empresa con unos jefes que no te ven como ser humano no te ven como ellos mismos lamentablemente"
good,"Be prepared to be the fall guy for everyone else in your company since you are the lead contact that most people see.  "
good,"Working for a company like PepsiCo requires an individual with ""thick skin"".  You deal with all types of people, from all walks of life, and when your relationships with them are not the greatest, well then that puts a strain on your mentality."
good,would deliver all  pepsi products to stores was a fun place to work on your own
good,"selling in products to maintain displays, rotating merchandise, placed orders to replenish shelve stock, organized back stock, and received credit for damaged or expired merchandise."
good,Large CPG firm that offers many learning opportunities.  Great firm to start career.
good,"Come in and complete a shift handoff to prepare for the afternoon"
good,"order puller"
good,This position was with Advantage Sales and Marketing each day consists of selling in display space for Pepsico Warehouse product to local grocery stores.  The fun part about this position was building relationships with the store management team and show casing huge displays during Gatorade season.
good,"buena empresa pero no tienes vida personal"
good,"É um empresa, com ótima. para se trabalhar. mais com algumas dificuldades."
good,"- it's a night shift work"
good,"working for 8 hrs excluding over time"
good,"A good and safe working environment,  where people use their diversity as and advantage and are dedicated in the fulfillment of their missions."
good,"Work day is like any where else it has its days."
good,"Pepsi Co is a great job to have and a great work experience. Ive learned more about sales and also gained better cutomer service experience. The management who run the company do a very poor job and show little to none care about employees who work there. My coworkers are good people and we talk and laugh about the job a lot but because of my job title we dont see each other often because we work alone for the most part. The hardest part about the job is the labor which involves pulling heavy pallets with hand jacks, operating walk behind and standing lifts to get to product, and also bending and lifting to merchandise shelves for accounts. The best part of the job is driving to various stores/accounts and meeting new people such as store managers and customers and being able to see the different set up with product in stores which helped me as a worker learn how to be more diverse in my position as well as learn more about the sales side."
good,"A typical day started at 2:00 pm, I would go in and get orders on a piece of paper that had to be built for the night. All of the work was split between co-workers. There was bulk and d-bay to be built every night. The bulk was built onto pallets and loaded onto a semi to be delivered to grocery stores the next morning. The d-bay would be built and loaded onto a side load trailer to be delivered to convenience stores. I learned how to operate a forklift and pallet jack. My co-workers were easy to get along with and most of the time put forth good effort to get the job done in a safe timely matter. The best part of the job was working in a team environment to get our jobs done, team work, helping each other out if things were more difficult for one than the other. "
good,I was employed 10 years and had the opportunity to excel.  The commute from Elgin was an 1.5.  The management did work with me to keep a work life balance and gave the option of work from home 2 days a week.
good,Management asks way to much for a days work.  Long 12 hour days are at lease twice a week. Days start at 6:00am in the field each day and often don't end until 6:00pm. Too many politics and too long to actually have a chance to become a manager.   Many people have been there for years and college degrees are not required. 
good,"fast pace, dealing with multiple people at times, bending,squating,lefting  all day."
good,Nice place to work until you get into mangement then its longer hours and less pay. Less than what you made as an hourly worker and much harder work. Not a job for the lazy for sure
good,"Boa Empresa para se trabalhar,uma boa política mas com superiores mal treinados,e,por ser um local de difícil acesso deixa um pouco a desejar"
good,"In the current position that I have is a crazy fast pace that is rewording, but is a position that lacks a sense of accomplishment because your never done with a project. As in this position the work load is too great, and is never completed there is always new challenges.  It is not for everyone they must possess a great work ethic and be able to think on their feet, and react to changes, and have great problem solving skills.  Management and other leadership is very dedicated and works hard at leading the masses of Pepsi Co. "
good,"Un día de trabajo se divide por etapas, es un excelente ambiente laboral, aunque en su estructura organizacional se encuentra muy desorganizada, los jefes son personas controladores que viven pendiente de cada minutos que estamos haciendo, si laboramos o no laboramos"
good,"Lots of hours during the summer, winter hours are minimal. Management forgets to mention EAP when you have a problem"
good,"The company is very rough to work for. Very Stressful place to work. not all people are friendly, and a lot of drama."
good,"no room for advancement to sales ,someone literally has to die or retire for a position"
good,"Ambiente não muito dinamico e nem competitivo perante ao mercado. Não tem plano de carreira, porém é uma empresa que se o funacionário traz resultado, terá sempre estabilidade."
good,"Lots of overtime, good coworkers, not alway the best supervisors"
good,"working large format stores, merchandising hundreds of cases, building displays, communicating with mgmt building relationships with multiple managers. hardest part holiday season. enjoyable pay checks"
good,Clean everyday. ran the production line everyday. it was a fair place to work at.
good,"you get to meet alot of people in the field and you also get to know all the managers, assistants, and other employees. This is one of the hardest job to work for, they hardly teach you how to do this kind of job in 2 weeks and expect you to learn the job in those amount of days."
good,"This place is a joke ,Don't get me wrong would be a great place to work if they would get rid of The plant Manager he is Nasty also the Union sucks they don't help u @ all just take ur money Ane god Forbid u get hurt They will fight u on it and let u go Very large turnover @ this location They can't seem to keep warehouse or Drivers Wonder why ??????? Very demanding Job"
good,"Like any route delivery job, you are required to drive a truck and take the product into the customer location. At Pepsi, you must park, downstack the product from the bay of the truck (this can be difficult at times), you will then take the product into the customer location and set it down. You have now touched the product twice. You then count the product, have the customer sign, and stock everything. You repeat this 15-25 times in a day and then return with your truck. Pepsi drivers have probably a 60% fail rate. People don't really know how difficult things are in this region. Be ready for a challenge."
good,"Good operating philosophy, they make soda. Varied work environment depending on location."
good,llegar temprano checar nuestras metas del dia
good,Its a tough place to work. Strenuous and low pay for the job. Its like going back to Highschool all over again.
good,"was a very rewarding job pushes you to the limit mind, body and soul"
good,Pepsico gave me a great background in sales and costumer service.
good,A typical day at work for me consists of reporting for the PepsiCo CDSD Operations division. Reporting is essential for monitoring the overal progress of tghe organization. I have learned the day-to-day activiies within a zone warehouse starting from the inventory process to product delivery. My co-workers are passionate in terms of ensuring that product is available and delivered to our customers. The hardest part of my job is to refrain from reading emails after hours but I am working on it! The most enjoyable part of my job is the flexibility in my schedule which is a huge factor in Work/Life Balance.
good,"Pepsi Cola of Bristol is a place where you can work independently. The employees are very nice and respectful. I enjoy working outside and on my own, as well as making customers happy."
good,"The parent company is very decent and tries hard to do right by the workers. This is, however, occasionally offset by the local management."
good,"Route sales, pretty standard. Some territories were much larger than others, some routes were much better than others. The route engineers could have done a better job balancing out sales volumes since the pay was based on a 100% tiered commission structure."
good,"A typical day would be filling store shelves from back stock or deliveries. Working and filling single coolers, organizing back stock, and with deliveries pulling sometimes more than 50+ lbs pallets not 80% stacked properly (Products Damaged) from transport."
good,Great overall company. Management has their favorites. Hard to get transferred and moving up is pretty difficult. High turnover rate But other than that use PepsiCo as a stepping stone for career advancement
good,"Very good benefits/pay but very poor work/life balance, I’m a fan of working hard but working 14+ hour days with 1 day off wears you down fast, they drastically changed the mileage reimbursement which hurt a lot especially because you drive your personal vehicle all day."
good,"This company is very good and enjoyable at times but with the way, management treats the employees, there are more rough times than good times. Many changes need to happen before a good review can spark."
good,Great company to work for-financially sound and global brands.  the most enjoyable part was the relationships you form in the market but the customers could be very demanding.
good,"The company itself is AMAZING  Go above and beyond for yourself and customers. Don’t try to impress anyone. It won’t get you anywhere. Be better and become better for yourself as well. You’re only benefiting from the work you put in. You’re always replaceable. Go to work, do your job, and you’ll forever be happy."
good,"Pepsi is a great company with great benefits, but they will work you & not think twice about it. You think you’re apply for a simple merchandising position, then you get your schedule & you have up to 5 stores & 3/5 will have a truck there waiting for you. You’ll have to unload 5 or more pallets on your own within their specified time-frame of 10 hours per day. Merchandisers must work Friday-Monday, so there’s your weekend."
good,"Competências de Negócios:"
good,The overall work environment was not very good and the departments were not collaborative and helpful at all. The departments weren't just didn't get along with each other at all. I felt I always had to compete with people within the organization
good,PepsiCo is going through a transformation of moving most IT functions from TX to India.  They have removed many benefits to place themselves along side many other average companies.  Advancement is slow to come and job security during this time is absent.
good,Buena empresa en varios aspectos sin embargo demanda muchísimo tiempo hasta 15 horas al día sin pago adicional
good,"Working at PepsiCo is not only fun but also gives me some sense of fulfillment in my everyday work. However, there is a serious lack of guidance and long term strategy in the particular division that I work in which leaves me the option to move on from the Company and pursue employment elsewhere."
good,"Great bosses but office BULLY “Slick” thinks he’s a boss & Union, likes to loosen fuel caps, hide key, steal straps etc...... otherwise I would have rated a five because there are some very kind drivers but this immature bully was enough for me to move on since there’s a lot of CDL jobs out there."
good,"You don't want to be a rep here unless you are just looking for busy work! Not a job that you can work at and pay your mortgage or afford to book a vacation"
good,"- workplace is just fine"
good,Pepsi is a good place to work. The management is good at working with you if you have issues. The work is pretty easy but sometime it could be a little boring
good,Benefits and pay are great.  expected income is MINIMUM 60k per year but can reach upwards of 80k depending on route assignments and seniority.  downfall is this job is extremely physical and busy season you can expect 12-14hrs a day and slow season 9 or 10.  They also do not pay hourly.  base+per case stipend
good,"start early like 4am not off the clock till about 5pm depending on season and area given to work.  Fast paced, heavy lifting, waiting on customers to check you in and to receive payment.  learned rotation of sodas.  some store will sell sodas that are out of date, so check before buying.  which companies sell what sodas"
good,In the IT department : Management was focused on putting out fires rather than preventing them. They did not spend money wisely.  The people working there were fun to work with.  Management was always pushing you to take on more responsibility for the same pay.  They did not advance your level.
good,Use pallet jack to take an empty pallet and use a headset to pick product and stack on a pallet. Once pallet is complete you have to count product to ensure you have the correct amount and wrap pallet. Then take pallet to truck and load it.
good,Was at one time a good company. Work lots of hours . Upper management is more worried about what looks good on paper instead of selling drinks. Company also doesn’t care about the customers.
good,This job is physical the hours are long and you work on weekends. You work around different people everyday. Come to work and be on time. Opportunity to work overtime
good,"8-14 hour work days."
good,"No OT pay, poor perspective to go further, long hours and pay just above minimum wage , Managment when challenge seems to be blaming HQ. Limited possibility to go higher once in a level job - Pepsico policy states that one can only apply for jobs to levels higher then current on the other side one can apply for any job if not leveled ( it's sort of a paradox)."
good,Well positioned company to grow with.  Great training and very fast paced company.  Upper management more concerned with diversity than accomplishments.
good,"We worked every Friday Thru Monday as merchandiser. Pay was not great but did get paid by the hour. When Pepsi was on sale you were required to stay late to keep product on shelves which was not a problem. We had several route men that did not do their job properly by leaving out of date product on shelves and even more in back rooms. When it came time to apply for a route, it was seniority based and not based on work ethic or ability so if you were on the bottom, all the route guys would switch routs which took months and you were not guaranteed a thing. Overall I liked the job but we were underpaid for the work we did and most of the management did not support us at all. I had a weeks vacation due me towards the end of my employment but was not given to me because I turned in notice at that time as well. Something I had earned!!!!!!"
good,"- Part time workers generally don't have too much say on when they want to work."
good,Pepsico is an alright company to work for but being a union facility and a new hire you are at the bottom of the seniority list which means you are forced to work all overtime and weekends which is every day and weekend when you work in the filling department.
good,Good for the students who want to take their ojt. They can learn more about how the corporate world works. PCPPI will build the engineer in you. You will learn every the process of every facilities inside the company.
good,The pay and benefits are good. No advancement unless you are a chosen one. Boring job nonetheless- work solo filling chips day in and day out. Management is generally about themselves and what makes them look good.
good,"Pay below average, Decent benefits, heavy politics"
good,"As a merchandiser you are required to work four ten hour shifts with the opportunity of working overtime on a fifth day. A merchandiser is responsible for covering the main sales rep's days off on Sunday/Monday and then covering another sales rep on Friday/Saturday with the opportunity of helping both of them on Thursdays. Most of the time you will work over ten hours each day due to the work load being heaviest during these days especially towards the end of the week when the sales change in each grocery store. Depending on who you are covering you might have an easy day or a hard day; it really depends on how neat and coordinated the sales rep is. You usually work alone and are responsible for putting up as much product as you can to the shelves, building displays, and managing other tedious things stores expect from Pepsi."
good,If you have a family you most definitely wont like working here. The hours are long and you dont leave work till the work load is COMPLETED. Sometimes that means working 15 plus hours going home just to sleep two hours then back at it. I dont recommend this to anyone that has a home life with kids.
good,"Everyday was slightly different and a great place to start out your career, as you learn quite a bit and are given many responsibilities very quickly."
good,lo mas dificil fue el horario de 6:15 am y mas o menos 10:00pm promedio y se fue complicando cuando incrementaron de una manera descomunal reduciendo nuestros ingresos aun estando conciente los de gerencia y pidiendo las disculpas del caso pero sin ninguna respuesta convincente
good,"PepsiCo is currently undergoing changes within it's structure.  Walk-up center called the Tech Bar is a huge success in providing immediate on site support."
good,"You are scheduled for 10-12 hour days, but the schedule is nearly impossible to keep up with, so you end up working 14-16 hours per day 5 days a week. "
good,"Great benefits, great PTO, great co-workers, but really high expectations, and not always enough hours and manpower allotted to accomplish the tasks. High sales desired, and sometimes overlooking the actual needs of the customer."
good,Good job to get your experience in driving trucks. You need a college degree to become management. Good for a long term career as long as ypur partner also has q good career
good,"This specific location during my time on the leadership team member proved to be a  workplace culture that was a very toxic and/or politically, ""just say yes"" to your leader environment just to survive  and maybe,...get ahead."
good,If you are in great shape physically then this is a good job. But it is extremely physically demanding and very fast paced. it was difficult for me to full fill my duties daily due to injuries from past. they dont prepare you for the strenuousness of the job. Manage was just focused on getting the product delivered.
good,Great company to work for as an intern. Not to much growth opportunity. The company turover rate is due to lack of growth unless you are at the very senior management level.
good,Very competitive environment.  Many smart professionals in my experience here at PepsiCo.  I worked here over 20 years ago and I will alway look at this company as the greatest starting point to  my career.
good,Good job but whoever works for you when your off want do or ever keep up with the merchandising like you do on your route and they want get punished for it communication is lack luster and the managers and or other workers will only defend what they do and not take a accountability
good,"You have to learn quickly in this sink-or-swim environment which is ok if you are used to that. However, hours are long (12+) so it isn't worth the pay or even the potential soft-skills you develop if you have an engineering degree. You can get what you get here a lot of other places without killing yourself."
good,"This place was great and helped me pay for college. When layoffs started happening though, I was forced to 3rd shift or I would be fired. I felt very under appreciatd"
good,"On two of my routes I have 10 plus stores, I have to do these stores in 10 hours or less they want less hours in an account. one of these accounts is a Walmart Super Center in Shawnee Ok. I will spend 8 plus hours alone in this store to do the job effectively. in this store it is really hard to get in and out on certain time even though I do this store twice on Fridays and Saturdays. and try to get to all of my other stores on the same day."
good,Great place to work bad management to work under. U work 8-12 hours a day non stop moving for 6 days a week and they have no empathy for all the hard work you out in
good,"PepsiCo Just revoked incentives for employees who worked hard to get into management . Working their way from the bottom. Just to be told they want to focus on outside talent instead of developing within. Another words if you don't have a degree your advancement opportunities are next to nothing. All opportunities to advance wages..GONE get development training GONE....any type of movement GONE. Another words if you are happy being a grunt and don't want to advance you career at all....this is the place for you.Unless you have a engineering degree, then you will be catered to like a walking god."
good,It’s a good company to work for. They don’t want Overtime but you have to get the job done so if there are stores with loads left on your phone and your at your 8 hours you have to finish.. come ready to work because we don’t need any more slackers
good,"Buenas marcas, estable pero no desarrolla a su gente, al Sabritas tomar control termino con GAMESA"
good,Pepsi has alot of work during the day and is a constant working enivornment. i enjoyed working there it was just to work to go back and forth every day.
good,"El ambiente laboral es tranquilo, pero hay poco compañerismo sincero, en la empresa no se fomenta la colaboración entre equipos diferentes, más bien todo es motivo de competencia. "
good,wanna work hard get craped on work here. route get cut oh well you'll be ok lost 600 a mo and acted like no big deal. almost lost everything cause of the loss.
good,"Kids are put into management positions without any background, experience or previous training. They are expected to learn on the floor and are shuffled into new positions about every two years. The workers are the ones who are forced to deal with these new borns each time. "
good,Overall solid company; a little too set in their ways ... Extreme long-term employees resistant to change ... beginning to focus on younger generation but it might take a while to turn the ship
good,Working for this company isn't the best because at the warehouse individuals do not work together. The managers only care for themselves and looks after their one or two friends.
good,"Would not apply there's no breaks except for lunch they work you none stop and only care about meeting there quota ,.............................."
good,"I have been with Pepsi for 2 yrs now and I started out loving it there but as the time went on it got worse and worse. Working at Pepsi is what it is! Tough, Over worked and under paid. I try my best to stick it out because like you I have bills to pay and a family, but most of all it's every week pay. If you cant find other work than it's okay to deal with Pepsi stress until something better comes along, but if you can find better with another company than please go for it and don't waste your time with Pepsi. I am loosing my Pepsi pride with each passing day and I am currently seeking employment else where right now as we speak..."
good,The work/home life could be better. If your department is short handed you will be asked to work 12 days. Some departments follow the business needs so in the slow time your will be working
good,Work morning started early around 6 am with meeting then out to the field. I always felt like I was doing the work of 3 people with every year the sale quotas numbers going way up. Management pushed hard really knowing in most cases reps needed more help. Pepsi is why I got into real estate.
good,"Passei minha vida na Pepsico, porém as gerências mudam, lideranças diferentes e consegui me manter por 22 anos."
good,"while the Bursom Road plat used to be a good place to work, cutbacks and restructuring mean that may of us left."
good,"The salary is good. The hardest part is, having to work long hours for an indefinite amount of time. The most enjoyable part  would have to be weekly pay."
good,"Leuke mensen - top producten - jonge mensen en veel actie, beweging - marketingcampagnes - open space en niet iedereen respecteert dit - heb er heel graag gewerkt , veel diversiteit - open communicatie, maar soms teveel communicatie."
good,Good job. Great way to learn about large companies. Worked long hours sometimes due to increased volume needs. Fun team oriented environment where everyone was willing to help out each other.
good,"Work was fine for a while, until our branch of the company was essentially sold. This killed ALL career potential and many of us were unhappy. Great for the older folks who want an easy part time job, but I was using it as an entry point, and we were banned from even attempting to apply back to other Pepsi jobs."
good,This was a fun job...I had a great to time with fellow employees and still good friends with them today....I like this job a lot..I thought we worked good over all
good,"Se arranca temprano 7:30 y no tenes horaio de salida, los llamados se dan a cualquier hora. Aprendí a manejar los distintos canales de distribución, interactuar con toda la cadena de valor y las distintas áreas. La gerencia son jefes,no lideres, muchos cambios en los 5 años que estuve, muchas desvinculaciones, 3 directores distintos, 3 jefes directos distintos. Lo que mas me gusto fue entender la elasticidad del verano en la costa y como se resuelven las problemáticas en poco tiempo por parte de los distribuidores. La parte mas difícil fue el cambio constante de gente en la mayoría de los puestos."
good,"my experience with Pepsi is great. They have excellent workplace culture, all are very approachable and helpful. they have groomed me  in every sense and made me much more confident. Most enjoyable part of the job was its dynamic nature and  the hardest part was to get things done in short period of time."
good,"Se aprende mucho de la operación en los diversos canales de distribución y se tiene contacto con cientos o miles de clientes."
good,you are force to work 50 or more hours a week. nobody goes home until the job is done and warehouse is clean. dont matter what time it is. equipment is always falling apart.
good,"In the office there is minimal chance to grow in the company. If you are lucky enough to become a sales rep or commissioned merchandiser, you will become successful."
good,"My best friends were made while working for Pepsico. The day was hectic and busy but talking with people all over the USA and Canada was great. The biggest issue with PepsiCo is that it doesn't matter how well you know your job or even if you do your job better than your manager could, all that maters is that you sell soda and meet the required quotas even if the job you do has nothing to do with selling Soda."
good,"The work place at Pepsi was very cut-throat and highly stressed.  There was no room for growth or advancement in the industry unless your seniority dictated your hours of operation getting to the day-shift or the more comfortable jobs.  The pay was fair, but the hours were not my favorite because we sometimes, more than normal worked 16 hours a day Monday-Friday and occasional Saturday's based on seniority."
good,jefe prepotente agresivo muy malo su cargo que tiene
good,Was a temporary assignment during the busy season for Gatorade.  I learned new skills during my time with them that I was able to utilize in jobs afterwards.
good,"updating company stock delivered"
good,Aprendi muitos oficios na empresa desde operar maquinário trabalhos manuais .
good,"Heavy lifting and heavy daily work load. Daily work life is overloaded. Great pay, friendly co workers and benefits are ok. rushed work life and unbalanced work family balance."
good,"most days were busy and other days were moderate "
good,Boring work.  Long hours.  Shift starts at noon which sucks.  The other employees are cool to work with but the job is super repetitive.  If you like long hours and are single with no family this is the job for you
good,Cool place to work. Not too demanding. Management and staff are very helpful. As long as you stay consistent with completing orders and maintain a level of productivity..its a breeze.
good,You are trained to work many differnet jobs. But are only given two weeks to learn them. If you dont learn them in two week you will get a write up for job proformance. Very stressful job. There is no room for a balanced life. If you are looking to just work for the rest of your life and not have a social life this job is for you. Now it does pay well. but you have no life
good,Very good company to work for. You need to be a team player. The company is growing every day.. Most important skill to have is communication.  Its very diverse work environment.
good,"typically long days. learned sales and customer development skills invaluable in todays retail environment. the hardest part of the job would be the external factors which couldn't be controlled such as weather, customer buying trends, and soft economy."
good,"I've learned to lead collaboration effort among customer, demand planning sales and distribution to effectively manage inventory and forecast accuracy."
good,You can build a solid career at Pepsi! I started as a supervisor and advanced. There is a lot of room for advancement and no shortage of task to grab onto and claim as your own.
good,"hours are very long, management isn't very supportive, and at many times it seems like everyone is on a different page. but at the end of the day its a good job I just don't know if you should make it a career."
good,empresa boa de trabalhar porem não da ao funcionário oportunidade de crescimento
good,"Managers at Director Level only concerned with younger female employees. This group was promoted easily. Diversity of thought is a misnomer. It was an environment of we want to hear your thoughts, but, it fell on deaf ears."
good,"With the steady decline in the soda business, numbers are pushed and makes your long work day that much more stressful.upper management is friendly, however they do not have any loyalty when it comes to their employees and would rather punish the employee then lose a customer."
good,Long hours but highly motivated team. I enjoyed the job however it was very common to work 12-14 hours if part of the operations team without any recognition from senior managers
good,Working here is very competitive in a fast paced environment. Good benefits and time off with a decent balance between work and home time.  The ability to be promoted and move up is very good.
good,"Empresa Razoável, mas tranquilo para trabalhar, bom relacionamento com os colegas."
good,This was my favorite place to work of my 20+ years unfortunately we faced multiple layoffs and ultimately outsourcing to a over seas based company. When this happened all worked onshore in the states were eventually let go.
good,"Conoces sobre desarrollo laboral, te permite elevar tu nivel de experiencia en procesos."
good,Fast paced FMCG environment with a huge focus on succeeding. Highly collaborative workplace with dedicated staff. Good renumeration and recognition programs in place.
good,"I liked working at Pepsico, but the HR department was pretty disrespectful. The typical day was good and the people are nice. I had a bad manager and felt that she was never really around."
good,They suffer from a huge lack of supervision and very high turnover rate of management. This creates some serious problems with employee direction. Also no real training to speak of. Your basically given a truck and a set of keys and let go to learn as you go.
good,"Small warehouse, very old place. Old way of doing things. Scan guns just introduced a few years ago. No labor standards. Old and antiquated processes. Too many chiefs not enough Indians."
good,My department was a fun but fast paced environment. But the lack of career advancement and perma-temping was a turn off for me. Some contractors were there for over 10 years working with no benefits or advancement opportunity.
good,"Most enjoyable part is the learning part. Management is OK. "
good,"Buen ambiente, mucha presión laboral pero soportable"
good,"Merchandiser. it was ok. stock, load/unload "
good,"the job can be demanding but not a bad gig for self motivated people with great work ethic! I would tell people to give it a try. You will love it or hate it but if you love it , you will really love it!"
good,"Work consisted not of just deliveries but sales orders also."
good,AS merchandiser i could drive a van to different locations and setting expositions. I lern how to deal with deadlines and management in different shops. It can be hard sometimes
good,"- flexivel"
good,"Pepsi is a very fast-paced and results oriented environment.  Being a large corporate entity, it lacks the ""soul"" of a smaller, privately owned company."
good,"Very fast paced job very demanding of your time. Must have a car and it will put miles on your vehicle so definitely have a reliable vehicle. Other than that, great relationships built and would recommend"
good,Was a decent place to work. The fleet of vehicles needed to desperately be upgraded. They pay was good and the work was challenging but manageable. The facility was very run down and some of equipment was outdated.
good,Great but long work hours and fast paced. A job for the young and not the older. Hands on. Have to be a people person. Alot of public interaction. Alot of work
good,"Long Hours, Low pay, management is sometimes good; mostly bad though."
good,Pepsi co was a great employer. But work load was too much and there was no balance between official and personal life. Salaries as per market were not those competitive. There was no pick and drop and ladies used to go at their own after late office hours.
good,Great company with great employees. Work days are pretty long and start very early in the morning. At times work load is a lot to handle especially around the holidays
good,Long hrs but good teamwork among peers. Work most holidays. The company goes through reorganization a lot. Department has a good training program but you have reviews on your work ability every three months.
good,"Empresa que não possui um dia igual a outro, sendo todos com bastante emoção. Apaixonados no que fazem esta deve ser a cultura , entretanto a gestão fica um pouco prejudicada com a demanda alta de atividades."
good,"a very inclusive work environment."
good,un exelente ambiente de trabajo antes de emoezar a trabajar nos reunian a todos en el patio de la empresa para realizar ejercicios para empezar el dia con una muy buena acritud.
good,4 day a week is a nice work week. Good ppl and nice to be home every day. Every job has it ms good an bad this one is no different. Fast paced environment Monday to Saturday all shifts available
good,"PepsiCo enjoys a good brand image and hence acts as a launch pad for many career aspirants."
good,"all brands of pepsico have available on my owner. all beands like everywhere all time so that is the branded company in the world. but my work was take order and collect payment. i am not pay roll employee in company, only incentive base private job."
good,"It was a decent job, decent pay, very, very physically demanding. Not much chance of advancement, the only incentive was your pay check. Management was lack luster.The benefits weren't really that great. Extremely hot during summer months."
good,They are always trying to overwork you and take advantage of the new guy by placing them in the worst position as long as then can get away with it.  Management will take advantage
good,I really like the company and want to love it but the environment is very cut-throat which encourages a lot of bad behaviors which also gets rewarded.
good,"Working at Pepsico was fun because the people I worked with her friendly, the supervisor would let you take a day of if you had to. The hours was really bad sometimes we would work for 6 to 7 hours, many times we were sent home."
good,"The employee development is good, the company invest in it, but the consideration of the personal life balance is neglected. The work load is very high with minimum work force."
good,It is a good company just too much politics. Management changes to frequently.  Pay is good for what they do. Awesome benefits and a lot of p.t.o. especially for the line of work it is.
good,"Some of the people I liked. Part of the work I did liked, and was good at. Never understood touch typing, until I needed to use an adding machine. I got very good at it."
good,"Una experiencia favorable, ya que me permito conocer bien las direcciones y demás"
good,its a third party company that runs PespiCo called X.P.O and they treat us bad. the shift i work on is the best shift but other shift make us look bad all the time
good,"There is no typical day. Everything is priority number one and stress runs high. However, they have the most competitive pay and opportunities for advancement."
good,this the job for the young guys who just received their CDL and no one else would hire them yet. Overtime sucks and the relationship between the customer and drivers is a joke these guys get treated the worst.
good,Fast pace - don't really know anyone so there isn't really a company culture that is created when going to work. Simply trying to finish the work day then head home.
good,"Firstly, to make things clear. This is a review of Pepsi MidAmerica in Southern Illinois, not PepsiCo.  "
good,If you work in finance/accounting it is horrible -job requires you to work late and stay even when the work is complete. The company is all about appearances and who you know.
good,It had its ups and downs but ok to work there jus not for me. Co workers were awesome. Management was fine. Some better than others. Overall we were treated fairly it was jus time for me to move on
good,"I didn't really work there for that long, but it seemed like a nice work environment and easy work. "
good,"Start your day at 3am to combat the big box stores ridiculous pallet times. Do all the work while the sales team just sends in whatever they want to line their pockets with commission. Zero recognition including during quarterly meetings, as your on your own and virtually forgotten about."
good,"Empresa multinacional, que precisa de melhorias no sistema de entregas, deveria avaliar melhor seus clientes e saber os horários de recebimentos, assim suas devoluções seriam sanadas."
good,"People are great! But nothing ever changes to make things remotely efficient. Have to wait for sales orders until 4 p.m. sometimes before I can finish my work.Warehouse gets overtime when others in the company are short by 8 hrs per week. Instead of getting on the salesman to get their orders done or try to sell out 48hrs ahead of time for efficiency, management just sits on its butt and thinks status quo is okay. Was told it was a family kind of place but really no one cares about anyone else at least at the distributor I worked for. Management only cares about sales volume and not about efficiency. You could send out 2000 cases of pop and have 500 cases expire and management is somehow okay with that. Really frustrating!! However, I have to say the benefits are very nice and can make up for some of the shortfalls but not all of them."
good,"A lot of work. Management needs a lot of work. workplace culture not that good, the most enjoyable part of your jobs so people was nice. the hardest part of the job it deal with people that didn't want to be there"
good,"good job, i had to stock the drinks and clean up around the warehouse, i had to operate the forklifters into the truck. job was very easy and fun to do"
good,"Job is the same everyday. The culture is 50/50 as far being satisfied with their jobs.Either you like it or you dont.  The hardest part of my job is the constant change in operations due to changes in management. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people, and the relationships you build over the years, as well as providing for my family."
good,"Fast paced environment. Shift work - however, as the manager, you have to stay approximately one to two hours past your shift everyday to close out the administrative part of your shift. You start out on an off shift and have to work your way up - usually takes a year or two to advance to day shifts."
good,"At the beginning of my time at Pepsi I had great aspirations and goals for myself.  After several years of being told ""you're the next guy"" and others with less credibility getting promoted takes its toll.  They have this program called the campus recruit program. This is where they invest money into unproven college students who do nothing but sign a contract and get promoted before hard work gets recognized because of said invested money. These people are promoted because they deserve it, or because in their contract it says they will be in a certain spot in a certain amount of time and they're under achieving so they're ""promoted"" to a different facility with different management aka were terrible and were ""promoted"" aka moved."
good,"Me gusto mucho trabajar con ingenieros en obras,  de l la a planta. Trabajar en equipo, realizar rondines, muy bueno"
good,PepsiCo starts out training on the electric pallet jack then eventually work your way up to learn how to drive the forklift. Quick training is a pro but I'm still having back problems from the long 12 hour shifts.
good,"He continuado mi carrera en empresas Multinacionales en este caso desarrollando mis relaciones con Sindicatos y otros aspectos complejos."
good,Enjoyed my job there. Was part of a great team. No room to move up within company. Some poor management. To many policies and procedures. It would always take too long to get answers from HR.
good,There is a good work ethic and this is a busy and productive place to work. each day is different and there is plenty of challenging projects for folks to undertake.
good,"My typical day tends to be structured. I will walk through my areas talking to the teams about the previous days performance and highlighting there priorities for that day without trying to micro manage people. I trust the team and expect them to make decisions about the process. Managing people is about communicating on their wavelength. All teams have differing strengths so being able to understand what they are and detailing the workload accordingly helps the efficiency of the team. "
good,Collaborative work environment with many opportunities for professional development.  Opportunities are also provided to work with many functional departments to ensure organizational and departmental objectives are met.
good,"- Uma empreza  boa pois trabalhava com varios tipo de pessoa diferentes porem muitos atenciosas e prontas para ajudar e ensinar trabalhava na parte de conferir cargas de produtos da fabrica e  fazer as entregas em lojas e mercados em toda grande são paulo e interios e algun outros estados."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,"good job to work at long hours good pay.."
good,"A empresa é boa de trabalhar tem plano de saúde unimed, salário não era ruim, tinha seguro de vida, vale alimentação e também tínhamos participação nos lucros da empresa. Não fiquei devido a problemas pessoais onde não me permitia ficar dias fora de casa, problema hoje resolvido."
good,"Long working Hours. Revise compensation table on Overtime pays especially for Sales Department (Technical Support). During holiday, must limit also work schedule."
good,en una empresa muy compititiva en lo laboral...pero ocupa cambios en el personal  y orden en lo que cabe almacen....
good,This place is decent and I enjoyed the people I worked with.  I liked being out in the field and excelling at customer service.  I was good at merchandising and enjoyed the work.
good,Job descriptions and accountability did not match everyday environment.  Decisions made at project level were not completed based upon side management opinions.
good,"I feel the we as drivers were overworked and underpaid. We didn't get paid for half of our job, and our insurance did not cover vison."
good,Lo unico malo de la empresa es que no tienes vida social ni con tu propia familia
good,"great place to work at if you have no life outside of work, it is nice that they pay for your cdl's. most of the people there are really nice and willing to help you out anyway they can"
good,"It has great people and pleasurable customers.  I have made a career there, but trying to see what else is out there! i love what i do. I have always been able to fix anything i set my mind to."
good,"Muita correria,aprendi muito sobre trabalhar em equipe."
good,"It's ok! Just be ready to deal with the ""boys club"". I think people should be ready for a male dominated workforce, and limited local positions. Most of the jobs outside of the front line are are in other states. So, if you don't want to relocate, find another job!"
good,It was a good job for a while but the hours became strenuous and i didn't feel appreciated by my superiors. Also not much room for advancement no matter where i went in the company i would make about the same money just more responsibility.
good,"Pepsi is a Fortune 50 Company that provides it's workers with many opportunities for advancement.  Unfortunately for me, those opportunities are not ones that I see myself taking on."
good,"- Arrive at first store for packout,upon completion move on to the next store on route at a maximum of 6 stores."
good,It is a very fast past job. You have to use multiply screens and learn a lot of things in 8weeks of training . You mostly learn from has hands on. Management is not that friendly did not like to answer question . They like to stay in there office at times not very professional as they should. Very could place to learn how to use a score cards and to be productive. Love the overtime pay that they offered. Did not like the fact that they only gave 10 cent raises.
good,"Work Life Balance is definitely neglected and employees are overworked.  However,lots of new Innovation in the beverage industry."
good,para cargar producto es un problema por que no ay orden en el almaen
good,This is the most challenging time when your in pepsi because you encounter different person and objection which your mean focus on how to win the heart and idea of your client to sell you products.

Followed warehouse instructions in building loads. Maintained a clean and safe work environment."
good,"Un dia tipico inicio del dia levantar inventarios y coordinar con el personal la operacion del dia, "
good,"Working at Pepsi was not fun or rewarding. The management played a good game pre-employment status, but that changed once you were hired and got to work. Often forced to stay after you were done working to make sure they got a full 8 hours out of you,"
good,"Good pay, lot of workload. lack of accountability. Culture at plant level could improve. long travelling hours"
good,"PepsiCo is a great company. The changes the company is making makes it truly tough to preform the job. The biggest issue is the are moving locations, so job security is on a day to day hope."
good,Typical day at work is steady. Just depends which department you are working in. I have learned a lot since I've been here 4 years. Management is ok still working on communication as a whole. Which is both Warehouse and Production. Working with my colleagues is fun. We all work together and get things done. Hardest part of the job is nothing at all. The most enjoyable part of the job is the free giveaways.
good,"Hayattaki̇ hedefler İyi̇di̇r fakat İlahi̇ bi̇r hedef olmamali,yani̇ herzaman daha fazla anlayişi İnsani "
good,es una empresa muy buena para laborar con un ambiente laboral muy bueno donde el empleado se siente muy satisfecho desarrollando su labor sin ningún tipo de acoso laboral
good,management is a problem here they view employees as enemies not assets.  regularly put in 13 to 14 hr days.  I did enjoy the work moving from place to place and something different everyday
good,"Es confidencial ya que por mas malo o buena empresa  que sea me dio de comer en algún momento ,disculpeme por fabor por los datos llenado que no sean de su agrado."
good,"Like everywhere else, it can be better. It all depends on your route and on how many deliveries you get. Really enjoy days with no deliveries because of the possibilities of having short days."
good,My shift consist of and fast pace environment using your hands to pick product in a timely manner. I have learned the values of product handling as well as safety. Management has been fair overall. My co workers must work as a unit to get the job done and takes someone to step up to lead them. Hardest part of job is working nights and sacrificing value family time during the week but job has to get done. Also order selecting is very demanding and hard on body after some years. I enjoy learning something new everyday about the company and product as well.
good,"One gets to work with one of the biggest brands of the world."
good,sair de casa sedo para começar o dia e atender os clientes sem correria. aprendi a respeitar as pessoas como elas são a gerencia tem que saber trabalhar com pessoas e não só com números parte mais fácil do trabalho é ter emprego e o mais difícil é não alcançar as metas  e o que mais vou sentir falta sera dos colegas que se tornaram amigos
good,"this place is a good place to work for a single parent.  In order to do your job and do it right it takes a lot of hours, and time away from your family.  In order to make any money you need to work near 70 hours a week.  There is also no room for advancement into a sales position."
good,"My job is more one on one with customers, and providing great service. Do your job and give the customer what the want. The management style at Pepsi is Good. On the scale of 1 to 10 my co-workers are a 7 at best. The hardest part of my job is not being able to satisfy the customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing a satisfied customer"
good,"slow paced practice in a major corporate facility.  8-10 patients per day, there were many opportunities for health events such as exercise programs, walking programs, weight loss challenges etc."
good,I start my day by clocking in and stretching for atlease 10minutes. after that i look at the amount of work i have for the day and i begin my shift. I unload the first trailer then take my 30 minute lunch and continue my to second trailer followed by a 30 minute break. I then clock out and leave which usaully takes in all about 9 hours. I leanred many things for example I have to treat this business as if it was my own in order to suceed therefore if i have a certain illness i make a decision if i am going to call out or not and i ask myself if i had this illness at my own business will i work or call out. As soon a i began to think that way i moved up in my company fast. I felt that the management had opportunities to work on certain things such as when the job gets overwhelming i feel that the management team could had come out the office and work on the floor as instructed but instead they would stay and depend on the rest of the team to pick up the slack The hardest part of the Job was to replace some one that called out because it happened ocasionally and it was up to the team to cover the replacement. The most enjoyable part of my Job was when every one played there part everything ran smoothly and also the free food.
good,Es una buena empresa para realizar prácticas sin embargo es una empresa nacional por lo que el tamaño de la misma no ofrece desarrollo profesional esperado.
good,"Good learning experience, lots of training, but work life balance is a challenge big time."
good,The job is straining on your body and there is not much room for growth. I would like to have opportunity when openings begin and have more of a work/life balance.
good,"very competitive work environment."
good,"Aprendi muita coisa la"
good,uma empresa humilde q saber trata um funcionario mais como todas as empresas ten suas diferença
good,el problema desde mi punto de vista muy humilde el la rotación de personal en todos  los niveles dentro de la empresa ya que  frecuentemente las personas que dirigen las distintas áreas son remplazados y cambian el  esquema de trabajo y haci se pierde y ocasiona un descontrol dentro de la empresa hay mucha gente muy valiosa dentro pero no la saben valorar y se va
good,I loved this job at first but it seemed that the longer I worked there things got worse.They pay you by how many cases you deliver so your pay changes with the seasons. Most days I would deliver 400 cases with around 12 stops. A typical work day is 5am to 5pm but its hard work. You have to hustle the whole time or you will be out all day. Newly hired drivers get the worst routes because they get last pic for routes in the morning. They fired a long time employee without a warning for a something petty. Not recommended for someone older with a family.
good,Multiple stops at supermarket chains. Building a repore with customers. Friendly interaction with other vendors and companys.
good,this a great job if you don't have want to move up. you work long hours and there is a lot to do. you will not get to be home on holidays with the family because of work. some days  are long !0- 16 hours) but the next day might only take you 6 hours so you pick your poison. but the pay is good just not good enough for what you will be doing.
good,Lider imediato extremamente transparente e voltado para desenvolvimente dos seus liderados.

good,This was a fun company to work with. Extremely organized and well managed group.
good,Es un trabajo agradable pero por cambio de gerencia van a prescindir de personal en el próximo septiembre.
good,"Every day is hard, expect to be treated like a slave! Long hours and just sundays off...."
good,Las oportunidades son muy pocas y al personal outsourcing lo tienen muy resagado de las opciones de crecimiento dentro de la empresa.
good,"good work culture"
good,"A typical day at work for me would include running reports, updating and maintaining the organization's web site, processing and following up with invoice payment and working on projects as they arose.  I learned the day to day Operations of a Distribution Center and how product is distributed to customers.  My co workers were based regionally but we had a very good relationship and provided a great support system.  Although the Operations process was the same in each location, it would have been helpful if I were able to visit each one to see the differences because some warehouses performed better than others according to the metrics used on the quarterly performance scorecards.  I would have liked to identify the process in each location to understand why.  That was the hardest part of my job.  The most enjoyable part of my job was that I had the ability to work from home when I needed to and the flexibility of my hours.  The unfortunate part was that I was not able to really utilize my technical skills as much as I would have liked."
good,"As a merchandiser, my work was self directed. I was assigned a set number of retail establishments. At these locations I would receive deliveries from the Pepsi bottling plant, stage the pallets, and then stock the coolers, the shelves, and the displays. I drove my own vehicle to the different locations."
good,my first day at job is very difficult day for me because before this i was jst student  but that day i ve nothing to enjoy.but after that day i jst realise that this is the real enjoyment and i ve started my career with fun and enjoyment with my coleagues ....
good,Long hours and working every holiday. The culture is really close knit.
good,There was a lot of communication loss between managers and workers. One manager would not tell you are doing something wrong until it builds up and manager lets it boil up inside him after awhile and then lets you have it because he is mad. He should tell the worker then and there when he notices things like this. Also one manager would joke about my lifestyle and put me down. Some co workers were very disrespectful of me and how I lived my life. But I was able to become good friends with a few co workers and still to this day talk to them.
good,Everyday is different depending on the stores you have to service and the size of the delivery at the store. Advancement is minimal.
good,"Go to work get my truck together and start my route."
good,"Production ramps up at different times of the year and the forecasting changes rapidly to meet customers demands.

Attained a level 3 certificate in warehousing logistics and distribution. Found the management too be fairly average. Co workers were mostly friendly hard working and cooperative . Assisting with newly installed automatic palletizing robots. Good pay rate."
good,My work days can be very hectic due to the multiple tasks I have to complete daily. Those tasks range anywhere from payroll to AR/AP and so on. I also assist my fellow co-workers with any tasks they need help with as well as answer a multi-line phone system while offering any customer assistance to those who enter the building.
good,Tools required to complete tasks are not always available in certain departments. Very fast paced in certain departments. Certain departments require overtime which is not always approved. There are a lot of changes which require quick learning. Very little room for error and you may have to juggle more than one position at a given moment. Impressions are a top priority. Co-workers are friendly. Managers are friendly but overwhelmed.
good,"start early finish late"
good,"The ever changing and fast past business behind the product line up that is close to untouchable in the industry. The issues that lie at hand are the work load balance is never balanced, and if it is it's that everyone has a lot! As one company they have lost their loyalty to the front line employees and often are driven on a hope instead of a reality. the constant re- alignment in positions/organization is frustrating. The daily life is diverse and dynamic, rarely a day that is not changing, what I liked about it. Co-workers were in all kinds, workers that believed in how we relate and serve the customer and be successful and the majority, single focused and worried only about their side of business. Upper management would take care of their own, which would lead to people who were ready for that job looking in from the outside. Your career path was often chosen for y9ou depending on what info you may have put into the system through the HR Dept. Posting of possible positions were inconsistent. I was one of the lucky one's that worked hard and by word of mouth and experience led me to my position. Still not fair for all who may have and were over looked for other spots, once again no consistency. The perks of the job had its advantages which were invaluable to the employees that could use them and the customers. Before PepsiCo bought the major bottlers most of these issues DID NOT occur as much, the bottling system ran a business of reality."
good,"I was a fleet mechanic and I liked it , didn't really see much more of the company the only thing that bothered me was i worked for them for 8 months and never missed a day .. through a temp agency and because the temp agency wanted to move me somewhere else ...they ( Pepsi ) did not hire me."
good,Pepsi is a good company to work for but very fast pace.  The company  moves hundreds of products daily throughout the southern region. I learned that a person has to be physically fit to be benefitial to the company as well as very friendly.
good,"Stocking or unloading truck everyday, usually work alone with no supervision, work at own pace"

good,"Pepsi, provides great benefits and job security. Proactive training and advancement opportunity. Great team focused environment.Oversight during second shift was spread thin in providing adequate support. Schedule and hours are a challenge, if one is trying to balance work and family life."
good,A typical day of work included analyzing sales trends of different products. The management was inconsistent and fellow workers were often unhappy with their current situation. The hardest part of the job was the lack of training. You were often forced to learn things on your own with little help.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced, precise movement is needed to perform daily tasks such as loading over the road trucks and filling out paper work for product that comes off of the production line. The management, advancement, and work/life balance are the biggest downside to this job."
good,If your willing to put your family and personal life on the back burner then Pepsi is the job for you.

Our management team was great we were the most productive shift in the state always won awards for hitting record numbers. My co-workers were all great people real team players. The hardest part of the job was loading out the trucks in the summer. The most enjoyable part was working with a great team.

good,"i like the job and I am happy to gain more experiences. i been there long enough to witness a shift in the company's strategy, embracing a wider world view, which includes the creation late last year of its global nutrition group."
good,"Wake up early and throw soda!! Stock all shelves and displays, and sometimes order. management was pretty bad, i'd cover their stores and write orders for them and they didn't really show any appreciation. hardest part was waking up early."
good,It's a good fast paced environment to work in. The supervisors was good stand up and honest guys. As long as you took care of the assignment at hand at a reasonable time there was no complaints. I loved every part of the job to bad it was a temporary assignment.
good,It has been really great feeling to work with such a huge brand. I had not faced such difficulties while working here. the only difficulty is there is lack of women strength (less women) in plant. Management is also very strict about work specially about output.But we were 3 girls working here and we had a great time together.all co workers are very supportive.
good,"Foi um contrato temporário de 3 meses, fui para Argentina aprender o equipamento (forno), mas por falta de equipamento não houve contratação. Os benefícios eram ótimos, os colegas de trabalho também,"

good,Im looking for a career. I am in-shape physically and mentally to handle most jobs even with the lack of training for some jobs. Fun is not a requirement but the job is and thats my main focus at all the time.

good,"Oversee and Develop Team of 2 Supervisors,1 Parts Clerk & 21 Mechanics for a 24/7 Operation"
good,A typical day includes daily sales meeting with staff to discuss daily goals and objectives for the day. I have approximately 30 people that report to me so spend a lot of my day in the territory dealing with issues my employees are not authorized to deal with and meeting with are larger clients.
good,"The job was great because it actually helped me get back into shape. A lot of physical work in a very hot warehouse. Also, got more experience on tractor trailers and forklifts."
good,"At the time I was lucky to get in, with all kinds of opportunities to learn about the business and the company itself."
good,"Spent long hours in stores stocking shelves and selling in product. Management was usually a college graduate that had spent little to no time out in the feild so did not truly understand their employees job. Co workers were great but you were out on your own all day. Hardest part of job was the physical aspect of lifting/pushing/pulling cases of soda all day long. Most enjoyable was being out in the feild in several different stores each day instead of being stuck i the same building with the same people all the time,"
good,Good starter job for fresh out of college.
good,"Think seriously about working at this one.  Bad management at the time.  Also, for the amount of work and the long day you were not being paid enough."
good,I would not like to leave a review or rating for this company at this time . This is none applicable to me . I will not leave a review for this company .
good,This place was okay to work.  The managers at the stores were not very cool people and one of the sales representatives wasnt very cool to work for as well.
good,"Great staff, good equipment and great home time balance. Typical day was inspection of truck and product management for on time and precise deliveries to dedicated customers."
good,Empresa boa de trabalhar equipe comprometida em bater a meta é na organização.
good,"The pay is considerably above average and the work is very easy, but they own you. There is no time off during the summer months, mostly 7 day work weeks with quick turns on the weekends not allowing for any family time."

good,"Es una buena empresa con buenas prestaciones y oportunidad de crecimiento,"
good,The job was good I had to deliver and but up the product in stores. I worked there for 6 months. I had to drive and it was starting to take a toll on me and my car.
good,"I always wanted to see what it was like being a merchandiser. It gave me the ability to be free with my time and completing my work, but at time it seemed like the work was passed over to me and even when i brought it to my supervisors attention i was brushed off. I ended up leaving because I got injured from the very complaint I had."
good,El que no trabaja gana lo mismo que tu y tiene más recompensas.
good,"Trabajar en la empresa Pepsi fue una experiencia muy agradable, aprendi muchas cosas un exelente servicio"
good,"steady busy work in a fast paced setting. typical day is filling vending machine snack sandwich, coffee, beverage. then on to the next stop then repeat."
good,"A typical day at work involved travelling around form account to account, checking inventory at each location, ordering in required product while tying to find more spots, more places and better spaces for pepsi-related products and advertising material.I learned how to time manage my day while getting the maximum value of myself at each store. The workplace culture was very competitive but was also very team focused.  The hardest part of the job is being able to complete all the required tasks in a short amount of time while dealing with at times, difficult store owners/managers.  I loved the freedom as well as the pay at Pepsi.  Pepsi was always trying to promote from within which was very encouraging."
good,"The job is physically demanding with poor management support."
good,"Empresa de grande porte, porem falha um pouco na comunicação e na parte dinâmica rapidez em resolver.. O adm entre único e fabrica parece que estamos em empresas diferentes isso traz um diferenciação nos processos."
good,Fast paced.  Frequent internal supply and production issues create inefficiencies..  Training program lacking and inconsistent.  Most of the time feel unappreciated.
good,Its okay job nothing special. Somethings can be changed but it was okay. Management needs some work and needs to care more about there employees and a little less about numbers and boosting the pockets.
good,This is a good company for the most part as long as you do your job no matter what the job ask of you and don't complain about nothing just do your job with a smile
good,"good job security, great benefits with the opportunity for advanccement. great eductional opportunities as well as the benefit of advancement in the company"
good,Pepsi was a good job. I just wanted to get my endorsements and further my career as a truck driver and to make more money. I would suggest to anyone starting out as a driver.
good,I learned that PepsiCo management really varies in consistency. Some manager care about the employees and will help in anyway. Others only care about pushing more product out.
good,"salary providing less comparing with other company "
good,"Work for 6 months as a temp, Then didn't get hired. Was a top temp went above and beyond what was asked and often worked on special projects. At the end of the day did not get hired."
good,Was a great company to work for coming in. There have been a lot of changes that negatively affect my position (mainly the introduction of the geo system and the snowball affects of it). 4 day work schedule good for work- life balance.
good,"Unionized company with an excellent safety manager and regional manager. Outstanding employees and exciting atmosphere. Some finger pointing on the overall management team, tons of emails and problems to solve, clean environment and fast paced work loads."
good,"It's a fast paced environment you gotta work hard be in time ready to work it's loading, unloading, assembly line it's a lot of work to do with this company"
good,Pay didnt match work. Long hours low pay. Never really recieved fair wages until the union was installed. Then the management held grudges. Employees were good people
good,White male dominated company hard to get ahead if your a minority. Was looked over more than once by newcomers. 1 of 2 black ppl to work in warehouse hopefully this can change that.
good,"I learned a lot and had many fantastic experiences. It's too bad that restructuring cost me my position, but overall, it was a good place to work. Management allowed us to work on our own and showed trust in our abilities."
good,Equipment was never up kept and dangerous to unload. There was always a shortage of equipment  to use to get the job done and computer printers worked on and off.
good,You will work very hard here. The work is physically demanding. Make sure you are healthy before starting. And be prepared to work long hours. They want the shelf to be perfect. So do what needs to be done.
good,you will work 13 days on and 1 day off. if you like to work a lot of hours and get compensated for it this company is perfect for you. you will have to overcome the work location problems but the overall company is good.
good,Like anything there is good and bad. Work with great people. Be straightforward about what you are looking for in a career and remain professional at all time
good,Extremely hard on your body and work home balance wasn't there. Union stewards didn't back their drivers and it was extremely hard to advance in the business
good,"Not a bad way to start a career. Easy to understand and is fast paced. Once you get the hang of it, it is a good job to have. The management was not the greatest and didn't have good communication skills with employees."
good,"I worked with them by agency. The work was fine, the agency made me work hours that were not paid to me."
good,"The very working day is mostly be on mondays, I learned to be smart and obedient and to do what am ask to do,I managed it well and I do the best,I am very hardworking,the hardpart is wen we do translation,the share give every ending of the year."
good,Like working for Pepsico. Worked here for about 3 months and is a decent job. A lot of work and sometimes hard to see family but in all a good paying job with good benefits.
good,"The beverage industry is surprisingly competitive, and working at PBC is no exception. All departments are fully focused on attaining top market share; which, requires many hours to meet challenging demands. Not for the faint of heart."
good,"Its nice company to work with , company use to give free hand to work with the style and perform.I have sent around 16 year with company and leaned a lot and also able to deliver the same while doing job."
good,"the hours were good, plenty of overtime, only because they are hardly ever fully staffed."
good,"A workplace where hard work is rewarded. Hours are flexible, and management is supportive. People are friendly and willing to help.  Open to new ideas and ways of doing things differently."
good,"beaucoup de pression, never enough, toujours éteindre des feux"
good,Diversity & Inclusion were both pushed a lost and allowed for associate interaction and team building... great work life balance with this particular job
good,"It's a good company to work for a lot of growing space to move up in the company. Management team varies, some care about the employees and some only care about their job and will backstab anyone to keep their job. They aren't out in trade so all they care about is what they need to be done they don't care if it takes 15hours or if you worked your tail off they just want what they need to be done while they sit in their chairs all day. A typical day at work you'll work 10-12 hours a day sometimes more and in the summer 6-7 days a week. There isn't really a work culture because nobody is at the building but managers and warehouse workers. Mostly all positions at Pepsi require you to be on the road servicing stores."
good,Worked long hard hours too many days a week. I rarely took breaks and never took a lunch. Sometimes I would be in 1 store for hours upon hours at a time. Pay was okay but definitely deserved more per hour
good,Some days there is alot of volume and can be very tiring and overwhelming and then other days its easy and your done early. pay is decent compared to other companies.
good,it’s an ok place if you have no other options from experience I can count on my hands several problems but it’s not the bottom of the barrel it’s all about your preference
good,"La empresa es muy buena y buen sueldo, se preocupan por sus empleados y las prestaciónes no se diga, te dan seguro de gastos mayores"
good,"Typical Workplace"
good,"No se cumplian con las horas laborales fijas, tiempo extra no era remunerable."
good,"Empresa boa , porem precisa melhorar muito em questão dos gestores de equipes"
good,"A typical workday was filled with faced paced activities related to finance, billing, supply chain, production manufacturing scheduling and various meeitngs and conference calls to align with different plant sites and business areas.  Working for a company of PepsiCo's caliber provided huge opportunites to cross function and learn how to manage tasks and projects across a large number of business units."
good,"I worked on the local brands portfolio in snacks which requires high pace , dynamic and agile leadership"
good,"Used to be s great company to work for but now they're cutting cost and farming out their operations bit by bit piece by piece . They're never satisfied  with your "
good,Decent pay for loading crew members and for production workers.  Can be long hours and hot/cold environment based upon the season.  Decent benefits in union facility.
good,"The movement in management changes so rapidly, once the team had a good grasp on the workflow and communication it would all just and the process started over. It was very difficult to have the team all on same page all the time due to the lack of communication from management."
good,me pareció buena me apoyaban mucho para aprender y al demostrar nos apoyaban a crecer y obtener un mejor ingreso económico Serios cumplidos con sus trabajdores
good,Pepsi is a cool place to work but their policies are inconsistent and change often with out notification. I enjoy the people that work there. They need more diversity in leadership
good,Work is very fast paced and numbers are a very important part of this job. Very demanding on your body . Supervisors are very knowledgeable of product and placement...
good,Good job and benefits and a good career but the schedule was hard to balance everyday life and work.. Overall it was a good business that is not goin anywhere.
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar! Contudo, apresenta algumas falhas na coordenação."
good,"Every day is a challenge, you work in combination with a lot of people and decision makers.Our team help to each others all the time."
good,"Competitive company that strives to be the best"
good,Good place to work. Teams are working together. It's better than it used to be. It's still long hours but it's summer so that's expected. Need to hire more
good,Then they restructured us and cut our pay plan. Moral plummeted and it became unbearable to work there. Our pay went down and our hours went from 10 hours a day to 14 hours a day or more.
good,"Management is not great some team leaders need a lot of work. Some team leaders don’t know what they are doing or just don’t care. Training is terrible and favoritism is big. Suck up and you will be good, I’m not the one. I go to work and do my job and then some."
good,"Start early, work hard moving product from warehouse to store shelves. Communicating with sales and managing personal. Operating 18 wheeler semi trucks to top name stores."
good,"The company has plans to off-shore all IT department to India and Poland. Which means, if you're looking to work for them, go to any area related to Marketing or Sales. IF you're planning to join the IT department, be prepared to live on a ""fear"" mode that  your job will be replaced soon."
good,"The IT department is pretty backward.  They are extremely rigid and are tightly tied to (very) old ways of doing things.  Most of the processes in place are so difficult to get things accomplished that many either give up or try to find an alternate route."
good,It is not very fun or productive.  No incentives or reward working here except for the company picnic and the company Christmas party.  But both are meetings that are catered.
good,"Es una empresa en la que obtienes como empleado mucho conocimiento y satisfacciones, el paquete de prestaciones es de los mejores del. Mercado, el sueldo que te ofrecen esta en el promedio, solo que la calidad y balance de vida es terrible,  y el crecer en la empresa depende en gran medida de tu networking más que en resultados y en tus ideas. Yo recomiendo trabajar ahí si aun estas soltero para iniciar tu carrera profesional por que definitivamente es una gran escuela."
good,Buena empresa aunque el horario es muy pesado
good,good paying job that needs to work on making the company more fun. Pepsi co needs to work on beating out the competition with competitive prices. The business plan needs to be reworked and the employees need to be treated and helped more.
good,"Hay un buen ambiente entre todos los compañeros, aprendes a tratas con gente diferentes y a conocer a las personas."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo que me tocó experimentar fue bueno, aunque el sueldo un poco bajo, las prestaciones fueron buenas aunque estuve muy poco tiempo."
good,"Its quiet, but stressful in a couple of ways. The first being we rarely talk to each other. The second being we have to constantly keep stocking the shelves."
good,"I worked here for 2 and a half years, the work was fine and hours were great. You’ll get all the money you looking For but when it comes to a good employee having a mishap they will throw you away as if you have never did good for the company with no hesitation."
good,I liked the job flexible hours decent pay but was let go for  reasons not true. my manager promised to cover a shift for me which he didn't and I got let go.
good,went better but it didn't beside co-worker problems it was a fun job and I loved working there. being put as a supervisor on the 2nd floor in the Pepsi Center was exciting. wish it was full time.
good,"the management played favoritism to some people,most of the managers were fair.the hardest part was watching people and certain people got overlooked.hardest part was dealing with various managers in various stores"
good,"The job pays well, but raises are ONLY given annually. There is alot of lifting, but as long as you are in shape it isn't a problem. For the most part, most of the problems occur when co-workers do poor jobs. The work is passed down the line to the person who is willing to do it. Because meetings are rare and you work alone, there is no accountability. You see another Pepsi employee once or twice a week, and your manager only once per month or so. This means lazy workers are rarely given any motivation to work hard, and often face up items rather than actually stocking them. You can start at any time before 6 am and typically get out by 2 pm, except on Fridays, Saturdays, and Holidays, which tend more towards 4 pm clock outs. Management is poor, under staffing is always a problem, and the corporate environment is cynical and patronizing. This job is of the same quality as the typical call center job, you're just trading your phone for a pallet jack."
good,Good place to start your career and get some experience in the business world. Learn from those around you who have tenure with in the company. Work towards a goal.
good,It was a good company to work for.  Although the hours were always different and usually fairly long the compensated you well for you're work.  The management at the company knew how to take care of there employees especially the ones who worked hard and represented the company well.  I would definitely work there again.
good,"Good place to work. Good management team, flexible schedule, good training class that last 3 month. Benefits are good, dental, 401k, insurance. Promotion within the company."
good,"Fue una experiencia positiva por el ambiente de trabajo, por las tareas y por el horario."
good,It was a fast paced environment with lots of job move ability. I learned a lot. Met a lot of good people. An excellent opportunity to understand the food based industry.
good,The service manager let's his best friend manage the technicians in the shop. The best friend just stands around and does nothing all day. The average pay for this department is $9 / hr and you put up with a lot of unnecessary drama.
good,No work like balance. A lot of overtime required for the role. Not flexible on pay. Reason for leaving was for better pay with similar company. Expect a lot of driving.
good,"Pepsi Manufacturing is a fast-paced environment that requires strong ""self-disciplined"" supervisors and managers.  You have great autonomy and are compensated well.  However, the company struggles with work/life balance; especially in regards to working off-shifts and long hours."
good,"A typical day working as Merchandiser at Pepsi"
good,"I thought it was a pretty decent job overall.  Was fairly enjoyable, everyone was pretty nice.  Don't really have much else to say, was a pretty good job."
good,"Aprendi en ventas, y con ello interactuar con la gente"
good,Empresa com bom pacote de benefício e certa estabilidade.
good,"Natural leader exemplifying excellent judgment under pressure and diffuses high-stress situations with ease. Enable a Safe, Reliable, Cost Advantaged Fleet."
good,Got to work with number of different type of people some worked well with others some didn’t even care if they screwed you over. Management was decent some managers cared for you but most didn’t care if you had helped and was taken care of
good,"PepsiCo is a great company to work for.  If you are not willing to be independent, hard-working, and willing to work for demanding management, PepsiCo is not the place for you."
good,go to different retail stores stocking pepsi products and ordering producs to refill shelves as we as taking into account any discounts that are going on and preparing stores for displays as wel as setting up and taking down displays for pepsi products.
good,"Long hours for commission pay. You get paid based on the amount of cases you deliver, it is all based on your salesman. You have zero control. Overtime is paid in a messed up way"
good,les journees se passent bien et ne sont pas longues j'ai appris plusieurs nouveaux astuces du marchandisage moderne
good,"This is a great place to work, but as of lately there is too much job cuts due to restructuring. Compensation is average. But work/life balance and other perks are great."
good,Plenty of opportunities to further educate yourself and advance your career. Promotions from within. Great benefits. My job gave me plenty of opportunities to work with many people around the country.
good,"very relaxing, No tension. Very lovely people, very accomodative. Thinking of quality in everything. The management was very understanding and not putting pressure"
good,"It's not a bad place to work, there are a decent amount of ""perks"" and they will at least try to help out when the hours get long, you don't have to drive your own car"
good,"Culture takes time to acclimate to; I loved the development culture and people focus.  There are very talented HR/OD people, though it is a bit research heavy and PhD biased."
good,Drove around stocked freight all day.  Pretty easy work. Good management.  Don't let Pepsi keep you at part time if your working full-time hours an have been there long enough to be full time.  Word to the wise.
good,"Pepsi is a very demanding, fast paced environment. Managers are focused on one thing and one thing only, selling more Pepsi. This includes maintaining more floor presence than the competition. Hours are long and overtime is mandatory. The overall attitude could be summarized as ""Whatever it takes to sell more Pepsi products."""
good,The biggest thing to know is that the smaller the location the more every manager has put on their plate. It's a great way to get a lot of experience but it is a ton of work.
good,"each day i would check the flavour and size sheets to see what we would be making then i would do hour checks on the product being made hourly to make sure colors, taste, smell and other specs were all in proper ranges,  all while keeping area clean of falling cans and spilled pop off floor and other part  of machine"
good,divertido con buen ambiente laboral y gran desarrollo
good,It’s a very stressful job but I like me customers. It’s fairly easy I just want to improve my career and move up the latter and make better money for my family.
good,A typical day at work. Was fast paced repetitive labor. That consisted of a DPS system and heavy equipment. I learned a lot about soda pop as I do not drink it. The management was poorly managed and lacking in communication. The culture was that of any other warehouse. The hardest part of the job was the hours away from the home. The most enjoyable part of the job was the physical labor.
good,not honest very hard work was told if I did everything right and didn't get no write ups I could move up. kept my nose clean for the time I was there!
good,Learned a lot of information unique to my roll. We worked together as a team always. Coworkers were always willing to share details specific to locations.
good,started out as a packer for pepsi co and was moved to data entry. filing and organizing paperwork for them and setting up new binders for them for the next few months.
good,mornig job very fast pace allow to work up to 60 hrs a week hard labor must be able to lift a mini of 25lbs a day interact with the people drive all over the local city have to merch some of your stops

good,"I was on swing shifts, I was on the 3 day work 4 day off and vice-a-versa to start  I enjoyed the position until another company started bidding on the contract and then it got a little hectic other wise quite a nice position to work close to home and convenient."
good,"- requires getting up VERY early to meet all the needs of customers "
good,"Productive, stressful, challenging, everyday is different, low worker self esteem, not happy at end, no seniority if you've been there 20 years doesn't matter because your as equal as a new employee that just started"
good,Dealing with co-workers and management lack of work. Really Pepsi-Co is the ideal job but management is stuck of this salary and hourly platform. What you make should dictate how you treat people but it is fact. Having a company with lazy veterans is an bummer. Just be all you can be all the time. Work is always easy when doing it together. Meaning day and night shift should be continuous work and not just for inspections.
good,"Decent place to work. Route sales hours typically from 3am until 1-2,Pm. Mandatory 50 hrs. per week to obtain your full salary. No weekends off .Pay is good if you have been there at  least 1 year."
good,Pepsico was a great company to work for until they had opened a new production facility and change had happen. Good and Bad. It was the beginning of something new and they lost some good workers because of the change
good,"Great campus with great benefits"
good,"good, fast paced,hard work. hayward cailifornia . whta are you doing tommorrow because this sucks doing a job summary.paid weekly, good benifits,paid time off."
good,aveces es complicado trabajar por las rutas que uno toma pero en general buen ambiente de trabajo
good,it was easy fast paced job we did alot in a short amount of time and customers were satisfied. it was repetitive and easy to catch on even for someone with no experience
good,"Will restructure every few years and only care about seniority, not merit. Long hours and blackout periods for vacation. Mandatory 6 day weeks common."
good,Was worked to the bone. Expected to work long hours alone with minimal support. Heavy loads and strenuous work all guaranteed that you will go home tired and sore.
good,"Being a Merchandiser  for Pepsi was an interesting experience.  From learning how to build pallets for distribution to many stores, to breaking down pallets for store selves and floor displays."
good,"Way too many Hours, not great for a Family and children.  Single perfect job.  The benefits are great, They need to give people more options for time off.  Employees who stay a long time need more incentive to stay, a pay increase would be good or more time off."
good,"Es una buena empresa, lo malo que no hay crecimiento"
good,It was alright. a little to much politics and consumption of power and control with favorites. It's a good job for those who have been there for over fifteen years.
good,"Pay is not very good."
good,Pepsico is a good company to work for.  A typical 10-12 hour work day was common although work was hard. A good place to work at and with good people.
good,Driver forklift and be ready for long day. How to adjust to everyday problems. Listen but slow to react. Very diverse.Working doing summer.When finally got off.
good,You work hard for every dollar that you make. For it to be such a huge company it is poorly managed. They all have their favorites and that's whom gets the easier routes and more hours.
good,"Good starter job, but not for long term employment. Your first week, you will be doing nothing but cleaning around the building.  After that, you will start working."
good,"I just worked for this company for a short time."
good,"Its been almost 10 years, I don't really remember much of the job. However I did like having my own schedule, driving a truck around and filling up shelfs. It is purely a physical demanding job."
good,It is a hard job. Long hours for less pay. They don't take care of their employees like they used too.  Money is going down and workload going up. They make up sales numbers as they wish.If a WaWa opens around you they don't adjust your sales plan for the stores that are within five miles of that store like they should.
good,"This job was very physically demanding that provided plenty of work, which resulting in regular overtime pay. Although, the job was mostly independent and required limited supervision, I encountered and worked with many coworkers who were usually very helpful and generally had good attitudes. Unfortunately, there was too much miscommunication, which resulted in the account merchandisers having to work more and harder than necessary. Another challenge was dealing with receiving managers at various vendors, many of which were difficult to deal, however this was not by means a result of poor management on Pepsi-Co's behalf."
good,Nice place to work. Directive and works well. GOod team environment but alot of pressure in terms of delivering results which leads to long working hours
good,The culture is good.  The demand is great.  I learned a lot about cyber securing and the impact to the food and services industry.  The hardest part of the job is learning all the different DLP strategies and techniques.
good,"Trainings and Workshops "
good,Un trabajo a mi punto de vista ideal para estudiantes.
good,overall a good company to work for. you are mostly on your own whe you have a route . the more you sell the more you make. only con the communication could be better
good,"Hard work on a daily basis, with little incentive in becoming a full time position.  Did work with some amazing coworkers who worked extremely hard. I loved working hard."
good,"muy bueno, todos son responsables, me agrada su sistema"
good,"Fun and worthwhile job experience, time management is the biggest hurdle to cross, but once that’s over with, you start to develop a routine and things become much easier."
good,"pepsico is a good company if you are really looking for advancement in the world of either soft drinks or salty snacks.  If you really want to focus on a job that is DSD based and that is a decent career, then this job is for you."
good,"Worked there three and a half years, and I ended up making less money overall than I did one year into the job. Was given a route on the opposite end of town from where I lived so that I wouldn't get mileage, even though I had routes close to me and I had seniority."
good,"Clock in, Do all handy stuff like loading and unloading, picking and that's really it, you're timed though so you gotta be abnormally fast.  it's a demanding job.  The pay is worth it but it's not really a good place to stay longterm."
good,"Poor communication with staff."
good,It was a great opportunity and gave me a chance to utilize my experience. I was allowed to use my creativity to build displays for store advertisement.
good,Poor management in leadership roles. No work/life balance at all. Salary was not up to par when compared to similar jobs in the industry. Employees were not always recognized for their hard work and efforts.
good,As always pepsico is a great company. I had fun working for them it was one of the greatest part time job i had. It was a great experience hopefully they'll hire me back to be full time cause i might apply again.
good,"Es una empresa que parece tu casa, donde te recuerdan los principios y valores que debemos tener, ademas ayudan con cursos para tu superación personal"
good,"This job is suggestible if you have kids or have no life."
good,decent work place. i really enjoyed working at this warehouse. pepsi had good employees. the pay was okay but could be better. not enough for single mom to survuve.
good,The appointment was too short to accomplish anything in the large scheme of things. There was miscommunication with management as there was a large amount of positive feedback which accumulated to an overall idea that the expectations weren't being met. Communication with management can be improved.
good,"Es una muy buena empresa para hacer escuela de multinacionales, te enseñan a trabajar."
good,Bon salaire et bons avantages mais demande beaucoups d'heures de travail et peut devenir très stressant et épuisant.
good,"My work at Pepsi was for a summer job. VERY long hours and hard work.  The pay was good.  Computer voice instructions through headphones to fill orders were less than clear.  Inventory not always in same place.  Warehouse too small for the amount of product, made it sometimes difficult to be efficient."
good,The work day starts a 4 am on any given route and you will deliver to 22 to 28 stops until you are finished.Any given day can be a 12 to 14 hour day depending on the route.With assistance you can finish in about 10 hours.Hydration is the key to maintaining a strong day.
good,started early with a loaded truck and delivered drinks to several locations over an hour to the first stop. hard work. hot in summer. cold in winter..
good,start at 4am every day and work till the job is done ussually around 3pm without a lunch. day could be longer if others havent finished their work overall a dull job
good,It is still a good opportunity for anyone who wants to work in the consumer industry.  People don't leave jobs because of the company they leave them because of managers and employee relationships or lack there of.
good,"worked very early mornings, stressful in the large format sales environment. manual labor involved and putting in orders while in freezers. Some days were easier than others."
good,I was able to provide well for my family and be home nightly with my family. I also got two weeks vacation while working for Pepsi. I was also able to get Pepsi products at cost.
good,"PepsiCo is good at getting products on shelf through all channels, and executing traditional marketing programs. Overall, it's a fun place to work with a lot of talented people. Management gets in their way with too much process and short-term thinking."
good,"Apesar de empresa multinacional, funcionários não fazem plano de carreira."
good,Buenas personas. Coordinadores correctos. Excelente salario.
good,You must be willing to put all youve got into this job to be succesful. Your days are long and its hard on your body. co-workers are amazing at this location.
good,Ive worked here for only 1 month but ive seen that the company don't approved college graduates and pwd to worked in any company because of liability and im pretty dissapointed but inspite of that they have might been a good and productive company also to work as an Encoder...
good,Pepsico is great as far as benefits and pay. The work/life balance is terrible. They have highs and lows as far as number of hours worked. This is a plant so you're going to have a mix crowd. It's best to stay to yourself and not get caught up in the plant life. Work hard and don't follow the leader. The management will recognize that you are a hard worker and will give less of a hard time.
good,"This job can be stressful at times, but overall it isnt a bad job at all,the manager over the merchandisers is one of the best managers i have ever had."
good,"Enjoyable and fulfilling since management is very supportive of all your initiatives."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo comedor en planta y trasporte incluido
good,"If you have no type of life and no kids, and all you care about is money; this job is for you! I mean I was promoted from a supply chain to a workflow coordinator. It was cool for a minute until you’re behind on couple of work orders but overall it’s cool I guess."
good,Pepsi had a good work environment that offered flexible hours. Job responsibilities include performing weekly analysis on financial statement accounts and month-end journal entries.
good,It is fun working in this company but suddenly my schedule is not good for me because I want a regular job ..My coworkers are nice and fun to minggle with them
good,It was a great place to work for a CDL driver just starting it is get them they experience they need as the learn the business and learning how to drive a tractor-trailer
good,Great pay for job level. Limited advancement/ training opprotunities. Relax office setting combined with micromanagement through out the processes completed on a regular basis
good,horrible management. they don't care about the wellbeing's of there employees. with the amount of work being done with the company they don't care if you are doing your job right its about inside friendships
good,"Fast paced, The pay was ok. Being a truck driver there isn't really any room for advancement in the company. They worked on something called Chinese over time which is one of the reasons i left"
good,"Muito trabalho, pouco reconhecimento, não existe folga"
good,"ambiente de trabajo comodo, buena experiencia buen equipo"
good,Trabajo con muy buenas formas de trato hacia el empleado
good,Long days for little pay. More pay would have made this worth it.  Good people to work for. Advancement was pretty easy but short lived.  Not enough time off.
good,"Nice company to work for.  Great people there to work with, I really enjoyed my time there and would recommend them to anyone.  Only downside was the location."
good,"I work on various different project in one day. I develop data visulization dashboard, attend meetings and support server. It's a nice company to work for because of work life balance."
good,Rough work life balance. Very stressful environment. Good benefits though. Paid time off as well as holidays. Management differs. Can be cut throat. They expect too much.
good,The pay was ok but the job was a lot of work and long hours.  I did not always know where I was working from week to week because I was a sub.  Trainer was a jerk.
good,"Pepsico is a good employer and goes out of their way to take care of the employees. The hours can be long and vary throughout the day, but they treat you well and like family, the benefits are good, pay is good, and advancement is likely."
good,Great job for opportunities to advance. A typical day involved non stop work . Management was good .The hardest part of the job was having your pallet in the correct order.The most enjoyable part was being rewarded for your achievements.
good,I enjoyed the time I worked at pepsi it was fast paced and a good learning experience I took some one else place while they where out on work relieve.
good,"se produce mucho polvo por la condimentacion"
good,Provided opportunity to learn and comprehend complete business acumen from an end-to-end supply chain perspective while acquiring and adopting skills for success in management.
good,"The management is excellent. Although the salary is not that high in which i understand for us working in province ( ZAMBOANGA PLANT), nonetheless, the GM and the Managers in different departments worked hand in hand for the benefits of the company."
good,"Even when I had doctor set restrictions, they ignored them and made me do all the same tasks. You are just a number there and the main boss is a dictator."
good,Hard work Very demanding company Learned Routing and direct store distribution. Competive work enviroment with a average turnover. Physical Delivering to stores.
good,"Es una empresa con un buen ambiente laboral, y con oportunidades para crecimiento."
good,"The pay was decent as a seasonal worker.  The lure of full time employment, benefits and few more dollars was always a carrot that dangled in the mind of seasonal workers.  You earn every dollar you get."
good,Don't feel like writing much. Just know if you were liked then you were promoted. Long hours. Met a lot of cool people though. Cool thing is nobody is breathing down your back all the time.
good,"Every moment at Pepsi is a working moment. There is no such thing as a boring day. Be prepared to work the second your feet touch the ground."
good,"Daily Report Generation. "
good,ambiente algo estresante los compañeros suelen trabajar en equipo
good,"PepsiCo did not pay that well, however, it was a good work environment. I enjoyed working with the people there. They made it a lot of fun. I would recommend working for PepsiCo, but not for long term."
good,"Nice people . Benefits could be better. HR could be consistent. "
good,"Ir is a good place to gain experience. With all of the things that happen throughout a day as a warehouse supervisor, you learn how to handle all kinds of situations"
good,"Long work days, heavy lifting, great benefits. Good job to have but to make a career out of.  Learn about advertisement. 10-12 hour work days. Work no matter the weather, good or bad."
good,"PepsiCo is in transition phase where the old and new worlds collide on a daily basis.  The environment is fast-paced and stressful."
good,"If your looking for experience in driving, then I would go for it. There is career advancement. The environment can just be so toxic."
good,"Increase sales on customer representative route. "
good,It was a great place to work.  I loved all of my associates and they tried to make the amount of work the five man crew in the warehouse worked worth it       It came down to them consolidating locations to create one big facility as the reason I left
good,"Regional Acct. Management, Large Format Distribution, National Acct.'s & Business Planning. Long Hours, Career Advancement Opportunities if mobile. Utilize the strength of Brand Equity to further your sales & management skills and career path."
good,"It was a better company about 5 years ago. Things have gone downhill since. Poor Management and Management decisions. Overall good company to work for, great benefits and options to advance, if you so choose."
good,"y good atmosphere of working culture and work life balance."
good,"un dia tipico de trabajo, no es complicado ya que estaba en un solo lugar fijo en la tienda estaba en autoservicio"
good,"I was an account manager in charge of 8 or 9 stores. "
good,"While I felt that PepsiCo was a good overall company to work for, I felt that attempting to advance in some areas were extremely difficult. It seemed increasingly difficult to move from being a general merchandising representative. I attempted to move into different positions as soon as I could for advancement and was never given concrete information on how."
good,very demanding and labor intensive job. Had to cover shifts of other employees who called off or did not want to come in. Have to hit very demanding sales figures.

good,"enjoy working in pepsi-cola."
good,pepsi is a good job.. they pay pretty good but the work is super labor intestive.. and the long hours are terrible if you want a family.. the money is there but the comision sucks
good,"Very fast paced business. Great for people who just need to make fast money. Great pay ,long hours. Loved working with all different types of people made a lot of friends thru out my time there."
good,I would go back and work for them. It’s a great company to work for. They have two warehouses. One as the plant & the other as the actual warehouse. Great hours and pay.
good,"I enjoyed working in the plant, mechanics are friendly people, you need to know what is going on or be prepared for the unexpected or the production line will go down and it needs to come up with highs of pressure."
good,"Wasn't there long enough to fully understand the culture, but it was somewhat slower than how Coca Cola ran there operation. management definitely could have been better in a number of ways."
good,fist experience in pepsi cola multan as a sales officer .i have achieve b brand compittion  award in 2004.the culture of this company is very risky. no job security .

good,"Ambiente de trabajo normal, falta de crecimiento y estabilidad econòmica"

good,Pepsi was a great place to work. The culture was family oriented and had a professional structure. The company was small but had great dedicated employees.

good,"My area of work is quite different that other jobs in the company. I heard that some areas are quite strenuious and stressful. I enjoyed what i did and who I worked with.  My problem was my supervisor promised me a big bump in my pay if I preformed my job as expected. After a review, he was extremely pleased with my job performance Absolutely nothing negative to say. The pay raise did not happen as promised. After much negotiation, nothing happened. I left to get the pay from another company"
good,"You will learn plenty at this job. Challenging, educational, provides numerous opportunities You will meet many different people while on the road. Great!"
good,"Very Stressful and strenuous job. You have immediate supervisors however, direction can come from a variety of personal.  Instructions, demands, and request may come from your immediate supervisor, Key Account Managers, customers you service, Market Directors, and more.  Feels like you have 8 supervisors all with different motives and/or direction.  Marketing and Sales departments are on different pages which greatly impacts ones ability to perform and the stress of the position.  In order to succeed in this role you'll need to be excellent at prioritizing and be willing to sacrifice work/life balance to 80%work 20%personal."

good,"Vote in a union whenever you get the chance,  The company is an Ok company, but there are things that having someone to represent and fight for you will come in handy, Trust me"
good,I enjoyed the people and the actual fast pace job.  Appreciated the union based job with get benefits. Picking and packing was hard but I was committed to making production
good,You only get maybe 36 hrs of off time the weekend then working 60 plus hrs a week not enough time to rest your body train one day then your on your own then they expect you to pick 200 cases per hr everyday if u want to hit your number I hope they find some kind of resolution on the down time for selectors  beware there is a extremely high turnover.
good,"Working for Pepsi is very stressful it's a fast environment. they pull you on a million directions. They do not have a plan A or B, you need to improvise a lot"

good,there are different positions in the warehouse that are great for advancement within the business and others not so much with alot of who ilike more tha  who can get the job done advancement oppourtunity's going on
good,"Place is designed to fail and does over and over. Hire Shift Supervisors right out of college, might have Engineering Degrees but are useless with no leadership skills. Plants been here since 1992 and it always feels like it's the first year over and over. Should have moved on years ago. Medical Plan is worse than Medicare Doctors dropping it. Too much out of pocket cost and they keep cutting overtime to make things worse."
good,Quick paced and challenging environment.  Dealing with customers everyday. Potential long hours.  Weather conditions constantly changes creates hazards.
good,Pepsico was a fair place to work at with good management and great Summer hours. Winter hours dwindle and the pay decreases. It's necessary to allot money earned in the Summers to allow for adequate Winter income.
good,"my sales manager was ok. but, when it came to what the stores wanted it was hands down up to them. if you can deal with someone telling you what to do all the time in an account that you're not even employed by then, this is the job for you. if not, then i advise you to stay away. you boss is always on their side and it's up to them Not!!! you. lose, lose every time for you. My boss acted like he had my back when he really didnt."
good,"pallet build,short breaks. pay was ok. fast pace,sweat and lose a lot of weight. managment was poor. co workers were pretty cool. point system is set up to keep you in the warehouse."
good,Be prepared to work your butt off. The most enjoyable part of the job would be listening to your music on the job and somewhat keeping to yourself throughout the day.
good,"Worked for Pepsi a long long time ago. Good company, Worked long hours and required to drive all day. You run a territory and make sure all stores are stocked."
good,"It is a franchise of international company the pepsiCo. It is the largest plant in the philippines with 1 canning line, 6 returnable glass bottles, 4 pet lines, 1 powder line , 1 bag in box line and 6 nlowing plant. "
good,"I have worked for this project, hence this is not part of my organization but they are our client"
good,It is a good first time job. I just feel like I do not get challenge like I wish to. It does not help me achieve my goals in life. She something to keep you on your feet.
good,Good company good benefits. Long hours pay was OK but below other companies doing the same job. I only left because there were no permanent positions available.
good,"The job overall wasn't bad and the people were pretty fun to work with. There is a major buddy system there and they've already picked who they want for a promotion prior, so internal interviews are just for show, so you can feel it when being interviewed. Luckily, it was just a filler job for me."
good,The day began depending upon work load of the day and completed when all customers were satisfied. All team members would help each other to complete the work.
good,"Fun place to work"
good,The office was a nice place to work.  The atmosphere is relaxed and I enjoyed working with my coworkers.  I enjoyed the job being close to home.  I would recommend this place of employment to everyone.  This was more like a family.
good,"Learned a lot about the business, started on production line and went into sales then sales management and then into operations, learned lot from several managers."
good,"A typical day at work was making outgoing phone calls to the accounts that were assigned to me to take the product orders for the week. Always had to try and sell another product that they did not have."
good,Overall PepsiCo is a decent place to work. The conditions aren't always favorable. Benefits are excellent. Management has some room for improvement at the local level.
good,I got hired as seasonal part time but stayed on as full time. The job itself isn't hard but it does give a lot of independence. This location is very unorganized.
good,This a fast paced employer and it's all about sales and meeting sales goals.  Not a good place for someone who not good in sales or lack of customer service skills.
good,No complains abouit the job . Salary is good. The only issue that my family got is that I work for 7 days a week as this is my part time job that requires me to work on weekdays and holidays.
good,"Know buddy lets and body know anything you have to do it your self and hope its all right to many people think there Bosses, it was a union shop on the inside and non union on the outside not fair"
good,"pick your route, most routes have 10-15 stops. unload product off truck, transport it into the stores, double check to ensure it all is correct, collect payment and returns if needed, head back to your to end your day."
good,"everyday challenges,operate,trouble shoot,maintain and service machines,daily quality checks,sanitize on a weekly basis,able to work well with others and leadership skills"
good,PepsiCo is a pretty good company to work for it helps builds up your skills in the work experience field. PepsiCo have help me out to figure out my work skills.
good,"No training, low paw for all the constant heavy lifting and there is very bad communication from management most times. The benefits are great ,but the work environment is typical of warehouse and retail combined."
good,"The workload is incredibly high, working nearly 55 hours a week while only working a four day week. There is a massive division between salesmen and the merchandiser constantly blaming each other for issues on the routes while not handling their own responsibilities. Management does much of the same."
good,At Pepsi i was trained on forklift operations. Loading trucks with production team. Stacking pallets with soda wrapping and making sure the product was secure to be loaded. The staff and management was very fair. The work culture was very much on the move at all times. The most challenging part was making sure product was never damaged.
good,It was a decent work place to work in kind of a quiet place but the work was reasonable for an 8hr job and I learned how to organize the items as told
good,"It has good job security,because there's allways work that needs to be done. the work can be very hands on and tiring. The work can go all the way up to 16 hours a day."
good,"Administrative Coordinator/Editorial Assistant (contract assignments at following:"
good,"Performed administrative functions for VP, Product Development and direct reports; maintain multiple calendars, travel arrangements, prepare T&E reports, maintain competitive database, mail & phone coverage, ordered office and computer supplies, processed invoices, coordinate numerous off-site meetings and conferences, including worldwide Technical Operations “Innovation Expo;” "
good,"This company is not all bad. However, Its not all good. It's very physical labor. Management is not so bad.The pay is decent, however, the compensation does not match the expectations."
good,PepsiCo has lost some of its focus. I have worked there 10 years and in the  beginning and the last few years we've taken pay cuts or no raises but company re-structure has put more pressure and responsibility on workers for less pay.
good,"I was a contractual employees in PepsiCo. The internal management in PepsiCo is good, however the employee policies needs to be updated by HR. It was ok to work there."
good,"Great company to work for.  "
good,Pepsi requires cars on call basis for checking there product samples from various cities and markets. They have to travels too much and nothing is planned no time for return
good,The pay is somewhat competitive. The opportunities for advancement between levels are very poor and the recognition of accomplishments by managers is weak. Benefits are good. The employees are what makes my job enjoyable.
good,"I had spent only 6 months, so can't comments more. I used to travel a lot in this job. Worked at small towns of MP. Deals with great well known consumer brands."
good,Pepsi is a very large company however the supervisors try and make the job seem more like a family. The pay is very good. The job is bad. It is however a lot of work and an individual must be physically fit in order to be able to perform the job as it is expected to be done.
good,"This is a large business that involves long hours.  Co-workers generally help everyone and work well as a team.  Availability to move up, especially if you want to relocate."
good,"Login.Work. Break. Work. Lunch. Work. Break. Work. Logout."
good,"healthy knowledge can be gained in overall fields cross field knowledge and other overall good experience working in pepsico."
good,"Good company to work for Overall"
good,"Secure employment with room for advancement. Excellent opportunity to get a class A CDL while getting paid to get trained to drive a tractor trailer. Fun, fast paced job where you meet a lot of people while frequenting many stops."
good,"	Apoiei aos processos de expatriação, principalmente o da diretora da Argentina, atuando na intermediação junto à empresa especializada para viabilização de documentação, moradia e estadia no país para o expatriado e família."
good,"They kind of make up the rules as they go.  Other than that, ok place to work.  Very hot in the production area, but a lot of management constantly questioning everything."
good,"I am employed with HP and its was my client site.However the working enviorment was reallly good.The client was really helpful and supportive."
good,Long hours working weekends normally 4 days on with 3 days off all depending on position but everyone will work weekends no matter your position. Union
good,"Fun workplace."
good,"Management for small format was not that great, no real training, tour routes are stressful, comm was good but working hours were long and sometimes worked on weekends"
good,"Product does not have demand in market."
good,"There is no typical day, the company operates in an unbelievably competitive industry and moves at a lightning pace.  You will always be challenged to do more with less - that's the nature of business so get used to it.  Some weeks can be very rewarding while others will have you wondering how you will ever get it all done.  The company touts a work-life balance but it is non-existent the higher you go and because they don't leverage their existing technology to its full potential, the travel can get to be downright unbearable at times.  However, if you keep your nose clean and work your tail off, you can succeed and advance while earning a decent income with great benefits.  The CEO is politically motivated which can be a detriment if you don't agree with her politics, but some people can look past that in favor of their close colleagues."
good,"Working at Pepsi was a pretty fun experience . Working here you would stock merchandise of Pepsi-Cola products , fill coolers with product and condense backstock of product."
good,"working at Pepsi Bottling New York is a great stepping stone in a career in sales. You get to understand the importance of building relationships in the field, as well as importance in understanding your demographics in your said territories."
good,"A decent place to work if you are in the core departments (sales, marketing, food services etc.). It can be brutal sometimes when it comes to ""cost reductions"". Overall, if you are in the right stream, it is probrably a reasonable place to work. Maybe a bit too much is asked of in terms of ""volunteering"" in an effort to be a ""community responsible"" organization."
good,worked with good people and only had one supervisor. I just stocked shelves after school and turned in my time at the end of the week. Did not have much interaction with anymore employees except my supervisor.
good,Good place to work at while i was younger. Would normally have about 5 grocery stores to stock in the early morning and would get them all done around noon. Then came back towards of the end of the afternoon to restock what was needed at various stores and vending machines.
good,Not really employee oriented. Very restricting and not very good for advancement. It's all about the bottom line. Moral seems to be an issue. A lot of management is either related or very close.
good,ok job just long hours and hard work u have to be in a good mind and ext.. u also get to buy drinks for a 25 cents other than getting it from the store foe 1.50
good,no tuve mucho tiempo de trabajo . aunque me agradaban sus galletas y atender alos clientes
good,"Mas incentivos, mejores beneficios, posibilidad de tener carrera dentro."
good,You work for five days out of the seven days for about 14 to 15 hours. It doesn't leave much time for your personal activities because work generally starts at 5 in the morning.
good,"Working for Pepsi Beverages Company/PBC is a great way to learn the sales field. Typically work 10 or more work hour days if full committed to sell. I learned a lot about Business to Business sales and how to utilizes gross profit numbers to do local sell ins. My co-workers in the plant are all great people, knowledgeable and help train each other up to greatness."
good,"PepsiCo has some great potential for those who are wanting to move anywhere in the world to chase your dreams!  While the growth potential can appear to be staggering in certain markets it can be tough, with lots of competition to challenge yourself.  A typical work day could be labeled as working with great people who are talented at what they do.  I've enjoyed the people I've worked with and you can really feel the work life balance focus of the company for most positions."
good,"Obtained CDL while working at Pepsi. Worked as a service technician for 6 years, full service vending route for 3 years and route driver for year. Local job with salary and commission."
good,"good job room for advancement and career growth I. Great benefits the work life balance is bad because of the long hours to be worked, not enough people to cover territory can be bad on other co workers"
good,El área de administración de ventas en esta empresa es muy importante ya que aprendes muchas cosas y aprendes lo que en verdad es trabajar bajo presión.
good,Me desempeñe bien en el area km ah tocado trabajar
good,"Aprendes a trabajar por objetivos y a administrar tu tiempo, tienes que ser responsable pues manejas el efectivo e inventario diariamente, por otro lado el trabajo consume mucho tiempo diariamente y en ocasiones no es remunerado de manera equivalente"
good,the job is fine but it is to much driving a car should be furnished and merchandisers should get commission and also the need to try and keep your route closer to were you live.
good,"Pepsi Bottling Group was a good place to work, unfortunately now they are out of business. They offered good pay and benefit. Hours were good as well."
good,"Trabalhei em uma linha de produção, é uma empresa boa para trabalhar."

good,"I have learnt a lot during this time of Job period."
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, muita burocracia para entrar, mas a política da empresa é boa."
good,To much hard work and not enough people to help you out on a daily basis. Management not efficient in managing routes with individuals
good,Long hours and not enough pay. Union doesn't help the merchandisers here at all its all favoritism and hard to get moved up.
good,"aprendi a empacar,  revisar, agilidad , responsabilidad y tener bun buen ambiente laborar con mis compañeros de trabajo"
good,"i learnt many things over there"
good,"La principal función del cargo es supervisar y coordinar la correcta entrega de productos a transportes, para un despacho oportuno de los mismos."
good,Management is understanding and try there best to make your work day move as smooth as possible.  However the way the business is run it is hard for the newer employees due to layoffs which is not good for people with responsibilities.
good,I worked this for a while it was an early on early off job. I like that. Had a regular route and hot to know my customers. Other vendors at times made my job difficult.
good,The only thing to leave this i am away from home and never found satisfaction that why i came back to home i am elder in my home and home responsibilities also came on my shoulder thats why i came back to home.
good,For those seeking a large company and office environment PepsiCo would fit your needs.  The company is located in a nice area and the building is big and clean with nice fixtures which makes for a comfortable work atmosphere.
good,"Bem agitado, corrido e produtividade sempre."
good,"Great portfolio of products."
good,I worked there as assistant engineering technician but i worked under contract am not direct staff of pepsico .hey hired me from labour supply company
good,"From the time you arrive at work in the morning, you are on the go. Employees are preparing orders to be placed on different trucks fro delivery to the customers."
good,"1. I worked in pepsi monday to friday at 8:30 to 5:30. "

good,"busy never ran out of work "
good,"A traditional company pushing to evolve and to catch up to the standards of a modern company."
good,"Pepsi is a productive fun and fast paced workplace, i very much enjoyed workin there, my co workers were very nice and helpful. I enjoyed helping out the customers find there beverages"
good,"starting off you make a decent living if you have no kids, and no responsibilities. One week vacation."
good,"though is a decent well paying job, working for this company is a very high demanding job and takes up alot of ur time of the day."
good,well its an easy job for almost anyone to get. pay is ok at best. just another job. nothing really exciting goes on. no one really likes it though.
good,"PES is a high volume call center, you'll have knowledge on microsoft word, excell, and other programs. very steady paced environment."
good,"A typical day at work would be Servicing Equipment, repairs on equipment, installation of equipment. Pickup and Delivery of company merchandise."
good,"most of the time i am in field generating orders from the customer and collections at the same time, visiting them to know what exactly they need and to know what is their concern how to improved our business relation, my job is very challenging in the sense that we cannot avoid lapses sometimes most especially with the service level that we are providing with the customer perhaps of the number of the customer i've been handling but we do our very best to serve and satisfy their needs as much as we can, i am enjoying meeting new people and handling different kind of attitude and on how to interact and address their concerns in a nice manner and a positive way."
good,"Fun place to be as an intern, great group of people, but it seemed a lot less scientific at times and a lot of trial by error. Pretty impressive pilot plant facility, but it was hard to get time on the equipment because other facilities would send engineers to use them for other projects."
good,"This is a huge Fortune 50 organization of which is great to be apart of, but discovered very quickly that you are just simply an employee number.  I gave this organization 200% for over ten years and put my career first, missing out on a lot of family time - memories with my daughter.  "
good,Era un buen trabajo el problema es que me quedaba muy lejos buenos compañeros horarios flexibles
good,Job security however not a good work/life balance with low salary compensation for work expectation. You're expected to learn all task including management on your own.
good,Management is good work with you to help if there is a problem. co workers are always there to helpful. I have learned how to be more productive. A typical day is busy.
good,"working at pepsi was uneventful. every day was the same thing as the one before. however, with that being said, it was not bad either"
good,"The job is easy. Your never around your boss. They let you do what you got to do without micro managing you. Also, they give you the tools to move up in the company if you show that you want to."
good,Good and fun place to work. Long hours and lots of works. Other employees are close knit and fun to work with. Compensation and benefits are good.
good,There are many positions at the company. I started as a warehouse accociate and was hired for a inventory coordinater position.
good,"expect long hours, hard work in extreme heat or extreme cold, day or overnight, good benefits and compensation, uses software to track efficiency of employees"
good,"I have experience for 7 years in one of the big company's in the world"
good,A typical day consists of merchandising a select few accounts and writing orders for accounts as well.  Negotiating with store personnel and implementing promotional materials as well.
good,"uma boa empresa, mas pouco cuidado com bem estar do funcionário , relativo com tempo a sua família."
good,Typical day servicing between 5 to 6 large grocery stores with the Pepsi product. Cleaning the back room and sorting all left over product. enjoyable part was that I was out on my route alone with no supervision.
good,I was doing good when I got there then they had me doing things that I was never trained on temp put me in a blind spot cause to Pepsi I  was there filling in a mans spot then they got me away so I really never got the time to enjoy my job like I did when I first came in.
good,Decent pay but a management is not involved in developing career growth for its employees. I imagine larger branches provide more room for growth and opportunities for advancement
good,Its only for productive based company.We can expect much like MNC's.  But we can learn more thing here to enhance our skills. Overall its a good company.
good,Pepsi Beverage Company is a good place to work. My coworkers in the warehouse were fun and  very team oriented individuals. We even went out outside of work and partied a few times.
good,If you load cases for Pepsi at a large facility by a large city you may be working 14 hours a day during the 100 days of summer.if you want 65 hour a week paychecks and constantly sore muscles and carpletunal then be a loader ;-)1k a week helps make it all worth it for not going to college
good,San Francisco is a tough place to sell beverage products due to wholesalers selling same product for  cheaper. Most enjoyable part of my job is to be outdoors majority of the day.
good,good place to work. always on the go.plenty of work to be done everyday. just not enough time to enjoy it once i left for the oil field
good,I do not wish to review.  Indeed has this as a requirements so I must write at least 20 characters to proceed.  I don't wish to have my reviews made public.
good,Muy buen ARA de trabajo muy bien trabajar para la pepsi porque te tratan adecuadamente
good,Good job to get experience in merchandizing. Have to have great people skills and work in different places. Willing to work 10 shifts and on weekends and holidays.
good,"Good pay but physical work. High expectations for employees with number system, very unreliable system. Good benefits. Picking and loading cases into trailers or accumulation. Lots of standing up forklift driving around warehouse for grabbing pallets with boxes of chips."
good,Highly competitive business trying to gain additional selling space for your products. Constantly trying to gain an advantage over the other beverage companies meant constantly being in the stores talking with the grocerey managers.
good,Good place to work. Family oriented place to work with good people who care about you. Lots of team building activities such as bowling and dining at great restaurants at the end of each quarter
good,es buen ambiente laboral tienes apoyo de las diferentes áreas
good,Buen trabajo en general competente a la hora de rotar al personal
good,"They are a very busy and fast moving environment which is fine. But, they take advantage of their Temp to Permanent employees in ways that i feel are not fair. I would be given the worst forklift to operate eventhough it would shutoff on a regular basis and it should not have been on the floor. Then blamed me when I would have a spill or they would acuse me of being to slow even though it continued to shutoff on me throughout my shift and i notified my supervisor and maintenance and they did nothing to resolve my issues.There is no timetable to being hired permanently (90 or 120 days in most places), they do not notify you of your future work schedule for the following week (rotator) until 1 hour prior to your end of the week. They force you to stay up to 4 hours on any given day or shift with only short notice."
good,"llegabamos y nos daban nuestras cuotas del dia y saliamos a nuetra ruta del dia y aprendi a tratar con clientes en sus hogares ,lo mas dificil seria que tenia una ruta un poco larga pero mas que nada laboriosa teniamos que hacer barrancas de altavista y entre dos es mas tiempo por eso llegabamos tarde , me gusto porque conoci muchos lugares"
good,"LONG, HARD, EXTREME, if you plan on working here be ready to deal with problems as far as inventory an so far so on as far as being a delivery driver"
good,"Es un trabajo muy gratificanrte cuando terrminas tu jornada y ves que todo  ha quedado perfecto, tras tu reposicion."
good,It was not a stressful and strained experience. I worked in the Packing/ Restocking department in the back of the warehouse and it could get abit awkward as far as the communication among employees go but it is quickly eased with the aid of the radio. The shift manager for that department was very easygoing and was very efficient in making our day easy by scheduling our duties throughout the day
good,"O dia de trabalho é bem intenso, diretoria e gerencia confiam muito nos funcionarios, trabalho ao lado de otimos companheiros.A parte dificil  é conseguir se desligar da empresa.A parte mais agradavel é poder colocar em praticas suas ideias."
good,Learn how to forklift and work various of machine the most enjoyable part of the job you get free pepsi gear hardest part of the job was working the same machine everyday
good,"Lots of hours and plenty of work which kept me busy through out the work day / shift , but i think that there could've been much a  safety work place."
good,"Great opportunity for new grads, not to mention the competitive compensation.  However, put simply - you will earn your paycheck. Extremely demanding, mentally and physically.  Expect weekends, off-shifts and every holiday. Also, perception trumps facts - this plays a major role in advancement."
good,"This is a competitive consumables company's with a high market share; however, high level management needs to improve the way it speaks to the employees."
good,"boa empresa.nunca tive nada a reclamar,pagamentos em dia,refeição,hora extra"
good,i go to work clock in pick up hand held and printer. then pre trip my truck and get pallet jack and hand truck check out. run my route and take care of customers talk to them as i am working leave go back take shells and pallets off truck check in and then do post trip and put money and paper work in safe clock out and go home. average work day 11 hrs. the highlight of my day is being out and about and talking and taking care of customers.
good,"while at this job i learned how to be even more quick on my feet at any workplace, due to how crowded it was i was able to maneuver around a lot of workers and mcahines and was able to get to job on time due to the convenience of how close it was to my house."
good,"In the beginning on my career at Pepsi, i loved it. The money was great. I loved the atmosphere. We had a ball all night every night. At the end of my career at Pepsi I didn't care so much for my job anymore."
good,Long hours but good coworkers. Company vehicle with fuel card was a good perk. Favorite parts of the job were meeting people and getting to build awesome displays.
good,"Trabalho com horário flexível"
good,"Delivery Driver. Out for 12-15 hours daily. too much for too little pay. was hoping to retire from here...Management is out of touch with reality. They don't understand that when you work with the public, various problems and obstacles arise on a daily basis. Good insurance"
good,buen compañerismo y trato en general.lo mas dificil cargar el camion por el esfuerzo fisico q hay que hacer.
good,"I was given the opportunity to learn about marketing and management"
good,"Nơi làm việc năng động, vui vẻ"
good,Great company but slow to accept change or update to latest technology.  Very much a sink or swim environment. Good benefits but not so great on work life balance.
good,"Lot of outsourcing in IT which leads to less growth opportunities. "
good,"This is for PBV not for PBC.  PBC was amazing!"
good,Pepsi is a very hard work place for employees as merchandisers. Sometimes long hours with a lot of product to break down and stock shelves.
good,"I both worked and attended school full-time, it would be difficult to describe any joy or spite I obtained from this experience."
good,The PepsiCo portfolio is very large. This leaves room for the individual to expand and touch various areas to find their niche. Very competitive environment with lots of aggressive metrics which it measures it's employees and processes against.
good,good place to work great people and brands.  Just not where i'm going to retire. early mornings in a  faced pace environment but great place to learn to sell.
good,"Would not take a position such as this again"
good,"Chegava de manha e ja ficava com o caminhao e ja estava pronto para viajar e assim sempre deixando carregado, e depois foi promovido a vendedor de pronta entrega, onde ficava com o caminhao e saia visitar os clientes e realizar as vendas, vendendo, descarregando os produtos, arrumando os produtos, recebendo a importancia, e fazendo banco e novamente carregando o caminhao na empresa para o dia seguinte"
good,Safely operated a forklift in a very fast paced warehouse environment.  Overtime is readily available and sometimes mandatory.  Enjoyed working with my coworkers.
good,"•Leadership of the sales team towards achieving sales targets and plan refrigerators and offers in the market."
good,Management was a pain but the employees were good and easy to work with. By far one of the best places I've worked. I very much enjoyed it.
good,Challenging job as company is MNC and also have international standards. we need to maintain food safety as per AIB standards.
good,"no comment, just that the management team is very jealous, and will find a reason to fire you when pressure comes down on them because they are not doing there job by managing well."
good,"I always felt like part of the team in the warehouse.  I worked with the warehouse day team. It took a bit to fit in, but once I did they took me on like family."
good,"I worked weekdays from 5am-5pm. The hardest part of the job was selling new products and convincing customers to try new products. The most enjoyable part of my job was the annual family events. My co-workers were okay, management wasn't organized and played favorites and didn't treat everyone equally."
good,"un stage qui m'a donné les bases du métier"
good,a lot of work not the best place but did a lot of work for customers and was very helpful all the time would not work there again
good,I enjoyed my time at Pepsi. Not much room for career growth. Job very slow at times. same repetitive duties day to day. Overall fair work culture.
good,Good co-workers. a typical day a pepsi was loading and unloading product from the trucks. I learned how to be a selector. the hardest part of the job was the hours. the most enjoyable part of the job was sharing laughter with my co-workers.
good,"Merchandising was my position with Pepsi. On a normal work day I had a repetitive store route to stock and rotate Pepsi products, organize back stock, build displays, and sales. "
good,Pepsi co is such a good company i liked to work at Pepsi but we have a lot issues with roaming.................... and we have gud time working with this company
good,I made really good money in the summer but not in the winter. management was ok. defiantly the better bottling company to work for though
good,"Het werken bij een groot bedrijf als PepsiCo biedt veel kansen."
good,"The job wasn't horrible, the management was poorly ran. The coworkers were not the greatest people to work with. A lot of slacking off going on while on the job."
good,PepsiCo is a productive company that pays well and gives their employees great responsibility. Most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to grow the business and the trust management had in its employees to do that.
good,It's a fun place to work for although there's nowhere to grow. I've learned so much in this company as I've moved to 3 different departments in the last 8 years.
good,"Great people with a few growth opportunities. Cross training is a plus and the desire to eliminate the Silo's from Sales, Supply Chain and I/T has significant benefits in your longevity within the company. Servant leadership has grown within upper management & it has it's place in managing up also. Consistent change and ability to manage change is required as DSD is evolving quickly over the next few years. Understand the 5 year plan in direction and be sure your skills are comparable with the requirements desired."
good,"A função de promotor lider na Pepsico é muito dinâmica, pois envolve várias funções, como supervisionar a equipe, levar material promocional nos pontos de vendas, fazer trabalhos administrativos, montar trabalhos em ponto de vendas, fazer visitas aos clientes. Aprendi muitas coisas dentre elas ter um bom convivio com as pessoas, a realizar vendas, pois minha gerente me ensinava muito, os meus colegas sempre estava disposto a ajudar uns aos outros, a parte mais dificil era enfrentar o trânsito e a parte mais agradavel era o relacionamento com os colegas de trabalho."
good,"oportunidad de trabajo, capacitación continua cursos .. "
good,PepsiCo is very good at maintaining the bottom line. They are very business focused and successful in meeting consumers needs.
good,Employees were nice and helpful when i started and still are the only thing is that the rate in which you need to pick product is a bit high even for someone with my experience. The way you need to build the pallet and reach that rate is very hard.
good,this was a good temp job. the people was nice and did what every they could do to help.  the only bad part you will have to work late if the driver did not make it in on time
good,"Department head, warehouse and fleet operations. "
good,A wonderful place to work and have awesome coworkers and managers. I get along with everybody. I learn a lot from working here. Gain wonderful knowledge about things I didn't know and more knowledge about things I already knew. Learn different ways to do things.
good,Pepsi was a fun place to work but there was no training for the advancement oppurtunities. The job was a learn as you go and very hard to figure out what was expected as a manager.
good,"As a leader of IT Project teams I involve people in the decisions so that they feel involved and ensure they have the opportunity to contribute to tasks facing the team. I manage the information, plan and organise and make the decisions as required."
good,This was a cool place to work. The only downside was that people that had less demanding jobs made the same amount of money as me or more. forklift operators and truck drivers mad more than me.

good,"Flex Schedule - 7-9 AM -8 hour day"
good,"I lost my job of 17 years at Pepsi due to a lateness that occurred during Hurricane Sandy. It was caused by a tree falling in front of me on my way to work during this Hurricane and police holding traffic up for over an hour. I lost my job despite not having a single absence in 17 years,a clean disciplinary record , a stellar work performance record  and a police report and letter stating that the officer wouldn't let traffic move. I was denied FMLA for my ill wife that I cared for the past two years,this care often caused me to be one minute late which I made up at the end of my 12 hour shift. I lost my job for 30 minutes worth of lateness that could would have been avoided had my FMLA been approved by the company. The hardest part for me to accept was that it was sanctioned by the union. I believed that my firing was a result of my salary as the company is going through a transition period where they believe it is more cost effective to have a revolving door of workers than permanent ones. The job itself is hard but fair as a former co worker used to say."
good,"[This is a comprehensive review of my time working for Pepsi Mid-America.  It's very detailed.  Blame that on my period spent at college writing term papers:) ]"
good,"I was employed through a temp agency so not knowing if you're gonna have a job day to day is frustrating. Told me assignment had come to an end on three days notice which is ridiculous. Job was generally not stressful and you do get some relevant experience, basically more for a resume builder but pay wasn't too bad at all. It's just really disheartening that your temp agency takes a quarter of what you make and do literally nothing for you. Work environment is pretty laid back and the people are enjoyable to be around. PepsiCo is a huge company though and if you can get in there's a lot of room for advancement in a career."
good,"After almost 4 years at this place, my pay has only went up to 10.55/ hr. It started at 9. I also work the same shift as when i started despite my urging for advancement. The best thing about this job is that I know that it is steady work and will be there until I find something that i feel betters my work environment."

I was fortunate to have a great group of people to work with which makes taking on major tasks much more fun. The hardest part was trying to balance the changes that would come from upper-management on a week to week basis. The most enjoyable part was working as a team to try and achieve goals with an amazing team."

good,"First responsibility was to run the Customer Accounts report, for daily orders (call list). Contact those customers and input orders into the computer, making sure the products were in the warehouse and on correct scheduled delivery day and truck. I learned alot of Customer Service duties, keeping our customers happy and difusing problems.

good,The BCR position requires 10-12 hours a day. The BCR will provide physical service while attempting to access more space for extra product displays. Management has limited interaction the their team. The team primarily works as individuals and not side by side. The biggest challenge at PBC is receiving clear and consistent communication. The most enjoyable part of this job is the opportunity to work directly with the customer providing for their needs.
good,A typical day at work was going from account to account to check their inventory. The schedule was so tight that there was only 5-10 minutes to converse with the manager.

Then I left and started my own business"
good,El trabajo que es llevar controles diarios no era complicado
good,Far the most part PepsiCo was a great company to work but in the past 5 years with multi restructures and lay offs kept the moral down and putting more and more of the work loads myself and coworkers. Very stressful and uncertain direction of the management team.

good,It was a good place to work. The people were nice and hard working individuals. I learned how to deal with management when it came to trying to get space for displays and sales adds. The hardest part of the job was without any prior knowledge of the stores sales trying to get the orders correct with all of the sales that were going on at the time. I worked long hours and the work was hard but I enjoyed it and have never been afraid of hard work. I started at the time of the Super Bowl and there were those sales and a lot after that.

good,Good company to work for name recognition is great. Always a lot going on with the company.
good,At Pepsi-cola as a route sales person you are pretty much on your own. your truck is loaded for you in the evening. then when you arrive in the morning you pick up your hand held computer and start your day. It is basically a Mon thru Friday job without having to work many weekends.

I feel like if the company doing good... we should get taking care of it... Empolyees have goals too.. dont get me wrong l love Pepsi.... it's a new year I have goals ... want my family to be ok
good,Great benefits because it's a large global company.  Extremely aggressive model for product sales. Which is fine but it's sometimes counter productive
good,"Definitely, the company provides good benefits such as health insurance, car plan, free uniform every year, but not limited to compensation because working here specially sales are at least at minimum of 12 hours everyday including sundays and holidays, most of the days wont have time for the family, just a few hours at night to be with them."
good,It started off great but I just wasn’t completely happy with myself so I made a lot of poor choices that hurt me in the long run but the company is great
good,A reasonable place to work and develop a career.  Challenging HR opportunities to contribute.  Key issues are sustainability of the business and building a culture that will support the long-term business strategies.
good,"Would have expected a better work- life balance. I was on call most day and night, having to login at all hours to fix issues, or worked around the clock to complete my work load."
good,"É um ótima empresa, cm inúmeras chances de subir de cargo. Profissionais de excelência. Porém muito estressante, exige muito. É requer sua total disponibilidade e atenção."
good,Pepsi takes up your whole day. You wake up early and get to bed late. Pay is okay. Nothing special. I wouldn’t recommend unless you are in your early 20’s.
good,Typical workday is 8hr day shift. Minimal overtime. Management is some-timey. Place is very multi-cultural. Co-workers are more family than co-workers. Most enjoyable part of job is completing my daily task with minimal supervision and my co-workers
good,Its very hard but worth it in the end. They have tons of benefits for you after you work for 9 days. Just don't get sick because they're overwhelmingly strict about attendance
good,The workplace was a decent enough job.The pay was alright and the management was decent at times. Sometimes the shifts would be longer than expected and the management changed often.
good,Dur physiquement mais à force ca devient de plus en plus facile.
good,The company fast pace but fun. The job requires a lot of hard work and dedication. I've learned time management and how to multitask. The hardest part of my job at the end of my shift. The most enjoyable part was meeting and exceeding my goals
good,PepsiCo was a pretty difficult job if you weren’t fit. The job payed will but I knew I was not gonna be able to work there while school was coming up. I work conditions were mediocre.
good,"Originally I felt loyalty and pride working for Pepsi.  That changed when an incident happened to me on the job that in the end made me realize that to them, i was just the number they issued me when I was hired and their priorities lie in their sales numbers and the numbers they use to grade the work of employees and departments based on their global expectations. I felt that employee appreciation was even less of a priority than customer appreciation and satisfaction. The customer's appreciation and satisfaction I noticed was not a top priority as I watched the marketshare percentages over the nearly 7 years I was employed for Pepsi. Before Pepsi corporate took over, my location owned over 75% of the nonalcoholic beverage market; over the next 6 years after corporate took over, it declined to less than 50% mostly due to the fact that innovation and  agenda was prioritized over customers' needs and satisfaction. Basically Pepsi runs on numbers, whether it's the numbers by which they identify their employees, or the grades they base their perception of work quality according to their global expectations regardless if the expectation is feasible for the location or not, or the product sales and profit margin numbers. Everything else is just a necessity they would do without if they could."
good,There are a few departments to choose from. I would recommend to someone in search of a company that offers good benefits for themselves and their families as well.
good,PepsiCo India holding Pvt Ltd. Staff behaviour is Very Good & Helpful. Salary is correct time of month. Learn good working knowledge. Sincerely work. Thank .
good,"working to much with your body ( felting  / bending / pushing )"
good,"Great shop, the equipment for the operators to use is kept in good condition"
good,It's an overall good place to work. The pay is over 21 an hr. Benefits are good. Highly recommend joining the union. Power is in numbers. If u start off picking it's a 4 day week schedule. Cons would be advancement. Bad supervisor in picking area. Lack of hr support. Co workers attitudes at times. And constant change of peers.  If you get on..careful what you do say. As with any job.
good,buen trabajo pero no para durar mucho tiempo ya que cada que pides vacaciones firmas renuncia y vuelves a firmar contrato
good,"If you're willing to compromise your integrity,  you'll go far. You just have to do the bare minimum to continue to be employed here.  Sometimes not even that."
good,"I have learned to do multi tasking, I have learned to managed my time, which work to be prioritized and to assist the needs and request of sales personnel."
good,"the management is a great group of people. they will help getting you set up with your new position.  they issue uniforms and steel toe shoes."
good,PEPSICO Saudi Snack in a summary was an enjoyable stress free  establishment . They had no salary problems . They were peaceful people and good workers consultation at all levels . It was really a nice company to work . I personally still missed this company due to the sell of my department which let to 30 peoples joblessness.
good,Learned to be self sufficient and it was nice interacting with customers daily to break up the monotony...Alot of management bias made for a unhealthy environment...Unfortunately
good,There is a lot of room for growth in the company for sales and operations. Not so much for administrative work. Benefits are great but compensation needs review.
good,"If you're looking for a place to grow then Pepsi is the place. There are many jobs available within the company. "
good,"Great pay benefits,  insurance, sense of friendship and team work, just grueling, long hours leaving little to having a personal life and taking care of household functions without being completely"
good,"Stocking, Communication skills, fast pace,"
good,Manufacturing plant that needs a complete overhaul in management. They are more like a friend than a manager. The plant manager and his sidekick act as if you are a peasant instead of a valuable employee. The St. Louis location has been in survival mode for the past ten years. Moral is dead and the warehouse workers are good workers but are being worn down daily. Good pay and benefits but not enough to deal with the unnecessary issues.
good,The campus is beautiful. The Gym is very nice. A typical corporate work atmosphere. The people are nice and work hard. The is lost a events and activities to be a part of.
good,Pepsi was a good atmosphere to work at the benefits and the pay could of been a little more than what they pay but the hours were very good and the people are really nice
good,the typical work day at Pepsi is pretty much safety driven every step of your day. From having the correct PPE(personal protective equipment) to ensuring you tractor and trailer is DOT ready for the road. Management for the most part tries to keep the workplace culture up by having most equipment up running and really because if not then it becomes the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and having a strong comradery with my coworkers.
good,It was a fun job at times u had to be very productive its fast paced competitive always but its alot of work and they pay u well but i think they had poor management.
good,"my job was awesome in my department , just wanted more financial stability and two days off back to back. My boss was the best i ever could have and miss working with him ,"
good,Very difficult and stressful work...at all levels! Very demanding and the customers (the store managers) are very unpleasant. The hours are long and the compensation is minimum.
good,Stressful job. Always pushing for more. Always working on weekends. Three weekends off in five years of employment. Good money over all and good benefits but the hours are hard to keep up with.
good,"For the most part, working at PepsiCo is an enjoyable experience. However, hours can be long and gruelling as the job and management expect an extremely high level of performance from their staff. Some managers are unorganized and forgetful. Driving all the time can be hard, especially in the winter months. If you want to work for PepsiCo expect your vehicle to mile out very quickly without really good compensation. Also, expect to be tracked with everything you do, including GPS tracking."
good,"If you want to move up, be ready to be bounced around the country every couple years. Staying in one place? You'll be limited. Standard north american corporate culture."
good,"Mi valoración como empresa es muy buena ya que es una empresa dónde la forma de trabajo es cómoda el ambiente de trabajo tambien es muy bueno y buenos compañeros. "
good,Pues al realizar un producto el tiempo no se logra ASER en ese tiempo por situaciones de falla de máquina falta de conocimiento en operaciones eso provoca precio al operador o técnico multiavilidadez en mantenimiento los tiempo no se respetan se atracan ante falta en algunas ocasiones refacciones herramientas no suficiente asesoría técnica de las máquina
good,Esprit d'équipe qui est l'un des facteurs de succès pour la culture de travaille pour cette filiale en Algérie
good,I have worked with some outstanding managers and professionals  throughout the years. I just recently moved to Georgia form New Jersey in efforts to start a new chapter in both my career and personal life.
good,I enjoyed the people who were there but the job wasn't for me. I would recommend it to a friend considering that the money is pretty good... also benefits and 401k.
good,"Strap on your boots, it gets thick. Very fast paced and can be quite stressful. Advancement can be achieved but once you reach office management you will take a 8-10k per yr pay cut! Benefits are good. Campus hires get hired often and will take priority over someone who has 25 yrs in the business. Sad."
good,okay place to work for management is very nice hours and route are difficult with time restrictions company is restructuring  they are not proficient at their job yet they don't know the area they are delivering too other then that it is a great place to work
good,If you want a high paying job look no further. However ... if u want to enjoy your own life definitely do not drive for Pepsi. with a split schedule they ensure you will get 2 34 hour resets each week allowing you to work 2 16 hour days on top of mostly having close to 14 hour shifts. you will soon find yourself unable to enjoy your home and questioning if you should just go back to driving otr
good,"Very fast paced. Only had a day and a half training due to time of year. Kind of underpaid for the expectations they hold you to. It is exhausting work and you have to work at a 200 case per hour speed. 32-16 oz bottles can considered 1 case. Imagine having to load 64000 bottles onto various pallets in a specified order to keep the pallet balanced for transport, IN ONE HOUR. And do that 8-12+more times in ONE day. FOR $16-$18 AN HOUR. I though this was one of the better companies to work for. The hard work is under paid and the desks are paid too much."
good,"Very competitive, great activities, rewards, very competitive. Hard work isn't always acknowledged. Management, overlooks conflict amongst staff members seeking resolutions."
good,"Environnement de travail agréable "
good,"Can be physically demanding, especially during peak times such as holidays"
good,"Company has a strategic plan in mind to achieve their business results. They have set up a very efficient way to achieve sales. The DSD process can be a grind being physically tolling and long days. "
good,Definitely a good paying Job for anyone coming straight out of high school. Job is labor intensive but nothing that the man or woman couldn't handle. No managers on your back and your able to make good connections with people in different areas.
good,Working at PepsiCo taught me a lot on the field and inside the warehouse met a lot of good people working there. My experience over 5 years working there has taught me a lot.
good,Was a good place to work till last 5 years. The business is fast changing it is hard for some company's to change without hurting their employees. I was pleased with my severance and HR department they tried to help all they could.
good,If you are there long enough and have the right route then its pretty nice. However your starting routes usually suck and involve working alot of weekend.
good,Your first week out will be easy. But 2 to 3 weeks in they will add on to your load. As a trainee you get 40 hrs a week after that's its 50hrs. Can be stressful due to customers not wanting to check you in.
good,It was a warehouse job. They all have ups and downs. It's all about how you work in an environment. I feel that people forget that a job is what you make it.
good,The office was ran poorly and the opportunity for advancement relied more upon personal relationships rather than work ethic. This alone is the reason i am looking elsewhere.
good,I liked Pespi as it provided the resources and experience I needed to shift into the world of manufacturing.  My bosses were pretty cool and met a lot of good people there.
good,I like the people I work with but the hours are unreal.  You'll work 7 days a week so don't plan on having a life outside of Pepsi. The work isn't hard but it gets over 100 in the summer inside due to no air conditioning
good,it was long and eatless work days. never the less i gotten it done the managemnt didnt really care a bout the worker just throwing cases is all the care about
good,"Typically would start around 0430 to arrive at first customer by 0500. Each day would have between 12 - 15 stops, typically routed until 1400 each day however it would often run much later than that. Management would be upset if you fell behind due to traffic and customer concerns. Salespersons were inattentive in their duties, often pushing their duties onto the drivers. Management was a good, but often ignored drivers concerns for their clients and vehicles. The culture was very competitive, yet friendly and when a driver fell behind, others would jump to their aid."
good,Uma excelente empresa fornece bastante benefícios que incentiva os empregados
good,"Aprendizaje en el desarrollo y cordinacion de las areas soporte que estuvieron a mi cargo (almacen,flota, informatica y recursos humanos) para el optimo servicio al area de ventas en el logro de sus resultados de ventas semanales, mensuales, mitad de año y final."
good,"fun fast pace place to work, friendly people, very knowledgeable people, good pay, good benefits, union based job and company, paid time off and vacation"
good,"Well pepsico has been a nice working environment through my job with them from  2012 till june 2018 .though some times work was hard but we often have fun during company parties.Management was good ,even the workplace culture ,the most enjoyable part was my interaction with other workers from other branches during parties and company games."
good,"I worked as a merchandiser for Pepsi during my summers home from school, it was a great job at the beginning with lots of hours and alot of freedom. As time went on the hours were reduced as well as the freedom. my biggest problem with the job was that the manager that i worked for was replaced 4 times over the three years i was working there so i was never able to build a solid level of trust or communication with any individual. Over all it was a good summer job but i couldn't see working as a merchandiser for  more than that."
good,The only reason I left Pepsi was to move back to West 5to help take care of my terminally ill mother otherwise I would still be there.  The pay was excellent.
good,"The warehouse is outdated. Equipment should be more advanced then what they provide their employers, and another shift should be created so that employees can have a set time to leave."
good,The people at PepsiCo are supportive and collaborative. All were professional and willing to pitch in. I enjoyed the groups I worked with and am proud of our accomplishments and successes.
good,"The job was okay, just stopped paying for my kms, i put thousands of kms on my car in a week and got no reimbursement. i had little to no hours. I went from a weekly 1000$ pay check to 300$ in one week with no warning."
good,In my 30 years in the business have trained and worked with many different people. I learned how to teach new hires dot laws and driving skills as well as selling techniques such as new handhelds and computers.It is diversified and great place to work.
good,"I loved the people I worked beside but the hours, especially in the summer, were extensive and the work was very hard. Great benefits but a high turnover rate for a reason."
good,"Meu dia iniciava com a abertura dos e-mails, verificava as pendências do front Line e as demais atividades da função. Meu aprendizado foi muito grande, rotinas da área da controladoria e relacionamento interpessoal, trabalhar com as gerencias em outro estado, implantação do sistema SAP e a mudança de cultura da empresa em POA. Possuia contato direto com a coodenação, que me possibilitou muito aprendizado, gerencia se localizava em SP, pouco contato. Bom relacionamento de trabalho.A parte mais difícil do trabalho foi a implantação do sistema SAP, houve pouco treinamento nas filiais. A parte mais agradável era o trabalho em equipe."
good,"This job was great for the purpose which was just to have a job. The management was fine, pay was fine, but nothing kept me there. I am thankful for what they gave me, but it was not a long term fit."
good,"I was hired straight out of college as a DSL for Frito Lay. Overall, I enjoyed my role but ended up leaving due to a new opportunity. They try to wow and dazzle college hires with the prospect of a solid (but below market) salary, good benefits, quick career advancement, and an ""entrepreneurial"" work environment. "
good,"Worked as intern an got good support from the company, but some employees are too careless and they wont take responsibilities though they are at good positions and this is the place where company lags behind in Karnataka."
good,It was a great job great benefits and great people there I love the job and love my coworkers love that job that was one of the best jobs it's hard work but once you get used to it it's a great job
good,Same as any company know who you can trust and do the best you can to fulfill your job duties. Your work is important part of how you grow in this company.
good,"Made a good living and had fun.A challenging environment with lots of technology to learn automation skills. Fast paced and good health,dental, and pension plans."
good,Arrived at 6:00 am daily checked out truck and left on  route to service a given route area with nationally known product. The company lacked ability to understand the local competition and did not compete with the same standards. The usual day ended about 6:00 pm.
good,"It was a stepping stone for future positions, and experience in will take with me to learning purposes. I had the opportunity to work with great people and be apart of the Pepsico family."
good,"Bueno,el.primer dia que entre me fue bien.encajaba los  productos Papas Lays Clasico y etiquetaba"
good,It is a great company and I've learned a lot about different parts of the IT sector but feel that it has a very political atmosphere. The workplace culture can make it difficult to advance as there are many experts that work there but there needs to be a larger blend of people with different levels of work experience to ensure future success.
good,"This particular company has moved to a more college hire approach which to what  i have seen  does not yield any benefits. If anything discourages current employees from being able to move forward in the company. This company at one time was an amazing place to work and i actually thought i would wind up a lifer. However, the company decided to take a different direction when merged with corporate and since then has been extremely unstable."
good,The company gets their interns and new hires excited about working for the company but doesn't continue that excitement and does not take on new ideas.
good,"PepsiCo is known for its difficult work-life balance, but this is because of the varied experiences it offers you. "
good,"Competitive fast paced job, you be responsible for selling product into stores and stocking the merchandise that comes in, while building displays and tagging products that are on sale."
good,Prefiro não detalhar porque são coisas confidenciais.
good,Long work days and it is every weekend. Your off during the week sothat you can make doctor appointments. Working 4 days and off for 3 days is not a bad thing. I wish they would treat the workers better.
good,As a merch you service 4-5 stores a day. You walk in the stores and fill up our line of products and speak to store managers see if they have any issues you need to address. Sounds easy but its really not its really LABOR INTENSIVE and theres always issues that will arise and make your day much longer. Oh and the union sucks
good,"Good company to work for. Each day brought different challenges."
good,fast pace decent co workers work with public high turn over not worth the money trucks need repair and better upkeep management is ok told one thing but made to do something else
good,"Culture: extremely fast paced, political, lack to regard for work life balance. "
good,highly professional work culture enjoyed a lot learning new things during my project team was so supportive and overall little challenging but definitely a great place to work with.
good,"Uma empresa multinacional que oferece bons benefícios e bem desenvolvida. Eu aprendi a operar maquinas do setor de alimentos , manipulação de produtos químicos, abastecimento de matéria prima"
good,Job can be very hard at times. In the elements for 85% of the day moving soda from your trailer to the store and then merchandising the product. Great people to work with!
good,"I've worked in several different areas within the company, and your experience will vary based on what area of the business you work in. The culture of the distribution center is different than that of the sales team."
good,Good team work in this company and supporting to all member which is working in a department and company and his management also good because it is very supported officially & personal also.
good,"I have had a great time at PepsiCo, but the feedback is not same with others. The company offers great sales incentives but the sales pressure is to much and often ends in Hot discussions."
good,You start at around 4 A.M. in the morning before most people awake dealing a lot of physical work. I did learn how to build strong merchandising and sales teams by focusing on communication skills development and morale boosting while ensuring each employee met or exceeded company requirements for standards and expectations. Management was for the most part approachable. The work culture is dynamic and ever evolving. The hardest part of a job of this type is the physicality of it. The most enjoyable part would be when you are praise for building a dynamic thematic display to drive customer excitement and see the reactions of the customers.
good,Muy buen clima laboral pero me uviese gustado quedar efectivo como me lo habían prometido antes de cumplir los 3 meses ya que contaba con mucha experiencia en el rumbo y no tenía ningún tipo de contratiempo ni nada...
good,"start at 5am usually, I get to my first store and spend 3 hours plus there, using a pallet jack, I proceed to hand jack and pull pallets of Pepsi products and fill any spots on shelf, interacting with store managers in the process trying to keep a friendly face and great service to the store. I drive to and service 3 more stores like this and my usual work day is between 8-10 hours per day. I have learned that people make the most of my day. The hardest part of the job is knowing that you can never finish everything everyday there. The most enjoyable part of the job is just being around like minded people of the job that love life and are passionate about what they do."
good,This is a good company to work for. I would recommended to anyone who applies. The management is well organized. This a simple place to work for. I enjoyed the people I worked for.
good,"The health insurance benefits are outstanding. "
good,"i liked working at pespi , good work and good hours.. but i was supposed to get a promotion but it never happen and the pay wasnt good compared to the extra work i had to do"
good,The job was fine while it lasted. Nights with twelve hour shifts made it hard to have an outside life some times. But workers an management were good.
good,good pay  good Insurance freedom of working by your self or with others co workers are great and helpful when needing help you for to get over 40 hours a week
good,"Pepsi does a great job of branding and marketing its product. Problem is, it seems that CEO doesn't want to share the wealth. Overall Pepsi, needs to improve on working to keep worker morale, and compensation higher."
good,A good beverage company . Good communication between management and manpower .hi technology machines and equipments. Good facilities and safeties company.
good,"Product Launches"
good,"As an employee at Pepsi Cola I learned to work with others and help one another out. Being team. Had awesome hours of work. received merchandiser of the year, cleaned and organized backrooms all over."
good,The routing system is inaccurate and unorganized. 10.5 to 12 hour days. Poor management. Under staffed. No work life balance. Most drivers are unhappy with the operation structure of the company but stick around because of the pay. Every man for himself culture. Minimal support from management.
good,(Frito Lay) Lot of opportunities to learn in the global giant including global exposures but long working hours and lot of stress was experienced in the day to day working. I do understand that situation has vastly improved now.
good,Pepsi Co.  Is a national standard company but my work in at is data update  in system.It not an recognized job. So I'm not Interested to continuing it .2014-2017 I done degree in bsc .Computers with statistics at prism degree college. Now I'm interested to take place in software field.
good,"Full of challenges everyday, alot to learn everyday... One of the best company in uae, and well known brand with high consumer equity and demand, more professional people required"
good,I learned so much in this company my boss. the first thing is how to make grip on computers how to make computer useful in our daily life.and main thing was how to handle the daily basis projects.
good,It is a fun culture to work in - very interactive amongst employees and managers on a daily basis. PepsiCo is an enjoyable company to work for if you have the opportunity to.
good,"Is great job for someone strong and Young. Is very ficical work that you have to perform is a job that need many hours of your day. Is a place to get lots of knowledge in. Gives you opportunity to work and meet lots of people , get skill with many diferent aspects about stores and management around you"
good,This is a good place to work. Managers are pretty nice and very accessible. No job too hard or too boring. Plenty of overtime available if you desire it.
good,"Good work life Balance."
good,"empresa dedicada a la elaboración de productos de consumo masivo de alimentación, con fuerte presencia a nivel internacional, la cual brinda un nivel muy elevado de seguridad para sus trabajadores para prevenirlos ante accidentes de trabajo y enfermedades profesionales."
good,"As atividades diárias eram realizadas calmamente, não existia cobrança direta pois os superiores sabiam da obrigação de cada um. Gosto desse ponto na empresa, onde somos livre sem ninguém ficar em cima durante o dia inteiro."
good,"PepsiCo es una empresa donde se puede aprender mucho, es una gran escuela y es una empresa que tiene muchas marcas. "
good,"Typical day at work."
good,OKAY for younger people . Thats all i have to say about that. It is a bunch of politics in that company.Wokr is ok. Coworkers complain. Benifits the best thing about it.
good,"Each day you will focus on your performance, all your efforts are ignored until they are desperately trying to locate someone to engage a customer that another management employee has already upset. Instead of receiving praise for a job well done you get I knew you could handle it. Which really is translated into better you deal with it than I."
good,"Great company with good or fair pay. Working in enclimet weather and long hours."
good,The employees and management team are very genuine and supportive! The culture is very positive and it is a fun environment. Shifting Schedules and with Saturday work sometimes even Sundays mostly when picked seasons like Ber Months. Casual position.
good,A typical day at work is long and grueling however on a good day highly rewarding.  When you achieve your goals you are highly rewarded however when you do not meet your goal you are criticized heavily and made to feel less than worthy of anything.  I suppose this goes along with work hard play hard.  It can be tough on ones ego.
good,Pepsi provides great family Benefits.  Work life balance was hard at times and management was very green.  I am glad I was able gain my CDL and advance my career.
good,"long work hours "
good,En la practica hace falta más enfoque al trabajo real en caso de quedarse en la compañía después de la práctica.
good,"The environment is overall good, benefits are suitable for the market in Jordan, HR management is good, employee relations are good, management is excellent"
good,"- 1 day off per week"
good,"Start the day by looking through emails for any information that my boss. I have 5 accounts, the first two are in Oakhurst CA the next one would be at Mariposa CA next would be at Corsegold CA and last would be in Madera Ca.  Vons, Ralleys, Pioneer Market, Hillside Supermarket, Madera Ranchos market.."
good,"recomendo muito bom os beneficio"
good,It's a good company. But there is too much strictness about a job. There are no other activities other than job.The quality of there products is unexceptional.
good,"there is no typical work day,  so many variables. one minute its smooth sailing, the next everything goes haywire. good communication skills and patience is a must. management can be difficult, even clueless at times. good problem solving skills will help you a lot. hardest part of the job was the physical portion of the job(working loads etc.) Most enjoyable was working alone and at my own pace."
good,I enjoyed managing Technicians. There was a daily challenge of both micro & macro managing the team. There always was never enough hours in a day to get all the work done. A person in this role must be very structured and organized. There is a lot of customer/contractor interaction. I enjoyed that part. Overall Management and HR are very supportive. This job presents the challenge of having a healthy work/life balance. You must learn to utilize all your resources and stay by the book on processes and procedures.
good,Management was continuously by the seat of their pants.  Work life balance was at a minimum for most each employee.  Turn over was above average for the Warehousing portion of the business.
good,"Si bien la demanda de trabajo es mucha, pero era agradable el trabajo"
good,"It is a large company that has potential to excel if you want to advance, but the midlevel management is not the best, from my experience."
good,Must have a good back and thick skin. Customers make or break your route.  A lot of decisions made for corporate accounts create negatives for the salesmen without just compensation or any feedback.
good,Besides the leadership....absolutely amazing! Im was the only female working in the warehouse.  Most cant do this job.  As i said besides the leadership great job
good,The days as a route sales rep with Pepsico Foods can be very long. If you are not motivated and organized it could seem endless. The training provided is good and ongoing. Overall a good company to work for
good,"I made good money working here.  I liked doing what I did.  I enjoyed engaging with the customers, they made my day.  I would recommend this place to someone looking for work."
good,all i can tell you is if you like the idea of working 60 hours a week and not getting payed a fair share for your time spent then feel free to apply never have enough drivers forced to work your butt off everyday and no compensation or any type of real appreciation
good,Typical day required me to restock stores and build displays.  Hardest part of the job was dealing wit over demanding supervisors.
good,"My morning begun @ 5AM gate checkout would be a and 1 process no matter how early I reported to work. My route would sometime take me as far North to Woodstock 15 stops and as far south to Atlanta, GA with 3 stops. The traffic at that moment would be extremely heavy. In the short time working out of the Stone Mountain location you would have to use secondary streets. Management would not adhere to the changes the route drivers was asking and the challenges we faced with global routing so that the stops was geographically located that we would not have to go 50 miles to deliver 3 stops. While in the Texarkana, TX location I excelled in learning the route. Able to put several stops into other days which made my work week 4 days and helping out in other areas. We had an AWESOME  team in both location. I enjoyed being outside, talking with the customers, and helping the community when I was able to do so"
good,"-first was taught great time management skills"
good,"nice environment, family style oriented, good breaks and end of year food provided. team work on everyone, long breaks and relaxing environment."
good,"This was a route sales position. This position involved driving, selling, and marketing. Although, this started out as a great job, centered around family, it eventually changed with new management. However, I would rate this as the best job I've ever had."
good,Overall a good place to work. With good benefits/compensation. Job and life balance can be a challenge at times. Learned a lot in regards  to warehousing and manufacturing standards.
good,"New management now, but then it was one sided. Very productive and good pay. Poor co-workers due to race. But loved the job no matter."
good,Too far from the city. Employees are good. Work is fun. Work culture could be better. Stressful due to long travelling hours.
good,Delivery of Pepsi products to area grocery and discount stores using a  International tractor and 53 foot trailer. Printed invoices  and ensured product matched invoices.
good,My typical day at work starts at 12 PM.  I check the number of cases sold for the next day and plan accordingly.  I have learned to coordinate with the senior mgmt. team and improve a line of communication.  My co-workers respect me because I will do anything to get the job done.  The hardest part of my job was employee attendance as it puts a heavier workload on other workers.  I enjoyed the end of the day when all trucks are loaded properly and the fulfillment of a job well done.
good,"Pepsico is overall a good company that will teach you a lot of life lesson and help establish a resume. A typical day consists of stocking product to the shelf, displays, and coolers. You don't really get to know your co-workers that much as this job is worked 95% of the time by yourself."
good,"I work a regular night shift pattern ie 4 nights on and 4 off and am employed with 3 other fitters. I believe I work well in a small team of 4 and we pull together and have no supervision ie we decide amongst ourselves how to split up the night's workload."
good,"Working here is a fun plus learning new things. Few great things I learnt here are Time Management, Project Management, Presentation skills"
good,"we are working in 5 days in 3 shifts , i learned much more from the pepsico as multinational company how to communicate with people from different culture and how to manage the employee on the right way,my hardest part in my job is to manage the spare parts and ordering the parts and make a plan to replenish to materials , the most enjoyable part is to wakr as a team with my team in the warehouses"
good,The job is exciting based off of the traveling. The pay is great and you get the chance to meet new people everyday. The hours are very long 8-12 min

good,"1. when breakdown occur due to my department"
good,"learned how to manage with the wholesaler and retailers "
good,"A typical day at work is going to the distributor warehouse and monitor stocking levels. The Company requires the warehouses 3 days stocking levels with 1.5% buffer stocks to fast moving products. If there are lacking stocks, we need to order at the plant for the hauler to arrive the next day. Its highly required that we don't deliver to our outlets with incomplete stocks since it will be unfavorable to the distributor, meaning another trip to the outlet will merit new expenditures in terms of fuel, manpower and wear and tear. We are happy with what we do for so long. Selling with regular customers, new customers, merchandising, there is this feeling of achievement whenever we end the day. I devise new incentive schemes to our people, like profit sharing, if our sales objectives are met. Most of the time, I am happy that our people try hard to achieve our targets and they get their incentives as rewards. We try to manage our distributors like we are an independent functional Pepsi mini plant at our areas setting me as the focal point of the business. Everytime we have done our jobs correctly means more money for the distributor, then rest assured that we will continue to expand. The hardest part of the job is when the distributor collapses due to bankruptcy or mismanagement, it means I have to scout for another distributor in the same area with financial stability to absorb the costs of logistics, which is very hard nowadays. The recruitment might end in days, months without any distribution in the area which could lead to competitor opportunity. That is why some areas are dominated"
good,"good company"
good,"Typical day of work can vary from day to day. Nonstop busy from the time I start my job to the time I finish.  Perform variety of duties, have great organizational skills to balance supporting 18 managers.  Confidentiality is important.  Most enjoyable part of my job is helping others and helping others ""Get Better"" at their own positions by teaching them.  I love learning new things."
good,"A typical work day included restocking product in each account, interacting with store managers and customers and providing the best product  the store and the customer. The hardest part of the job was being in a store for 4-5 hours dealing with impatient managers and rude customers"
good,el trabajo que se vivia dia a dia era un reto para mi por el desgaste fisico que se tenia pero lo tomaba como ejercicio...estaba muy bien pues estaba todavia soltero
good,"My time at Pepsi was okay, however it taught me a valuable life lesson in time management.  You were always on a schedule and had to meet deadlines regardless the work environment.  I was on delivery route and the stress was very hard on me.  Seldom found time for breaks, lunch's, etc... however I knew the job was required to be done.  That stress often carried over to home life and made things difficult there as well.   I was so overwhelmed each day and couldn't wait for the next opportunity to come my way for me to use my college degree from UNCP."
good,"I work third shift but put in at least 12-20 hours of overtime weekly."
good,"Dia de balanço com os vendedores"
good,"Drove to large format retail establishments and merchandised Pepsi products. I learned aspects of business, sales, and merchandising. Other than merchandising, I assisted sales representatives set up displays, and assisted the warehouse crew. Management was very reasonable and easy to get along with."
good,It was a great place to work. my trainer  kept putting the company down as he has been there over 10 years and kept telling me why are you here this job sucks!  he was putting apps everywhere and looking elsewhere but to the bosses he was the best they had.  long hours but weekends off for the most part. if you work slow you get better trips. if you work fast they give you longer trips but the plus side is more cases more money.  trailers are great and New but tractors are old and junk.  benefits are great. Management will leave you alone as log as you get the job done. pallet jacks die quick. Co-workers are good people for the most part.   good luck!  its not a team at PBG in albuquerque... I get to wear my free t shirt anytime I want. dont get me wrong it is a demanding job so if you dont like to lift and help other drivers with no help from them then this is a good place to work! Hard to get to know the customers when Mgr keeps changing your route..
good,"The money was great, however, I didn't have a life. Some days, I would work from 5AM in the morning until 7PM at night. My manager rode my back 24-7, he micromanaged like there was no tomorrow."
good,"I worked at Pepsi and it was wasn't perfect, but then again, what is. The hours can be long, but once you get into a groove, you can definitely become more efficient and find ways to get home earlier while also making all of your deliveries. My pay was about 12.80 an hour and I definitely felt waaay underpaid for the amount of work. <y location was especially understaffed due to the high turnover rate and that just made things especially more complicated. Management was not very organized, but they did a good job dealing with the understandably disgruntled customer accounts. I definitely would've stayed longer but, unfortunately, I was let go after an accident where one of my hand trucks on the back of the trailer damaged the back of a parked car in a cramped dollar general parking lot. I was within my probationary period at the time so it was an automatic termination. My supervisors really understood the situation and worked hard to keep me, but someone higher up at a desk a couple hundred miles away pushed the button and had me snuffed out."
good,The work was not steady and i was constantly only working 2 or 3 days a week
good,trabalhei em uma empresa grande multinacional não tenho do que reclamar ouve alguns erros assim como toda empresa que erra em setores simples como segurança

good,"Great place to work - work from home, plan your day, work with high schools and colleges. Co-workers are all young, fun and driven! Great work and life balance as you plan your own days and as long as you do your job, you can do so. The struggle with this job is you may run into customers that have contracts and cannot purchase the products - other than that we work for a big name and it's great. Unfortunately if you want to grow within this company, you must relocate, which I am not willing to do with a family. We are in sales and reporting system is not up to par with what I am used to so we don't know where we stand at month 9 of the year."
good,"Empresa en la que no hay desarrollo profesional, ni apoyo como empleado, pocas prestaciones, no muy buen ambiente de trabajo"

good,"Working time extend to 12 to 16 hours, a learned about the the laboratory works and quality assurance while the management were supported for the benefits needed by all employee. My co-workers were fun to go with and very friendly and accommodate but the hardest part of my job is working during graveyard hours until morning in the next day without sufficient rest. The most enjoyable part of my work is having recognized and awarded for being a punctual employee."

good,"A as an Account Manager for Pepsi my day typically starts around 6:00a.m. . Each day I have a specific number of accounts to visit. I generally visit 16 to 22 accounts on each day, and I spend on average 30 minutes to an hour in each account. The first step when I enter an account is to speak with the manager or owner of the store to see if there are any issues I need to resolve and to also sell in additional product. My second step is to check to store to make sure Pepsi product is properly signed with the correct price point and to make sure the signs are neat. Thirdly I merchandise the store. Fourthly I inventory the store to so that I can make an order to send to replenish the stores Pepsi products. The final step is to supervise the deliver of the product once the order has been placed and to make sure that the product is placed in the proper area by the drivers that deliver the product. This job requires me to manager around nine deliver drivers. Managing drivers and micro managing store employees has taught me the value of clear communication and also the importance of establishing a rapport with the individuals you work with on a day to day basis. In addition, managing drivers is one of the most difficult parts of this job because the turnover amongst drivers is very high. However, there are many aspects of this job I do enjoy. I am able to work and communicate with people that are very diverse. This job also requires me to be responsible for myself and manage time wisely because I am in each account by myself. I also enjoy this job because it challenges me to improve"

good,Overall this place is a great place to work. Excellent hours and fun people to work with. There is plenty of training and people are very friendly and willing to help.
good,This was a great company to work for minus the management. The pay was great and there were plenty of hours to go around. The only issue I had with this company was the management. The bosses were arrogant stuck up and had the better than art thou attitude.
good,"Been here awhile, not leaving anytime soon. Company has its share of problems but what company doesn’t, great ppl to work with , supervisors are great, hours are ok. All in all it’s a job with great pay/ benefits."
good,Not a bad place to work. But they start you out below scale pay. No real plan to get their employee up to scale pay. It was a lot of overtime available.
good,"A única dificuldade é conciliar a vida profissional e pessoal, mas em si um ótimo lugar para trabalhar."
good,Overall good company for work. But not satisfied with the wages. Work culter is good but a bit stressful moreover no paid leaves no available. Got the good experience of product management

good,"Uma empresa excelente, com pessoas que te ajudam muito a crescer."
good,"Very physically demanding job. Long hours during summer and holidays that can become excessive.  This seems to depend on the market, the management at the facility, and the assigned route.  Pay is fair. Best part of the job is being on your own most days, moving from store to store to complete the job."
good,"PepsiCo  was an extensive fun work environment , with each day being an adventure .Management staff was always willing to assist on any aspect . Which not only helped to remind you that it was just work it was more of a family . Which I do believe PepsiCo ensures that the culture and values of the company is first priority."
good,"decent company but lack of ability for career advancements"
good,"have worked here for 21 years-have had career growth"
good,"My last ten years of employment with Pepsi seemed to go downhill, partly in part due to the economy unfortunately. The company was very good to me throughout my career, but my last 5-10 years were just hard to watch the company decline. My reason to choose retirement at that time was that the last 5 years with the company I was no longer able to trust the plant manager or the warehouse manager. Although those two individuals are no longer with Pepsi, the environment has not gotten any better according to those I still converse with occasionally."
good,"It is very physically demanding, better suited for someone in their early to mid 20's. i am not sure if the system is the same as it was then, but you had to do everything yourself, order, work back stock and work all deliveries as well."
good,"Overall, great experience however extremely political culture which tends to value your internal network more so than the deliverables accomplished in your performance."
good,Let go from Pepsi on a technicality that wasn't made apparent to me before applying or starting with the company. Was really getting to know and like their system. Also enjoyed atmosphere and employees that I was working with
good,You get out what you put in. This company is very fast paced with lots of demands it's imperative to have tough skin and be flexible. Long hours are sometimes required and hard work as a premium.
good,"Pepsi was a great place to work, competitive pay and excellent benefits. The only down side is that I worked every weekend.  I enjoyed the customers and the work."
good,"For administrative positions your ability to advance is based on your supervisor's title, not your own abilities.  Pay is very low compared to other companies and you must be in your job 18 months before you can move to another position.  This is an incredibly long time and not the industry standard of 9 months to a year."
good,"Great environment and people to work with. They're willing to help you out in all areas.."
good,"My tenure at PepsiCo afforded me the opportunity to lead challenging and complex initiatives, grow my skills and build solid relationships.  At the time I began consulting on the PepsiCo client account the culture was people centric, and they genuinely cared for the employees. However, at the time of my departure, the frequent organizational changes had a great impact on employee morale."
good,"If your load isnt ready when you show up for work, you have to wait on it!"
good,As an OJT before I learned a lot especially in formulating in Excel. Always show your supervisor hat you are willing to learn so that you can be absorbed.
good,"Work at PepsiCo is great because they have a flex schedule and you can do more things about your life in your free time."
good,Pepsi are not consistent with background requirements.  Some potential employees are hired while others are not with the same background history.  I feel this is unfair
good,"Fun and busy place to work, however, the management changes often and they do not communicate well.  Management make changes for the laborers and lower level employees that impacts their quality of work/life balance for the worse."
good,In my time with them I got stuck working weekends (Saturday and Sunday) only for 5 years. It's their weekend merchandising position. I applied for a full time position every chance I got but never got hired on. For a little while I was the trainer and a few over the people I trained got picked for the full time position over me.
good,PepsiCo is a great company to work for. It pays great and everyone is easy to get along with. The hours of work is great and the benefits are awesome.
good,Sales meetings help you learn new ways to sell your products and tools from other co workers. Managers usually make time to get you in the right direction.
good,Uma experiência boa e que me agregou muitos conhecimentos.
good,I do not have a review for PepsiCo at this time. I enjoyed working there but the management can be frustrating. Changes to the systems are slow and not rolled out to the company well.

good,fast pace job to deliver and set up product. stock  shelves and displays. company does not stand behind there employees if a call or complaint is called in from a store / customer they turn there back on the employee before finding out any facts or if there is any truth in the matter.
good,Pepsi is a great place to work if you are independent and require little oversight. Expectation are too high and they do not have the operations support to meet those expectations.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Pepsi. Communication from management isn't all that great, however you are left alone to do your job and go home. "
good,"Gr8 culture, global standards & HR practices but insecurity in India. Work Life balance is low. "
good,"Es una agencia que cumple puntualmente con sus obligaciones, cuando requerí hacer un tramite nunca me comentaron que había algun retraso en su información o pago."
good,"Great atmosphere to work in, get to meet new people, you can drive from store to store so there is no constant supervision if you're looking for a job like that."
good,"There are a lot of perks to working for a big company, half day Fridays, work from home days, unlimited sick days, 4 weeks of vacation after 5 years (3 week starting). However there are many draw backs such as slow movement, corporate politics, and talent pipeline issues. A few people move up very fast (Promotions ever 9-12 months) but the majority of people are stagnate and take 2-3 years to move to the role (eligible to move after 18 months is the policy)."

good,Pepsico was a very good company to work for.  I learned a lot from the people I worked with.  They could improve on balancing home life with work life.
good,"Start early and finish early. Every day is the same. Work 8-10 hours per day depending on what is on your route for that day. Customer service skill learned,. Hardest part of the job is the Holidays."
good,"Emphasis on Driving volume every single day. No let up.  Overall culture was good, but it got brutal having to forecast 2-3 times a week.  It didn't change anything."
good,"I loved Pepsi when it was a smaller company. After Pepsi co took over it went down hill, they did away with some great mgrs that had been there for year and the fight for the employees and what was right left the company"

good,They cut my pay after several months from $21  hourly to pay by  .53 per case and $300 base. I went from 1500 p week to less than $700. The trucks constantly broke down.
good,"If you don't mind a constantly stressful job with little work-life balance, you'll get rewarded by being promoted every 2 years and paid a good salary."
good,Pepsi was my first real job. The hours were fine and the pay was decent. Would highly recommend young workers to start off as a merchandiser and work their way up.
good,"Since, I only worked with the company for a year at max.in a consulting role, I don't think I have much to review but it was a step into the door for me and helped me enhance my SAP capabilities."
good,"what i enjoyed most about working for Pepsi Co Arizona was how Productive i felt, how fast pace it was, the structured training events, and how helpful networking with other plants was. i also enjoyed being part of the Campus Hire organization within PEPSI and being part of the culture and inclusion team."
good,Pepsi bottling group was a very busy place that focused on the bottom line and not employee satisfaction or growth. Very little work life balance there.
good,"Es una gran compañía para aprender. Se debería adaptar con mayor velocidad a los cambios del mundo corporativo y migrar a una organización más ágil, flexible y a la vanguardia de las nuevas tecnologías. "
good,"Solid job that provides decent pay and great benefits. Typical work day was 10 - 12 hours. If you can handle physical work and working in the elements, its a nice job. Weekly pay"
good,"Work/life balance is horrible. Great place to work of you,re an individual not looking for time to your self. The part time role was more beneficial for my life it gave me three days a week to my self and i didn't have to worry about being forced to stay over or come in on my off days which happens pretty often if your low on the seniority totem poll."
good,"People often say that people don't leave companies, they leave managers.  And that is never more true than at Pepsi.  "
good,My experience with PepsiCo was short lived. The people were outstanding across the board I felt very comfortable and welcomed. The problem was to much work and no time for family as the hours are extremely long and weekends are a must to work in most cases.
good,"As a merchandiser, your duties included driving to assigned stores to restock Pepsi products and break down large deliveries. Handled any issues store management might have."
good,"I average twelve hours a day completing numerous tasks."
good,"Starting off as a Merchandiser, working my way into a relief salesman, then taking over my own route was a highly anticipated goal of mine. Everything was going exceptionally great til they laid off 40 people from our Baldwin park facility. Leaving me a demotion back to merch with horrible hours and no route consistency. Once that took place, I had a very hard time trying to balance a family life. My days would run on 10-12 hr shifts not being able to pick up the kids from school as I did. Family life is very important to have when working in a stressful environment. Without that part of your life it's extremely tough to stay sane."
good,"en general una buena empresa, con actividades globales y interacción con varios países"
good,"There are a lot of great things to say about PepsiCo. For the most part, I love the people I love with. I love that I'm empowered to look for better ways to go about improving our infrastructure. The flexibility is fantastic with work/life balance, however the amount of work can prove tedious. I'm a salaried employee and there isn't any way possible to cram the work I'm responsible for in 40 hours. I work a lot from my home and the hours stack fairly quick. I'm working in the neighborhood of 60 hours a week. So there's that. Would I recommend PepsiCo? Absolutely if you're a work horse. "
good,Prime dayalı çalışma sistemi. Maaş az. Çalışma ortamı güzel profesyonel.
good,Uma boa empresa pra se trabalhar e com certeza uma excelente vitrine para se lançar no mercado de trabalho
good,Great meeting new customers everyday.  Rewarding being able to help in whatever way is needed.  Challenging and a learning experience to compete with other vendors
good,"If you really want this job, its stressful and a pain and honestly the payment is good, but not enough for the work you do every day and the manager can be rude"
good,"It's a great place to work as long as team management is good otherwise it isn't.  You do get to learn a lot since you juggle multiple hats many times, but you aren't necessary compensated for such efforts."
good,"Overall it was a good experience with a very corporate company.  In the end, I just wanted out of the beverage industry.  I was given the opportunity to relocate or change positions but I was just ready to leave."
good,"Started out typical,then change after change.Never had a clear view of policy. Supervisor was great limited power over policies.Fellow employies where great."
good,A very team oriented company that relies upon individual partisipation. A place where an individual can suceed and can move to greater life achieving goals.
good,"I feel and have briefly seen that no matter which Department you are in and what Nationality you are, all the employees are united and work together beautifully."
good,"This job does have decently good pay, the benefits make it great. This job is physically demanding itself mixed with new management with no prior knowledge makes it very stressful. You can really only make more money if your willing to relocate. They offer no overtime but will not hesitate to load you down with more work than your hours will allow."
good,"10 years experience as a web application developer and project manager. The company has drastically changed from one that prided itself on quality in-house development to one that eagerly outsources all development (and even development leadership) to often low-quality programmers, and then blames the third-party supplier for the resulting quality control issues. For these reasons, and the below average pay for developers, I would currently recommend staying away from this company if you're a developer."
good,people who work for the company are great must your mostly by yourself. the hours are long and gets stressful at some times. some days go by fast but days with big sales they can be 10-14 hours long
good,Great place to work if your out of high school. Schedules really don't ago accommodate family life. You have to accommodate to the work schedule instead of your family life. Main reason why I think new people leave
good,It was a pretty good place to work it until people started hating and had a disagreement on certain things that they didn't want to do at the times of working
good,"PepsiCO has a vast amount of opportunities for employment but do not educate employees of those opportunities. Those who work in certain fields or locations are the only ones privy to new openings in their area. "
good,"Un lugar bien para trabajar , con metas y objetivos ."
good,summer time is the hardest part of the job its  really physically demanding fast paced Days go by fast great benifits just wished I could of got my full 40 hours
good,"Fast paced work environment, can be very  rewarding for the right person. Takes a very large time commitment and attention to detail. The Poplar Bluff depot is one of the best in the company."
good,Must be able to wear many hats and develop relationships within company and among customer base to accomplish tasks and meet goals. A scheduled day can change in a heartbeat.
good,Visit 10-20 account daily to maintain shelf space in accounts cold vaults making sure that the portfolio is being maintained.  Introducing new market items and filling in voids.
good,Pepsico is a job. Just like any other job it gets you from point A to point B. Normally there is a lot of turnover because it is a corporate job. If you want to advance in a career you have to be willing to be good at your job but great. If you are great at your job they will want to keep you in it for the fear of loosing you.
good,If you enjoy getting up early and working late this is the job for you ...your hours are dependent on how slow or fast you work you work everyday different days off and you work holidays
good,none.....there is not much to say for this company .. you showed up every morning to get your handheld and go to the back of the yard to find your truck...do a quick check on service then go and deliver Soda to the different stores.
good,"Stock shelves at grocery store, build displays, sell in new product,inventory. Learned alot about selling and customer service. Lots of pressure to oversell product into a store by Pepsi upper management. Enjoyed interacting with store employees and customers. I was pretty much out on my own taking charge of my clients needs. the hardest part was keeping everybody happy down the chain of command."
good,"A typical day at work is fairly balanced day depending on the mood of individual."
good,2 weeks of days followed by 2 weeks of nights 12 hour shifts good salary but can be tiring work heavy lifting required enjoyed working with my team made the shifts go faster
good,"É tudo muito dinamico, precisa-se fazer varias atividades ao mesmo tempo. É dado autonomia aos funcionarios"
good,"Its a good paying job but its a lot of physical work that can stress you out easily, you get good benifits. Bad part about the job is that you have to drive you own vehicle to and from every store."
good,If you want a good stable job then i would recommend Pepsico. If you are looking for something new everyday with a good management team then i would NOT recommend Pepsico.
good,"O serviço dos auxiliares é muito braçal, exigindo muita força, isso se torna cansativo."
good,"-Visiting multiple accounts, maintaining rapport with account management."
good,a typical day for me is just stacking Gatorade cases on pallets all day in  a hot warehouse with little help from co workers. Many co workers never show up for work or leave early and leave us short handed and makes it way harder to get work done
good,Lo malo que no te permiten crecer por laboralmente.
good,Days vary just like any job. I think that corporate is a bit overbearing. Overall though people are happy on a day to day basis and I do not mind going to work.
good,Always moving and have something to do. Time does not stand still when merchandising. Great entry level job for the pay with good benefits package. Fun
good,My day would be clocking in and going to my work station. I would get my orders for the day and get work on my machine or cooler that is needed to be sent out that day or the next. I would take care of special orders to have them ready when they are needed. I also fixed and repaired the machines to working order.
good,"Lots of hours. You can work as much as your body will let you."
good,"To reach my daily sales taget by visiting all scheduled call Customers for sure incentive and commission. I learned alot specially in handling objection, rejection and any kind of pressure, boost my confidence in communicating and interacting to different kind of people. My teammates visor and managers was the key of what i learned as of today, they're the great mentors, teachers and friends. The management are molding me into a better person. Pressured workplace but fun. During lean month was the hardest part of my job due to low of demands specially during typhoon attack, it affects my KPI. I enjoyed alot when i reached my sales target that will turned to cash, trainings,  activities and opened new account was also boost my happiness."
good,"Developing customer relationships to help grow the business. Being responsible for many accounts by managing inventory, using sales techniques, and and being organized on a daily basis."
good,"The drivers at Pepsico in Philadelphia are the lowest section in the company and are treated as such. If a driver can make it through the first year to a year in a half things will get slightly easier. However there is little chance for advancement from the driver position, because the better driving job at the company people stay at for years. Then when and if an opening occurs there are so many people  applying for it, that if one isn't high on the seniority list there is a better than a 90% chance that you will not be consider for the position."
good,"Unfortunately the longer you are with the company, the more you salary kind of gets ""stuck"". They work you to the bone, expect 150% from you but hard work isn't always recognized."
good,"Boring workplace. 5 years to be a manager. 20 years to be a Director. I wish the company did more for the younger folks who are coming in. The company is hiring from Big 4 for Accounting but in my opinion, not yet ready for the highly motivated candidates."
good,"to much attention is spent on union needs and not on the how it effects the entire team."
good,"Working in Pepsi Cola Products Philippines is the most challenging I have encountered. Task from Negotatioan, A/R's, Client and Different Client type. "
good,Boa Empresa mas não houve adaptação da minha parte.
good,Its a good place to wrk if you just got your cdl n if you want need good benefits. Other than that its to much work for the money.
good,Great company with great benefits. A male dominated environment. The company provides an extensive amount of training.
good,Es un lugar estricto en cuestión de higiene y limpieza de área aunque si existen ciertas normas que falta reforzar
good,"A great company to work with, but with hardcore sales, management is poor, no job retention. Also supply chain management is not working properly"
good,"aprendí a mantener una cartera de clientes saludable"
good,typical work day was driving to 3-14 different stores per day to deliver product. some days i was in a 53' semi other days i was in a 16 bay side loader semi. Being in the side loader was a difficult because you were required to hand unload hundreds of cases of pop and beverages and wheel it into the store by 2 wheeled dolly and stock shelves. most of the time the truck were not loaded properly with the correct product which effected my pay because i was paid commision my number of cases delivered. so if the wrong product was on the truck i could not take in the product because i was not needed causing a loss in pay
good,"Pay is great, co workers are great, work load is ridiculous. Great place to start working but not a good place for a career, most people do not retire, they get hurt and can't work anymore"
good,"fazer o que vc gosta ,tratar as pessoas com educaçao ,ter respeito o cliente sempre te razao  acomunicaçao ajuda bastante na hora da venda saber dar seu limite de amizade ."
good,Ser flexibles aportar lo máximo para tener un mejor desempeño
good,I'm a full time employee getting part time hours. Some days I don't think I get treated fairly. I'm finding it hard to get by on these hours. Being a single parent and working pay cheque to pay cheque is beyond difficult.
good,"Meet drivers at stores set up displays clear out back room get shelves filled, hit 6 to 8 stores a day, self motivated, work alone most days, during sales very long hours,"
good,"Mi día de trabajo comienza a las 6:00 am, donde se presenta un informe de resultados y se da salida de rutas, se le ofrece servicio al cliente en contacto directo de mis venderos con el mismo es la parte mas agradable, lo mas pesado es el horario que maneja la empresa, ya que iniciamos el día a las 6:00 am y terminamos a las 10:00 pm y no contamos con apoyos para realizar actividades de nuestro trabajo."
good,"Time management,friendly coworkers,amercian style of work,24 hour plant running so planning is very crucial.The hardest part is that you have to work more than duty period in case of emergency"
good,I got to know a lot of good people at people but I must say that their is limited room for growth unless you are a college recruit.
good,"Working with the people was great and have a great bunch of customers, hours are not bad but they constantly have changes in management"
good,"precion como en todas pero sustentable"
good,Responsible for managing the day to day operations at PepsiCo’s  multimillion dollar Research and Development laboratory.

good,"Bons avantages"
good,buen trabajo no tiene horario de salida no hay ruta fija venta de hogar casa por casa
good,es una empresa que toma muy en cuenta al trabajador ya que se puede hacer carrera dentro de ella
good,The starts by checking what are the priorities. Make rounds and spot the things that needs immediate action. There is not enough manpower for repair works if not related to production. Learned scheduling and prioritizing. The workers are not happy to be working outside of their normal place of work. It challenges us to solve the problems even without full support.
good,worked ther fore 16 years. and on time each day no problemes.And have good friends there to day a great worker help out when need.Wish i was there with them.loaded trucks and unloaded trucks all day with no help.
good,"work as a quality officer,"
good,"Gained much experience work the 3rd shift which was fun. I learned how to help the customers and also learn a lot about merchandising, each day is a new day. Co workers were great, the hardest part of the job was double work from employees that did not take care of their job."
good,"The hardest part of the the job is to wake -up early in the morning, travelling with in 1 and 20 mins from Pasay to Muntinlu[pa."
good,"I learned a lot about the truckers and what they needed to do. It made my job a little easier talking to the customer and where they needed to go on a daily bases. I enjoys working with the management there. Just no job security. I would collect money from the drivers, count it, and enter the data in MS Excel. Did some filing there made copies of everything in and out of the office."
good,"Dit is was typische werk per dag : Basis product controleren op defecten met behulp van de lightbox en de"
good,Very disorganized and overwork their employees. The managers are very disorganized and do not communicate with their employees about the job expectations. Store managers are rude and mean. Every store has work for two people.
good,as long as you get your job done it's a great place to work. must have car and must be able to work over time. rough start if your not physically fit.
good,"My experience with PepsiCo was exciting fun and fast,they have a false sense of security  when it comes to expectations on contract employees as expecting them to have the background business process knowledge that equates to 20 + years of knowledge of the functional operation. The team environment is friendly and management has frequent one on one meetings with the employees. I would say the hardest part of work for PepsiCo is their misconception of expectations on new hires and notice of being relived of your duties in short to no notice."
good,working at the sales department is my career and hobby but it is very demanding for almost 6 days a week almost 10 hours a day
good,"On a typical workday I would leave my house and clock in in my work van. The epad would tell me what calls I had and where. I would log in the location into my GPS. I would then proceed to my first job and fixed what ever was wrong with that particular equipment."
good,Soy trabajador informal trabajo para ellos pero no pertenesco a su nomina.
good,Good management and plenty of room for advancement.  Very very labor intensive work environment. Would be and is a great place to work but cooking is my passion and would like to apply my experience and passion to something more food related.  Great benefits which is why I chose to take this job.  Pay is inconsistent because it is all based on sales and commission.
good,"no work life balance backroom people a stores are rude. They think there manager for some kind of reason,. Plus thing your on your own. You can work at your own pace but its hard work. You usually work about six stores."
good,"Good estsblished company to work for, good pay.  Good company support to be able to perform daily tasks"
good,"La convivencia diaria con todos los vendedores ,asi como el trato con el cliente ,aprendes a escuchar las necesidades de tus clientes ,para poder hacerles recomendaciones para incrementar sus ventasy asi aplicas el ganar ganar,debes de tener buenos lideres para motivarte a conseguir las metas que te piden,el ambiente de compañerismo es bueno pues son como tu segunda familia ya que pasas demasiado tiempo con ellos, lo mas dificil es que sacrificas mucho a la familia , pero se recompensa con la remuneracion de tu trabajo y el reconocimiento por tu buen desempeño con premios y regalos."
good,PepsiCo Direct in my current position I make inbound and outbound calls time lapse between each call usually would be 5-10 seconds apart no an average day. If you have the ability to grow and become successful pepsi offers great benefits and even pays commission. Doesn't hurt to try.
good,"A typical day at work was starting out around 6 A.M. and finishing up around 2 or 3 P.M. getting Pepsi Products and stocking the shelves, coolers, and displays until filled also maintaining the backroom where the Pepsi Products are. The hardest part of the job was having to pull the full skids of Pepsi Products onto the store floor. They can get heavy. What makes it even more horrible was using a bad jack then your working twice as hard. Co-Workers weren't that bad. They were always willing to help. Management was just ok, they could have been better. Receivers and Grocery Store Managers are terrible. They are very cranky and rude to you. There really wasn't anything enjoyable about the job. It's just a job and that's it."
good,"Buenos colegas,de los cuales pude aprender y asi afianzarmeen mis responsabilidades rapidamente"
good,"job culture was very nice, co-operate each other, directly in contact with GM, trained in various fields like branding, customer relationship, complaint dept.."
good,good company just too much has change over the years due to the economy. a big restructure is needed. typical day can run from 8-12hrs depending on work load. work by yourself nobody on your back but dealing with customers can sometimes be difficult
good,"Financially rewarding place to work."
good,"Normalmente o expediente é de 8h as 17h com intervalo de 1h de almoço. Durante o dia recebemos ligações dos vendedores e promotores passando os pedidos até às 13h, após esse horário se inicia o processo de análise e liberação dos pedidos, terminado esse processo fazemos algumas atividades de controle. Temos contato diário com a gerência que nos auxilia sempre que necessário. A relação entre os funcionários é bem cordial e até mesmo descontraída gerando um bom ambiente de trabalho. Como parte difícil posso destacar as falhas do sistema."
good,todos nos llevabamosmuy bien..... buen apoyo entre promotores y demostradores.
good,"Promotions Clerk."
good,"*  aprendi  a  llevar  con  mucha  frecuencia  manejos  de conflictos, fue  de  una gran experiencia.."
good,Overall good company to work for provided that you work in the right department/office
good,I worked there  for 6 years the pay is great management is terrible the workers run the place. You tell them about I people doing drugs at work and they do nothing about it . I liked working there but hard to move up never get in days .They have good things for employees like golf and family day but need to worry about safety ALOT more .

good,"on a typical day, i'll be just typing stuff that my supervisor gave me."
good,"I have my own designated route of 5 stores. I manage product inventory, write orders, sell in new product, as well as our company's different programs and selling initiatives each week/month. Aside from sales, I also merchandise and stock shelves and coolers, as well as build displays. The management team is friendly, professional, and helpful. The hardest part about this job is finding a way to manage my time properly with having to not only sell, but constantly merchandise as well. The most enjoyable part of this job for me is commuting throughout the day and meeting with store directors to discuss selling initiatives and programs. I enjoy interacting with people. "
good,"Pepsi pays good, but the job is very back breaking. But my co-workers where great, and management was good"
good,Good place to work. But it seems like mediocrity is their standard.
good,"Manage twenty accounts daily (B2B), in a challenge marketplace. With profits shirking customers are quickly to find ways to increase their profit margins. I quickly and effectively overcome these challenges you using my sales skills effectively to capture sales. Along with driving incremental sales by introducing innovate sale into the marketplace."
good,good supervisors and managers. seem to really care. frequent days off.
good,"I worked 2nd shift and a typical work day started with getting load sheets from management to see what product went on the trucks that needed loading, some truck needed very little and some were almost empty when they arrived to the warehouse. I learned how to work faster and more efficiently, because there was a bonus program that pepsi had. The employee who had the highest average at the end of the week, with the less errors from building a pallet of product from the load sheets got a bonus of some type. My warehouse supervisor was supportive. I had very helpful co-workers, when I started they got together and showed me the ins and outs of loading trucks, also how to make the job easier on me, advise that I passed on to co-workers who came after me. There was not really a hard part of the job I did, it was just mostly lifting and loading. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work experience and working with a great crew."

Aprendí técnicas en ventas y a saber identificar oportunidades de cierre. Tuve varios colegas aun que no los procuraba ya que cada quien trabajaba su ruta.Lo que mas me gusto fue esa solidaridad que te da la empresa como miembro ya que te exige pero te ayuda a ganar.No me gusto fue que:se interpuso una situación de peligro de aborto en mi esposa y no me permitieron estar con ellos."
good,There are many advancement opportunities within the organization for those with strong management relationships.
good,I've worked around many people while at the same time maintained pepsi commodity.
good,Once you have arrived at the customers store we recieve the ordered merchandise and disribute it and respond to any special request. Time management is important and good communication is needed with co-workers to be most effecient for the team. Hoildays and special sales were always a challange and requried more hours and harder work but it made it worth it to make our team goals at the end of the month.
good,"Been here for a few months, it's a decent job with decent advancement opportunity."
good,A typical day at the job was stating at five in the morning and getting off at five in the evening. The greatest part of the job was that you worked alone and you got to meet different people every day.
good,"I have never worked for a fortune 500 company who promised you incentives to be paid out that I won and either lacked or never paid them out. Give you a used gift card for $20 that was worth $7.50 and good only for a mall in Dallas, TX. You are overworked. It is paid exercise though. Communication is very lacking and management game plan to carry out to displine employees is lacking and inconsistant."
good,"Bons benefícios; Oportunidade de desenvolvimento, busca metas; alta rotatividade de gerentes, o que dificulta devido a mudanças constantes."
good,"last minute orders continually require ee flexibility.  This makes it difficult to attain work-life balance. Pay and benefits are good, advancement opportunities are good"
good,"it is okay to work here. but a lot depends on manager."
good,"truck of pallets to unload, stocking the shelves and coolers, always rotation stock...place pays decent, some drama with center people in company but otherwise not to bad"
good,"The company offers a fair wage for the work as long as your willing to learn on the job and meet the minimum requirements.  The only negative about the job is the ""open"" time frame after you start your shift, meaning that you'll be there as long as it takes to finish whatever work orders are ready. (Can sometimes be overwhelming in the summer and towards holidays)."
good,Enjoyed day to day work  money and employees with good work ethics and morals activities activities fast paced work and good activities fast paced work and good work and good
good,"Typical day at work is, start at 4:30 am "
good,"it was a good place to work. made good money. flexible work hours and good managment. "
good,"You were assigned more work than an average 8 hour day could take care of. To stay ahead required at least 10 hours per day. The compensation was good, excellent benefits."
good,Always on time and willing to learn new skills have a lot of job history so got a lot of experience doing a lot of different things always on time take my job seriously
good,"Alot of work, but the pay check brings ya back. Awesome benefits as well. Early hours for drivers, late hours for warehouse. Plenty of overtime every week"
good,"I liked it so much I came back. It is a really fun place to be. There are lots of great minds working together. It is a diverse culture, and everyone is very kind to one another."
good,Buen sueldo. Buen ambiente laboral. Bueno en general
good,"Be prepared to hustle all day , equipment needs to be up to date, and the pay needs to be moved up the other companies have added helpers on their trucks and also have pay raises across the bored"
good,La jefa era muy estricta y aprendí mucho de ella. Lo malo era el sueldo de la compañía.
good,"The pay was great, no argument there. The occassional additional hours could be frustrating. High turnover rate for the loaders made it difficult to maintain things. Female workers do not tend to stick around at all. Mgmt, more than anything, made things harder than they had to be. And there was a lack of follow through at times. As far as the workers, the FMLA policy ruins the place and it appears that everyone was too afraid to touch the subject. Again, it is difficult to maintain consistency when attendance is poor."
good,PespiCo was an amazing place to build & hone my hard and soft skill set. Jobs generally last from 18-36 months before switching roles. An excellent place for people to begin their career.
good,"A empresa me ajudou muito,não somente no que diz respeito no profissional como também pra vida! É uma empresa que visa bastante pelo bem estar e segurança do funcionário."
good,"Working with PepsiCo company in average the company itself seemed to be a good place. Administration, and store management was unfair, but my direct supervisor, who warehouse manager was super."
good,"Pros:"
good,My manager was great she communicated with us so good.   The team was great and I process and trained my pears in Oracle.    Being a team player works great too.
good,"Pepsi Beverages Company is a decent place to work. Great benefits and room to grow and advance your career if you work hard and explicitly express an interest in it. Management is generally friendly but borders on incompetent with crucial information given late with varying degrees of accuracy, with an accompanying expectation to perform as if the information was accurate and provided in a timely fashion. They do not at all encourage a healthy work/life balance, with an expectation to work 45-50 hours even if the work can be completed well within 40."
good,"Good place to work but , structure of plant needs change . Need better supervision with knowledge of company . People are great almost like family . Lack of knowledge in all fields to many college recruits. Interaction with coworkers made job tolerable an okay to be at ."
good,Hard work with a lot of responsibilities. No bosses hanging over you unless you’re in town not so much family oreinted. Counted on to take care of all accounts.
good,"I worked here for 3 months along with 15 other new people, and before I left the company, 13 other people had already quit. This job is very demanding. Management expects you to stock and merchandise many of the stores you service. This is time consuming and tiring  because you have to be fast and courteous to many customers who take your job for granted. I was a very good  worker and I still got treated  like a has-been by some customers and managers when I was there. But all I needed was time to find another job, because I knew my first week that I wasn't going to stay there. In the end, I proved my point."
good,"I Learned How to be a team player , Learned how to work on PLC, , Hardest part of the job was lifting motors and taking them up flights of steps, I enjoyed working with the vendors the most , a day at  work was making calls , inventory , Receiving Parts in E maint,"
good,"A typical day at work is redundant.  Although, my manager is a good guy, he only delegates, because he does not know the job. I was hired in 2000, and I had excellent training, and support. Over the last 18 years, I as well as 90% of the employees stay in a position on average 25 years.  So, there is no room for advancement. "
good,Well the last time I was with them was ages ago there company I has evolved to new levels. May input would be meaningless.so I’ll just keep my comments to myself
good,"it was a good experience i would recommend it to my friends "
good,"It used to be a very good place to work, but the environment has has changed for the worse.  Too many useless rules, and the supervisors are mostly school kids"
good,"Accounting department was a great place to work for. I have been there for many years. Over the years, I had many different managers. Most of them were good. They reward you for a job well done."
good,"The local business leadership team was great to work with; however, I have never met a less motivated or irresponsible work force. Callouts were rampant and I found myself delivering the product at the last minute so often that it affected carrying out my work. If money was my main motivator this would have been a good job."
good,"Hambiente lavoral tranquilo..desayuno gratis,apoyo entre compañeros."
good,I go in around 6 or 6:30 in the morning.  I've learned more then I ever thought I would about Pepsi Beverages.  I love my boss he has been very understanding because my mom was really sick. It's pretty cool.. Everyone for the most part is very friendly.  The hardest part for me is having to wear steel toe boots.  I really enjoy the team building activities that we do.
good,I love my team they are very friendly and they thought me how to work stress free and learnt new things in excel like vlookup pivot table hlookup macros this is quite a good company for any freshers
good,This job is like lifting weights all day.  You must be quick on your feet and think fast.  Managers are great.  People are helpful.  This job is physically demanding.
good,"Holidays are a rush, close for one day that's a holiday and work the Saturday prior and the Saturday after a closure to make up for it. always short staffed, working 80 plus hours a week."
good,"Like any other job its competitive, face paced, cut-throat.  The atmosphere was great but like any public work place bullys exist all over.  Do your work, stay quiet let bullies be bullies, self motivated job.  Great place just work-place bullies run the show."
good,"The only thing I thought was unfair was the pay scale.  Most employees were paid very well.  Maybe 600 to 1000 a week, while receptionist were only paid half the salary of everyone else while still having to maintain a heavy workload and constant changes in policy and job duties.

It was   sometime stressful, in the event that production had to keep moving, and sometimes there were just too many things down and preventing production from running.  In my first few years I learned what to address when and where to enable the line to run smoothly."
good,Pepsi is definitely good at paying you for service but the toll it takes on your body is a lot. they depend on you a lot and need you for things other than that its good place to work
good,"Very fast-paced environment with long hours. Very early mornings and late nights are common. Management is overall supportive and understanding, but communication could be greatly improved. Amazing benefits."
good,"PepsiCo is a great company with great benefits and pay. However, the work/life balance is very hard to achieve when reaching any sales goal or quota. The people are very welcoming and hardworking as well."
good,Good place to work. Great benefits and great hours. Pay was good too. Shady management though. At the end I had to watch my back. I was taken from a route that I earned to be made an example of. I had to take photos of every account I worked in because of the collusion between management and sales reps.

good,I provided the company with a 2 month notice so that they would have the time for find my replacement. Funny thing that 8 of us left the company on the same day including my boss!  This was only at the Indianapolis location. I was at a point of time in my life that I didn't have to work anymore.  This gave me a great opportunity to quit and pursue a medically related career.
good,Very exhausting job. Understaffed at the moment so it puts a lot of work on the people that work here. Would be a great job if we can keep people in the company.
good,"I like the company as far as being on your own and working at your own pace. The problem with this company is the turnover rate. They cannot keep anyone to save their lives and the ones who suffer for it are the current employees. Two other problems I have with this company is the fact that they don't pay mileage and that Merchandisers don't get any kind of weekend off, yet they love to call you and ask you to work on your DAY OFF after they nearly killed you during the week. I would suggest anyone unless you really need a job do not work here as a merchandiser. You will have no life."

good,"dia típico  é  puxado pois  você  precisa  de  resolver  mil  problemas   de  uma  só  vez e é  bastante  complicado, como  assistente  aprendi  muita  coisa  que nas  antigas  empresas  não  fazia como  como  ser  um  bom escutador  de  historias de  vida  dos  funcionarios, bastante  coisa que você  aprende historias de  vida  incriveis  que  a pessoa conseguiu superar.A direçao  é  muito  rigorasa a gerencia  nem  tanto  a diretoria  fica  na  matriz  em  Sao Paulo, ja  a gerencia  fica  lado  a  lado  dos  funcionarios acho  isso  bacana  pois  os colegas de trabalho   dão satisfação  a gerencia mesmo  sem  pedir,eles  sabem  que tem  um  cargo  assima  deles    e respeitam  isso. A parte  mais  dificil  do  trabalho  é  que  a minha  coordenadora  era  de  Goias e  eu  era  a frente  que  ligava  os  problemas  que  aconteciam  aqui   em  Minas e não  tinha  nenhuma  assistente  de  rh  de  Goias  aqui e  ai  passavam  pra  coordenadora  uma  coisa  distorcida e  ela  me  cobrava.A parte  mais  agradavel  era  fazer parte   de um  evento  que  englobava  todos  os  funcionarios   da pespico."

Also, printing out invoices for each customer and collecting money where needed. The hardest part was getting up in the morning and the most enjoyable part was being able to be out of the office and meeting new people and helping them get the product they needed for the week. Was a very free job really when you get done you are done for day. And while out in truck you were free from being in the office in the same spot for 8-12 hrs a day."
good,"This is a very competitive, energy driven and  innovative company.   Work life balance can be a challenge.  The company requires 125% which is great but you have to have the drive.  There are opportunities to move throughout the company unfortunately relocation might be the only option."
good,Everyday is a busy day at finance office and certain records and documents needs to be updated and recorded. I learned to be patient and being s self starter.

good,"good job"
good,The best thing about PepsiCo are the people you work around and the benefits they provide. The only real downfall is the incompetent management and the unfair union rules. The managers have never done the job the workers are doing and the union makes them pay the motivated workers the same as the lazy workers. There is no room for advancement or compensation for going above and beyond.

I would check in with store management and go over any questions and /or concerns they may have. I would take inventory of product that I had on the shelves and in the stock room, then fill product as needed. My co-workers were always willing to help if needed and all worked well together. The management team were always there for any questions or concerns I had. They would also show how grateful they were for all your hard work.

good,A typical day would include traveling to different stores to execute displays and promotions. I most enjoyed meeting new people in new places.
good,"A typical day consisted of stopping at 15-25 pre-determined stops in your geographical territory. At each stop you would check in with the manager or owner, and then take care of whatever needs they had. Any place other than a restaurant you merchandised the product into coolers or displays. You would constantly check for ad changes, and then have to change your point of sale material. There were lots of times that we were given the wrong information and then would have to scramble to make or find appropriate price points."

good,en esta empresa me desempeñaba como tecnico y operador de maquinas de empaque con manejo de programa y personal a cargo.
good,Working at pepsi was an ok experience at best. The schedule has to be one of the worse. I started with a tues-sat schedule which quickly turned to fri-tues a week after being hired with no warning prior. The work is hard and taxing on the body.

good,"This job is great for entry level. Very family oriented. No opportunity for advancement. Wages never increase. Those are literally the only two negative things about it. Aside from that, great work environment, and they work with you with anything that you may possibly need help with. The hours are great also."
good,"This was my first ever job, which I landed back in 2011, and from the get go I was held to a high expectation. The only downside was that it was a small store so hours were sometimes inconvenient and management didn't take to kindly to small mistakes, even though it was my first job."
good,Excellent Company and Pay. Horrible work schedule. Work 13 days in a row just to get one day off. Your work days are 8 hours but 12 if you have to cover for people.

good,Challenging and fun place to work. Managers understanding and willing to work to help strike a balance between work life and home life.
good,"Load and unload stock from trucks while counting stock using a pick application, I refreshed my skills on the forklift while working with Pepsi, my management and co-workers work hard but treat me like an outsider. The hardest part of my job is going in and worrying about whether or not my job will be threatened again. The most enjoyable part of my job is that as long as they let me, I can put my head down and focus on the task at hand without issue; benefits are great, and being able to stay in town to be with my family is good."
good,"Although things may be different now, but during my time at Pepsico., I felt like they were almost under-employed when it came to merchandisers. An average day for me would be: I'd have around 7-8 stores maybe even more and usually you spend between 45min - 2 hours per store. So as you can see, having a life away from this job isn't easy at all. Hours are usually 7 am to 5 pm but don't be surprised if you work all the way to 9 pm sometimes. "
good,"Hours too long, hourly pay rate too short. Very physical plus work load and hours not consistent. Higher pay would keep more employees. Like 16.00/hr"

good,During my career at PepsiCo I performed most of the jobs that were hourly work. When I started it was Quaker Oats and was a great place to work. However after the acquisition by Pepsi many things changed in the way things were done at all levels and it was much less favourable from an employee point of view. Pepsi decided to close the plant in 2009 and trying to acquire another suitable job has been difficult. The people I worked with were always terrific and quick to help. The most enjoyable thing for me was the stability of knowing a solid job was there for me every day.
good,The management is nice and will work with you but we get paid but the load and work 10-12 hours a day so I feel like I need a job making the money for the hours I work
good,Loved the people just had a better opportunity it’s like family they even gave me a chance to come back after I got my cdl . This company really appreciates there customer.

good,"Fun work environment. Very relaxed, not super high strong or overly professional, very lax environment. Could use some imp[orvment from valuing lower prospective."
good,Pepsi is a decent job but the job is very labor intensive when most truck driving jobs you can just drive and make more money.  Pepsi isn't going anywhere so it is a good place to work if you are worried about job security.

good,"i loved Saturdays because in early hours you will find me with speaking to the colleagues to know about their weekly targets and meeting with them for half and hour for the next week targets.and rest of the week goes in putting data in the computer, updating daily reports.answering emails and calls from our seniors.my roles involve extensive management responsibilities and staying organized is not option."
good,"Pepsico es una empresa que paga muy bien, te da muchas facilidades para desempeñar tu trabajo, tiene excelentes prestaciones que muchas grandes empresas no ofrecen pero es muy demandante de tiempo, hay mucha presión y mucho stress.  Te mantiene alejado de la familia y el día menos pensado, cuando ya tienes 20 años o más de laborar, simplemente te despiden."
good,I would go into work at 6am every week day.  I then will load the truck with the equipment that I will be using that day for the account.  I learn all the different components there are for just getting a simple drink from a fountain unit.  Before I didn't look at the big picture of what and how much is used to get a simple fountain soda.  If the soda water isn't to the right temperature the soda could become flat and may even lose its carbonation.  I would say the hardest part of the job is if something goes wrong with the equipment when you fire it up and you have to determine what went wrong and how to fix it to get it to work.  The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the finished product.
good,"Aprendí  de todo... generalista de Recursos Humanos"

good,A typical day at works starts with being prompt clocking in and starting to set up my line. That involves counting bottles turning on machines and making sure the volumes are set correctly. I also make sure the line speed is set to upc matching caps and codes to be allowed to read send and set. every 7 bottle are to be checked weighed marked and placed aside for a.p.d. to collect. my co-workers keep the line going as i keep account for the line. As long as we put it together and use our skills properly we can finish up a pallet within a 30 time period. The hardest part of my job would be if the line stops and breaks down. That will set us back at times but that where the team plays a roll. The most enjoyable part about my job is getting the line back up and running and catching up on time. Once I know I have completed my job in a timely order is when I become satisfied with myself and my job. I love to get my project complete and finish all projects to the best of my ability.

good,I learned a great deal of knowledge and assets within PepsiCo. I enjoyed my time with the company and feel that I bettered myself within.
good,a lot of work. long days. most managers or cool. when i first started was a lot of freedom.
good,the hardest part of the is that you will have to carry a lot of creates and arrange them in the warehouse and the fun part is that you get a lot of free freshment
good,"A healthy crew and fun people to work with. I wish management was a lot more organized. The work can be a bit hefty at times, but with proper technique, you can work your shift in a healthy way."
good,poca disposición de los jefes y gerencia para ejercer alguna oportunidad laboral.
good,Just working 14 to 16 hours a day hardly had time for life i mean on the weekends but all I did was sleep because I was so tired all the time it's really not a bad job
good,empresa boa mais o ruim era a lider que nao sabe rosolver nada na empresa
good,"If you can take extreme physical labor and like the money it provides it's a great job.  The breaks are short, but there is music and the ability to talk and have fun while you work also."
good,"Ambiente bueno ,muchos beneficios como tranporte a cargo de la empresa ,comedor en planta sueldo pago en tiempo y forma .vaucher fechas especiales . Turnos rotativos mañana,tarde y noche. Pudiendo cambiar los turnos con otro empleado."
good,"Starting off is a bit rough. Be prepared to work a lot depending on the route you have. I was working a minimum of 13-15 hour days consistently. I would wake up before dawn Go to a few stores, conduct an inventory and then make a Pepsi order for that place of business. I would say the hardest part of the job is working alone for 68-74 hrs a week."
good,Lack of workplace culture.  Have a sales team but no competition within teams.  Low moral with senior front-line employees.
good,"Muy buenas personas,equipo de ventas exelente, chicos que salen a pelear todos los objetivos, sin palabras."
good,"its a very great work environment, very fun and its so much to partake in especially charitable events, my co-workers are the best set of people I've ever worked with, coming to work doesn't feel like pressure. PepsiCo has its moments when you really have to put your best foot forward but in the end it's worth it!!"
good,"Job is long, hard and very demanding.  Benefits are awesome and the company as a whole is a good place to work for.  However, the amount of work that is involved is sometimes ridiculous"
good,"É uma empresa que muito motivadora,organização total da parte finaceira e gerencia, todos sempre prontos para melhor auxiliar todos os colaboradores."
good,we had a good crew we put out good product it was fun to work there the first 10yrs until we started hiring supervisors in houses judgement got cloudy after that
good,its a good place to work. think fast move fast kinda jobs. you have to learn 8 jobs in 10 days some jobs is hard to do in ten. great pay and benefits tho. 
good,.muito bom
good,"A Pepsico me auxilou muito em meus conhecimentos, além de me fornecer uma grande experiência profissional."
good,"Es un ambiente de trabajo arduo, bajo presion ya que en la actualidad las ventas por unidad es de 2 a 10, la posicion de Coca Cola en el mercado es dominante y todo el esfuerzo en el punto de ventas es contra ellos, y eso para mi era de motivacion al igual el personal a mi cargo salia con la misma linea a conseguir mejores espacios para nuestros productos y nuestros equipos de refrigeracion tenerlos a primera vista"
good,"You are paid well but you feel like i have earned every single penny. You can start your day anywhere from 430-630 am, coming in more early means you beat traffic but its up to you. Overtime is never a problem, you could sit in the office and gain hours after you where done with your day, all they cared about is that you finished your route and all the deliveries where made correctly. You get paid hourly if you aren't doing a route all 5 days of the week and are sent out in a van to help others for example. You get paid salary+ commision if you ran a route all 5 days of the week. Very tought job. Until you get a route, you will be a spare driver where you will cover other guys who have called out for example."
good,My experience with the PepsiCo brand were very professional. I learn it was a way to represent yourself at work. How to be productive with your time. Making decisive decisions in a repeated fast pace.
good,It was a great company to work for but after my first year. I asked for my week vacation and for benefits start and I didn't receive. Notice about them and I got upset and left

good,me gustas las ventas por q me gusta trabajar bajo presion me gusta llegar al odjetivo siempre y eso me motiva para resaltar en mis ventas con mis compañeros llevar un ambiente armonica y profecional
good,"A empresa e uma empresa muito boa para se trabalhar; tive um grande aproveitamento neste tempo q estive trabalhando nela, tem um bom gerenciamento as pessoas são de boa convivência, a parte mais dificil era quando chegava varios insumos para receber e ter que fazer as analises necessarias, mas tinha varias partes agradável que era o aprender algo novo a cada dia!"
good,I learned to become more punctual come early as i could and be responsible to the assifned work. My co-workers is very approachable if i dont know what i do they simply teaches me what should i do. Be patient to the assigned work dont hot-headed the hardest part of my current work is that if one of the delivery docs is lost. The most enjoyable is that if i accomplished something and my Boss like it.
good,"Great place to work awesome benefits plenty of room for advancement a plenty of overtime year around you get help when "
good,"i am the best salesman on company.."
good,i am working with pepsico when ever boss suport us then he should leave the job i thought its ok but next boss not support us like he is not good cominicater

good,typical day at the whig is great because everyone on our shift gets along we can all communicate and we all help eachother out . Everyone has theyre own strenths and weaknesses so you know who to ask to do certain tasks. working at the whig has taught be how to work hard count fast and dont get envolved with any gossip. During the 27 years at the whig Iv had some great co workers some crazy coworkers and some very mean and toxic co workers. The best group has been the group Im with now. Its like a family. The hardest part of my job is wednesday night . We have 5 different papers to put out that night . At x-mas time the bundles of paper are huge and heavy. Thats when I love it best I love the challenge . The bigger and heavier the more interest I have in going and going ............
good,"the hardest part of the job, is how to execute safety system for the front-liners to be there first priority in there daily work time mainly."
good,Uma empresa que da oportunidade para o colaborador.
good,"It was fair for the most part except that I worked such long hours my family never saw me anymore, and I never got to do anything anymore.  I was working upwards of 80 hours a week.  At first it was only around forty but then it began to get a little out of control.  The manager was always ""sniffing.""  That was my first experience with someone snorting coke.  He didn't even bother to hide it as well."
good,"Typical day-extremely busy, workload huge, various tasks"
good,"boring workplace, politics, people management, no inclusion n diversity"
good,"It was easy to work on the assembly line so i enjoy working the try to apply to work as a"
good,"My day starts with making a great product that consumers love.  I've learned what it takes to produce and distribute a beverage, how to keep it safe and how to work safely while being alert and attentive.  Sometimes the dysfunction of a few managers may be harmful to the overall atmosphere of the work force.  My co-workers are very special and hard working people.  The hardest part of my job is the constantly walking up and down stairs that are apart of my work area.  My machine has stairs that I travel up and down in an eight hour period could exceed over fifty times or more.  The most enjoyable part of my job is my co-workers and seeing a finished product that we have made on the shelf at my favorite grocery stores."
good,Good job for the most part! I would recommend to a friend.. pay is good..  benefits are good.. Currently employed 7 years and going great place to work for younger individuals!
good,no fui satisfecho de como tratan los empleados los jefes no te evaluan no te contestan cuando les marca por cualquiera cosa
good,"Examine what my accounts need, checking the status of product, equipment orders, and fill back stock for future order. Then the sellings starts. Finding opportunity to increase volume and yield dividends for the company.  I learned how to sell, when to sell, what to sell customers in different geographical areas. In addition, i learned the power of numbers including, customers index, P&L, and margins percentages. My co-workers are great individuals, and we are all like one big family. The hardest part of my job is not sealing the deal with customers. I take it personal when I am not able to sell in a deal, or create value in an account. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing that my advice, hard work and selling ability has yielded my customers major dividends and they see growth."
good,"Dia de Trabalho tranquilo"
good,"My typical day is work start with managing budgets, working with vendors, advertising agency and Pepsi International, managing events and promotions. I learned about about the carbonated beverage industry and working with managment in an international capacity. I am the only one in marketing department so my main interaction is with Accounting department. The hardest part of my job is managing all brands in full 360 campaign. The most enjoyable part is executing events."
good,"I recommend other to join pepsico because you get to  know how to deal with a people and facing challenges which is quite interesting for me .."
good,PepsiCo is a good company to work for. The hours are ridiculously long though. Management was horrible when I was there. Great weekly pay. Travel far to location of route.
good,"A PepsiCo sempre foi uma empresa de nome e renome no mercado de salgadinhos (Elma Chips). Gostei pelo tempo que trabalhei por lá principalmente aprendi a lidar com grandes hipermercados. A única restrição é que não tínhamos muita vida pessoal, pois tínhamos que trabalhar todos os finais de semana."
good,There was little communication between departments which was hard. As well as lots of micromanaging from CFO that was not trained on other areas of the company. Certain people were allowed to just take money out of the cash drawer leaving it unbalanced at times.  There is very little work/life balance. Personal private information was left laying around for all to see. Account Payable questions every hospital visit made under the insurance. HIPPA Guidelines are not followed.
good,Serviço diario de atendimento a clientes na Grande Vitoria
good,I like the job but i just dont like the work life balance.  They work you 60 to 70 hours a week.  You are never off. 24 doing working.  If you don't like working 60 to 80 a week dont apply
good,"Pepsi was purchased as I was advancing. They decided my position was not needed. After I left, they re-created the position when they realized how important it was."
good,"I would not recommend  them to anyone. Very unproffesional company, management has not skills in the field what so ever."
good,Walk into different accounts and service them as well. Writing orders and keeping a great communication with the staff and management in those stores.
good,"salary good but no stability"
good,"Es una empresa con un alto nivel de exigencia y dedicación."
good,"Pepsi is awful about timely raises, and once you are in a position offers little to no room for advancement or even lateral moves. I excelled at the job I was in, and since it was undesirable to anyone else, I was blocked from attaining other positions within the company. Also their pay is not fair, and I was 4 months past my one year mark when I quit and still had not gotten my 1 year evaluation or raise."
good,"Very Productive but not fun because of continental shift pattern, last year management improved slightly unfortunately there was bad management before that"
good,"I would get a service call on my ipad and then i would go repair the machines, after i get done i have to call for more work and some times there was not any to do, the management keeps watching to see if you are not working at times."
good,"a great place to work if you like inter acting with customers,,besides that poor management-scheduling heavy equipement moving was a major obsticle for a single person"
good,"Debido a la operación de la compañía es muy absorbente alrededor de 13 horas de trabajo de lunes a sábado."
good,"Positives Great pay Great benefits. Ken Bradley is the best boss I have ever had."
good,"The work environment is not the greatest to work in, there seems to be a constant cloud of pop mist which makes it hard to breath at times. The management expects you to be available to produce 100% all of the time, no mistakes. There are some good point however , low turn over rate, great pension, experienced trades men to work with."
good,"Empresa não investe em crescimento de funcionários, não da valor a funcionários que se destacam, a gerencia da mais valor em amizades do que competencia."
good,"a typical day at work - month end is target day like 30 ,31"
good,"Interesting work place,computer vocie pick system flawed never the less overall good company to work for."
good,i learned about the industries working process &all utility maintenance.
good,PepsiCo is a family affair. If you do not personally know people with PepsiCo it is very hard to become one of the crew. The work shifts and management are as varied as snowflakes.
good,Aangename collega's op de werkvloer zelf. Corrupte HR. Franse taal beheersen wel interessant.
good,great company to work for. poor management at ontario ohio location. i would advise somone to obtain employment and then transfer to another location for better opportunities.
good,The work at Pepsi is easy but busy. You will always need to find something to do. You get 2 breaks (10 min & 20 min) both are paid. You get free drinks if they are in the breakroom.
good,"Un dia tipico: Procesos administrativos a ejecutar"
good,"Started out as intern then went to Special Events and onto Merhcandiser then to Sale Rep.  This was a great place to learn how the corporate world works.  I learned and saw a lot here.  I earned a ton of cash and at an early age as an Intern and Special Events Coordinator (Union). Once I became an At-will employee the salary and commission were good but were stymied by a corporate change in leadership.  This caused all of my drive to succeed to leave and then I was gone.   "
good,"Fast paced place"
good,"days start earl at about 4or 5 am must make it to all of yours stores everyday , you are given two days off per week , must spend some time review sales and specials throughtout the week. Must talk to store managers at every store about sales and product placement. Must get to know back room receivers and grocery managers and deal with their attitudes on a daily basis"
good,Es una excelente empresa que administra y la ingeniera no se considera solo para externos
good,Not Really A lot of Management Long Hours To Much Over Time Just not a good Feeling to work in A lot of tension low work Moral no understanding for the workers.
good,falta um pouco de atenção com os funcionarios as vezes! Mas é um ótimo lugar para se trabalhar.
good,"Negative working environment. Many unhappy people that work there. They demand a lot of their employees. Long hours and hardly any days. It’s a very negative impact on family life. Management hired by favoritism and not qualifications. If your not in the circle then your an outcast. Proper training is lacking and certification needed ingored. Not all is negative because opportunities are there to advance but you must fit in. If not, then it’s you against them."
good,"Great company to work for, if you do not have a family, worked on average of 60 hours a week, not much time off to be with family and friends. Salary was low, had to work 12 hour shifts 6 days a week."
good,Was a great place to work but then management was changed and the work environment became toxic. Supervisors tend to not help employees succeed and play favoritism towards other employees.
good,"Great deal of travel. Good benefits. Team environment. Ability to organize, prioritize, and work under extreme pressure, heavy work load and deadlines. Effective team performer who operates with a strong sense of urgency and efﬁciency. Computer proﬁcient in MS Word, Excel, and Ofﬁce."
good,"enjoy working with my co-workers"
good,"era extramente dinamico o dia de trabalho, pois deviamos estar prontos sempre para os imprevistos, sem perder o foco de çompromisso com a empresa. Aprendi que um bom negocio tem de ser bom para os dois lados, pois so assim teremos um cliente fiel. Acho que um dos problemas da empresa talvez fosse com sua gerencia. faltava mais humanisno e sobrava abuso de poder, quanto aos colegas de trabalho, todos sempre dispostos a aprender sempre mais e a parte mais dificil do trabalho era o nao reconhecimento de grandezas conquistadas e a mais agradavel era o trabalho em equipe, oconvivio, o apoio e principalmente o resultado! aquela sensaçao de dever cumprido, esse sim e o melhor pagamento obtido."
good,"A minha função é venda na rua :verifico no sistema os descontos considerados para aquele dia ,vejo com os funcionários de estoque se temos alguma ruptura e em qual produto visito "
good,"Poor management, third shift, customers are very enjoyable, co-workers can be hard workers"
good,"The Work I do everyday is the hardwork al day."
good,was good place to work for with the exception of some very rude upper management very productive days long work hours 10-14 hour days so much to do and have active outside life is difficult is the hardest part the easiest would have to be the different type people u meet
good,"Lack of training, lack of equipment and parts for the job at hand.Poor communication between management and the rest of the staff. no planning for future events,until the last minute. my co-workers were great and hard working given what we had to overcome on a regular basis.the most enjoyable part was close friends"
good,Le falta a la empresa ser menos drástica solo piensa en la empresa más no en el colaborador no dan insenyivos de nada y exiguen números inalcanzables
good,i like the hard work but dont like the traveling. I work good on my own and give  a 100% at everything i do but sometimes when Bosses are not there to see your work they come to the wrong conclusions.
good,Good job if you want to have a career. Management are kinda unorganized. Employees are showed favoritism if they have seniority. Most employees are marginalized by certain positions
good,A lot of freedom with this job as long as you are handling your business. Good pay. Good benefits. Management doesn’t know what they are doing. From the top down.
good,"It is a place full of machines working at the same time, so very noisy and hot in the summer."
good,"The management was solid. Good people with good ideas. The coworkers were friendly, respectful and responsible. The pay was not the best and the opportunity for full-time work was not readily available."
good,You'd be lucky to get a electric forklift even if you showed up 15 minutes early. Everything else was a lot better once you had the electric forklift.
good,"Trabajo bueno_ pero mala experiencia con mis supervisores  por no facilitar atención para desarrollar la venta de productos de Pepsico, falta de ropa de trabajo y discriminación por talles de ropa por mi condición ropa, aveces tardía en falta de pagos de viáticos."
good,"Merchandising job with really no room to advance. Not every works hard so you may get stuck doing extra work because of that. Promises of promotions that never come and not a career path unless you know someone higher up. Otherwise its not a terrible job if you're a college kid for summer, maybe."
good,"Work at Pepsi takes dedication and commitment.  There is always a lot of work to do; for the full time employee there are busy seasons and then there are the BUSY seasons.  The company vehicles are maintained fairly well, equipment is satisfactory, pay is decent. "
good,It was a great experience while it lasted learned a lot that I can take my learning experience anywhere but I do not wish to go back hopefully I can make my mark with another great company!
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es casi nulo, no hay compañerismo, no existe coordinación, en pocas palabras no existe estimulo por parte de la empresa, y en ocaciones los compañeros van sin ganas de trabajar, lo que hace que el ambiente se vuelva frio."
good,Decent work environment alot of stressful deadlines to meet but definetely attainable. Good group of teammates to work with moral was good alot of independence for running your route
good,"Un dia tipico era la visitas de cliente se tomaban los pedidos y se reponia la mercaderia solicitada."
good,"Overall Pepsi was a decent place to work at. The management where I was located wasn't very good. Their training process was a joke, it was a ""learn on the go"" type of enviroment. You would work with the lead for a couple of days and once they felt you were comfortable you were left on your own. The type of work varied by the order you recevied some were very easy but at the same time some were rather difficult for a new person. "
good,Management was very disorganized. The shift schedule was not good. I was not able to have much of a life with my family outside of work due to scheduling.
good,Pepsico is a group of companies. I have worked in pepsico brand Aquafina mineral water which is product of Riaz bottlers pvt ltd Lahore. I have working in Aquafina as a sales representative and handle company key accounts.
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo pero las opciones de promoción y crecimiento profesional son mínimas.
good,Fine place. Contracting work no advancement. But the hours and location fit for me so I stayed. Would have been nice to get a raise thru Kelly services or hired on. But didn't happen.
good,A typical day is driving to your first store around 4am and stocking chips till you have filled the shelves with what you have then going to the next store. There are no lunch periods and you have no control over your days off. Most of the guys have been working with them for over 10 years so you will never get first pick at any holidays off and they work every day of the year pretty much.
good,Good place to work. The money was great in the end the management is lacking. Care more about hitting numbers than the health of his workers. Hard work doesn't matter there. Youcan slack off as long as you keep your nose clean.
good,"Good employees,very competitive,paid good also good benefits,sometime poor management or lack of communication from mangers but overall I enjoyed my time there"
good,Fast Paced got a little hectic. Fun place need more training for new employees. Long hours great money not a bad place to work overtime guaranteed no matter what pidd.
good,Empresa boa de trabalhar e com uma equipe dinâmica.
good,"Good company to work for great pay but lots of hard work and attitudes from customers throughout most delivery routes when delivering products, sometimes rude and disrespectful"
good,"good hard work, competitive pay, full work week, weekends off, good management team, good benefits, I like the people that I work with. Pepsi makes very good products."
good,Buen lugar de trabajo pero el outsorcing lo arruina todo
good,"ok company. they just relocated to new location so everything does not fall into place yet. great pay and benefits. takes alot of your time trying to get adjusted. good equiptment as far as the transportation goes. i think they should have two people to a truck but thats on them lots of new territory to cover which is a downfall. warehouse workers do not stack product on half pallets the way they should so a lot of pallets usually turn over while on route but they are working on that. Some salesman do not completely do their job so the driver has to do it for them. another downfall.im not sure how they are handling that. . the most frustrating part of this job is finding the local mom/pop stores..unless you are familiar with that certain area"
good,"De mal en peor, pagan menos que antes."
good,"it was difficult and presure company they give really hard work more then work in duty hours .too much work burden ."
good,Es una empresa muy formar peto la verdad no es lo que estaba buscando
good,Great brands. Great relationship with trade especially with key retail. Focus is on volume selling and are targeting Africa. Route to market strength in past years.
good,good pay not much for advancement and all jobs seem to go based on seniority not off who can do the job better or works harder
good,"comienzo día laboral revisión de linea lavado de maquinaria verificar que producto este bien elaborado, análisis de envasado. en relación al trabajo que tenia aprendí manejo de maquinaria uso de químicos de lavado, pertenecía al área de brigada de emergencia realizando entrenamientos de bomberos. el grupo de trabajo cada persona era muy individualista y al ser personas muy mayores era difícil el manejo de trabajo en equipo. en si me gustaba lo que hacia en el trabajo pero nunca que se pudo llegar un acuerdo de contrato especifico ya que realizaba trabajo que no me correspondía y las responsabilidades eran mayores "
good,"It was not a career, but a lifestyle working for Pepsico. You will give up family time to earn a nice paycheck. I learned how to drive a jockey truck, and sell soda."
good,"Enjoyed working with the drivers and being a part of the team.   It ok to work there.  The early morning hours were a bit much, while trying to raise a family"
good,"Trabajo de producción muy activo."
good,".Trabalhava como operador de máquina no setor da estamparia, na produção de embalagem e produzia em torno de 150.000 a 180.000 tampas no meu turno."
good,"A typical day at work goes as a line officer for half day, then concentrating on the project given. I learned the beverage bottling procedure, new equipments/ machinery used for the same and syrup planning. the most enjoyable part of the job is the open behaviour of each and every individual and their cooperation."
good,"lo que sea hacia diariamente en el trabajo era principalmente llegar con el jefe a cargo nos daba nuestros objetivos diarios y por mes despues la revision de producto y del camion ya en calle o en ventas era visitar a los clientes que la maquina me marcaba como requisito del recorrido diario al final del dia se tenia que haser nuevamente el conteo del preoducto con el que sali y con el que regre y al final ser la entrega del efectivo de venta que la maquina o hanhel me marcaba un dia tipico en pepsi. "
good,fun job but no room for advancement if you don't have your CDL.  Great co-workers but the benefits weren't that great.  Frowned upon if you needed to take time off for a sick child.
good,"un dia tipico en la empresa empieza con tu llegada temprano, saludar a tus compañeros de empresa sin distinguir areas, tus labores que ya estan agendadas en tu horario mas las eventualidades que salgan en el dia, que eso era interesante ya que todos los dias habia algo diferente que hacer, no existe el aburrimiento"
good,"Fast paced with high production levels, makes  the work interesting and exciting. I enjoy working in a new industry. The people are very nice and friendly. Lots of autonomy in my support role."
good,Demanding place to work in a production warehouse. I learned how to read a production worksheet and get trailers loaded and unloaded safely
good,"Es una empresa alimenticia de primer nivel y calidad, trabajo de líneas de producción con objetivos bien marcados, beneficios de transporte puerta a puerta y buen tiempo de descanso con la comidas de desayuno/merienda y almuerzo/cena. No es un trabajo peligroso pero hay que tener cuidado y estar atento al proceso productivo."
good,"There is time limit, you have to work for late night hours, very Stressive Job, Management is well supportive but time limit is major concern, as i am not able to enjoy my personal life"
good,good company but no room for advancement and they only care about numbers
good,"As Manager, the pace can be hectic at times. However, I "
good,"With this job I was able to come up with creative ways to	Established and maintained interpersonal relationships with contracting companies"
good,I was trainee there and I took for a while through my university.
good,"No te dejan crecer mucho."
good,the job was very hectic at times. management was all over the place.it was a lot of traveling that just wasn't worth it.
good,"I enjoyed working for Pepsi and would've made a career with the company had I not been terminated over something minor.  I lost my job over explaining to one of the store managers at a Kroger in Katy, TX that I wasn't responsible for making a mess in their back room after being accused multiple times. The store manager asked me to leave the store and Pepsi terminated me behind it. I don't agree with management's decision but they will have a higher power to answer to. I guess being on time and working hard means absolutely nothing when your job is being threatened by some regional manger from Kroger who has an ego the size of Texas. The pay is good and overtime is available if you're willing to work. I got along well with my coworkers as well as the workers at the stores on my route. I would gladly go back but it definitely wouldn't be the same. My views of upper level management have been tainted. My direct supervisor was only hired because she was a graduate from UTSA. She had no knowledge about the company or the beverage business. I was hurt when I lost my job but when one door closes a better one opens. I learned a lot in my short time there."
good,"all days good"
good,"1. My first seven days after joining enjoyed a lot."
good,"Did not work there very long, but it was a great experience learning about the maintenance of the truck and learning the mechanics of the Thermo King refrig Units."
good,"Good work environment. However, coming in with a college degree and not being in the sales department, I found advancement quite difficult and had little assistance from my management staff to help me meet my lon term career goals."
good,"Contato com clientes e Area comercial, Grupo Americano, pouco contato com gerencia,"
good,"new experience,never having worked in warehouse before, learning assembly,,shipping and receiving..line production,"
good,"Empresa muito grande com varis aspectos a serem mudados,como valorização de seus funcionarios,um ótima expriencia para um vendedor."
good,My typical day consisted of tracking sales and costs. Managing frontline employees as well as the entire sales team. I had a great working relationship with my union workforce. The most enjoyable part of my day was spending time with my sales team at the end of the day! Discussing wins and losses. Discussing customer service and productivity.
good,You start work as soon as you get to your first store. Go into the store and check with the store manager and check to make sure everything is ok or if anything needs to be done. There are maybe about 5 or 6 stores a day for a merchandiser and usually we worked by ourselves. The hardest part of the job is if you mak the job hard it is very easy if you make it that way. The most enjoyable part of the job is when your in the car driving to your next stop because you are getting paid to drive your own car and you give your body a little rest.
good,"A typical work day consisted of going store to store and selling product along with stocking the shelves, interacting with the customer and building a rapport. Its like football practice, you will work, hard"
good,"My week begins on a friday while most people's week is ending mine is yet begining. I start at 6:00am, I go to my first stop. My job consist of going on a route and fill the shelves with our product from the backroom. As far as management they are competant in some departments and lack in others. They tend to not really listen to suggstion recomended by s working in the field. Co-workers are ok some better than others as in most jobs. The hardest part of my job is staying interested and being fully engaged its very repetitive.I enjoy the fast pace type of work. things tend to change just not as fast as I wish it would."
good,"Overall was a great company to be employed with.Benefit package,pay scale,as well as my immediate supervisor were well rounded.The lack of unscheduled time off,the work day lasting upto 14 hours,and last minute planning from some in upper management.The fringe benefits were nice as well,such as cell phone,discounts,etc."
good,Great for keeping somebody fit. Very physical job and fast pace create a quick moving day of work.  Definitely more geared to a younger person due to the nature of the work being performed.
good,not what i expected for a billion dollar company. They are union so it is not great at all. The perks at the company are not good at all. There is no carer growth opportunity
good,"Empresa, em que aprendi muita coisa, me proporcionou crescimento profissional, financeiro, fiz vários amigos."
good,"Very busy work days. "
good,"Need better strategic thinkers who can execute clear, defined goals. The CEO is fantastic. Managers who have been there 10+ years are not innovative, they only know the way things were done and can't see beyond the problem. They may be in roles they are not qualified for and give very little support."
good,Te groot verschil tussen uitvoerden mensen die de fabriek draaiend hielden en de hogere mensen.
good,"Its a huge learning in sales,one should work with varun beverages limited if one really want to do excel in Sales."
good,"My experience varied based upon the department I was in.  There was room for advancement for permanent employees.  In fact, permanent employees were considered for jobs before outside candidates were.  I think this is a good policy although it makes it difficult to get a good job there from the outside."
good,"supervise pre-sale, delivery and traditional distribution areas. Sales personnel management and market development."
good,"A shambolic environment, poor pre historic manufacturing practices. Dinasour management with very questionable attitudes. A working environment where production operators dictate to managers where they decide to work within the factory. The heat is unbearable to work in as pepsico which claim to be a family caring company who care for their employees interest choose not to invest in air conditioning but would rather invest in more machines, paper rather than foil, plastic!! It has became a laughing stock with lazy individuals ruling the way. Culture is hilarious with some very strange people working there. If your desperate for work and prepared to be treated like an animal then pepsico is the in place to be!!"
good,"Fast paced, have to keep up with production  Line,  be able to lift  heavy boxes. Half hour lunches, as soon as they see you slowing down they will fire you"
good,"Pepsi was a great company to work for that I would refer many people to apply to. The pay is very good and there is plenty of room to grow within the company. The only negative about the company, or more so the facility I worked for, is the negative culture in the building."
good,"No geral trabalhar com datas e reposição de mercadorias, montar trabalhos de merchandising e sugestões de pedidos. Horário comercial , salário ,vale transporte  e vale alimentação."
good,Pepsi is a great company and in this position you can make tons of money but work/life balance is nonexistent. The managers tend to favoritize workers.
good,Falta un.poco de apoyo a.personal de trabajo y continuar
good,Starting my job at Pepsi started a very good time in my life for me I was able to purchase my first car and live an exciting life where I was always on the go problem solving I felt accomplished every night.
good,Long tough grinding hours. But overall great expirenxe. Had an opportunity to meet new people from everywhere And every trade. Management is the constant.
good,Dislike the travel in personal vehicle to the various stores.  Short staffed so you can work as many hours as you want.  Good pay.  Great job but I am seeking more a permanent full time position.
good,We need more money to start to keep people interested. 13.00 to start not enough fort what youhave to do.. More like 15 or 16.00 to start.. I wasnt fast enough so they say... I was there everyday didnt complain.
good,"You can plan to work there for decades"
good,Love the family type feel and that everyone got along great pay and time off loved the company and hard work.One of the best employers to me until I got hurt
good,Um ótimo lugar para obter experiência profissional
good,Management  structure was in flux throughout my time there. They didn't have direction of what they wanted to do at middle management and they changed and shuffled people into management positions of areas where they had success in but not necessarily success in being a manager. This didn't allow of the best support of all employees or the best fit of managers or those who would be a good manager into the appropriate positions.
good,"Good learning experience, great developmental environment, and fast paced. Definitely a career for those that are driven, self motivated, and ready to hit the ground running."
good,"Culture has changed a lot over the years , focusing less on employees and more on policies and procedures.felt more like a number than a actual part of team."
good,the facility i worked at in fort myers fl was very political and biased about who they advanced forward and who they kept on board depending on mistakes and overall work ethic.
good,"However pepsi is a hugh company with  small minds"
good,My job with Pepsi was a temp job.  I had just retired from AT&T and was looking for something to keep me busy and to make a little money on the side  It was a lot of work that kept me busy.  I learned a lot from Pepsi it was never a boring moment.  The company was very good the their temp workers.  They included all temps in their meetings and all celebration.  My most difficult part of the job was dealing with some of the customers.  it was difficult getting them to cooperate with returning calls and sending information back on a timely matter.  The department i worked in the people were all friendly and helpful.
good,"Wake up early start at your store walk it take count pull the product and fill the shelf take inventory of back-stock. Learned how to rotate and how to build rapport with mangers and how to sell in new products.Team management is needing more focus,the work culture is god fun people work there good environment."
good,"En un dia normal de trabajo puede pasar de todo, especialmente en el area comercial donde yo trabaje. Se trata de dejar que fluyan las tareas y cumplir con las prioridades a los diferentes jefes."
good,"Pepsi is a great company to work for as far as benefits and pay are concerned.  Like with any large corporation, the wheels are constantly turning, changes are inevitable, and competition is fierce.  Soda is a luxury, not a necessity."
good,Долгие процессы по согласованию любого документа приводили к большим срокам выполнения простейшего задания. Разветвлённая Орг структура замедляет принятие решений
good,"Excelente empresa pero muy demandante, condiciones laborales poco favorables, sin embargo, buen ambiente laboral."
good,"Fast paced environment, constant engagement with external customers. Job consisted of heavy lifting,customer service and  always on the move. Good entry level position in the beverage industry."
good,"You are paid well to operate a stand up fork lift. There will be times you can be force to work overtime, and extra 4 hours with little notice. You are provided free bags of chips to eat on your breaks."
good,"como toda empresa grande , quando não esta bem na parte de diretoria a empresa perde um pouco de seus principios..."
good,Company is all about brand recognition.  Great place to learn how to enhance your skills and company does recognize when an employee performs their job well.
good,"Job was great and stable, but there's hardly any chance of advancement if you don't cozy up to the higher ups and brown nose. Work mostly by yourself, do the work, and get on with the day."
good,I was there for my internship after the end of 3rd year education at UET Lahore. PepsiCo is a nice place where I observed Blow Molding process of plastic bottles and filling it with soft drinks.
good,"Highly challenging worklife which creates life style stressed and difficult and family suffers."
good,Responsable y entregada al 100% y siempre con deseos de superación.
good,Management is not up to par at local level. But colleges an other persons are very supportive. Sometimes it is difficult to understand the hiring policy.
good,Fast Pace workplace good pay good benefits. Little promotion opportunuties. Triple time on holidays but not enough time to spend money and time with the faamily
good,"Pepsico is a good stepping stone for a young person, not a career type of business. Politics rule in the beverage industry, you must question your integrity to make it their for any period of time."
good,"Nessa última empresa em que trabalhei conheci o que realmente é trabalhar em uma empresa que se tem alegria e vontade de se trabalhar claro que houve uma ou outra dificuldade para minha ascensão na empresa mais fui feliz profissionalmente, aprendi muito com as normas da empresa e da legislação o qual a empresa prestava suas obrigações legais, aprendi a desejar e executar minhas obrigações sempre com a melhor qualidade para meus clientes e consumidores assegurando a satisfação plena."
good,"No puedo realizar una valoracion puesto que procedo de una empresa (PEPSICO) la cual ha vendido el area comercial a otra empresa (SCHWEPPES) y nada mas hacer la incorporacion, presentaron un E.R.E., y la duracion con la nueva gerencia y compañeros ha sido de 4 meses. Si puedo valorar que: he aprendido otra forma de trabajar, nuevos recursos etc."
good,"empresa que abril as portas para o mercado de trabalho"
good,"Shifts start at 6am, with multiple pallet orders to break down everyday at various accounts. It is a very diligent manual labor job that requires one to lift up to and over 30 pounds over a 6-12 hour shift. Being a merchandiser is a very independent job which requires a good work ethic and having the ability to self manage in a timely efficient manner. I speak with my Sales Rep often about product issues or concerns, but other than that this job requires a lot of self autonomy of which i appreciate. One of my favorite parts of the job are the associates at my stops. I've become good friends with other workers from different companies as well as managers through being a merchandiser. My least favorite part of the job is having to use my personal vehicle. I easily put on over 1,000 miles in a 2 week span, which does take its toll on my vehicle. Overall, management tries their hardest to make their employees happy and satisfied. But with over 50 employees at the Saginaw plant alone, sometimes personal concerns get swept aside."
good,"Pepsi has been a good company for me, but I am ready to move on with my career. I am looking to finish my school and start a career in the Criminal Justice field or maybe something along the lines of teaching."
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo, buen salario, solo que el manejo del personal no es el deseado"
good,"It was a fairly straight-forward job, although the hours are lacking."
good,"La rotación es mucha debido a las condiciones laborales, por lo cual todo el tiempo estaba buscando y contratando personal, ocupando todo el tiempo para ello y no podia invertir el tiempo en otro tipo de actividades del área."
good,Its an honest day's work aside from the fact that you go in at 10am but do not know if or when you will get off until 3pm. Some days you work as late as 2 am. Management is supportive but applies the typical pressure to push production. The most enjoyable factor is that it is a great workout.
good,Management isn't the best. Nothing get done when you report it to them. And it just seems to put a target on your back. I just show up to work and do my job and leave.
good,"The hardest part of the job is time management, not always having enough people to complete the tasks. I learned how to manage myself, take care of tasks on my own."
good,"very organized. Great work environment, production is rather easy than hard. No a/c so its hot, but besides that? Its pretty cool and laid back."
good,Understaffed in most aspects of management. Marketing strategies that often miss their mark. Terrible work life balance. Older buildings in disrepair with shrinking profit margins.
good,"Some of the best people I have ever worked with, the exception being the 2 shift supervisors. The shift supervisors tend to instill a 1st vs 2nd environment and it doesn't help. They should be working as a team instead of against each other, this is starting to creat a rotating door of warehouse employees."
good,Great learning. high performing teams. diversity and inclusion culture. Great benefits and salaries are among the highest.
good,loaded/unloaded trucks.  deliver product to stores. merchandise product from cooler to shelves.  collect monies and turn in paperwork
good,"Hard work, management is very unappreciative, my job title is unloader/picker, my hours were cut in half because I'm not able to produce 100 cph,, (cases per hour) I'm the oldest picker in the warehouse at 47, every other picker is no older than 30 & my average is about 75 cph, pretty good at my age but not good enough for management, I explained this to them & asked if I could split my time picking & doing other things but it went in one ear & out the other, it's a pretty good paying job but it's a 100% physical job & if you don't meet their quotas they'll cut your hours or let you go, they just don't care!!!"
good,"You have to be hard hearted person in this kind of job, as you will encountered different personalities with different anger management program."
good,"Good place to work. Worked with youth through college in high volume. Did speed/agility, plyometrics and weight room. Was responsible for weight room flow for 4 coaches along with education of the program for the coaches"
good,"I started working for Pepsi as a merchandiser in 2002.  After about 9 months I was offered an opportunity to work on the warehouse side of the business.  After five years as loader and relief driver I applied to become a Warehouse Supervisor.  About a 1.5 years later I applied for a promotion in Grand Rapids, Michigan where i went on to work for about 13 months a Product Availability Supervisor.  I was then offered an opportunity to return to my previous location where I was once a supervisor to take on the role of the Supply Chain Operations Associate Leader.  I will say the senior management has changed a lot over the past several years.  I work about 10-12 hours per day not to mention that the cell phone is constantly ringing.  I enjoyed seeing the impact or the influence that a manager can have on his/her team, almost like being a head coach. At the end of the day it is about whom you report to."
good,"Dealing with different kind of Manager with different attitude but you have to please them because it's part of my job. You have to give a time table how long you will stay on one store so can go to another store and sometimes you to finished early but you have to help some of your co-worker that behind on their schedule. Nothing is easy on every work we do, but the hardest on this job is getting up early and going home late."
good,Company is going through a shift in volume which is causing issues
good,"i love Pepsi, but with the introduction of the robotic machine, a lot of us are going to loose our job. but it a great place to work."
good,"Comienza a las 6:30 a.M con un minimo de 23 visitas,impulsar productos de inovacion(diario),a negociar mejor con la gente,la direcion bien,excelentes compañeros,la parte mas dificil el poder escalar(titular de ruta)cuenta mas la antiguedad que la capacidad,lo que mas me gusto el apoyo de mis compañeros."
good,"I think Pepsi is a great company to work for during my time with them I did the following "
good,Long hours and not a certain shift. I learned how be a customer-friendly employee.
good,"always busy"
good,come in and do your part everybody else do theirs management is okay the most enjoyable time are the meetings takes away some time. very challenging work
good,"Boa empresa pra se trabalhar,com alguns benefícios bacanas,mais com umas cobranças incompatíveis da parte do gerente,referente a rotinas a se cumprir."
good,"•	Pull orders according to specifications"
good,"Pepsi is a great company however expect long hours, but if it were easy everyone would be doing it.You will learn to think outside the box and be quick with comebacks to customers."
good,Routes are too big per driver so work days get longer and longer but no compensation made for it.
good,I have been employed with PepsiCo for almost 3 years. Great company for members of management.
good,"Typical day starts 10:00 pm and end around 6-7 am, pulling in small tractors to semi-tractors,trailers,forklifts,pallet jacks, to panel trucks into shop for PM's to minor repairs. Sometime road calls, into warehouse or yard to make a repair or simply to help a driver with getting started on the road."
good,"Passar turno com parceiro do turno anterior, verificar pendências de produção,organizar a linha conforme a programação, fechar a s ordens de produção do dia anterior ."
good,"Go to the Pepsi plant, get your paper-work, grab your hand-held computer , make sure you check if there any promotional boarders or stickers displays then get in your vehicle and start recording your time log and your mileage ledger. Usually when entering your accounts (grocery stores), you greet the managers letting them know you are in the accounts for servicing and if there's any issues, then you examine these accounts to check for all Pepsi products or displays, then go to the back of the store where the Pepsi products are, then you merchandise the store with the products, after then, structure the back-room from what's left-over and then write an order using a hand-held computer. After servicing the entire store,you consult with the manger and letting them know what has been accomplish in there stores, then you smile and leave."
good,"Aprendi a operar uma máquina de embalagem, aprendi a trabalhar em grupo e a socializar com as pessoas."
good,The ole school staff is great. There is a very family oriented atmosphere
good,"Faz carga e carrega todos os dias,abastece de combustivel diariamente,deposita o numerário colhido diariamente,prestaçao de conta com o financeiro diaria,reunioes todos os dias com o supervisor.Aprende-se muita dedicaçao e diciplina no trabalho,quanto aos colegas de trabalho,se obtem muita amizade e companherismo,e a parte mais dificil é bater o que foi carregado com o vendido.A melhor parte é saber que a empresa sempre cumpre com seus compromissos com seus funcionários,nunca atrasa seus pagamentos,apenas nao se tem muitas oportunidades de crescimento profissional."
good,Great for the employee who has little to do. Pepsi will fufill your void with its long hours and lack of family friendly structure. On the other hand Pepsi has a good compensation system. Great benifits.
good,It's a job that pays the Bill's. I wouldn't reccomdend to anyone who doesn't want to work your butt off everyday you're at work. The entire system is based off of averages in a complicated formula that determines if you have reached your quota.
good,Long hours. Don't expect to have a life. You get Christmas and Thanksgiving off every other Holliday you work. The money is really good and benefits are really good but they come with a price.
good,"I worked only for three months as A seasonal warehouse support. Every one is deferent on each other, it applies when it comes to your senior managing persons in the workplace, overall it was a great place to gain some variety of experience. The Pickers at the Mississauga plant were the best at my knowledge of experience in supply chain operation. Pepsico is one of the best I have ever seen."
good,"It was a great company to work for, but required on demand request that would take away from work life balance. Overall great company to work for, but very demanding at times."
good,"HARD physical work, after working 48/52 it's exhausting. Pay is good but could be better. Typical is a base pay with comession for routed drivers. Spare workers are hourly and start at 12-13 an hour."
good,I start my day not knowing where I am going but have a time limit to get there..often work short handed covering multiple areas.have learned alot of patience and built good relationships with my customers...they believe in doing more with less..have good managers but tasked with getting things done with not enough employees. Hardest part of the job is not having set work hours or shifts ... not leaving any time for family...best part of the job ...building relationships with customers and good pay ....
good,"Very physical work. Really tough on the body. Managers were forced to make drivers do a lot more than expected by their bosses and we all know the outcome of that. I'm a big fella so it was nice that I dropped 50 pounds in 9 months, but I had to give up working for a while because of my rotator cuff surgery from Pepsi."
good,"The job was a fast paste job.Earlier morning start but still was a good place and a lot of good people worked there.each day was all ways different the loads where all ways different but over all a good place.melt a lot of different peoples at the different location, learned different places and different areas of the city ,"
good,"A very good place to work, healthy environment for work. Also want to mention that i have earned a lot while working there and i would love to refer this place to my friends as well."
good,I love to work on new projects and new machine installation. PepsiCo provided me good knowledge of big heavy packaging machines and hands on practice .
good,"troubleshooting repair and replaces parts as need "
good,Management had a tendency to look for non-existent issues. And would write an employee up for things former manager had found to be acceptable or for things the employee had been trained to do.
good,"A typical day at pepsi involved intense physical labor.Constantly lifted anywhere from 10-40 pounds for 8-14 hours.I learned to never give up no matter how hard adversity gets,you have to power your way through mentally first then physical.The most enjoyable part of the job was the paychecks"
good,great money no life. you work 60 hour weeks in the summer. Monday -Friday weekends off. most holidays off . winter time is slower time of the year. mostly ten hour days
good,"Gestores ruins , a empresa vende um sonho que não cumpre"
good,"You get in early... about 3am and done with your day at 3 or 4pm...sometimes didn't get home until 7pm.  During the summer months, this was typical..."
good,"The people I worked with were great.  The company has changed as a whole over the years.  The flexibility is the best perk.  I've learned so much over the years; working in different departments, learning each department culture and understanding many sides of the business."
good,Love it but the work life balance and compensation does not reflect the work put in by it's employees. Upper Management make you feel replaceable and care more about the Frontline.
good,Mucha presión y poco sueldo si no eres de planta  a veces buen ambiente
good,Good pay but you work almost everyday no matter how many years you’ve been there .. They have major turn over with supervision so its ran differently on a rotation with the young college graduates supervisors that come in every year..
good,A very respectable multinational company. A very good learning organization. Processes and procedures are strictly followed. Very customer oriented. Innovation are encouraged.
good,Benefits were good co-workers were very respectful. The manage team needed to learn about leading by example instead of pointing fingers. The work loads were fine and appreciated the weekly pay
good,"I started as a Merchandiser at PepsiCo. At that point in time, the work load was heavier. It got very tiring at some point. There were no specific time when you get off. If you have six stores, you work day is not over until all six stores are done. This is the only thing I hated about it but I mean it make sense because all the stores had to get worked. As I grew older with the company, I didn't get complaisant and started seeking additional training. I asked my manager to cross train me on different aspect of the business. I offer to do that with no pay on my own time. She agreed, but she did make sure that I was on the clock. I was able to eventually work as an interim manager when she eventually left. Unfortunately, I was passed on many opportunity to become Merch supervisor. This is because that most of the higher ups really hire people that they are cool with. That's the other part I dislike about this location. I  got to know one of the manager in the builder, who eventually had a position open. She suggested that I apply for the position because of my skills. I was able to get the new position. The next thing I love about PepsiCo is the Education Assistance portion. They do help you get a degree, but only offers $5200 for undergrad and $8000 for grad."
good,"es una empresa buena donde se te permite poder aprender mucho acerca del área de trabajo"
good,"Pay was decent, was commission plus base pay every week. That may have changed since. Pepsi was a great way to start your way into commission sales. Issues with plant manager at the time. It cause deliveries to be delayed or not delivered at all. Effected sales for almost a year."
good,"No setor que eu trabalhava seguia uma linha de produção, aprendi muitas coisas na área de segurança e qualidade dos alimentos e uma melhora significativa no relacionamento com as pessoas"
good,"Se trabaja bajo presion, se aprende  a vender,  los jefes son exigentes, buen ambiente laboral."
good,Stagnant and slightly boring. But there are some good people working there. Their lean six sigma and supply chain teams are interesting to work for. But nothing out of the ordinary.
good,"Dentro de las actividades que se encomendaron realizar me permitió desarrollar mas los conocimientos adquiridos durante el transcurso de estudios, mismos que se aportaron de manera eficaz y eficiente."
good,Ho lavorato come impiegato nella sezione logistica
good,Una empresa con mucho prestigio y cuidado con sus trabajadores.
good,Some manager work with employees but those are the ones that get Frown upon but fun guys to work around for the most part make a long term friendship forever
good,"Good company in General, not sure on the direction they are taking, micromanaged to much in my humble opinion. Thinks have greatly changed in the years that I worked for PepsiCo, I wish them great success in the future, it was just time in my life for a career change. I gave them plenty of notice when I decided to leave."
good,"Buena Empresa, pero faltan promociones a su personal para desarrollo."
good,"They let you know in training that the nature of the business requires working weekends so it's not a surprise. Most of the people there are good to work with. After a lot of missed family events from having to work every weekend and most holidays, the stress builds up. There are not many positions that have weekends off so the family life suffers."
good,"I do not wish to provide a review at this time about a typical day, what I learned, management, the workplace culture, the hardest part of the job, or the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Working as a delivery driver has been very taxing on my body. The hours are long and you are very tired at the end of the day and throughout the week. If you are ok with hard work every day this is an ok job.
good,"uma grande empresa, com boa dinâmica de trabalho, porem necessita rever seus conceitos quanto a planos de carreira e critérios de avaliação para cargos."
good,"Moving product from trucks to floor, and vice versa. Large team working together to achieve a nightly goal. Thousands of units of product moved daily."
good,Sirvió como experiencia por mas corta que haya sido
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo y calidez humana, pero jornadas muy extensas"
good,"In all facets of the company, PepsiCo hires exceptional talent.  It is a great place to sharpen your skills, and develop individually.  You will work on very cool projects, and have exposure to a wide variety of products.  However, like most large companies, you will always just be a number, and loyalty is extremely difficult to find."
good,I was really excited working at PepsiCo. I had learned lots of ethics about work and skills. Employees and manager was big time help on my difficult days. The workplace is fun and cultured. The hardest part of the job was time.
good,"i was overall happy but management was poor at times, great guys to work with while working. benefits were a great perk to the job as it requires a lot of bending and kneeling"
good,"pero los intermediarios o maquilas pésimas, cambia de nombre y no pagan a los trabajadores"
good,PepsiCo was a good experience. But wish it had better compensation. Would work for them again but would like to be in another department to better grow in develop in personal interests.
good,Pepsi was a fun place to work.  We worked hard and played hard. I really enjoyed my time there and would have stayed if it was not for a really poor manager.
good,good experience working in RBL Pepsi Lahore. good team work good work place management is also skill full. i realy enjoy my all job tenure. cooperation with all team.
good,Great place to work if u have no life or love to work for 16 to 20 hrs a day the pay could be better but not bad but u don't have a life at the Spartanburg branch in S.C. 6 day's and about 17 to 20 hrs a day !
good,"Good Company to work for"
good,"Diverse work environment that allows for learning of multiple areas.  Unfortunately, high supervisor turn over that causes inconsistent policy adherences."
good,Very good portfolio which was fun to sell. Daily challenges help me grow as a sales representative. I was always fortunate to have strong experienced managers to help guide me though my career.
good,poor communication.  overload drivers.  hard to get people to stay. poor routing.  to many merch stops that up your time but no additional pay for the work
good,"Sales oriented company with good understanding of market place , employees were treated more as a number instead of a valued employee. workload was unbalanced"
good,"i would start my day off by going to my forklift, inspect it and sign off that it is safe to use. either i would start by filling the pick face with pop and correctly rotate the dates. or i would get my headset gear on and start picking pallets,"
good,Pepsi is a great company to work for with great pay and  benefits.  It was unfortunate for me to have had a boss who lacked people ethics and skill.  Specially for the ones that literally put their life on the line while he would go  out and take his vacation.
good,fue buena escuela en el tiempo que trabaje en esta empresa te enseñas a llevar indicadores un orden en los procesos de venta en fin muy buena experiencia
good,"La empresa es buena, pero la administración no ayuda ..."
good,on a average day at pepsi you are touching all the product on the truck. must attempt every stop policy. hard labor job. time management at its best as far as DOT.
good,A empresa é excelente portanto como trabalhei em uma terceirizada dentro da empresa os benefícios não eram os mesmos. Porém era agradável de trabalhar mais não tinha nenhuma estabilidade.
good,good place to get experience an then find a better place it union 3 year contract with cost of living increase each year so pay goes up able to move around if your hard working
good,It's non-union so you can get fired for any little thing that's the problem about working there there's no job security it's non-union so therefore you can get fired for any reason management always changes every two years and they want to fight you for any little thing
good,A fast phase of production lines. Speed and accuracy is important. product output oriented bosses. On time delivery  quality and quantity are on high priority. The hardest thing is to meet the target quantity. most enjoyable is vacation time.
good,"Pros"
good,A typical work day would be waking up at 4 am to be at your first account to merchandise before the store manager would show up and be ready for walk through. The best part of my job was talking to different managers per account.
good,Great job to start in. After a while it take a toll on your buddy with all the lifting and moving around.A lot of hours if willing to work. management has terrible communication and seniority is really big in this company so be ready to wait a couple of months to receive any equipment.
good,"Pepsi was hands down one of my favorite jobs ever. It challenged me every day, physically and mentally. It kept me sharp and in shape! The team work also played a huge part in making every day go correctly and efficiently!"
good,It's very good and big company. Work in this company organized very good. I am proud that when I worked in this company. It was very good and funny times in life
good,"This is a company where you will never have to worry about job security. There is plenty of work to do, so much that your work life balance is the most difficult part."
good,La empresa es buena pero el crecimiento es complicado
good,me gusto trabajar en planta me setia muy bien con lo que me desempeñaba a pesar de los conflictos que se alman como en toda empresa
good,"Work at Pepsi was fun and a bit challenging.On a typical day my duties were not limited to regular staff attendance checks, collating branch attendance, sales figures and generally attending to staff issues.the staff canteen was also part of my schedule. I was responsible for its entire upkeep from sanitary conditions, maintenance and daily menu."
good,I love the job but I feel disconnected from my family because I never have any time with them other than the time I'm sleeping. I feel like family and personal feelings have become the last connection on the company's mind.
good,Days started early and ended late. Little advancement opportunities for women. Laid off after being there for 5 years. Management and human resources was unethical
good,"I always thought it was a great place to work...loved the people, loved my job...been there for 30 some years...until I trained for a management position and questioned someones time card..found my self fired for ""excessive mistakes""....really? in all my 30 some years never being written up or had a bad performance...and now I have excessive mistakes..could I have stumbled onto something I wasn't supposed to?  "
good,Small warehouse with minimum space you need to maximize your work areas to do your job properly.  Equipment was pretty old and could definitely use a overhaul.
good,Pepsi is a good company to work for until you get hurt. Then they treat you like scum and find any reason to fire you. Overall good company pays well but life balance is no good work work work work...
good,"No se valora al personal, el trabajo realizado por el personal técnico no es retribuido en los paquetes económicos, no se incentiva la superación profesional."
good,"El trabajo es muy tranquilo que tiene sus buenos y malos, por uno no es tan estricto por lo malo todos quieren aser patrones, y los encargados de la gente no se asen encargo de poner su gente en linea."

good,was quite some time ago when i was there but i remember it being fun with opportunities to grow. i got offered different opportunities which is only why i left.
good,la parte mas dificil del trabajo son las cuotas q tiene q cumplir al mes
good,"work was temporary.  sometimes a few hours a day for a few days"
good,"Essa empresa era muito boa sim para trabalhar,fazia parte de uma terceirizada que não tinha nenhum benefícios,como plano de saúde e outras coisa.Mas fora isso lugar bom para trabalhar.Isso falo da terceirizada não da empresa Pepsico"
good,This job gives me really good work experience with working around the warehouse as well being a safe delivery driver.  The easiest thing about this job is basically you work and a calm and steady pace.
good,"a dangerous accident in the ware house,a forklift operator knocked down an employee,,,what i learned was to always give a distance away from any mobile machine in the ware house.,,the management came up with new health and safety manager,,,my co-workers equally learned to notify the forklift operator about their presence around him.,,,,the most enjoyable part of my job is that ,i always complete my task on time,very friendly with my co-workers and the management."
good,"Route delivery to established account base. Set up displays and merchandised products. Did daily inventory management. Had a class B CDL, with air brake endorsement."
good,A typical day at work is very fast paced. I have learned to do quality checks on bottles. I have learned to do package changeovers.My co-workers are great to work with. The hardest part of the job is long hours and working almost every weekend so don't have much time to spend with my family.  The most enjoyable part of my job is learning new things and working with others.
good,"É uma boa empresa para se trabalhar, adquirindo bons conhecimentos na área e todos que trabalham são educados e atenciosos no que fazem ."
good,"- Good Start for Entry Level"
good,"Job requires little supervision which is nice, but the start of the day begins really early. The job is physically demanding and they kind of expect you to not have a life outside of work. Expect to work all weekends"

good,es muy bueno porque aprende a llevar cuentas y aprendes como tratar a las demas personas y el respetoante todo
good,"Great place to work, although advancement is poor and hours are not guaranteed.  Good experience gained through covering sales reps."
good,"I do record reviews of line checks and other lab/quality paperwork. "
good,My time with Pepsi was fantastic.  It was a great company that valued its employees work.  Beverage sales is a very competitive industry and Pepsi time and time again was very innovative in its approach to improving its business. Management was always there to support your needs.
good,Enquanto não se mexe nos benefícios do trabalhador show passou a mexer no bolso de quem leva o dinheiro pra dentro da empresa desaqndou perdeu ótimos funcionários.
good,"Studied the working of industries one to all. A typical day starts with the new assignment for the day or the whole week. Have to trave and work with the co-workers to do the research and getting the data about different variables of the machines. The hardest part was to study the steam boilers, extensively used in the working of the plant because of the heat generated."
good,I enjoyed my 7 years I spent at Pepsi. I learned a lot regarding finance and customer serivce.
good,Great company and benefits. Work/life balance is not very good. Have learned to adapt even more quickly than before to changes in policies and job procedures since being employed with company. Great opportunities to advance within company and become involved in company committees.
good,I enjoyed interacting with differeent managers and co-workers at each store I went to.
good,"working most of the time outside of the office."
good,pues buen ambiente y todo estaba perfecto menos el salario y el que no puedes subir de puesto asta que alguien de los que estan ahi muera o se pensione o lo despidan y no te evaluan ni tampoco hay oportunidad de crecimiento y cuando las hay son escasas.
good,"Empresa de grande porte que está agora em fase de mudanças de sua cultura empresarial e de vários aspectos de produção, melhorando a qualidade de seus produtos e serviços.                         Nesta empresa obtive um excelente crescimento profissional e pessoal. Na área em que trabalhava, a manutenção, sempre tivemos um bom relacionamento entre as equipes. No que se diz repeito as partes difíceis na minha opinião seria investir em treinamentos e insentivos a capacitação de seus funcionários."
good,Monday's are always payroll and reporting days.  The rest of the week is monitoring processes and using compliance reports.  I over see 3 direct employees but oversee processes in 6 other locations.  The hardest part of the job is the compliance research.  The most enjoyable is working with great people and the perks of Pepsi.
good,It's a simple job you come in and sit at a labtop and analyze samples through a computer.
good,I just remember the demand was very high and there was not enough staff to serve all customers. The wait for advancement was over 5 years.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of merchandising and ordering product.  I also built product displays.  I learned how to merchandize, order product with a handheld computer, how to sell in extra displays. I worked for 6 different managers during my time there and 5 were great!  In fact, I still have 3 of them as my key references.  The hardest part of the job was the long hours.  The most enjoyable part of the job was learning new things."
good,Company is strong but advancement oppurtunities are limited. Seen as Blackhole.
good,"great people, met alot of new people such as account managers and such. got laid off due to downsizing within the company"
good,Good company with good benefit. Learn a lot with nice co-worker.
good,"The hardest part of this job is my Management. I really feel like they over look those who come forth with new ideas and a since of change in a good way, for those who share the "" buddy system"" with them."
good,Worked there for 7 years.  It was a pretty decent large company to work for.
good,Very good pay and advancement poor managing resulting in effects towards employee's
good,"Worked at my own pace and the traveling."
good,Overall a good company to work for but im always looking for something better for my family.
good,Fast paced and a very dirty environment .Had fun working there but was laid off after 911 .I was a full time employee and enjoyed my job very much.
good,"Boa para trabalhar"
good,"Enquanto estive nesta empresa, o gerente então na época, era uma pessoa difícil,tinha seus ""pupilos"" e isso dificultava a qualquer outro conseguir uma promoção. Não sabia ouvir. A equipe era muito unida, e aprendi muita coisa com eles. A parte mais agradável era chegar no fim do dia com a sensação do dever comprido. A parte mais difícil era a cobrança do gerente, que não se importava com os fatos ao seu redor."
good,"I have learn great customer service"
good,"El trabajo en esa empresa es agradable porque hay un ambiente de cooperacion asi que cuando uno entra a trabajar en ese sitio todos ayudan y tratan de hacer sentir comodo al personal de nuevo ingreso,  eso da mucha mas confiansa para que uno pueda desarrollar mucho mejor su rabajo."
good,"Was made redundant August 2012. A typical day at work would be undertaking the full Accounts Receivable role which includes allocations, reconciliations, collection calls etc."
good,"Empresa com ótimo ambiente de trabalho e benefícios.Muitos treinamentos aos funcionários, o que torna muito mais simples a adaptação."
good,"Rotina dinâmica, com grande desenvolvimento profissional.Aprendi a trabalhar sob pressão e de forma organizada para melhor rendimento do trabalho."
good,"A day as a representative consisted of loading product on the shelf according their core standard,and maintaing your inventory. I have learned to delegate job rules and responsibilities to my co-workers in order to get the job done. My co-workers were dedicated as well to getting the job done."
good,Good Company to work for but managers and supervisors are at a par level.
good,this job was good at the moment when the time was needed but no medical benefits at all.
good,"Aprendi a ser mais proativa, a ser mais dinâmica, aprendi que lidar com pessoas não é uma tarefa fácil, mas é o difícil que me atrai. Aprendi a ir além, meus colegas de trabalhos são pessoas agradáveis, da gerência a direção aprendi que as vezes as mudanças são necessárias."
good,"Cumprir minha meta de trabalho,aprendir muito sobre pescado e a qualidade do mesmo,pessoas muito preparadas para avaliar o seu profissional e pessoal o tempo foi muito pouco para avaliar mas pelo o pouco contato encontrei pessoas que me ajudarão muito,o cheiro do pescado qdo fomos aprovados na experiência com a oportunidade de voltamos como efetivo."
good,Pepsi spends a lot of time developing their employees. I learned how to bring an operation from a vision to fruition. I acquired skills that are transferable to many different jobs. I had a very strong manager who was able to take raw talent and develop that talent and mold a positive team environment that was productive. The hardest part of the job sometimes was knowing that open job positions are not posted for everyone to apply internally.
good,A typical day at work was going in and there was no work
good,"I have learned a lot here, process control, calibration of equipments, RM/PM, microbial analysis, man power management."
good,"Work day starting between 5am-6am. Time crunch-orders must be done by 1pm. Orders take about an hour an order. A typical day you could have 8-10 orders to place. Also responsible for all sales, that merchandising is correct, pricing in place, and out indexing the competition. Highly stressful on Holiday weeks. It is a 24 hour 7 days a week job. Most enjoyable part-IF your accounts look good you could be done at work around 3pm."
good,"Fun, fast paced environment. Good management team, great plant staff."
good,"Excelente lugar para laborar, solo que los horarios si son un poco extensos en el área de ventas ."
good,"Empresa multinacional, de grande porte, alta tecnologia."
good,"Productive and fun workplace. Nice and supportive team mates. Good work environment. Clean atmosphere."
good,PepsiCo is a good place. It is just like any other company both pros and cons. If you are looking for a mentally demanding and sometimes physically demanding opportunity then this would be for you.
good,"Overall it's a good experience "
good,"It's a great company to work for but there's no life balance. If you're are ok working 12-14 hours a day, it's the place to be. Based pay and Chinese overtime."
good,Boa empresa para se trabalhar mas a liderança deixa muito a desejar
good,"Pepsico treated me very well. The intern program was wonderful, and I learned a lot during my 10 weeks with the company. Procurement was a wonderful place to land with pepsico."
good,Good while I was there but wasn't there long enough to experience more .alot of things are fast paced and the bosses were good at getting help in places that it was needed
good,Direct management makes a huge difference so it depends on who is in charge. The company itself does offer good benefits and pension however salaries are capped and no room for advancement in some areas.
good,"I enjoyed my 17 years working there in a sales capacity. Leadership focuses on creating leaders, inspiring others to step outside their comfort zone and shun complacency."
good,I liked working there because the work wasn't that hard even tho it was big machines for ladys easy to do especially with help of each other coworkers.
good,"No aplica para mi caso, acabo de salir de la compañia"
good,"Basically keeps you on your feet all day, constantly working with the public and learning new things. all around good place to work, treat you well and are supportive"
good,It was a ok work experience. The hours and the work are not worth the pay. Was thankful for the job at the time and I worked it until I found better or something that worked better for me.
good,"First of all I did presentation, after that I made the psychology test, the test was very extensive and I have few time for exercises. "
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo. Supervisor fue bueno con nosotros.
good,"Por muitos anos quase 8  otima empresa para se trabalhar ,porem com a mudança do ultimo  gerente veio intimidaçoes e ameaças a todos os vendedores para atingirem seus objetivos"
good,Start the week off on Sunday/Monday depending when the 2 days you get off are. Hours varies between how much cases are needed as well as how many workers are on hand. After the first 2 weeks both hands and feet will hurt. After it gets better. Summer can have between 12-16 hours in one night and you will have to come back the next day. Must have steel toed boots and gloves(both provided)
good,I had a wonderful experience at Pepsico over the 15 years that I was there.  Most of the people were great and the experience was once in a lifetime. I made the decision to leave after 15 years because they kept flattening the organization and reducing compensation.
good,"Sales achievement. "
good,"Four day work week, at 10/h work days. very strict in house rules,"
good,"I was a consultant @ Pepsico, not an employee.  The work was really good and challenging. I experienced travel to Mexico City to support a major initiative."
good,A Good opportunity for starters. No satisfied salaries paid. Flexible work time. Best platform to learn the standards and other skills very quick. Benefits not upto our expectations as we think its MNC
good,"Compañía estable, con gran oportunidad de crecer ,  ."
good,I worked the the promotional marketing teams in the development and execution of campaign programs for the fountain beverage division prospects and customers.  It was a great opportunity to expand beyond a typical CPG client environment...as pushing innovation was a key driver fueling the excitement and creativity of day to day operations.
good,"Long days, very busy. Union. Don't know what else to say. Don't know why I have to have some reasons to put this. The company was okay. "
good,"Es una empresa que te permite tener un buen ingreso, arriba de la media, muchos bonos mes con mes, te dan uniformes y botas periódicamente, trabajar ahí en un reto diario, quizá lo único que no está bien, es la forma en como manejan al grupo las personas que están a cargo, pero es buena la empresa"
good,"Me ha permitido conocer aspectos laborales muy interesantes, ya que tuve la posibilidad de hacer labores de jefe de almacén de mantenimiento y de administrativo de ese mismo departamento,  un trabajo en el que tuve que tener contacto con compañeros de otros departamentos y me ayudó a conocer nuevas vías de mejorar y ser más eficaces en el mío."
good,Working for pepsi was a very good experience and I enjoyed working for the company. Management was great  and the workplace was  always organized.  Pepsi made it very esy learning how to work in a warehouse and hats what made me enjoy working for Pepsi.
good,"Workplace used to be much more fun and enjoyable.  After the previous two rounds of layoffs, morale has taken a major hit."
good,"Oficinas cerradas en su momento, creo ya la reestructuraron"
good,"Buen ambiente laboral , excelente empresa , pero aún tiene detalles por afinar en cuanto entregas"
good,"Working at PepsiCo was fun and not stressful at all. There is no work pressure and the employees are given good breaks in a day."
good,"Muy buena empresa , muy orden , compañeros educados , ambiente laboral maravilloso"
good,"loved the atmosphere. management was flexible and understanding, can't really say the same for some co workers. the customers and store management were generally really friendly as well."
good,"Working as an overnight merch has its perks you don’t have the co festoon of a store being packed with customers, but you have zero support from daytime staff or managers if you have any questions that need immediate answers. There really should be an overnight supervisor to relay these things too someone to make the call for the managers but who also works the overnight shift so they are available for questions at 4:00a. There is no shift differential for working the overnights, and no weekends off you work every Friday and Saturday"
good,"Overall its was satisfactory."
good,"PepsiCo is a great place to work, however they do major layoffs every year so not very secure.  I enjoyed working independently without being micro-managed,"
good,"Es una empresa con buen ambiente de trabajo, con bastantes experiencias para aprender pero sin crecimiento, se debe tener tolerancia a la frustración y con buen sentido de apoyo."
good,Overall good job. It’s pretty rough for about the first 3 to 5 years. Most of the time working 6 days a week. It’s a union shop so EVERYTHING is seniority based. I’m still here so they are doing something right. Must be willing to WORK. Lazy people need not apply.
good,"Horários flexíveis, banco de horas. Bons benefícios. Problemas com comunicação e disputa entre setores."
good,Empresa com bastante desenvolvimento profissional ..e um bom desempenho produtivo..
good,"Due to franchise operation, it's not satisfactory place to work. Company should focus on distribution. Need company operation in odisha to grow faster."
good,"Excelente empresa, buen ambiente laboral "
good,"Good Company,lots of room to advance...great pay. Lots of safety training and direct contact with customers. Keeps you physically and mentally active."
good,Une entreprise avec de vraies valeurs et de beaux challenges à relever.
good,"empresa boa de trabalhar, local adequado, salario compativel"
good,Training process needs improvement. Supervisors are replaced too often and bounce around departments for there self benefits and causes each department to struggle since there’s no structure.
good,"I like working there. Its a very fast pace environment, with long hour. So it is no problem in making overtime or a lot of money. I just was in school at the time and couldnt keep up with the long hour on 2nd shift."
good,"Management were never on the same page. Job kept you in shape. Job is good for getting your feet wet, and learning customer service, but there are other jobs that pay better."
good,"Bien pagado pero bien presionado, muchos indicadores por cumplir, si eres alguien que le gusta trabajar sobre objetivos y dinámico para cumplirlos es el trabajo ideal"
good,"Proporciona diversas oportunidades de carreira e aprendizado. Excelente lugar para aprender, desenvolver e praticar liderança e trabalho em equipe."
good,PepsiCo is a great good. I've worked there for 13 years. On a typical day I would have to upload packages. Driving a forklift was a everyday thing. I've learned to work in a steady pace.
good,As of my experience its an nice working place and environment for the employees. The company follows all the government norms for the employees welfare and also the company development.
good,"Empresa com bons benefícios, ambente de trabalho agradável. "
good,You are payed well. Very difficult if you are not used to intensive labor. You don't have much of a life outside of work. More movement upwords in work because of seniority and not experience or credibility.
good,"Great benefits,  but they showed alot of favortism towards their own kind. (Race). I worked on the late night shift, but we had a certain level to meet and if we didn't they would try and you up."
good,"Pros:"
good,Pepsi is a very fast-paced company for the position that I hold. There is a lot that can be improved in the management team. I feel my voice is not heard at a Pepsi.
good,Pepsi has good benefits but can be more competitive as far as pay. They offer in depth training on a lot of jobs and follow through on inquiries on different subjects.
good,A typical work day was filled with setting up and updating company outlets. Managing outlet accounts and processing information through various computer applications. Having weekly personal and team meetings.
good,"PROS : good pay great benefits "
good,"Overall pepsi is a good company. The one negative is communication from upper management and customers and that leaves the drivers in a bad spot."
good,No work / life balance. Must socialize with upper management to get promoted (sponsor). Must work long hours on a daily basis 6 days a week and sometimes 7 days in a row.
good,Uma grande Empresa para se trabalhar porém com uma cultura muito engessada em seus projetos.
good,Pepsi was a very enjoyable company. I Recommend Pepsi for anyone looking for a long career. It has great values and very good benefits for families. Plan on long ours and lots of hard work.
good,It's a great company to work for I think upper management has the right idea unfortunately my immediate supervisor didn't have the same idea. His main goal was for upper management to see change and not worry about the final outcome. Customer where already being affected before I left. I'm sure upper management will make correction.
good,"*12-14 hour days"
good,"I climbed the corporate latter from working at the the plant to running delivery routes, supervising the delivery routes to selling to the biggest customer in the the world (Walmart/Sams) at the RVP/DVP level.  Awesome opportunity and met some great people."
good,"Great benefits and union. A lot of different departments and room to grow within the company. They offer 401k, vacation and sick leave. Paid holidays."
good,"Tuve una buena experiencia, horario cómodo y me gustaba mucho el trabajo. El trabajo era parte time mayormente los fines de semana, pero al principio en la semana tenía turnos en la mañana ya que tenía otro trabajo."
good,"not a team environment build around competition which makes it an aggressive job wouldn't recommend it unless your fit. its a very active job"
good,"Working as a merchandiser is a physically demanding and sometimes exhausting job especially in the summer.  Days start as early as 4am and can exceed 12 hrs.  Most, however are between 8-10 hrs in length.  The pay and benefits are good and people are willing to jump in and lend a hand most of the time.  Pepsi does a decent job taking care of it's employees and working with you if life gets complicated."
good,"It is a very friendly atmosphere, with a Diverse group of workers. I have worked for PepsiCo in Urbandale Iowa for a little over 2 years now. I have had a pretty good relationship thus far. I think the only thing negative; is working in the weather condition changes; but it comes with the territory; there is nothing you can do about that. Dress according to the job description and stay hydrated during changes of the seasons."
good,"Learning something different from management to coworkers,everything at this job was a experience,There potentially space for growth to achieve in getting your CDL if you don't have them"
good,The loaders and pickers needed more communication between them to ensure better quality of the product and the way it's shipped. Pallet sizes and proper stacking should be inforced
good,"-a typical day on the job starts at 5am at my largest store. From there I clock in and check in with store managers about wants and needs. Then I begin either stocking shelves or writing an order for that store. Once done with that store, I communicate again with store manager before leaving. I perform these duties in anywhere from 3-5 stores a day."
good,productive and fast passed work place. i worked on doubles forklift and slip sheet lift from time to time. this job was a placement through prologistix
good,"overall, a decent job. good pay for part time. good people. could have used a bit better communication. still friends with quite a few of the people i met through the job"
good,Great place to work a lot of excitement. Typical shift began at 3P until 12P depending on the event. Was able to meet great people and work with a great team. Very easy work mostly have to have great customer service skills.
good,es algo pesado ya que no tienes hora de salida y tienes que llegar con la cuota que te piden
good,"PepsiCo, especially on local levels, cares a lot for it's employees. The benefits are outstanding, the work-life balance is really great. "
good,"Muitas mudancas ocorreram em minha passagem de 2 anos nessa empresa."
good,typical work includes building orders on pallets. There are different things you can do within the warehouse if you are willing to work hard enough. Management is ok. Hardest part of the job can be the long hours depending on how much work is required to be done in that specific day. Most enjoyable is employee appreciation week although  the last year wasn't all that great.
good,PepsiCo was a good place to work. One of the best managers I ever had. Enjoyed working alongside my co-workers. Hardest part of the job was working with some of the backline teams.
good,Great opportunities provided to help individuals to grow in their career and many domains to get expertise and develop in personal and professional life.
good,Typical day at work fun hard day lots of moving around I learn how to multitask an manage my work area so it wont be so hard for me to clean at the and of the day I can help out and run the forklift or I could be delivering merchandise to a grocery store that's the most enjoyable part of the day for me. Thursday was the heavy days what I mean about that is BULK day was are hardest day which was Thursday I worked 2nd shift  2-9pm sometimes didn't get off until eleven or twelve.
good,Started at 2pm did a forllift inspection. worked in production taking finished pallet's off the production line and stacking them in the warehouse. also loaded trailer's with product to be shipped to other store's. very fast passed. hard part was makiing shore you stacked the product properly so it didn't fall. the people were fun to work with.
good,"Falta apoyo a crecimiento y creer en la gente, el resto me pareció de las mejores experiencias laborales que he tenido"
good,Nice job great ppl working there I was going through a cris miss to many days of work good money weekly if u on a route u make commission 550weekly salary good living
good,"Pelo comentário dos funcionários , parece ser ótima "
good,Vraiment fière d'avoir grandi au sein d'une si belle organisation.
good,It's a good working environment for the most part.. management had there own way of doing things of course but it's really not to too bad..if they give you a heads up on things like schedule changing.
good,"I enjoyed my work at PepsiCo, and although the days were long and sometimes very hard, it was challenging and I didn't often get bored. They also pay very fairly."
good,hard work when given a route but steady and great customer interactions. you got to do lots of new things for the better and worse at times. co workers always helped the best they could
good,PepsiCo offers  great medical benefits.  They have an average retirement 401K plan.  The beginning starting wage is good but raises are on the low end.  The staff I work with are good people and the USM is awesome.
good,This was a great entry level start to a career as a Class CDL Driver. I truly have enjoyed the experience and what this company has taught me. This is a growing company with a lot of opportunity.
good,"Empresa seria que mantém a qualidade dos seu produtos, que se preocupa com seu cliente final."
good,"Se necesitas mas personal por parte de RH, mas motivaciones."
good,"Very fast paced. Only had a day and a half training due to time of year. Kind of underpaid for the expectations they hold you to. It is exhausting work and you have to work at a 200 case per hour speed. 32-16 oz bottles can considered 1 case. Imagine having to load 64000 bottles onto various pallets in a specified order to keep the pallet balanced for transport, IN ONE HOUR. And do that 8-12+more times in ONE day. FOR $16-$18 AN HOUR. I though this was one of the better companies to work for. The hard work is under paid and the desks are paid too much."
good,"Muy buen ambiente, la rotacion de puesto bien organizada, se puede aprender bastante, me gustaria volver"
good,"PepsiCo is a great company to work for, lots of benefits to being employed there. the crew is amazing and same with the management. If only I were off nights, life would be good!"
good,"greatb place to work, loved working there"
good,"Great learning facility "
good,"Me deram uma proposta de que teria um excelente plano de carreira, porém apesar do meu empenho, não aconteceu."
good,"PepsiCo is what you make out of it.  With good leadership, working there is great, bad leadership and it can be unbearable.  One thing you can count on is change.  If you happen to get one of those managers, best to keep an active network, current skills and look for an opportunity to move to new role."
good,I like it the people I work with are great. it gets very cold and we do a lot of heavy and awkward lifting. other then that the company is good a takes care of equipment
good,I have to manage different sections in Beverages processing so I have opportunity to go through all these task as a part of my job routine. I have great opportunity to learn about management skills in different ways even in tough scenario.*required
good,"it was well organised ,safe work environment,organised, timely updated by the manger.I been trained properly and aware about the new product in the market."
good,Every job at pepsi is tough. Never did i think the soda buisness would be so stressful. However if you dont mind a hard days work with some long hours its really not too bad. The benefits are pretty good. They still offer a pension. You just have to deal with the stress of a declining soda buisness due to people trying to be healthier.
good,"Trabalho cansativo e desgastante, muita cobrança, sendo a parte mais agradável fazer amizades."
good,"Une très belle école de vente, pour etre formée aux différentes techniques de vente"
good,"Um ambiente super agradável"
good,"Was a co-op, learned a lot and the organization was around to help me continue to grow. Job security an issue, lots of people were let go during my time."
good,This company had great benefits and free product and giveaways.  Just didn't like being tied to the phone for hours on end everyday.  Coworkers were great!
good,Not really a bad place to work just gotta get better at listening to the worker's and I think they would be good. They need flexible hours for the  warehouse workers
good,Very fast pace job you get to see different people all day long.it has good pay. You drive the truck and take the order in and stock the shelves......
good,"Working at Pepsi is a lot of hard work, and you are not secured a permanent position until the very end of your temporary assignment."
good,"Pepsi’s a good company to work for. If you want to move up in the company show up on time, work hard and express your interests to your direct manager or the manager of the department you would like to work in."
good,"La multinationale PepsiCo Aliment a été une belle école pour ce qui est de la supervision, mais c'est un endroit très compétitif même à l'interne ce qui fait que c'est un peu dur sur notre moral, mais aussi sur le moral de nos employés qui se fatiguent rapidement. Par contre, très axé sur le changement. C'est l'idéal de nos jours!"
good,Could be better with better management and better co workers. Depending on mood is depending on your night. If everyone works hard its a good night but there are always slackers that make it a bad night.
good,"Normally high stress environment with management concerned with budget goals and sales"
good,long hours very little time off. never really get the days you want off unless you've been with the company for more th its not likely.an ten years and even then
good,"If hired, which could take a while, the environment is very high paced, very heavy workload with lots of hours to go around for everyone. Management could be better."
good,"Mal equilibrio entre vida personal y laboral."
good,I had a great time at Pepsi and I fit in very well. Although the management had a high turnover rate we still managed to get things done. I was there contracted by Aerotek.
good,"Otima empresa, boa estabilidade de vida, salario bom."
good,It was okay for the most part. Just be to work on time and do your work safely and efficiently. Long hours and good benfits. Learned a lot from this company.
good,It was an ok place to work. Could have been alot more order but was ok .. The management was not communicatin as well as they should have . They would write us up for not staying later then we should after we have worked the mandatory hous they had asked of us
good,"es muy cansado el trabajo ,mal pagado para todo lo que se mata uno"
good,Pues fueron muchos años pero a pesar de haber hecho tanto por la compañía nunca fui valorada al nivel que esperaba
good,"A typical day - We unload semi's first thing. Rotate pallets. Start building pallets for delivery truck drivers, takes about tree quarters of the day. Clean up shop and wait for drivers to come in. Load semi trucks for delivery to other Pepsi companies. Wait for delivery trucks to come in, then load their trucks."
good,It is long hours and physical labor. Management staff is constantly changing. First shift hours start at 3am. You go to varies stores to merchandise their product.
good,"As a commission based route sales representative you live your route. They tell you that you have complete autonomy over what you order and deliver to make it as efficient and profitable as possible for your route, but due to factory overruns, nationwide promotions, and other large scale shortfalls more product is forced onto your route than can be sold. This causes many days of picking up out of date product or moving product from store to store, and in all of these instances the costs are taken from your sales. Average work days for an RSR are between 10-12 hrs five days a week. I ran a route out of town and my average start to finish time was 16hrs. Though some routes are able to generate a commission salary of around 70K per year most are between 45-60k. With the amount of labor, hours, and responsibility it doesn't pan out to what I consider fair pay for the efforts made. They also promote furthering your education. They will only reimburse college courses they feel are necessary to PEPSICO employees, and if you are going to school in your own time they will celebrate that until you get close to graduation then they will change your schedule, transfer you, and do anything in their power to keep you from completing your educational goal, as that makes them fear your ability to move on to better endeavors."

good,I loved working here but it is a union plant. The union and stewards are awesome but management seems to be after everyone because of it. As a mechanic and being required in the plant in order to run the managers don’t treat you very well.
good,"Some days are good, some days are Very Busy. the days that are smooth, it gives time t get PM's done and work orders. Many different types of process equipments and alot to learn, but too many long ti mers for any advancement in the maintenance Dept."

good,"Technology, advanced as it is today, is not enough to allow advancement without relocation. Benefits are good. Tools offered to employees are second to none. The hardest part of the job is the amount of stress. It seems like everyone is worked to capacity and not providing high quality output of work."
good,This is a pretty well organized company to work for. It's been many years since I worked there so I can't say for sure if this is still true. I enjoyed it.

good,I really like this job because i got to talk to customers and store managers about the product i was stocking. I would start my day around 6am and finish close to 4pm. Managers let you do your job and only bothered you if there was a problem.

good,"Aprendí a interactuar con muchas personas de distintos paises, crear procesos y organizar tareas de forma autónoma"

good,I stock shelves which is easy. I get a decent pay and i only work weekends. Getting up early isn't my favorite thing but it could be worse. I get to work alone which is fine. Though driving from place to place isn't ideal because compensation for miles isn't much.
good,"i learnt alot of new things warehouse job as well as sale dept."

Many skills were necessary on any given day and I learned a lot of vital skills throughout my term here. Along with operation of the forklift I also maintained trucks and relocated them in the lot."
good,"Uma empresa boa para se trabalhar, tem seus contras."
good,A typical day at work for me was balancing the trucks deliveries from the previous days work. Calling on customers to order product. While doing those tasks I would work with customers that were past due and needed to get their accounts caught up. I would process the payments that were mailed in. I would work with co-workers regarding accounts that were short paying invoices to correct those mistakes may they be on our end or the customers end. Overall I would keep track of the money coming in from customers as well as making sure invoices and statements were sent out when needed. My job could be quite challenging and stressful at times. I truly enjoyed the co-workers i had the privilege working with.
good,Safe and secure place to work. Benefits were good. Lots of overtime. A type of High school drama/gossip was around though.
good,A typical day was filled with very fast paced activity. I liked being in a team environment that also allowed me to do stretch assignments. Management was good.
good,"Average work day start around 5am. Go to the Pepsi plant grab your truck keys , head to you first store. Usually takes about 3 hours to work a store. You have your main soda isle, coolers, tea/coffee section and water. Rotate the products, write an order for the next two days , condense as much as possible, then head to your next store"
good,Great company to work for.  Co-workers are great and friendly environment.  Daily job task would be drive your route and fill up pepsi machines that needed filling up and make sure they are working properly.  Empty cash box and turn in money at the end of the day.  Not enough vacation for the type of job you do.

good,"La na pepsico aprendo varias coisas, na parte de arquivos e desenvolvimento pessoal"
good,"Lo mas dificil es andar en campo pero pues así es el trabajo "

good,"Era muy fácil el trabajo sólo que no hay una buena organización en general de jefes,recursos humanos y de mas."
good,Start out cleaning tanks that are empty. Then you unload the sugar car or two if you have room. Then start mixing for the next day production.
good,"Typical day at work was being on your feet for hours at a time, it was tedious but my coworkers and managers made it very fun. The hardest part of the job was the manual labor of consistently bending and picking up product. The most enjoyable part of the job was being with coworkers that are very nice and friendly."
good,"El trabajo en si,y las comodidades,prestaciones,etc.eran muy buenas.Si dependia de mi me hubiese gustado seguir en Pepsico,el problema fue que mi CONTRATO era por TIEMPO DETERMINADO, el cual al finalizar no se me renovo porque ya estaba estipulado que asi sea.."
good,"A typical day at Pepsi Co consisted of closing out equipment moves from the previous day and calling customers to schedule the equipment install or pick up for two days out.  I learned that customer contact is very helpful and the customer appreciates the information given.  The management was helpful with any issues or problems that may arise.  My co-worker were always helpful and worked as a team to get the job done.  The hardest part of the day may have been not being able to get in touch with the customer to notify them of the equipment moves.  I enjoyed everything about this job, the people were great to work with."
good,As a pre sell account manager I was able to provide growth and brand recognition on a local/family own market as well growing exisiting accounts who used competitive brands.
good,Great place to work at. Great team and co-workers. It's all because of the great leads that are hired carefully to lead the team. Good benefits and good compensation.

good,Se trabaja sobre objetivos y bajo una presion constante para cumplir con los lineamientos de la empresa y sus prioridades
good,As a part time merchandiser hours are feast or famine.  The job itself isn't to bad.  Some days are pretty physically demanding.  All ways have your ringer turned on or you can miss opportunities to work.
good,"Agradavél."
good,This job was very tiring. I worked consistently 12 hour to 15 hour shifts on a daily basis without stopping to eat. I really did my fair share of labor at this job.
good,Una empresa q se compromete con los empleados y los premia por sus esfuerzos y colaboracion en los dias de mas actividad
good,OK place to work. WFH 2 days a week in my position. Really laid back environment. The only issue that i am seeing is advancement is really slow

good,"good coordination with peoples here  in my department ,having too much fun even if we are in a crucial situation,team work is a plus point -learned how to manage time for emergency shut down."
good,"The sales environment is changing all the time. You are always shooing a moving target. Disposable income is a challenge in the country. The most challenging part is price management and New Product Distribution in the trade"
good,Its really hard to get a full-time position being a contractor at Pepsi. The best thing to do is work here for awhile and move on to get something better.
good,Ok place to work good benefits just never know when you will be getting off. Nice hours and decent pay. Lots of manual labor.
good,"Only thing that made the job hard was working nights and my family life, it was hard to balance the two. I had to make the decision a lot between money and family. Family had to come first!"

good,"Coworkers and customers were extremely friendly and easy to work with. The schedule was very flexible, although it was physically demanding."

good,"SAP Functional Consultant (MM)"
good,Our day started at 3:00 p.m. and typically lasted any ware from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. We used a system called ASN which was a software program that employees used through headsets to complete their tasks. There were many areas of the operation and I was used in all the areas to balance out any problems I could see happing before they happened. The job was very laborious and took a toll on our bodies and minds with lac of sleep and very long hours.
good,"Physical Job, possible long hours work in all weather elements. Heavy lifting, customer service operation of tractor and trailer."
good,"Lots of benefits, but there is little room for growth unless you have a college degree.  Even if you get one during employment, it is unlikely that you will be promoted."
good,"Great company to work for.  The work is honest and the pay is decent.  But when it comes to a career path, the company is severely lacking.  Its quite honestly the reason i left.  Advancement is based solely on politics and not enough merit."
good,My job has been very rewarding at this company. I've learned a lot about warehousing policies and procedures as well as delivering quality product to our consumers and customers.
good,"•     Built orders using the picking system"

good,Eu cresci e aprendi junto com a empresa. Ganhei experiências e ajudei ela a crescer com a minha capacidade de liderar.
good,"En la empresa se tiene un horario de entrada mas no de salida, depende de como manejes las rutas de entrega y la cantidad de carga que se lleva se puede terminar temprano o salir hasta en la noche, en general la empresa es buena te va bien y te dan todas las prestaciones de ley lo único que puedo decir es que si en el horario si es un poco pesado pero en todo lo demás esta bien."
good,"Boa Empresa, bom ambiente de trabalho, precisa melhorar pacote de benefícios"
good,"Great place to work with supportive staff. i would start work at 430 so that i could be at work when the companies that we order raw materials from would get to work around 8. i learned how to order raw materials and now to run multiple different applications that kept track of our inventories, so i knew what i had on inventory"
good,"Falta crecimiento al personal, aprendí cómo es una empresa grande a nivel mundial, un día típico estás ocupado con variedad de cosas pero a veces no hay nada que hacer, tus colegas no están integrados, la parte más difícil es que no se aprecia lo que haces y lo que más me gustó es que siempre entendieron lo que hacia"

good,"This is a good place to work, everyone very personable. The corperate structure/business requirements are difficult to follow in a smaller market, when these sales requirements are designed for large markets. To advance into management, you have to relocate"
good,Did not work at the location. I was working from offshore (India) I have nothing much to say about it since the interaction was not directly with the client but with my senior
good,"Excellent work enviorement.I liked so much to work in this company because the conditions for all was very good. "

good,PepsiCo is a company that hires and grooms the best marketers in the world.  Their employee development program is one of the best that I have seen.
good,It was a good job with good management. Excellent benefits and friendly co-workers. Sitting in traffic was the hardest part of the job
good,Drive to different super market and stocking shelf and setting up displays around the store. Rotating product according to the experacion date. Working by myself and reporting to update on work.
good,I worked here for very small tenure but I think PepsiCo is pretty cool place to work for. Integrity and attention to detail about the work is pretty good.
good,"Good company, I had a good experience but with limited time. My input most likely would not be a good point of reference. I only had a few months of time, but I loved the people I worked with, and hated some. Large building there are a lot of people that you would not know, it is the typical large corporation office environment."
good,"Responsibilities"
good,I found Pepsi to be a well organized company. Each day was mapped out for us the evening prior and sent to our company provided phones. Management worked very well with its employees to provide a good working evrironment.
good,This is a solid company that pays well however the loader/picker position is very labor intensive and the hours are extremely long based on outgoing orders.
good,"Aprendi a não esperar pelos os outros, tentar sempre melhorar a exposição dos produtos e sempre que um cliente precisar de sua ajudar mostrar interesse em procurar se informar de um determinado produto para passar a melhor informação possível ao cliente."
good,"friendly co-workers"

Reviewing and processing job applications. Checking manager's voice mails and emails following up and handling immediate service needs. When working with so many people on a daily basis (Customers and Co-Workers) I have learned to deal with many personalities. Some cases were very extreme, but in business you have to make sure that all types of customers are satisfied in order to ensure the business longevity and also to maintain a healthy work environment with Co-Workers. I learned different programs and procedures in order to be of better assistance to customers and co-workers in absence of upper management, hence making their office work lighter when they returned from the field. Management in my first 5 years there was great. Management was very fair in how the employees was treated. When the manager was transferred to another location and another manager from another location stepped in that is when everything changed. Everyone became insecure about their job status, always tension, many were getting fired. There were cliques being formed. Your voice was basically silenced as far as ideas, creativity, as well as suggestions.

good,"Empresa multinacional de grande porte na área de alimentos e bebidas, atuei apenas na área de bebidas quando o departamento em que eu trabalhava foi descontinuado seguindo as atividades para o México, apesar de ser uma empresa agradável e mesmo eu tendo oportunidade de continuar em outro departamento, preferi ir em busca do mercado nas funções a quem me julgo melhor conduzir."
good,"Manage twenty plus employees on a daily basis. Responsible for timely and efficient deliveries within DOT guidelines and Company policies. I work with multiple departments of our company on a daily basis to ensure customers recieve the highest level of service possible. I am also responsible for all Safety and Regulatory training and responsible for the record keeping of all training. During my almost twelve years at Pepsico I have held several positions and gained experience in Sales, Customer Service, Management, and an overall understanding of the corporate work enviroment."
good,A typical day at work involved me reconciling work order forms and working on excel projects while analyzing company financial statements. Management was very helpful however not enough managers to help at all times. Co-workers were extremely friendly and easy to get along with. They were always helpful and took an interest in helping you advance. The hardest part about the job was working on different financial statements and analyzing numbers in excel. Although it was difficult it was a challenge that I accepted and enjoyed accomplishing. The best part about the job was the company culture. I enjoyed and looked forward to going to work every day because of the people.
good,Great workers and followed instructions well . Long hours and not enough pay. some managment had no respect for for their workers.
good,Was able to interact with the costumer on a daily basis from store to store.
good,A great company to grow within. They pay pretty good. Only problem is that it is hard to get ahold of your boss when you have a problem.
good,This job requires good selling techniques with focus on customer service and satisfaction
good,"You have to be aggressive and a hard charging individual, long hours but you work on a great team"
good,"I've worked for PEPSICO for twenty years and have recently been injured on the job. I've had a very hard time getting the insurance company to accept my claim, concerning an injury due to the repetitive physical motion required, to successfully do this job. Untinow,"
good,"Pepsi Co, is a company that has been in existence for decades. Heavily involved in the community and has produced some great produces. Pepsi Co, is one of the leading beverage companies in the country that continues to offer employment opportunities and diversity to all people.Fair wages, diverse culture and safe workplace environment has made Pepsi Co, a good place to work."
good,tienes que madrugar y llegar temprano con buena presentacion todos los dias
good,"Working at Pepsi was pretty cool, other than long work days your check surely benefited from your work days. Although being away from home and having a family with working 60 plus hours a week could be a potential problem. It wasn't  until March of 2019 when they decided to close the KCMO Production Plant. That a few number of people had to lose their  jobs"
good,"Line Operator, 10 hour shifts, scheduling, hours, co-workers, starting salary and benefits and wages, days off, location and drive distance of where live"
good,Solid company with room to grow; started off as a relief driver then transferred into the sales department.  I’ve managed my own route in the Belmont/Mt Holly area for approximately 4 years now.  Overall a great team
good,Good pay but needs management change. The perks where good. 2 weeks of paid vacation when you start and a discount on soda every week. Overall setup is good.
good,great place to work friendly equal opportunity... all though a bunch of cry babies and always out to get someone fired but other then that it was great and really helped my family!
good,Weird hours. Too stressful. Veryfast paced. Too much to worry about. Work hours are 2am to 11am. Lunch is at 6am. Just to much stress Too handle. Kinda dangerous too.
good,"Fast paced, fun. Great learning environment. Challenging assignments. Opportunities to travel and understand the needs of local consumers. Start up mentality in a large organization."
good,Interested in working for the company but it haves its pros and cons.the boss was fair and understanding with the employees and i wasnt in the warehouse i was out in the feild mostly
good,"Ho lavorato in questa azienda 10 anni."
good,"The job is really enjoyable and you feel responsible for your own success, but if any support from management is needed, you'll have to grind your teeth to get it."
good,Pepsi is a great place to work but it isn’t for everyone.  Expect to work decent hours Monday to Friday.  A lot of merchandising involved daily . Lots of repetitive lifting .  More of an account management role.  Perfect job if you are great at forming and growing long lasting relationships.  Good pay and 3 weeks vacation to start.  Good Benefits.
good,Creo que es una buena empresa con respeto al trato personal y profesional y para aumentar y mejorar la forma de trabajar en el punto de venta.
good,"It is a good place to work but more money needs to spend on I.T. Infrastructure. Too many workarounds that will cost the company more in downtime."
good,Mi experiencia en esta empresa fue muy buena aprendí muchas cosas
good,Great Opportunity for Entry level employee. With great benefits and work/life balance. I would recommend this job to anyone that wants to start a career in sales/marketing.
good,"El día típico en las plantas de PEPSICO es seguir todos los estándares  y normatividad aplicable así como respetar la cultura en calidad , seguridad y diversidad. Aprendí cosas nuevas en procesos de alimentos, la solidaridad en el equipo y con los jefes inmediatos así como el equipo directivo. La cultura laboral inclusiva, la parte mas difícil  es que hay que hacer multitareas en un tiempo muy corto con resultados positivos y contra reloj, lo que mas me gustó es haber laborado en la compañía líder en frituras del país y del mundo entero."
good,"Pepsi is a big organization with many divisons - Beverage, Food and Snacks.  Each division has its own culture.  Pepsi bottling is a tough organization."
good,"A PepsiCo e uma ótima empresa. Tem como principal função sempre promover funcionários interessados. Com plano de carreira para várias funções. Presa o bem estar de seus funcionários e familiares dando todo o suporte nescessário. É uma das empresas que mais cresce no país, com um enorme portifólio . Para todas as idades e gostos. Tem um exímio atendimento ao cliente, que supre todas as necessidades de qualquer estabelecimento . Pois trabalha cm parceria e discernimento e muito respeito cm seus consumidores. Em fim, super recomendo."
good,"Ran into a bad situation with management, other then that, great place to work. Relaxed atmosphere. Great coworkers. As an admin, you are required to be perfect, while other positions are not."
good,It’s a good job to have for a little while and get experience but really wears out your body. If your body can take it retirement and benefits are pretty good.
good,Work at your own pace freedom from being inside. Customers can make or break your day. It is a hard job but good benefits and home time. Pay could be more but once you get your own route it gets easier
good,"Repetitive but easy work, some good management and good coworkers. Compensation should be more for the physical nature of the job. Good job to start out in and advance up the ranks."
good,Decent company to work for. You will stay busy. Tasks include preparing vehicle in the morning. Delivery of product. Stocking shelves at certain locations.
good,"I honestly like working here. My boss isn’t bad and has a good understanding of what needs to be done. The pay is ok but the take home car makes all the difference. Always something to fix or install. You will constantly learn new things. "
good,I really liked working there because it is really rewarding and you learn to work by yourself a lot.
good,"It wasn’t a bad job , but it’s no job I wanted to be stuck at working so many hours just to get a decent check . Night shift and the hours I was working was not going to work out for me ."
good,"Great company, good pay, steady work, overtime if wanted. Really enjoyed working there. work was it hard people were friendly. Good employee benefits."
good,You have to work hard at Pepsi but they treat you well. I've worked for other distributors that dont care about their employees but at Pepsi they make you feel like part of the family.
good,"A PepsiCo foi uma ótima experiência profissional com muitos desafios e bastante trabalho... A empresa tem uma cultura muito forte em resultados e compliance, onde o cliente final era nossa principal razão e existência."
good,"Works for Pepsi for 11 years.  Plant manager play favorites  and if she didn’t like you you will know it   Very long hours ,low pay. No time for family. But all the Drivers got Along great with each other."
good,"as far a was concerned the colleagues I worked with were great fun"
good,very hard and physical job. union rules helps however it also limits. days can range from 7 hour days to 14 hour days. must start no later then 5:00am. you work most weekends. some routes that are given to you can be 30+ miles away. its a company that you want to think long term. PepsiCo is a Fortune-50 company.
good,"Being an emplyee of pepsi cola phils inc. is an "
good,"as company policy and company work culture are work friendly , but required the top management support for the higher level promotions , other wise you need to stay the same role ,"
good,"Connecting to your superior was easy and the hours were not too bad. You would often be required to take shifts for other people. You are required to work early in the mornings, so you must be aware of your own personality and work style."
good,Wasn’t bad.  But you do WORK for your money.   But there are perks to humping it all day.  No room for slow and lazy. Good weight loss program. Work work work.
good,"Bulk sales large format is a good was to get into the beverage business. The problem is that if you’ve been there for 20 years or 6 months, your salary and commission rate is the same."
good,I have nothing but good things to say about PepsiCo. I always felt comfortable with my job and always appreciated for my hard work. I get compensated well and the benefits are great. The advancement to management is very tough though.
good,Pepsi is a great company to work for. Get in the door. It can be difficult to put the family first...you will work more hours than you want. Money is decent..
good,"Good company to work for, good benefits."
good,"Days are filled with meetings, challenges to overcome and requests for new projects to be delivered.  Working remotely is the norm, leading and interacting with teams all around the globe.  The job has taught me to effectively manage teams, budgets, work virtually and lead multiple projects on tight timelines.  Management is generally supportive without micro managing.  The culture used to be very vibrant and people were collaborative across different areas.  More recently there have been significant layoffs, drastic reduction in team sizes and direction from leadership that consolidation of facilities will require relocation for a significant portion of the IT workforce.  This has eroded the energy and trust of many employees, and led to a significant number of resignations in the past year.  The best part of the job has always been the people and the opportunities for learning and advancement.  The ability to work remotely and opportunity to travel internationally to work with different parts of the business is also a wonderful part of the job."
good,"Great place to work, but we expect a lot out of our people."
good,"In my market, it was difficult to move up. Once corporate took over, the culture shifted in the wrong direction I thought.  It was also a very physical job with constant lifting, so it's not for everyone."
good,"Very physical job, long hours, and they expect a lot of you. I enjoyed working for the company and I had a great boss, but I spent my weekends so tired from the week before I didn't have much of a life. Its definitely a young man's job"
good,PepsiCo  Frito Lay has 3 shifts many of new hires are forced onto 3rd shift this is also the shift that gets stuck with all the extra work. Management never really stuck around long enough constant turnover due to better opportunities elsewhere.
good,A great place to start your career with opportunities to collaborate with different teams. The workplace culture is the best part of being an employee at PepsiCo.
good,I have worked with this company for five years now and have been happy. When i first started I moved up to sales in only three month. Ever since then I have truly loved the sales aspect and the relationships that I have built with the managers.
good,While I was merchandising I learned a lot about the job very quick. It’s nice to work on your own and and at your own pace. My managers were awesome never had any problems with them.
good,"A Pepsico foi uma escola em minha vida, aprendi muitas coisas que hoje levo para minha vida profissional e pessoal, ótimos benefícios e o referente a pagamento nunca atrasou, são corretos."
good,"A typical day was never typical. Every day presented new challenges and kept me on my toes. I liked the changes of scenery and the hours. I did not like working in the Boston Area. I was a victim of 5 hit and runs and 5 car accidents, all within 6 months. The company was very accommodating at the time, but later resulted in my resignation."
good,"falta de oportunidades de crescimento, mais com bons horários e benefícios"
good,"Texas location was excellent. Management and all. Made excellent money."
good,"PEPSICO  is a great company to work for.  I would suggest to make sure you find a mentor, someone who will invest in your career. Great benefits, and it can be flexible.  You will work more than 8 hours a day"
good,"If you looking for balance life, this is not the place. This more suited for single ambitious workers. If you want to spend time with your family it very hard. In order to do the job the right way, you have to be out in trade 10-12 hours a day. Most days you leave when it's dark and get home when its dark."
good,I have learned a lot in this organisation and manage a lot of things under production pressure and load.Iiin production you have to take a decision fast.
good,"Um ambiente agradável de se trabalhar  "
good,"PepsiCo is a good place to work, just any job, you got to be trained and then show your performance and just do it with a good attitude and with that, doing a good job has its own rewards. I think a good attitude shows on a person and working as a team player is another. Their are many opportunities available to someone willing to give the company their best and with that and a friendly smile can go a long way and that applies to everything a person does in every day life. A good attitude and good work performance equals a winning team where everyone can be happy and contribute to the overall success of the company and being part of that team. To grow in a company a person has to be part of that company and show support and contribute to the success of that company. I love challenges and learning new jobs and meeting new people and at PepsiCo I got the chance to do just that. I am looking to forward my experiences and add to my existing experiences in all of my endeavors. I believe I am a hard working individual with a good attitude and a zest that brings good relationships in the companies where I have worked and to all of my future relationships in other companies. I have a lot to offer in experiences and working knowledge that I can bring to any company and a positive attitude is a good place to start."
good,Empresa que dá oportunidade para jovens aprenderem uma carreira.
good,"Worked only half days minimum!! 12 hours is half of a day right??"
good,"The management team doesn't take their employees into consideration when they're planning any type of work related activities and etc. My current management team tends to spend most of their time playing around in the office shooting basketball, and playing computer games than assisting the employees hwo actually needs it."
good,Employees are paid well with great benefits... but you will seriously work for it. The hours are long every day you work; nearly every day in the summer is a 14 hour day.
good,"Pepsi is a greater place for a new driver to start.  Relaxed atmosphere , hourly pay, work at your own tempo or pace. Family oriented, dont ask or expect too much from the driver on a day to day basis. More concerned about your day to day well being than how many accounts you did or didn't service."
good,"i Start the work say with checking papers and machines and take instructions and note from previous shift engineering then i start the production or complete an old one , then i start to observe the quality and give instructions about it , notes if it found , make a round to observe the safety practice in the factory and give my notes and photos if i found any shortage or incidence in the system"
good,"management can be better, they dont seem to care about the production. seems as if they jus come to work to get a pay check. but besides that its a good job."
good,Una empreaa que sigue al pie de los lineamientos de sus normas y politicas de la misma
good,"The long hours and tough physical demands can really take a toll on your body. The people I worked with were amazing, with one exception, every manager was top notch. I would not have stayed at this job as long as I did if it were not for the people."
good,"PepsiCo is a company that offers employment to all types of people. Everyone is welcome to work at PepsiCo, and each employee has an opportunity to be successful."
good,"Embora a PepsiCo tenha contribuído muito com meu crescimento profissional, e a considero como uma escola, não vejo hoje a empresa nos mesmos padrões que tinha anteriormente, com a busca por crescimento em um mercado cada vez mais acirrado, a empresa perdeu um pouco de sua essência de valorizar o funcionário, e entrou em um ciclo novo, que está mais próximo das empresas de outros setores."
good,"PepsiCo in Halifax Nova Scotia was a small office with only about 15 team members in the office at a time. There was minimal social interaction outside of planned events that were very fun, such as charity golf events and product launches."
good,"Definitivamente mi escuela de aprendizaje laboral, estrictos disciplinados y con procesos de trabajo excelentes"
good,"Very nice plant and everyone is eager to help each other.  It's a union facility,  so you have to join to work there. Time and a half on your 6st day and double time pay on your seventh. However they have a flex work schedule that they have implemented.  So when your family is doing stuff on the weekends,  you'll most likely be working for straight time."
good,Muy Bueno. Me gustava a tener todos los productos PepsiCo disponible en los dias de trabajo
good,My direct Manager is incredible. Pepsi Co encourages life long learning. I am given many opportunities to expand my knowledge base. There is absolutely no culture. Not a great place for young people to work.
good,Een hele gezellige werkplek waar ik fijn gewerkt heb
good,"Typical day at work is quite hard core production related work"
good,"Good place to begin driving career. Management was okay, good teamwork environment. I was always able to get the days off I needed and when I needed. Hardest part of the job would be the actual unloading, which was pretty easy. The warehouse that loads the bays can make or break your day."
good,Good place to work very busy in the summer not much family time benefits are good. PepsiCo cares about their employees and many awards and appreciation awards and annual appreciation week
good,Good place to work. Not much room for advancement if not in the program. Would recommend for someone looking for stability and not looking to move around
good,Es una empresa con un buen ambiente laboral  mucha presión
good,"Empresa possui boa estrutura para os funcionários, sempre voltada em especial para o quesito segurança e produtividade, sendo esta também de extrema importância no que diz respeito a promoção e ampliação de oportunidades para os seus colaboradores, uma vez que a mesma possui projetos de desenvolvimento profissional visando sempre o seu crescimento em consonância com o mercado."
good,"Empresa multinacional de grande porte no ramo de alimentação, e bastante responsável pelo seus produtos até ao consumidor final"
good,too many moody co-workers stuck on the union cant get full benifits money wise its good just no time to live or do anything but work and sleep. the only bad thing is  no time
good,"O melhor é evitar se fazer uma rotina desmotivacional; procuro sempre com o time oportunidades e desafios alcançáveis, com fundo transparente para o resultado alinhado aos objetivos da empresa como para o desenvolvimento de cada um.  Promover estratégia para tudo, de forma que as anomalias sejam diminutas e menos sofridas para soluções. "
good,"I really enjoyed working with the people on my team and the company but I was on contract through cognizant and was extremely underpaid.  There was also no paid time off, holiday pay, vacation, or insurance."
good,PepsiCo es una buena empresa que da oportunidad de crecimiento haciendo bien el trabajo se puede sobresalir.
good,"Bom,um pouco de cada coisas,boa,familiar,óleo,união."
good,Una empresa sólida y estable en la cual puedes se estable
good,"Starting the day at 6:00 am, you were unsure what exactly your day entailed until using the handheld device. Most days were from about 6 am to 5-6 pm. There was a lot of sitting in the truck when not delivering, and delivery drivers are monitored via location on the handheld."
good,I would love to go back to PepsiCo as I enjoyed the work and the people are wonderful the hours for just fine the break room was very comfortable had outside seating
good,I would come in to Pepsico at 7. There would be pallets waiting for us. My partner and I would just go up t the pallets and give ur best opinion on if the pallets were god or not. We would put the god pallets on one side and the bad on the other.
good,"Great work environment with room for improvement."
good,This would be a dream job if management wasn't rude undisciplined and heartless. Management has favorites which makes others worry about the job security as they will fire you for anything. Plus you're only allowed 4 sick days all year.
good,The only bad thing about working at Pepsico was you spent all your time there. If you were low on the seniority list you were expected to work every day the plant was operating.
good,Promotions were difficult because they focused on promoting campus recruits or on a who you know policy. Had to resign for spouse relocation after 17y
good,"- Fast paced corporate environment where hard work and effort are recognized and praised"
good,"Overall a good company to work for with great benefits. Good people as coworker and work well as a team. Work/life balance is heavy on the ""work"" side. Prepare to be at work before sun-up and home after dusk."
good,I made some good money for Pepsi. But I had no social life. Worked early mornings 12-15 hour shifts mostly. It was also hard on your body. Good way to stay fit but the work is just extremely hard on the body throughout time.
good,PepsiCo treated me well. Payed minimally but okay. Management was good but not organized nor strong enough. No chance for full time without having a CDL no matter how well or hard you work.
good,". A full todo el dia."
good,"Good people to work with, poor managment is making things harder to accomplish. Fair time for breaks and lunches. Competitive pay. Overall review is 7/10"
good,Fast paced job that never gets dull. Great job security and benefits. Good job for people that do not like to sit in offices all day. Hard work and good customer relationships pays off.
good,"You are required to work a 12 hour day in 8 hours. As a sales rep you are nothing more than a glorified merchandiser with slightly higher pay. The management while I was there was great, however they are not able to help due to corporate control."
good,"At Pepsi there was plenty of room to move up, good pay, paid time off but expect to work overtime. Its a fast paced environment  but if you connect with people it can be an easy job."
good,Uma empresa muito boa de trabalhar com produtos de ótima qualidade de fácil acesso ao mercado. Salário bom e benefícios excelentes
good,"Decent place to work most jobs are very physical. Very long work days and hours, but pay especially for the area is very competitive. Overall not a bad place to work."
good,Management was very involved from a safety perspective and wanted to ensure everyone at the plant went home safe. Understood that while changes to safety are constant the right was being completed in order to make the working environment safer for front-line employees.
good,"The merchandiser position its a good start to be part of the company. You'll meet with many different vendors in the field and people. The merchandiser position is a early start time, 3:00 am or 5:00 am. Your end time during your work day is not guarantee because most likely you will do overtime."
good,"Good place to work, good benefits, nice group of people, sometimes long hours and plenty of overtime, some perks, good employer, free uniforms........"
good,"Pepsico pays very well, but the work/life balance is very low. I liked the people but the job itself was very stressful. I would still work there again"
good,Very hard on your body long hours can work up too 60 hours a week The benfits are good for a famliy of 4  3 years vacation after 10 years. you will start as low man which can be tuff
good,Over the last 5 years it has been a great environment and the people made it fun to work in. The later years things got harder when it came to upper direction from corporate. The people made it fun to go into work.
good,"One of the things I liked most about working here was that I wasn't under constant scrutiny by members of management, Each of the drivers worked independently and if you were doing your job well, they left you alone."
good,"Awsome place to work, great benifits, good company to work for. Good pay as well. The guys were always ready to help on installs, or techniques on how to get machines without causing damage to customers business."
good,"Some Management is decent but culture is changing due to new hires coming in and management does not change.  There is a lack of training, direction and plan setting."
good,"Typical beverage development environment. Short-term scope, frequent change of directions in research. Managers have been there for very long time and have a hold on power."
good,Tener gusto por las ventas por que es un poco laborioso
good,Typical day of work is answering phone calls scheduling training and compliance reviews.
good,Typical day starts at 5-6am depending if your an early bird! Make sure your products are all filled and faced and your backstock cleaned and put away according!
good,"The job itself is simple. stock and rotate products, builds displays etc etc. I gotta say the only issue i have with this position Is that I dont have full control over how long I work per day. Your day could change if, managers give you extra stores to do, your store delivery arrives late or the grocery stores have a tedious task they want you to do.  so what you thought was gonna be a simple 8-9 hr day could potentially turn into a 12+. and I'm not sure if All merchandiser  managers are like this but mine  don't answer their phones or reply to txt. which annoys me and makes my job harder.  it's not like I'm asking how their day is. im asking work questions. where's my delivery? ,I need an address to a store etc. As a merchandiser that's still new I have some  tips for all new merchers or for people considering applying . when you look at your schedule never assume that's it. keep in the back of your mind that you will get another store. never assume your estimated time of completion is correct. add 2 to 3 hrs to that.  Also know that there is a chance your salesman will dump the big delivery on you and make his deliveries light.  you will encouter stores where your product is out of place and or expired and the backstock isn't properly organized. if you keep these in the back of your head you won't be *that* upset when it happens. but like most places you gotta pay your dues first. after your 6 months you get your first raise. and can transfer to another department or get promoted to a salesman."
good,"I was on call 24/7. Pay checks were good but had to constantly change personal plans to cover for other employees on short notice. Was passed over for positions by under experienced employees with less seniority "
good,"I enjoyed the work but the pay was not as competitive to coke. management only promoted individuals who hunted, buying houses, or played a lot of golf."
good,"Monday- Office Day"
good,fast-paced job very physically demanding good working hours once was a very good company to work for then merged into a worldwide corporation and went downhill quickly
good,"-Typical work day was pretty busy dependent on seasonality, I obtained several sets of analytical skills. Most management was very helpful, dependent on the resources they had available.  The culture was based heavily on work/life balance. The hardest part of my job was influencing people, the easiest part was influencing people as I enjoy using data to influence people to make correct desicions."
good,"PepsiCo, Inc. is the overarching company that manages 22 one-billion dollar companies.  The brand consists of Frito Lay, Quaker, Tropicana, Gatorade, and, of course, Pepsi."
good,"I can tell working in pepsico help me grow in my   IT carrer, also here i experience obstacles that makes my personality more caring towards colleagues ."
good,"esta empresa es muy buena pero las areas de oportunudad estan en la administracion tiene buenos beneficio buena estabilidad ,se preocupan por sus colaboradores"
good,"Supervisors were great - some will work with you more than others. Able to move positions or locations if wanted, needed, or required. Part-Time work can vary on hours of course - you will have short days and long days but all work is very physical. At that time, co-workers informed me that after years of performing that type of work, their bodies have taken a toll."
good,"Started early, loading my truck - stops all day at stores, filling product and customer service. The long hours were pretty tough and My days off were split, Wednesday and Sunday."
good,I loved working for Pepsi it's fast-paced and physical work  I was let go for disability reasons but I am ready to go back. Human Resources says I was  eligible for rehire just wait to see if that is true
good,The work was easy as an adminstrative assistant. They are really great about admins working on projects which makes the work much more interesting. I earned my six sigma green belt in this company which was very rewarding. My manager was amazing but most of the management in the company either micromanage or have very old school ideas of what an admins job is (i.e. getting coffee and taking laundry to the cleaners). Hardest part of the job was not being challenged enough it makes an employee board and unmotivated. Most enjoyable part of the job were the benefits.
good,PepsiCo is a fast faced environment with high expectations.  I gained the knowledge of corporate processes in addition an additional skillset in safety management.
good,"You control your own day. Visit a set number of customers everyday/ usually the same every week (C & G, Drug & Dollar, & Grocery). Anywhere from 12-20, no company car provided but reimbursed for mileage. "
good,Crazy hours great advancement but your will never see your family again.  If you are starting out and single and want to learn and grow this is a great place to work .
good,work was good but upper management was your typical out of touch and out of date corporate who sits behind a big shot fancy wooden desk and makes stupid decisions to maximize corporate profits while giving the little guy the same pay and more work.
good,"It is a very physical demanding job where you know what time you start but not what time you get off, you work until done. Potentially long days but also really short days"
good,"Belles entreprises tres formatrice "
good,"typical my days are long, and busy. Overall the company does pay decent, and have great benefits, great culture, I've learned how to become a better sales rep."
good,"Limited career advancement, due to a consolidating industry under margin pressure.  Constant upper management turnover does not help the situation.  Need a new CEO to change the company vision/direction."
good,Great company to work for with great people. The people made the job enjoyable.  My teams that worked with me was a combination of union and nonunion workers. I learned how to work with both to be successful.
good,As an intern I was able to be exposed to the corporate culture in a lot of different ways. Interns were still a new thing in my department so I did have a lot of freedom to learn a lot of things. Great pay for an intern but the company didn't offer a lot of transitional opportunities.
good,Rotinas em produção e armazenagem no processo de alimentos.
good,"Hours are long but compensation is good, so it's worth the long hours. Learned valuable information about how to handle management at my accounts. Merchandiser supervisors do a good job of communicating with me on a given day to send help if needed. They also do a good job of giving days of when requested and work with you in the event you need a day of suddenly. Work on your own most of the time so need to be a self starter. Hardest part of the job is the physical labor but as long as you lift product properly you have little risk of injury. The most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom while out in the field and your day is done when your job is complete so some days are lighter than others."
good,"Nice working culture,Supportive staff,Good medical facility,Entertainment focused,Worldwide brand,mnc group,Quality conscious production,Standardised process"
good,"Devido ao porte da empresa, o funcionário acaba tendo pouca visão holística, ficando preso na mesma ""caixinha"" sempre."
good,I have done lot of initiatives and achieved many awards and rewards. i have developed many reports and analysis which helped to the Sales TEAM for their further planning. So many innovative things to the TEAM and this organisation.
good,"The days are long. The expectations are unrealistic. Pay is good, benefits are excellent.  Stock options, 401k match etc. There are rewards for sales goals."
good,"Fast paced, ever changing work environment. A lot of politics involved in order to move up in management. Shrinking market makes for a lot of cost reduction."
good,"it's a very fast paced workplace, not a lot of free time"
good,"I enjoyed working for PepsiCo. It was a very productive workplace, with hard working employees. Everyone worked well with one another to stay efficient and meet their quotas."
good,"Pay was several times above median income, great autonomy, and great colleagues and customers. In reference to the cons, advancement was nonexistent all relative to the politics that you can convey to upper management, poor communication lines from top-down strategy being implemented, and benefits were comprehensive; however, not that great."
good,during my time at pepsi was the 100 days of summer with fellow employees constantly quitting. we lost 1 person weekly for 10 weeks. worked a min of 65 hours a week for 5 months
good,Not incredibly stressful fun job with not as many hours as you would like. Management is normally pretty cool and understanding if you need to talk to them about something.
good,"I will suggest that if u lauch a new product think and lauch there must be something new from than competitor"
good,"a empresa realmente é um escola."
good,I think the company could be a little more diverse when it comes to its upper level management. The company would also benefit from sponsoring employees that already work within Pepsi.
good,With Pepsi you are required to work on weekends and all holidays except Christmas.  Average work week is between 48-58 hours a week.  This makes it very hard to balance family life with work.
good,"Empresa con gran desarrollo personal y laboral."
good,"A typical work day just requires you to be on time ready."
good,"Administro la tercera sucursal mas grande a nivel nacional. He aprendido mucho de la administración de proyectos, administración de personal de 60 empleados entre directos e indirectos. Se lleva un control de almacén de 18 millones."
good,"Great advancement Opportunity.  Long Days and high paced environment.  "
good,"Routing  all delivery methods for Pepsi locations across the U.S. Easy job with intailing working with locations on how best to route all trucks in cost savings method, constant  review of locations analytics via report and interrupting any opportunities for better efficiency. Office culture is good with people willing to step in and help each other."
good,I noticed that my customers product on a certain shelf was empty and looking in need of filling but they had no more product so I took a lot of inventory of our Pepsi 12 packs from back room and filled spot with it and cleaned up that spot for the customer making both of us look good and sell more .
good,"PepsiCo is a great company that genuinely wants you to learn, although they do not hire entry-level for Packaging. The employees here want you to learn and do not treat you like an intern. The management in this company is also eager to help. The office is very quite and not very sociable."
good,"Success depends on one's own ability to prioritize work load and juggle multiple task."
good,"good culture and opportunity for career advancement.  Great place to start your career, learn new skills and develop yourself especially in the sales industry."
good,For the most part this company looks after their employees.  The company has very many avenues for advancement and work.  the benefits are good overall.
good,"It was a good place to work, minimun supervision, work task were easy enough and you had a full time job. Sadly they only contract via CTS (Caribbean Temporary Services) and rarely give the employee the chance to be hired by the company per se. I was there six years and it was always working like a temp."
good,"The work culture is good and the management was supportive."
good,Great place to work with work life balance options however management is not great. Opportunity to work with great team and learnt and grown a lot
good,"muito trabalho para uma pessoa só, carregar o caminhão sozinho de duas a três vezes na semana, dirigir, vender e arrumar os produtos nos expositores e estoques de clientes."
good,"the days were the same overall. people were nice, i learned how to be efficient in a warehouse. the hardest part of the job was learning the system but once that was learned, work came easy."
good,"In questa azienda ho conosciuto un nuovo settore nell'ambito alimentare. Nel mio lavoro seguivo una puntuale pianificazione di lavori dall'analisi dei consuntivi dell'andamento del fatturato allo studio del piano di un piano sviluppo di un cliente al confronto con la direzione commerciale, quindi alla presentazione. Altra attività con le stesse dinamiche la sviluppavo con i collaboratori, agenti pluri mandato. Con quest'ultimi un feedback frequente e gli affiancamenti nelle zone di competenza completavano la mia attività. Trasferimento di metodo, supporto nelle trattative di vendita rafforzavano il rapporto creando un gruppo di lavoro sinergico e teso al raggiungimento degli obiettivi. Il buon rapporto con i colleghi dei vari reparti di logistica,produzione, amministrazione agevolavano il completo svolgimento del mio lavoro. La parte più piacevole del mio lavoro era quella della vendita presso i clienti direzionali e/o presso i clienti minori affiancando le varie agenzie. La parte meno bella era sacrificare spesso i fine settimana per completare report e programmi di lavoro."
good,I enjoy my job but long stressful hours some days. You will be working holidays as well. The only day off you will get is Christmas.
good,"rígidos en cuanto a prendimientos establecidos se trata"
good,Management really paid little to no attention to contract workers.  They do offer affordable benefits.  They were not able to offer other work once contract terminated.
good,al principio es emocionante ya que te motivan a que puedes ganar bonos pero yaen la secuencia de los dias trabajados el trabajo es mas forzado
good,"A PepsiCo é uma empresa muito boa de se traalhar, muito dinamica, uma nova experiencia e aprendizado, bons colegas de equipe, sempre nos dando novos desafios, mas nunca aqeles que não conseguimos realizar."
good,"Your company is your own enemy"
good,"PepsiCo has a 24X7 work culture where if an individual has the will to learn new things and take initiatives the opportunities to grow are immense. The pay structure is good and so are the employee incentives. One of the secure companies to work for with a special focus on gender diversity. Ample opportunities are provided to show one's potential to higher management. The company could do though with with lesser hierarchies, clearer HR policies and well mapped career growth plans for employees that are adhered to during appraisal cycles. Overall, it was a great learning experience for me to work with PepsiCo."
good,"In a typical day you had trucks that needed to be repaired, you had meeting with sales and operations, dealt with vendors and drivers, and helped with scheduling. I learned executional planners and the importance of them. I leaned their theory of the 5 S's which allowed us to win the presidential award. Worked in a very team atmosphere and everyone was willing to help each other.  There was strong support of the upper management."
good,"Pepsico isnt a bad company. Management is very respectful and will try to work with you if you work with them. Hours can be long, but it depends on how fast you can finish your route, pay could be a little bit better but overall not a bad company"
good,It helps me develop my personality and gives me professional attainment. Work environment is very productive that gives me more desire to work and be able to do my task well.
good,"This is the workplace which provides opportunity to learn, progress and contribute to the organization. Place that gives enough space and helps employees to grow."
good,"Believed in relocating employees every 18 months to 2 years, that wanted to move up the company ladder.  Living in a smaller market with family roots, was not interested in relocating until my children were older."
good,"Good fun atmosphere and good co-workers. the only problem is the warehouse supervisor, team leader, and the QC are very disrespectful. Pepsi needs to provide us with bullet proof vest to wear to work because of the neighborhood on a couple occasions shots were fired into Warehouse."
good,My plant is just not up to par but overall Pepsi has great benefits. Long hours work is physical but its what you should expect.
good,"Able to self-direct and work effectively with others at all levels of organization with team members, senior leaders, executive management and clients"
good,"Great company."
good,"Growing company with a focus on multicultured advancement. "
good,Great company to learn all aspects of 3PL. This company offers a start to a logistics career not job a job. I encourage those new and wanting to learn logistics to apply when an opportunity presents itself.
good,"Huge organization, lot of scope to learn every day, good management and co-workers, fun place to work. Very busy during work hours, sometime overtime in accounting department due to month end, quarter end or year end"
good,"Learnt different knowledge/Ideas in office & in Market work Understanding Customer Etc."
good,"- It has been an honor to work with such dignified MNC."
good,"It all depends on if you need someone looking over your shoulder at your every move to get your job done, if so this isn't for you. Your responsible for dropping and hooking the trailer at the correct locations."
good,"Un día tipico hablando por medio de audio confrencia con los cedis para solicitar  información"
good,"great benefits, flexible schedules, room for advancement.  This is a company that will give opportunity for growth and development and focuses on the better good of the employee as well as the business."
good,"If your willing to work there's opportunity to make a great living here. Outside of having to drive your personal vehicle for company related duties, this is not a bad place overall to work."
good,within the two and a half months I was with the company I learned different areas of the line quickly. I enjoyed my time there with my fellow co-workers.
good,"Good company culture and friendly co-workers."
good,"Fast paced production environment.Picking and building orders using forklifts and electric pallet jacks.Plenty of overtime witch makes for nice pay checks and little time to shop,good for saving money."
good,"Track team progress"
good,"Nice Helpful Staff"
good,"fun people, management something to be desired"
good,typical day at pepsi was definitely a workout i learned different aspects of the bottling industry coworkers are very helpful hardest part of job was meeting all stores needs on daily basis enjoyable part of job was meeting new people daily
good,"Un buen horario fijo de trabajo con actividades claras rutinarias, interacción con muchas personas, solución de conflictos en forma rápida, trabajo bajo presión constante interactuar entre ventas y administración"
good,Long days typically on foot most the time since i was only a temp.. others were able to ride fork lifts while i only had a pallet jack..
good,Great company to work for.  Always fun and challenging but due to size can be difficult to make impact that changes corporate strategic structure
good,Great company to work for.  Always fun and a challenge but due to size can be difficult to make an impact that changes the course of the organization
good,Multicultural place to work and plenty of work to be done on a day to day basis.  This company does not tolerate any foolishness.
good,If you go in and do your job you should be ok. You do not get rewarded for how hard you work as or for going the extra mile. It's simple you do what is asked of you and go home.
good,"Es un puesto de responsabilidad pero muy llevadero,me llevo una experiencia brutal gracias a la direccion de la empresa.Respecto a mis compañeros no tengo nada que decir fuera de lo habitual,es un ambiente mas o menos bueno.Los objetivos podrian ser unos de los mas dificiles de la empresa.El horario y salario es la ventaja en cuanto a otras empresas.La estabilidad es la unica llama que sigue encendida debido a la crisis en la compañia."
good,Good work/life balance allowing employees flexibility to work from home.
good,My day usually started like this when I get in I go in my office check my voice mail for any issues from customers and vendors From there I would check to see what orders needed to be pulled so when my people got in I could let them know how to proceed and in what order. I had over 20 trucks that had to be loaded with sodas and snacks. the hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers and having to write people up for continually making mistakes. the enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with they made the time at work pleasant.
good,fun place and good company but the management team has alot of work to be done
good,You have no life balance especially if commuting. You need to be a self-driven person to be successful.
good,"Its all about the people that work behind you, if the person on your route has a strong work ethic, smoother the workday is aside from late truck deliveries. Management could use a serious improvement, with the lack of communication in a field where communication is a serious cornerstone."
good,"Preparing Orders for various stores in the hamilton and surrounding area."
good,"um lugar bom de trabalha, bons colegas de trabalho boa equipe de gerencia  tem oportunidade de crescimento profissional."
good,"long days, good management, great coworkers, low pay for as hard as you work, great not working in an office and staring at the same four walls"
good,"Hardest part of the job is most likely the consistent 8-12 hours of  lifting and pulling product. Other than the borderline over exertion I seriously love my job. People are great, with exception to grouchy managers every now and then, and overall great work environment."
good,"A Pepsico foi uma empresa na qual aprendi muito, foi o inicio de uma vida profissional envolvendo área operacional e administrativa, tive incentivo para minha formação acadêmica a qual despertou em mim a esperança, um sonho, de me tornar um grande gestor na área de Distribuição & Logística, mas que inexplicavelmente não ocorreu. A Pepsico foi uma empresa que me decepcionou muito em termos de oportunidades de crescimento profissional, promoções. Pois sempre que surgiam oportunidades, novas vagas as pessoas que eram direcionadas para ocupar estas novas vagas vinham de outras bases ""Principalmente SP"" ou de fora da empresa. Oportunidades estas que tive em empresas posteriores e que assumi e dei prova de que sou um profissional competente."
good,"La entrada es a las 6:30 am, al llegar se realiza una junta en la clinica de tu grupo donde ves las prioridades del Dia asi como las ejecuciones."
good,Would recommend a friend or others to apply. Great location and environment.
good,"there pay is really good, but you will work very hard for it. over all it's a good place to work."
good,Mejora cartera de clientes y venta ambiente laboral bueno si dan herramientas de trabajo pero es poner mas conciencia de que hay temporadas para venta de todo tipo d producto
good,"typical day would be getting to your first stop early ,getting in and out of mom and pop stores finishing your corporates first because they keep you busy. "
good,"This is a very fast paced work place also always meeting new people. Anytime you needed help you have a work phone that everyone's number is in and can make a quick phone call. Easiest part of the job is traveling, hardest part of the job is that you have to be fast and efficient."
good,"dia a dia é saida em rota com equipe, negociações, calendários promocionais, "
good,great work and pay just job security was bad worked for a few months then laid off
good,Productive. Freedom and travel. Paid for gas. Must use own vehicle.
good,"Great company, hard to move cross-functional"
good,"Bueno el ambiente es muy bueno solo que no dan muchos beneficios deberian dar bonos de asistencia, produccion etc"
good,"It was a great experience regardless of my misfortune of having a poor manager (tsm). It can be political but if you work sales. what can you expect. I would definitely do it all over again and strongly recommend it for young energetic newbies to the American work force. Just be presentable, responsible, respectful, likeable, but,"
good,"amazing atmosphere, I learned so much at PepsiCo and the co-workers and staff peoples are too good and very cooperative ."
good,"Alot of constant lifting, bending and pulling all night till the work is finished."
good,Excelentes beneficios salariales pero le falta mas calidad de vida para el área de ventas.
good,"muy buen ambiente de trabajo en la sucursal donde estaba trabajando aprendi muchas cosas ya que estube en todos los puestos administrativosy apoyando en otras sucursales en los puestos administrativos."
good,"I could say that being part of this company was that i rose from the ranks, I started out as Cadet engineer and later became a Supervisor and then Department Head level/position. I value all the things that I have learned from my trainors, mentors, superiors for this I know would make me a better professional in my chosen field.  "
good,"This job never stops. my co-workers are all good, and for the most part, we work good together."
good,"Frito-Lay, part of PepsiCo, is a very fast-paced, highly competitve workplace. My immediate work group is very supportive and team oriented. There is never a dull day within my role as there are many roles within it including, staffing, sales, management, leadership, administrative work, tracking, human resources, marketing and other duties. I enjoy the freedom as well as flexibility to the job but yet it is a job where you are always 'on-call' and sometimes the balance and demands of the company are quite aggressive."
good,Job was fine.  Good pay and plenty of hours.  Work life balance was bad though
good,Hardest job is to handling people of operation but its a nice challenge on myself.
good,"Good working atmosphere and people friendly. I learned a lot of technical and management skills, people management and planning. My co workers are very supportive to achieve our goal."
good,A challenging job that you learn a lot quickly in.  Great place to aid in career growth.
good,"This is a great job for a young man without lots of outside responsibilities beyond bills. If you have kids you'll need someone to watch them when you are at work all day 5 days a week. Single parents will struggle as your day starts 5-6am and can end well after the sun sets.  "
good,"They tell me what they want and let me get it done,"
good,"ethics and values are top priority ,got to learn innovative ideas with diverse people of different nationalities hardest part of job was to reach target with unnecessary pressure around us ."
good,"A good company for if your expertise is needed. The company is always finding ways to maximize productivity and cut cost so if you have great ideas. Good luck to anyone who is interested, it is a good company work for."
good,"The Pepsi company is a good  company to work for. Great benefits. And you know that soda isn't going anywhere so there is expected continued growth. But the Austin, TX branch is a terrible work environment. Upper-level management is poor, on the occasion it is even there at all. Which is a shame because Austin is such a unique and growing city with so much opportunity."
good,great job security great benefits room for advancement. hard job lots of work
good,I learned that diversity is an emerging HR function that needs to be considered as a discipline at all institutions of higher education as earning knowledge in diversity will prepare students to work in our global society.
good,The day was always different and I was able to learn something new everyday about some process of operations.  Local management was patient and great teachers.

good,"Esta em um forte crescimento, entrei como ajudante e passei a operador , ocorreu varias mudanças na gerencia da empresa, trabalho em equipe."
good,It begins by recieving work orders that needs to be delivered the next morning. 20 to 30 work orders in a packet. Build the beverage work order onto a pallet in a neat fashion. Making sure all items are available. Continue in order until the last order is filled. I learned how to keep a steady pace at a long period of time. My co-workes who were their longer were very helpful to my transition. The hardest part of my job was picking back up the pace after lunch. The most enjoyable part of my job was employees
good,It is a good place to work. The hardest part of the job was standing up and watching the caps on te bottle and the fill height. I learned to do paper work and manage a bit.
good,"A typical day of work involves clocking in at 2:30 am. I then pre-trip my truck to make sure it is safe for the road. My first delivery is at 3:20 am. I unload the pallets that are scheduled for that store and place them in the designated location inside the store. I get checked in by an inventory control clerk and insure the order is accurate and pricing is correct. I load the back haul from previous deliveries, for example empty pallets and empty crates. I then travel to my next stop and repeat this process. I usually have 8 stops per day."
good,I am stuck in a union job with no place for advancement. I am continuing with my education and looking to take my talents to a new career.
good,"i learned how to spot trailers, use the computer for dock management and inventory, pick orders using a head set, drive forklifts, use pallet jacks and so forth,"

good,"It's a good place to work. Some things could be better. No bonus, not much room for advancement."
good,"I've only been working for the company about 2 months, but everyone says there's room for growth. Seems like a good company to work for as long as they keep you at the bottom."
good,"A empresa é excelente,mas peca em alguns fatores tercerizados"
good,Get a good raise after 90 days. And a bonus ever Year .get sick days  vacation two weeks a year. Get to take home pepsi products  .good hours time and a half. Friendly and nice people to work with safe place to work
good,"Job security. Good pay. Indoors, hot in summer, ok in winter. Grumpy old men. Young managers. No room for advancement. No time to slow down. Can not drink anything other than pepsi products on lunch,in your car, anywhere on premises."
good,This is not a great place if you have kids or want a life outside of work. The management are rude and unprofessional. And they will only need you for there vacation time. After that they will get rid of you!

good,"Facilidad de trabajar desde casa, horarios acorde al horario entrada."
good,"flexible work arrangements, good pay, company is so large its hard to make an impact as things progress slowly.  large disconnect between executive leadership and lower levels."
good,PepsiCo is a good company to grow with. no one looks down on you if you are willing to learn and work hard. PepsiCo will provide the tools and training for you to grow with in the company. Always opportunities to move up. PepsiCo provides good Benefits. PepsiCo is very family oriented and treat everyone equal. PepsiCo is family to there employee’s and the community.
good,"typical night was boring but hectic, management was on point, culture was alright, hardest part of the job was keeping up with loading. i enjoyed the job because it challenged me to do better"
good,"Good company to work for - different  opportunities/roles available due to size and geography of organization. "

good,Opportunity is there if you actually apply yourself and weather the storm  would recommend for younger adults who are responsible and accountable and j

good,"Me gustó , aprendí y conocí muchas rutas a personas que de verdad te enseñan"
good,"Fast paced, innovative company, with great brands and products. There is a significant opportunity for advancement. The most enjoyable part of Pepsico is being able to work in a variety of go to market systems."
good,PepsiCo was a great opportunity to further understand sales in the industry. I had a very divers territory which i feel helped a a great deal in my sales career.

Establish positive customer relations"
good,"Worked several positions,  under different managers,  and each of them put the employee first.  Unlike other locations,  communication was spot in,  solid,  and consistent"
good,"Long hours, good pay, could use better management . Summers are really hot and winters are really cold. Fast paced. Takes a lot of thinking and skills."
good,awesome job bad management paid every week wasn't cool for me  it's only two people unloading trucks if one doesn't show up your stuck unloading a truck pretty much by yourself and that takes 4 to 5 hours. if you have 2 or 3 trucks and need all 3 that day you will be there all day.
good,Pepsi has good benefits and decent pay for the area. Paid for mileage between stores worked. Probably a better job for single people or at least someone without family since there is no set time you’ll get done in a day. Miscommunication/over ordering between sales representatives/management is a definite problem when it comes to the job.
good,As a job it would have to be at the top of the list. It's a very physically demanding job and granted it was only four days a week those days were the weekend. Expect to work long hours and to be yelled at alot by your customers. It pays well but there is always room to make more.
good,"What I loved most about the role was the palpable excitement for the work and subject matter. Everyone in the office was a complete science dork, which I mean as the highest of compliments. We consistently had passionate  discussions about the science behind our research."
good,"Management need to be more involved wit the job role they manage. there needs to be more progression for MTs, its difficult to progress leading to people moving on"
good,There is some flexibility in scheduling and a variety of options on hours available. Minimal supervision and clearly identified tasks. Great for students or an individual with a set work schedule looking for supplemental income
good,great job but management is very shady and don't respect their employees. Will throw you under the bus any chance they can. good job if you don't mind working hard and hate time off. you work all holidays and weekends.
good,"I was a dedicated employee who would put my all into everything I did. Pepsi decided to make a management change in my location and they completely ruined every sales representatives life. We had to go to every single store, every single day. This was NOT the problem. In fact, it was an amazing idea. Pepsi is in the service industry and it was our job to serve EVERYONE. The issue was that they made sure we hit quotas  but they decided my location would be a trial location to make the sales reps stock their stores as well. Have you ever been told to sell 1,000 cases into every store and the next day go in, sell more and also stock the entire store? It’s not practical and a multi billion dollar company can afford merchandisers. Horrible idea."
good,I enjoyed the work I applied for consistently. I had fun within the company the time I worked there was informational and an eye opener coming from the military as a previous employer.
good,"Really good company to work for. Wasn’t satisfied with working long hours and not being able to advance. I left to pursue other opportunities, but wouldn’t mind working for Pepsi in a corporate setting."
good,"Great corporate culture, ability to flex hours, a lot of autonomous work and projects to further your skills, a lot of training programs provided. Overall"
good,Uma boa empresa para se trabalhar e fazer plano de carreira.
good,"No meus 7 anos na PepsiCo tive algumas oportunidade de plano de carreira. Os benefícios são muito bom (3 dias de folga para tirar no decorrer do ano de Bem estar e 1 dia de aniversário), convenio odontológico e médico. Plano de reconhecimento. Instabilidade e burocracia em processos simples."
good,"I worked under the supervision of a young jealous female. I wasn't liked by this individual from day 1, she asked other employees to lie about my production performance"" I was given this information by the person that was asked to do the dirt. Management stuck together, right or wrong. I didnt have a chance. I will say I loved my job and even would do it again had I the opportunity."
good,This job is a fast paced and hard labor position. You will work long hours 12 hours to be exact. The summer months get really crazy but the manager will bring in temps to help with the work load.
good,good benefit sgreatv retirement package  alot of work but made it through 30 yrs equiptment was good for assisting me to get my job done enjoyed working and driving
good,"I enjoy working here, but maintenance guys have lots of obligations.  Management should improve and the workforce would benefit. Great pay, but can be stressful at times due to high pace and many hats you have to wear."
good,PepsiCo's  to me is a special  company  I feel  and  think that thier  was a lot of good times ' I had fair mangers  great  compensation ' I work thier for years  ' Pepsi  Tacoma  'Washington  was like my second  family ''
good,Is a stressful job is fiscal and I really didn't like the schedule I like to have days consecative days and the mostly likely your schedule won't be like that. Management is ok depending who u get alone with the only thing I didn't like is to much gossip people know your business even personal things that you have going on at home that only management should know but other employees would know as well.
good,Great atmosphere and flexibility along with all kinds of amenities on the campus. Benefits are above and beyond with multiple options for everyone. Compensation was solid.
good,"I did not like this job at all, They do not care about there employees at all. I was very disappointed. I will not recommend to anyone I know. That’s on god."
good,"Pepsico has many different avenues to explore for employment, from beverages to snacks.  They have a very professional workplace culture and achieve a good work/life balance."
good,"My typical day starts out with the planning  and carrying  out the daily schedules to minimize fluctuations in workload, i also have the pleasure of be responsible for ensuring that high merchandising standards are delivered consistently across all PBC business segments."

good,"Job consist of long hours but the time does fly past."
good,Great job but just could pay little more I still remember how to do the after these years . I love it I even have thought about going back but don't think they hiring.
good,My time at Pepsi was very good. On a day to day basis it was always something else to look forward to doing dealing with the customers and some of there problems made the job even more fun just  being able to help them out.
good,"There was a lack of equipment, people use to steal equipment off of others trucks. The pay was great, I could actually live off of it. Great insurance. One month paid paternity leave.  But it is hard work and you have to work fast"
good,Empresa com bastante inovação e novos desafios diários. Tem uma boa valorização do lado pessoal.
good,Un lugar donde tienes posibilidades a otra oportunidad para ascender.
good,"Tirando o meu gerente da área de transportes, o restante do dia a dia na empresa era de forma excelente e saudável. Diariamente desafios."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my job at PepsiCo and I was good at it.  Unfortunately, after 13 years I was caught up in the twice-yearly layoffs.  With Indra Nooyi gone and Ramon Laguarta in, maybe this will change.  PepsiCo lost a staggering number of GREAT employees over the 13 years of layoffs under Indra Nooyi."
good,"The job is fast and some of the hardest and rewarding jobs I have had. I worked with stores, fixed sighs and built displays, stock daily. Put lots of mile on my truck"
good,"It was great getting to know so many people, the only thing was that the hours were long. The benefits are amazing, I got paid to use my own car for driving out of town for work."
good,"This job required attention to detail and the ability to be self motivated and work on your own. As a Route Salesman I loaded my truck, ordered my goods, serviced and stocked all my machines."
good,"Na área industrial é uma empresa que tem uma estrutura forte em alguns de seus segmentos, como snacks, porém falta estruturar melhor segmentos mais novos, como nutrition and cookies. Um dos fatores que ocasionaram o fechamentos das fábricas de Mto grosso e Porto Alegre."
good,A typical day at the pepsi warehouse would start with me getting a list of all types of different pops and drinks that i need to put on a cart. Its starts out with about 25 papers at the beginning of the day then whenever we are done we had to load them up on the truck. I learned how to load a truck and all the safety hazards of the truck. The management was okay but also a lack of because we only had 1 supervisor. The culture was cool everybody was treated equally in all ways. The hardest part of the job was determining how i was going to stack things up to make it all fit. The easiest part of the day was when we had to load the trucks up.
good,Fun fast paced work environment. Mostly good people to work around. Sometimes poor management decisions but overall okay. Workplace safety is a big deal.
good,"Managers were easy going and the workplace culture was pretty relaxed. My coworkers were willing to teach me and guide me, and wanted me to get the best out of my time with PepsiCo"
good,"Infelizmente não continuamos com a fábrica aqui no RJ, porém a equipe toda era muito envolvida nos processos. A Pepsico tem suas questões e costumes. Uma empresa boa."
good,"It was a great place to work, some good mangers that would help and work with u. They had there fav or best friend with the best or easy route. Nice culture around the group of drivers real friendly. Most mangers we’re understandable"
good,"Since it is a huge company, the benefits that are offered are great. The pay is not bad either. But, they see you a a thing rather than a person, A thing that they own. They don't care about anyone individually"
good,"Great company volunteer opportunities."
good,"Working for such competitive brands has to be a dream for every Marketing student. My dream came true and it was worth it. A lot of sacrifices were made and a lot of pressure was on. But when it comes to learning from the best, PepsiCo, definitely know what's up."
good,"Not a bad work life balance, frequent movement within groups and teams which is good and bad.  Worst aspect is the job culture, and the requirement that you be a type A personality to continue to accelerate within the organization."
good,Pepsi is a great place to work. Having an athletic back ground I liked the pace of things. Compensate for the hard work and benefits was lovely. I would recommend working here to anybody just be prepared to work hard.
good,"Depending on your route the workload can go from relatively un-taxing to genuinely impossible. If you are looking for a job that pays great with no required education, this is probably the only job I would reccomend."
good,"This job requires a lot of you, but if you're in the right city, you can do well financially. Make sure you take care of your back, though. Management leaves something to be desired"
good,"Pepsi has a beautiful corporate campus, full amenities, and a professional workforce. Gym, Outdoor Trails, Mini Mart, Cafeteria, Events & great people. I enjoyed each day and all of the associates."
good,Empresa visando o desenvolvimento de um trabalho objetivo e gerador de resultados de forma a possibilitar crescimento para os envolvidos.
good,Buena en terminos generales con algunos objetivos complicados de cumplir para el trabajador.
good,"Best corporation I ever worked had the pleasure of working for. Structured work environment with little autonomy. However, the team is strong in talent and execution at every level. Excellent benefits. The sense of team and closeness between the members was extremely beneficial to the success of the organization. The company takes pride in developing additional skills and education in its staff."
good,"Training and organizational structure is very good in the introduction of new hire .  ability to work in a diverse work culture. "
good,This a good job to work at I love working for a good Warehouse job like this I love working the Forklift I love working wit my hands I Wish I can go back to this job or work for a Company like this
good,"Work days are unpredictable based on monthly objectives.  Many Saturdays were mandatory work in order to meet objectives.  The work and family life balance is not even."
good,Workforce and management are great people to work for!!!   If you do your job you’ll never have issues.  If you choose to be difficult then you will get difficult back
good,Transport product to designated areas unload/load trailers. Learn how  to use voice pick system. Have a good communication with supervisors. Sequenced loads to avoid overweight charges at scales.
good,"PepsiCo is all about Performance with Purpose. One of the highest companies to embrace Diversity and Inclusion."
good,"Very challenging. If you're not up for a challenge, this is NOT the place for you. Days can be long at times, especially during Summer. "
good,"Very on demand business, work life seems to be up and down depending on the year and performance.  Pay is competitive for the area and benefits are a little pricey but tend to be good."
good,"Not a bad job if your a college or coming out of high school , can be long hours , you work at your own pace for the most part . If you don’t mind working weekend and don’t have a family this is the perfect job"
good,"Better of the beverage company's! I have had managers that were some of my favorite of any job. I have also had some that were the worst. The job will depends on the people your working with. The job is never left at the stores, always be ready to talk work all times of the day"
good,I started their at a young age and work to provide service to all the delivery drivers.  Enter all the tickets and answer the phone.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.
good,Deja a desear mayor ingresos por labores en lo general muy buen trabajo
good,"This job was back breaking, I didn't feel like I was getting paid for the amount of work that I was doing. Not only that, the stress. I was tired of the work, I quit."
good,"My experience with this company was that of one of their smallest branches, and as such was slightly different than the company as a whole. Pay was lower than similar positions in the industry but benefits were very good, and the company was very efficient in the way they did business from day to day."
good,"PepsiCo has treated me well and helped me provide and take care off my family.  The compensation is great and the benefits are top-notch. However, if you are not in sales career advancement is slow and stagnant. Movement more than not seems to be based on who you know not who you are. This is extremely frustrating and is steering me to look elsewhere in the near future."
good,"Depending on the office location and department, PepsiCo embraces work /life balance and respects their employees needs/requirements. It is a healthy positive work place."
good,PepsiCo hires really great people but so much corporate governance is not being well received. Divisions are being required to streamline everything. One size fits all rules are the norm.
good,"heavy lifting and management is terrible, but good pay/holiday and decent benefits. has become very micro managed. fewer and fewer perks, even though company is bigger and bigger"
good,"Managing warehouse employees is never easy, especially when the warehouse and equipment is old and preparing to be torn down. "
good,"El tacto con sus trabajadores es bueno, hay un buen ambiente laboral"
good,"Recently, PepsiCo under went a restructure.  After 24 years, with the company, my number was called.  I LOVED pretty much every minute of my time with the organization.  "
good,"A BCR is certainly a great job for someone who came up through the company in a front-line position to strive for and it comes with a competitive wage, but it doesn't come without some things that need to be improved on.  "
good,"Long hours with below average pay and raises are not that great. Great benefits, great people, great training. It really is a good place to work. The only bad thing I can say is the pay is not great. And you will work a lot of hours. If you are hourly it is good, but not for management."
good,"Great place to work.  I have worked here many years, and the benefits are outstanding.  The company culture is changing with new leadership, and it is hard to achieve the growth goals."
good,"PepsiCo is good for anyone starting their career, you get to learn alot from the systems in place and the ongoing training programs. Career progression is a little slow, but it's worth it with the benefits you get in return."
good,"PepsiCo was a great company for me to begin my career. Employees there were willing to help out when needed, the company provides many tools to further advance your education, and has great benefits. "
good,"Empresa onde se aprende bastante, muitas e operações e processos são constantemente modificados com a finalidade de se ajustar ao cenário atual. "
good,I did pretty much the same thing for Pepsi as I did for Coors Field.  when baseball season over I went over to Pepsi for hockey and basketball.  Work in the pantry section did salads and stuff and work with the same staff.
good,"Always busy, fast pace with a lot of inbound and outbound product. Fairly easy and straightforward job. Will be bounced around from forklift to pickline."
good,"IT really depends on the area and manager you work for, but overall PepsiCo is a very good place to work.  Work/life balance has been supported by all my immediate managers except for 1.  Pay is very competitive and there are a lot of great people working there.  Over the last few years there have been big changes that have made it a very different place to work, but still overall a good place to work."
good,It's a fun place to work with good pay and benefits. With me having kids I just find it very difficult to have the proper work and life balance that I need with the shift starting later in the day and working up to 12hrs some days.
good,its a ok place to work. if your not familiar with a fast pace working environment or able to deal with multiple things at once than this isnt the job for you
good,"Despite it being a hard working, laborious job. Still had good hours and reasonable hours to go along with it. Not recommended for those who have back problems or anything similar to that."
good,"Horarios agradables, aprendi nuevos tipos de reclutamiento, a veces hay gente difícil de tratar , la parte mas dificil; reclutamiento de campo, lo que me gusto:la mejora en el clima laboral"
good,"You will work hard and play hard.  They people are very driven and things move fast,  They have great brands and marketing.  Ongoing training, great benefits, competitive compensation ..."
good,good place to work.sometimes you are asked to work odd hours at husker games football or basketball games.there are times you will work over night installing
good,"Great work environment.  Friendly people, helpful.  Would highly recommend to any young person wanting sales experience.  Great job if you like the interpersonal interaction with people, the customers, on a daily basis."
good,aprendí el trato con clientes y relacionarme con ellas
good,"Decent company to work for, but it really is for a younger person willing to lift cases of soda a build displays. Long days and weekend work was a downfall."
good,"Persona responsable, trabajadora, honesto que cumple con la encomienda que se me da."
good,I like the fact that I can set my own salary goals. It becomes a challenge. It is a very competitive work place. So the hours that I have to put in to meet my goal can be time consuming.
good,"Working for PepsiCo was a great experience.  It is a very fast-paced environment, but when teamwork kicked in the challenges became enjoyable.  I didn't know what to expect on a daily basis, but what I did know is that there were people around me who wanted me to succeed. "
good,"The people at PepsiCo are smart, driven and collaborative.  The culture encouraged teamwork and collaboration, and the teams try to move as quickly as possible to launch new innovation and ultimately ensure that PepsiCo products are delivering positive value to consumers' lives."
good,A good place to work and one of the few career companies left but a demanding work environment with roles that can be narrow.  The Company works around this by doing a good job for the most part at rotating people between different roles.
good,"I was a salesman in my early twenties and still lived at home. In three years I saved enough to pay my way through college, mostly. And I had some sweet cars along the way. You will work your butt off. It's a younger mans job, IMO. Get the CDL and the rout job. Stay away from the warehouse jobs."
good,"I learned great management experience"
good,"Depending on your team, the work is interesting and varied.  Must be ready to multi-task .  Certain groups have long hours.  Different stress levels per group.  "
good,I work on both sides Pepsi and Frito. It’s a good place to work of course every job has its ups and downs. But as long as you do your best at being your best everything else is easy
good,Carecen de capacitación y desarrollo al personal y gracias a ello desarrolle la habilidad de ser autodidacta para afrontar las oportunidades que surgen en el día a día.
good,very good place to get access to International standards. Learning experience was much appreciating but the work culture was little unpleasant. However as an intern had a great time during my tenure.
good,"I enjoyed my years with Pepsi, made great friends while working all those crazy hours. I had the opportunity to make a good salary from a good route on commission."
good,"Empresa certa nos pagamentos de salários dos funcionários, vale todo dia 15/mês/40% e pagamento total todo dia 30/mês, vale alimentação todo dia 15/mês, plano de saúde Unimed"
good,"A typical day at PepsiCo, involves planning.  All employees work together to create a oneness, so that we reach our daily goals. Everyone is cross-trained so we can support one another.  The most challenging part of the job is multi-tasking.  It exciting to be apart of an environment that allows you to do many things within a 8 hour time span.  Management is always available to support you in every dept."
good,"great team player, and positive attitude. able to handle multiple projects, help with out having to be asked by my supervisor. I also enjoy utilize my time according"
good,"The work environment is very exciting, however, being contracted the work place is slightly different to the ones that work directly for the company. Overall good place to work."
good,Una experiencia relasionado campo de venta donde entregaba pedido en tiendas en diferente lugares ciudad
good,I really enjoyed my time at Pepsico. The typical work day would be you starting at your first store on your work list. You would have to merchandise all stores on your list. The thing that sucked was waiting for trucks to deliver the products. This will throw your whole day off if the driver was behind on deliveries.
good,"After joining the Organization i was great environment . The Location of the factory was very good ."
good,Fast paced makes the days go quick. Pretty much on your own throughout entire day. Pay was decent and management was helpful when needed. Overall a good place to work!
good,PepsiCo is a diverse company with a good work life balance and flexibility to help meet family needs.   The people are fun to work with and I've learned a lot over my tenure
good,The job was available to advance and they had many incentives to work there.  Rarely micromanaging.  Many meetings and you can work at your own pace as long as customer is satisfied.
good,The Merchandiser position is a very physically demanding position. The management in the company were great to work for and were understanding of any situations that arose.
good,"Doesn’t advance position fast enough unless your willing to relocate, management is knowledgeable of the business but could me more understanding of obstacles"
good,"I really enjoyed working for Pepsi. My day would start anywhere between 4am and 6am. Check in with my boss to see where I was going for the day.Sometimes I would go on a delivery truck to help out the driver other times I would be driving a Pepsi van. The advantage of being in a van was that I was able to help multiple drivers throughout the work day which would usually be about 10 hours give or take. While working for Pepsi I learned how to use a forklift how to load and unload trucks properly,how to dex deliveries,reset stores and use a handheld."
good,Here you will learn how to expect the unexpected. You may have no problems through out the day and the next day you may seem to feel as if you are never going to leave your desk.
good,"Working with Saudi Industrial Beverage Company - Pepsi Cola (SIBCO 1) is good and fun where we consider each other as family. "
good,"On a daily basis I met with 15-20 clients a day setting contracts, placing orders, merchandising, and managing drivers. All enjoyable. As I visit each client, I would arrange, merchandise the store, and then speak with the client. After discussing what product we should bring in the next delivery, I would then pursue in sharing of other opportunities with sales, new beverages, or any upcoming deals coming in the near future."
good,"Good team to work for with good leadership.  There no avenues for advancement and pay increases, based on merit, are very small even for the highest performers.  Not a job you could work long term if you are looking for advancement."
good,"Great job, very stressful at times! Attendance is a priority or you could caught off guard if you don't have a grip on it.At the time I was working, it was sort of cut-throat, if you were low man on seniority list and had to wait for a fork-lift in order to start your work. Didn't like the fact if you had low seniority and someone didn't show up for your shift, if no one else wanted the overtime, you had to stay for the shift or until someone came in."
good,Good company but navigating career paths can be challenging without an influential manager. Great time off benefits with 4 weeks of vacation after 5 years.
good,"Time integrado, motivado e dinâmico. Aprendi muito como estagiária."
good,"Most of the management are pretty good. The work is really easy. The pay for new hires is pretty low but the insurance is nice. My tip, don't join the union. They do nothing for you but take your money. Unless of course your a screw up and need someone to force pepsi to keep you on. But this union does more harm than good and joining is a choice. Most people that want a permanent job at the end of the season can find one."
good,It was a nice place to work with a friendly environment. I learned how to pre-oreder and build displays. The job could be physically demanding but they were updating to make the task easier for employees.
good,"a typical work day is about 10 long hard hours, i work my stores back stock to the shelf and displays and also work deliveries. the pay is good and i love my schedule."
good,Awesome coworkers and amazing management. Very understanding when it comes to sick kids and family issues. Fast paced so you never got bored with work.
good,Es una empresa muy grande y aveces hay fallas en comunicación por la cantidad de personas que en ella laboran
good,PepsiCo. was a very versatile job where I was able to meet new people an explore various parts of the city. It was a great opportunity to learn and work on customer service skills.
good,Good Company to work for.  Some of their policies are a little harsh. And some of the upper management is not the best. Great benefits are offered.  Everything HR does is online.  Kinda hard to deal with.
good,"Great job and good work environment. Had to work a lot of hours and was kind of stressful but endured if day. Would have loved to work for different boss, but didn't have that option at the time."
good,"It is hard work but , once you get the hang of things it is not so bad .It was hard for me to get use to people not caring about holding the door .Once you get to the door to go inside the store so would hold it for you and others would not and just let it close.That made it even harder to get in the store sometimes."
good,"Aprendi muito, problemas como faltas de presença de funcionários e administração das lojas. Uma cultura bem básica que se sustenta nos suas convicções. Difícil lidar com a falta de investimento na época que pertencia ao grupo Marfrig. Agradavél era o relacionamento interno."
good,10 months of employment. It is busy and fast paced and also stressful at times. It was also stressful to not know when I would be home on a day to say basis.
good,"Uma empresa seria que preza pela segurança e saúde física psicológica dos seus funcionário. aprendi muito  a liderar com treinamentos e cursos, pelo sistema TAG ( time alto gerenciável ) que foi não só uma experiencia profissional , também pessoal!!"
good,"first time to start life in corporate world ."
good,"Trabajo dinámico y cambiante. "
good,"It was a great place to be associated with and work for, many great people and opportunities for those that are self motivated. Very physically demanding as well as mentally demanding."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es bueno, la convivencia con los supervisores es tranquila mientras no se le ""atore"" algo, el encargado de almacen o SAC (como le llaman) tiene un mal trato con sus empleados y con el puesto INASE, el trabajo es pesado en cuestion al horario, el sueldo es muy bueno asi como las prestaciones, una gran oportunidad de progresar."
good,muitas mudanças na vice presidencia e diretoria EX:mudança na vice presidencia em um ano duas em dois anos na diretoria.

good,It is a very nice place to work for.  They are very understanding when it comes to needing time off or emergencies as well. The management is kind of easy than I would think one should be.
good,"Good HR Policies , Management . Career advancement is strong in sales dept. Management is not focusing on other support functions. Good work culture and currently it is going down"
good,"The day of the work start with team discuss and target review , plan of outlates, market review and group meeting . I Learned from this job is how to manage the situation calmly without getting panic ."
good,"Embora a empresa seja agradável de se trabalhar, acorrem alguns falhas administrativas!"
good,"Fast-paced environment where competition is fierce and room for error is small. A very political environment. That being said, due to the fast pace things are always changing and your skills are put to the test. You learn a lot very quickly."
good,I enjoyed a lot my work at PepsiCo. It was mainly an internship but was not less than a job. Working as an quality assurance officer for pepsiCo will always be a proud. We mainly inspect their raw material and give suggestions accordingly.
good,Sink or swim environment with a great workforce.  Provide clear direction and expectations.  The work balance can be challenging at times but it is recognized by your peers.
good,Really enjoyed working with my customers located throughout the USA. The systems in place supplied great tools to do the best job for my customers and meet their needs throughout.
good,"- Tem um ótimo plano de carreiras;"
good,"Muito agradável para se trabalhar, com todos os benefícios para os funcionários; Aprendi muito na empresa, a parte mais difícil era os meus colegas de trabalho, pois não sabiam trabalhar em equipe prejudicando muitas vezes  o setor de produção. E lideres de Setor que privilegiava alguns , não sabendo separar o profissional do pessoal."
good,"I work 2nd shift, I start at 4:00 pm but never know when I will be getting done with work until it happens. Most of the time on average....I work 10 hours per day but during the Summer and around all Holidays, I will have a minimum of 15 hours overtime."
good,"Creative and agile culture, engaging for the politically savvy marketing focused professional"
good,"gostei muito, aprende, amadureci, e ajudei a empresa nos pontos de vendas..."
good,"Nice place to work for. Hours are long, and the volume is demanding. Must be able to work with people, and must have patience when dealing with customers. Downside is that the job will take away from your personal life."
good,"I started in Route sales, then Route Supervisor, the Senior Route Supervisor, Then Market Equipment Manager  then  on premise Supervisor. Face paced. Met a great deal of the reatail businesses. Made a lot of contacts. Like the jobs"
good,Would like full time hours but everyone is friendly and seems to have great benefits if full time.  they do reimburse your mileage as a merchandiser and seems to be well organized
good,Company is still stuck in the 90's culture and the environment. Hardest part of the job is culture senior leaders come into the office from headquarters you rarely see and they don't even speak to you although you support their organization.
good,Pepsico is definitely a good company to work for. Employers treat their employees well. With hard work and enthusiasm truly the employees work will definitely be rewarded.
good,"The work is very physical so you have to be prepared to always be lifting."
good,PepsiCo is a great place to learn!  Rotations of about 2 years are encouraged which allows for new learning experiences and a wealth of development in a wide array of job categories.
good,"PepsiCo has a determination to stay as one of the leading companies in the industry; and that comes with a cost.  Overall work load is 10-12 hours a day.  There is a lot of unrealistic goals and a lot of pressure from management to ""accomplish"" them.  Fantastic company for a specific kind of people"
good,I enjoyed working for this company.How ever I was hired by cognizant a third party company for pepsi co and they did not kept their promises about compensations .
good,Pepsi is a great company to work for. Hard-work and joining extra curricular activities is a great way to get noticed if you want to advance to higher positions.
good,"I have worked here since January 2012 and moved quickly to Assistant to President.  I think workplace culture is fairly typical - some pretty managers are encouraging, some not so much.  I have enjoyed my jobs most of the time."
good,Empresa seria bem melhor se paga-se horas extras para motoristas e ajudantes.
good,The job was a great job for awhile but the pay was less than ideal and the workload kept on increasing with new product lines. Hours can be brutal and the wear and tear on your car can be costly.
good,Empresa sólida no mercado e proporciona benefícios.
good,"no time for family time a lot of overtime not much time for personal "

good,"The position was good, it was fast-paced and busy almost the entire shift. The management was very helpful, and made for a good environment to work in. The schedule was the hardest part (with kids) for myself working from 5am-1pm sometimes earlier. The staff did allow me to take off when needed to pick up or drop off my kids."
good,learned how to operate packaging machine. also worked in warehouse and QA lab. management was ok. machines were not well maintained which caused problems. overall not a bad job
good,"Over all experience was good and challenging at each and every level in terms of targets, operations, cost management, market execution, etc. But it was a great opportunity to improve my skills and attitude towards strategic thinking, market execution, operational management, taking initiative towards brand/ market development with confidence, courage and right focus. During this time, I had an opportunity to attend lot of training and grooming sessions which has helped me to produce results in the same company and later with other companies with which I have worked."
good,Uma empresa dinâmica com plano de carreira Bom esta passando por um período difícil
good,Supervised 9 employees.  Assisted in hired and firing process.  Was able to assist drivers on dad to day operations of off truck sales.  Very much enjoyed working outside with customer involvement.
good,"lo que mas me gusto de este trabajo fue que aprendí muchas cosas sobre diferentes áreas ya que sin duda alguna si alguna persona faltaba se tenia que cubrir esa parte y a todos nos tocaba por lo menos una vez hacerlo, ya que como lo decían los jefes nadie es indispensable en la empresa, y se tenia que cumplir con el trabajo encomendado."
good,"work journey was great. I learn how we can perform a different task at  the same time , how we can work fast and accurate ,how we behave with other and so on"

good,They are consolidating their facilities across the country. I wore a lot of hats at Pepsico. Everyone is asked to do this.  Overall good place to work.
good,"Some great people, some old thinking in leadership positions. Not malicious, just need to be more comfortable with change and leading true change.  This makes the current organization a little ""Slow"" in responding to the employees professional skills development and ability to grow."
good,Job requirements are often physical and long.  Must create lasting relationships with management and store accounts. Many opportunities within the company.
good,"Professional and Personal development through company training, coaching and on-hand experience. Fast Paced and very productive."
good,Early morning hours. Usually 5 AM-2 PM depending on if stores have soda on sale. Traveling a bit puts ware and tare on your vehicle rather quickly. No time and a half on holidays for part time employees.

good,"Great work environment. however, you have to be in a role for 18 months and can not move up more than 2 levels. Pay range for lower levels is not that great. However, the work-life balance in this company is great."

good,es muy buena empresa pero el personal de supervisores y gerente no dan buenas soluciones
good,Job security isn't there.  Some days you could be sent home with no pay do to the lack of work and too many part time employees.

There are lots of opportunities for advancement however, more qualified candidates are often passed over for the advancement of less qualified, diverse employees.

Equally they do not hire anyone over 50 and very few people over 40 - especially white men."

Typically end about 1am. Utilized a forklift the entire night, while operating under a voice picking headset. I would drive from ailse to ailse picking the amount of products my headset would give, wrap the pallet when completed, and transport the pallet to a 48' or 53' truck."
good,"I enjoy working for PCNA, as it is a strong company that provides the availability of work life balance"
good,a typical day on the route would start about 7 and end late morning to early afternoon. it was an easy job and had a great schedule there was an agenda each day and the agenda didnt change so it became easy to learn
good,A typical day included but may not be limited to regulating supply of product in store and in vending machines. I organized and structured displays for store advertisements and promotions
good,"This job is great if you are focused and can work alone but in team if it comes up. Organisation is important and self motivation as well. If you are looking for a fast paced job but most of your experience is in retail, stocking shelves then this is a good step up. If you prove yourself they are willing to help you move up in the company to higher positions. The pay is good, just be prepared to work weekends and travel around to the different stores in your own vehicle."
good,Productive & challenging workplace with fantastic resources/people.
good,I learned how to drive a forklift and got certified. They people in my office were great to be around. Free coffee in the morning. Starbucks sometimes. Meetings always had good food. We also had cookouts. Great environment.
good,"At PepsiCo, they truly ""bleed blue"". There is/can be a wonderful family dynamic there but if you're working for a franchise, it can be harder to grow."
good,Minimal opportunity for Driver growth or advancement. Drivers want the opportunity to grow or to advance. Best part of the job are the relationships built with customers and/or coworkers.
good,"The hours are good if you seek full time employment. If you are a student or are looking for part time, not so much. Also the summer tends to be a little overwhelming if you have other jobs or activities planned out."
good,Je recommande cette société à tous les jeunes diplomés ou juniors.
good,I enjoyed working at this place. Had a lot of fun activities and a gym and soccer during lunch. It was a great place to work. I also learned a lot of things over there.
good,"Un gran lugar para trabajar, en medio de un ambiente cambiante, pero sobre todo competitivo y retador."
good,Ambiente agradable para el desarrollo de las tareas diarias. El espacio físico para el desarrollo de las mismas. Trato fluido con los superiores.
good,Es una empresa que tiene muy buenas prestaciones y un muy buen hambiente de trabajo
good,Gran empresa para trabajar que ha ido perdiendo sus raíces a lo largo del tiempo
good,It's a good company to work for. They strive to make their employees the best they can be. Management is always willing to listen and help in any way possible. Always willing to hear new ideas to help better you as an individual as well as bettering the company to strive to be better. It is a family oriented company.
good,"Todo bien en cuanto al trabajo, algunos problemas con candados de promoción"
good,Good job and great company. I enjoyed coming to work. Competative pay and benefits package. Would recommend this job to anyone wanting a rewarding carrer in driving.
good,"Muito bom trabalhar lá, há possibilidade de crescimento só tem que ter paciência."
good,"Great place, feels like home away from home. They provide uniforms boots etc. Caring place. I left because I was there four years and I wasn't learning anything new. Just a bunch of promises"
good,Work is very physical and the employees are extremely selfish. You have to be able to work nights and potentially long hours. Average between 50-60 a week.
good,PBC is a great organization that has the top brands in the food and beverage industry but the people are truly what drives this company to be on of the best organizations in the world.
good,"Buena empresa, ambiente laboral regular, buen trato, prestaciones y de mas"
good,"Great job, you can get a lot of Overtime if you choose to, except salary employees. the 401k plan is really good the have a awesome benefit package that's available to full time workers"
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, tem ótimos benefícios o dia a dia do trabalho muito tranquilo."
good,Nice place to work I have known many people to move up very fast in the company. Full-time employees received benefits. Most of the people there are pretty friendly.
good,I really enjoyed working for the company. My manager and supervisors were great and very helpful. I did everything asked of me to the best of my ability but was never able to achieve theirs and my goal. I really appreciate the opportunity they gave me.
good,giornate normale di lavoro con giorni stressante alla fine del mese.
good,It’s a hard job if you aren’t geo box the pay is ok should get paid way more for what you have to do. Having to unload by hand push into store wait god knows how long to get checked in then Merchandise the product way too much work for the pay but it is what it is if you need a job.
good,Every bottle counts while working in the beverage business.  Be prepared for every day to be different and to meet your competition head on every step of the way.
good,Empresa muito próspera com boas condições de trabalho.
good,Highly automated facility with a very lean and unionized production team. Management was a good old boys club that if you weren't in then you had issues with getting the support that you needed.
good,"I would go back to Pespi if the management was better then what they had. I worked there 4 years and was working double shifts sometime and asked for a raise , they chose not to respect my wishes so I had to move on, which I didn’t want to do. But a Man can only be used for so long before he moves on"
good,"Invaluable experience, excellent trainings, able to see how your work impacts company and team goals. Provide roadmap for success and leadership roles.  Long hours and sometimes last minute travel.  Lots of company perks."
good,"Great people, top notch work environment, good work/life balance. Get the job done attitude, yet flexible on project completion dates. Training available for all sorts of skill upgrades."
good,"You will work hard at times, but get payed reasonably. Enough money to live in a nice home and live comfortably or take care of a family. The down side is dealing with rude customers who are impossible to please yet pepsi agrees with them always and if you get kicked out of a store you can be terminated regardless of the situation."
good,I enjoy working at Pepsi. The staff are nice people and are good to be around with. Good management is lacking but overall its a good work environment.
good,"1- the normal day is very pressured day"
good,Great pay will wear an tear on body no time for family. Long hours unless you have a goal working all the time. Plus if your kids stay in the same household thins will be better
good,"good company with competitive benefits, low job advancement opportunity, frequent change management, great location of headquarters with many on-site perks"
good,"It was a good job at the time. I was going to school and working at the same time so that made it tough working thirds. The environment was nice. It is a union shop. Worst thing about working there was the Friday to Saturday turn over, You were required to come in 6-8 hours after you got off on Friday for work Saturday."
good,"4/10 is awesome."
good,Managing people and a warehouse in Goldsboro.  Provide daily inventory to suppy chain.  The workplace culture is fast paced and performance driven. The hardest part of the job is the budget criterion. The most enjoyable part of the job is dealing with the employees here..
good,"The benefits are good,  5 personal days and weeks vacation and you get your second after a year.  Minimal collaboration between departments, expected do a ton within a 14 hr period, handling various deliveries where they send in too much product at times and you are expected to stock shelves and find space for the rest.  They want you to work a little less than 60 hours a week in the summer and they cut your hours down in the winter time. They give you a manifest with estimated delivery times that are way too short and your constantly running behind your first year while you're learning stops.   Routing is done out of state so daily routes aren't in order so you have to move pallets around in your trailer to get to the right stop.  Trucks are barely maintained and if you have an issue the maintenance crew acts like its a big inconvenience.  It's an okay place to work but they have a lot they could improve on."
good,My experience with pepsi was overall good. The work was hard and the hours were long but at the end of the day it felt rewarding. You are paid for mileage and hourly along with it.
good,High volume production. Problem solving daily. Logistics in corporate shipping and receiving. Product supply and demand. Materials coordinating per production schedule
good,"J'ai bien aimé mon expérience dans cette compagnie, d'au tant plus que j'ai beaucoup appris sur le commerce."
good,"But few of the people hired in my cohort in 2018 made it all the way to being hired. It was a strenuous work environment. I wish I could say I had made it, but I got sick less than a week before Labor Day, accumulated too many points, and had to resign."
good,"Fast paced job, will definitely have you moving. Managers question why you are taking so long all the time even though you are working alone and have like 7 to 9 stores to do within 8 hours."
good,"Good people to work with on the floor. Old school technology for cleaning processes, which turns these activities into a hard and very physical job."
good,"it was a fast pace environment, I drove a power jack and prepared orders for delivery. loaded and unloaded semi trailers, kept the warehouse floor clean, used a pick system"
good,"as long as you do your job in a timely fashion, you shouldn't have any problems. Dispatch and management were great. The equipment was ok trucks stayed running for the most part."
good,You are given the opportunity to treat the customers as you own business and broaden you knowledge about each customer you service by viewing the different types of  services and products the offer. There by leaving room to upsell a new product or more of a successful product with a different flavor. Exciting.
good,"very good people"
good,"Fast-paced workplace working alongside experienced professionals. You're given an opportunity to make decisions and learn from them. "
good,"Union contracts being worded funny causes management to be petty sometime but I love all my coworkers and the job isn't the hardest in the world. Good workout, up early, chances for overtime daily."
good,I loved the work that pepsico gave me was incredible but the business was too cutthroat and too fast paced for me it seemed as though they expected my entire life to be centered around Pepsi.
good,The Daytona Beach office has a great merch manager in Wayne. I have a lot of respect for him. I was treated great at this location by management. My only complaint was that the stores on my route were always the last to be delivered. This often caused them to be late and i had to wait a long time to start working my stores. This isn't really my manager's fault because the truck drivers are based out of Orlando.
good,"Uma empresa com salários na média das empresas do porte, porém o plano de carreira é bastante dificil, para quem se conforta em se manter na posição pode até se aposentar na Pepsico."
good,I’ve had a great experience. It has been really fun and challenging. I need to make more money. And have a career with better advancement opportunities. To better my family
good,"Aprendí mucho de ventas el valor de servir al cliente, aprendí mucho de seguridad al manejar"
good,"Overall good company,  long hours for sales rep at times , although some day are short and you get off early. Average yearly is 52000 but your working 50 hours a week or more . Great benefits and 401 k matches half . Great opportunities to grow but easier to grow if you have a college education , if you don’t you often might get overlooked for someone who has one . Some days are tough because you never get help . Pay is anywhere from 599$ a week which has been my lowest of this year to 1,300 the highest of this year . Not bad but don’t recommend if your going to school might effect being able to get to class on time still great opportunity to work and grow you can still go to school with this job but you have to know how to manage your route to get out on time also compared to coke we are way outnumber they always have help and it sucks some store hate us but the salesman can always turn that around ."
good,Its long hard days working around costumers and consumers in stores. hardest part of the job is working back stock into the store shelves and cold boxes. making drop times is very difficult due to the fact that its usually just you and you alone working your four to five stores a day. Two of the five stores a day will be a product drop while the other three are just services to the store.
good,"Days can be long especially in the summer"
good,"Small Format SDL"
good,"Great place to work, benefits, and growth opportunities. You can make a career out of the front line or move up through management. Sometimes you may have to coach people through their positions but it's apart of being a team player."
good,"Hard work,  productive and friendly environment. "
good,It a nice place to work. Pay is good .Company just can't keep  good supervisors! The plant is extremely hot in the summer time!*The turn over rate is high.When company hire alot of young new hires.They have no responsibility so they eventually don't stay for the long haul!!!
good,"Procurement Division:"
good,"- Career Advancement Available"
good,great experience but management needs to learn how to give back to employees and not just take from them all the time. Hard labor workers get alone well.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, entretenido y dinamico, buen compañerismo."
good,"PepsiCo values work/life balance significantly. There is great flexibility in working from home, schedule changes, etc. with an emphasis on reliability. "
good,"Empresa multinacional, oferece bons benefícios."
good,"Like most major companies, the process is heavy and time consuming."
good,"PepsiCo is a world leader in convenient snacks, foods, and beverages, with over 285,000 employees. PepsiCo owns some of the world's most popular brands, including Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Diet Pepsi, Lay's, Doritos, Tropicana, Gatorade, and Quaker. PepsiCo brands are available worldwide through a variety of go-to-market systems."
good,"Responsible for monitoring and controlling quality parameters in in-line products"
good,lots of hard work but some decent perks. If you can handle the hard work and the stress its a great company to work for. Only reason I left was for a job that didn't require me to travel as much daily.
good,Good work culture and learned a lot in terms of handling large scale franchise bottlers and nationally leading the Modern Retail business and Food Service Channel Operations for PepsiCo.
good,I found the management could be very inconsistent. Not all managers worked with the same ethics and goals. I had the pleasure of working with managers that were interested in my career and then some managers that only focused on some people of their team but not others.
good,"Lo que más me gustó de PepsiCo es el ambiente laboral y la disposición de las personas a ayudar. Los equipos estaban muy cohesionados y nos solíamos juntar para comer siempre. Lo más difícil fue encargarme del departamento de marketing digital mientras cubrían el puesto de digital manager en Madrid, una critical experience que por supuesto me ha ayudado a crecer profesional y personalmente."
good,a typical day would include starting at 5am servicing customers and pretty much advancing until the next store location what i have learned from working this job as much as i have is that its critical to work at your own pace and provide excellent service to the customers efficiently to their needs to build and maintain a good relationship not only for yourself but for future opportunity in the future
good,The company is a good company to work for. Management was not fair and consistent when it came to job advancement. Typical day as a relief was not knowing what you were going to do. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some if the management.
good,"Employees are hardworking at Pepsi Cola of the Hudson Valley."
good,It was a good job at the time one of the managers and I didn’t get along. I got along with the customers which made the easy. Just like any other job it has it’s goods and bads
good,It was a decent company. Management was pretty good while i was there. They were involved in the community. some of the work days were long and tiresome.
good,"It was really good experiance  there's a diversity in it and there's many schedule activities, the HR department has many ideas to implement, career path development plan for each job,and i still love the work environment, may allah give me another chance like it."
good,Lo que hace uno en el día a día salir a dar todo de uno mismo y llegar con la meta del día
good,Stable job with a copious amount of hours for those looking to work weekends on a consistent basis. Work life balance almost nonexistent but offers many opportunities to learn and grow with the company.
good,Good place to work. Some people within management are leaders. Some positions involve using your own transportation. Everyday you work by and with different people on a daily basis.
good,ótima empresa para se trabalhar . bom ambiente de trabalho
good,Working here was okay. Getting paid every week was a plus but the long hours were not so god. Management was not very good either.The most enjoyable was the people
good,"Worked there for five years, first as a contractor and then as a full time employee. I appreciated all of the opportunities afforded to me in my time there, from growth to experience"
good,"Productive, pays well. Long hours but other than that everything else was cool. Great entertainment with the guys and they tear us with food sometimes."
good,Good company to work for. Teaches TPM (Total Productive Maintenance) which is great training and is transferable if you have to move to another company. Great team members.
good,"Pepsi’s is a great company long hours though!"
good,The soda industry is extremely competitive between Pepsi and Coke.  That translates into the everyday work life within the walls of Pepsi.  Fun place if you like that environment.
good,The benefits that PepsiCo offers their employees is above standard.  They still offer a pension program to all employees and tuition reimbursement.  I really enjoyed my job working with the employees.
good,"Un placer trabajar en una empresa como Pepsico, empresa seria y con posibilidad de crecimiento"
good,"Alem de ser uma empresa ótima e com vários benefícios, a ,mesma te dá oportunidades para seu crescimento profissional"
good,"The job itself isn't very difficult pull product stack on a pallet wrap it and stage it. The working conditions aren't the greatest though. Summer time its above 100 degrees on a daily basis inside the warehouse, hot temperatures long days and not so great pay make it hard to maintain working there."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo pero con poca estabilidad
good,It is a nice place to work at. Lots of young energy in the trade promotions departmentThey taught me SAP and I am grateful for that. They put a lot of energy in training new hires which is great
good,Enjoyed 29 years at Pepsi. Vehicles kept in top shape. Given all the tools to succesfully do the job safely. Great way to meet people of different cultures
good,Good place to work where attention to detail is important and ability to multitask is crucial. Overall a good place to work. Mt. Angel is somewhat stuck in the past.
good,Pepsi MEM - Stable and fair division of Pepsico to work for.  Pay is very competitive.  Big emphasis on safety and training.  Management is knowledgeable and reasonable to work with.
good,"I have had a good experience working for this company until a change happened with the transport. (Tuped over)."
good,Pepsi cola was my first company where i stated my carrer i learned all from here I always thank ful to this company that they give me chance to build my career level up
good,"Hard laborious  work, decent pay, good Co workers, friendly environment, good benefits,  newer equipment to operate, lots of public interactions. Home nightly."
good,"Algunos supervisores son buenos, un dia en ruta es salir muy temprano"
good,Most of the drivers helped each other out when needed and everyone got along. The hours are definitely too long especially if you have a family and want to spend time with them.
good,PepsiCO promoted a strong team environment in both sales and distribution departments resulting in better performance. Team events were often organized.
good,"Pepsi is a good company. The manager who hired me was good with communication. The next supervisor was not as good. The only time you heard from him was when there was an issue. If you needed time off you never knew if it was approved. "
good,"You work independently. Stocking shelves with pop, coolers, displays, etc. building displays, using pallet jack, flat beds, uboats, Pulling the pallets on to floor early mornings, it was somewhat of a struggle if your small. Organizing backroom with stock when finished. Damages to the side. Scan in and out. Good job if you like working independently."
good,"Pepsico da çalışmak benim için güzel ve avantajlı oldu bilmediğim bilgileri öğrendim ofis ortamını gördüm  edindiğim ortamdan mutluyum iyikide çalışmışım stajyer olarak insanları çok iyi ama şirkette gereksiz şikayet edenler çok var bunun olması normal tabi :) büyük şirket ortamında eğlence olarak çok güzel etkinlik gezi  gibi sosyal etkinlikler düzenliyorlar iş stersini atmak için güzel avantaj herkes birbirine saygılı,hoşgörülü  davranıyorlar"
good,This is a job where you get what you put into it. The main problem with them right now is some of the management is inconsistent or inexperienced. They have great benefits. It is a very demanding business and place. There is a lot of turnover.
good,"Me parece una empresa donde a pesar de que la carga de trabajo es mucha, hay muchas prestaciones y beneficios. Algunas personas en mandos altos pueden llegar a ser elitistas pero en general el ambiente de trabajo es bueno"
good,"Buena cultura de trabajo y ambiente, es una empresa socialmente responsable."
good,"This job with Pepsi is hard work, with a lot of lifting, but with the work comes great benefits...health, dental, vision, 401K. Weekends off and time with the family."
good,Great place to work. Everyone is super friendly and always offered to help out with questions. I learned a great deal while working with this company. I really enjoyed my time with PepsiCo.
good,It is a union faciity. It goes by seniority on what routes or duties a person does. Overall great workplace culture. Management is reasonable with their employees.
good,"Fast pace, people were very friendly, kept up to date on diagnostic equipment. "
good,Great company with great pay and benefits. Coworkers are good people to work with. There’s always room for advancement. Kept me updated on new things ahead
good,"PepsiCo was a layed back environment with great people to work with.  I hear that the environment has drastically changed from when I left and a lot of the IT work is now being outsourced."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Pepsi, the company was good, the management was great and fair, the only reason I had to leave was I was relocating. I would definitely recommend working for them."
good,pepsi is a great place to work but the shifts are hard to get use to and are hard on family life.other than that great place to work great benefits and pay is good as well.
good,"A very strong work ethic is needed as it is physical. Time management skills an asset. Team oriented and goal driven. Safety a priority. Do your best, meet targets and have fun."
good,Como todas as empresas tem seus lados positivos e negativos...as positivas combrem os pontos negativos  da Pepsico.
good,"Better be ready to work.    If you don’t mind working,  you will be fine.  Early days and late nights.  Overall good company.  Just show up and work.  Good benefits"
good,"Salaries in certain locations never seem to go up. That said, the work life balance is wonderful. Some departments have 50% work from home. If you can handle the random lay offs that seem happen with no rhyme or reason, it is a great place to work!"
good,"Top notch place to learn best in class marketing, however, lots of posturing and politicking amongst colleagues for career advancement with no clear path to growth and development. In addition to doing your job well, expect to also be required to lead a club or employee resource group in order to be considered for a promotion."
good,I enjoyed working for Pepsi. I got to start my route early and made good pay. They paid by case. So there is money to be made. The down side is the route are unpredictable. Sometimes there is more than you think you can handle. Definitely a young man’s position.
good,"worked for pepsi for 7 years nice job too have would work there, fun up beat place  start 6 am hit the route wate for orders full acct build displays,"
good,challenging and fun to learn the different equipment usage. opportunity to learn different operations of machinery. chance for advancement. weekends off
good,"Very demanding. Takes a lot of hard work and dedication to move forward - very long hours. "
good,"This is not an easy job for someone who cannot use time management skills and prioritize task. You must be able to work without supervision. "
good,You work long hours. The pay is good for what is required. You work with store level management to build displays. You work with your sales rep. to communicate any problems to management
good,"A empresa oferece treinamentos regularmente, o que mostra preocupação com a capacitação e desenvolvimento dos funcionários."
good,Good paying job but depending on where you were located depended on how the job worked for you. Pepsi treated most of its employees well but management was selfish and would over work the harder workers to a terrible degree
good,Le travail de marchandiseur chez Pepsico-Fritolay consiste à placer les sacs de croustilles ou les breuvages dans les différents magasins qui vous sont attitrés. Le travail en général est intéressant malgré son aspect répétitif et il est excellant pour un étudiant puisque le travail normal est uniquement de fin de semaine.
good,i started my carrier over here. To learn a plant manufacturing at pepsico was something educational but seriously the upper management here enjoys with good salaries & less work to do.
good,Fair company to work for. Great pay and benefits. Worked for this company for 10 years. I did my best to make the company a success. It was a fun ten years.
good,"Very busy work environment during the summer time. Excellent pay for Warehouse Work, weekly pay friendly work environment with co-workers. Hardest part of the job would be the constant bending/twisting you do on a day-to-day basis."
good,Excellent pay and career job but just be careful of cut-throat employees and management. You start off in warehouse and depending on seniority and where you are in points you can get out of warehouse in six months time.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Pepsi for the most part. The management team really did try to work with you and help you out with situations that came up. There are times, especially in the Summer, where even if you're part-time, you'll work 30-40 hours and sometimes 50. And part-time employees usually get stuck with the holidays since full-time gets paid overtime. I did enjoy those of whom I worked with and the employee parties got better as time went on. It was a little frustrating having to drive all over from Gaylord, to East Jordan, to Cheboygan, and the surrounding areas, especially when you had to start at 6am."
good,Los supervisores eran muy estrictos. Pero bien....
good,Great work environment / team members.  Great culture and celebrate employment diversification.  Provide flex hours and a minimum of 3 weeks vacation to start.
good,Overall good company but they have a specific way they like to do things and if you don't conform to the mold then you will be left behind. Culture is 10-12 hour workdays. Management has a tendency to peer over your shoulder on everything.
good,"I would definitely return to PepsiCo, I was a temporary employee that didnt get a chance to go through with the hiring process. I wish things could have been different."
good,An amazing organization that offers tremendous opportunities for advancement. Very fast fast and challenging work environment that forces it's employees to learn and act quickly.
good,"The job was a summer job for me. Hours were long and the day would start at 6am. you'd work individually and you'd have a set route every day. you'd work until you were done with your route. lots of communication required with store managers. I was given a company phone to sign in and they would track were I am. I'd also know where the delivery trucks were. overall fun job, great experience. decent pay but I was not happy about the gap between full time and part time workers."
good,"Long hours., your day did not end until all of your stores were worked. Your day would start at 4 am and many days didn't end until 4 or 5 in the afternoon."
good,Gostei muito de trabalhar na PepsiCo durante mais de 6 anos contudo acabaram com as posições regionais de bebidas e por isto tive que sair da CIA.
good,"Ótima empresa de trabalhar,  ambiente tranquilo e descontraido.."
good,"If we are on rolls of Pepsi co directly, we get good salaries and perks. But this is a different scenario if we are working with franchise bottlers."
good,"Being a manager you learned how to manage food costs, labor costs, the profit and loss statement monthly. All shifts were scheduled for 10 hours and usually you worked a little extra. You did have the free reign to manage your store without being micro managed."
good,"In a small town its either Pepsi, Coke or Budweiser. Started as a merchandiser, worked hard, showed interest in driving. Company trained me while on the clock and got my class A CDL. Became a route delivery driver in less than six months with zero out of pocket training cost."
good,"A fast-paced, ""figure it out yourself"" culture. Need to be a self-starter, curious and willing to make connections in order to get the information you need to perform your job."
good,"For the first 19 yrs I had mostly great things to say about PepsiCo; Great opportunities to grow and advance, good pay, job security, work/life balance, etc.  But after being laid off for the reason of saving money on my salary and pension, I now look at PepsiCo in a whole new light.  Loyalty used be something that was respected, celebrated, rewarded.  Up until just a few years ago, it was. Now, it is a reason to get rid of a lot of people just to save money.  "
good,"Si bien cada tarea depende de un sector especifico, la buena relacion llevada a cabo por la mayoria, colabora a que se trabaje con ganas, a que cada uno se sienta respetado y reconocido por su labor"
good,"As an OJT, I cannot tell what is really the job since all I did was more on observations. Based on my observations, I find it exciting and enjoying working in PEPSICO. The workers, the environment or the ambience is relaxing."
good,"PepsiCo is a great company to start a CPG career. A lot of very talented people and a lot of great industry leadership. It's a very hard working culture, which isn't a bad thing. Compensation isn't great a lower-mid level roles. Headquarters location leaves a lot to be desired. White Plains/Purchase NY is very expensive."
good,No time for home life but benefits and pay is good depending on the route you get you could be working from 10 hourse a day to 14 hourse a day a lot of that could be drive time
good,"Working your route from early until done, promoting products, and keeping a good re poor with your accounts.Keeping customer loyalty by giving great service in sales, and service. When on call, being there for your accounts when they need you most. Like on weekends, or at night."
good,"I was a driver at pepsi and the days were often long and the work exhausting but I was compensated well for my efforts. Problems with routing and loading were ever present and there is a lot of turnover because of the physical nature of the work, but most people did what they could to make the best of things."
good,"Bom ambiente, recursos adequados e uma gestão moderna."
good,i                                                     i loved working with these guys money was really good ppl easy to get along with really ice owners
good,It was Fun! Hard work but a cool company to work for. I was able to work with other team members to get the job done. If I hadn't finished my work I would get other merchandisers to help me out.
good,"To many hours 50 to 60 weekly, sales rep position eIs equivalent to work a full time and part time job because the number of hours."
good,"Had a great internship with Pepsi in their Frito Lay Division. Management was great and the company culture was one I would recommend joining. The job can be stressful at times since people are buying less salty snacks and carbonated beverages, but overall a great experience and a role I would recommend."
good,"Long physical work if your willing to do it, as hard as you make it for yourself. Plenty of hours if you can take on more. Mostly solo working conditions as far as other members of the team, lots of client and in store interactions."
good,"Great co-workers, good hands on experience and open to new ideas. Awesome brands that you feel proud representing. Above par compensation.  Lots of teamwork."
good,"A company you can learn and work on many areas and functions. Moving departments are not that hard. Good work life balance, depends on the group one is in though."

I would travel to several location around the city and other cities close by my location. I've met a lot of interesting people. I worked here until I joined the Army."

The hours varied from being 12-16 hour days during the peek seasons down to minimal hours during off season.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being a part of the Pepsi Beverage Leadership Group"
good,"Good benefit and good pay but no job advancement. The environment is not that safe. This company might be the best factory in Columbia, Mo but the factory job is always pay a lot but it will never be the safe place for your health. The overnight schedule with 12 hours shift is killing workers. the loud noise and the heat in popping are and oven room are so dangerous for anyone health. If you love money and do not care about health, this will be your dream place to work. Just making money and do not think too much about other things around you. this will be enough and good place to be."
good,Good place to work if you like to bust tail. Overall it's fast paced and the time goes by fast. Not for those who do not like manual labor. You are constantly lifting heavy things and moving pallet jacks. Often times the back rooms are hot and you'll sweat like crazy.
good,"- Project Management"
good,"Nicely Skilled Job to have, but if the Pepsi Bottling Plant decides to Strike......The few skilled employees we have at the service and maintenance division have no say in the matter.....Everyone has been there for years.....Family Atmosphere.....Helping folks get something to drink for 16.5 years.  Everyone by now has heard that the Production Facility (Serperate from Ours) voted to STRIKE.....So we have to honor that reguardless of our votes :("
good,"Please see me for detailed review."
good,"Many moving pieces and  specific skills required to manage job responsibilities.  Long days, decent amount of travel time, many meetings and conferece calls, and ongoing day to day challenges both on the business side and the customer side.  Great coworkers and solid management.  Hardest part of the job is the demad and expectations with the overwhelming workload and constantly changing deadlines.  Love the level of responsibility and the relationships built both internally and externally, as well as the knowledge and skills acquired."

good,PepsiCo works as a team which is motivated and focused towards the goal
good,I enjoyed working for PBC very much. I was able to work independently as a Merchandiser. This job require discipline and the ability to work with no supervision. The hardest part about this job is the stores back stock. If your product is not easily accessible it takes longer to do your job turning a 30-45 minute job into a 2 hour task. Fortunately this was not always the case.
good,"Top notch talent"
good,I was a part of manufacturing pepsi drinks to be shipped out around the state of illinois. This was a fun job and I was actually able to see first hand and be a part of making very popular drinks. All of the co-workers were like family and quickly made me a part of it. The hardest part of this job was keeping the assembly line running smoothly after my machine kept getting jammed. But I made things happen and was very proud of myself. The management were good people and well organized.
good,"I love the facility where I work. Our facility sells 1.3 million cases annually so we are really busy for a small location. I get along great with all the employees and I am respected and appreciated for my work. I lead many groups and am considered the point of contact for many important roll outs, conversions and programs within the facility. I work hard every day and do a great job maintaining the entire office and all of it's needs independently. I generally work without supervision and alone however I am responsible for answering to five managers and meeting all needs timely."

good,Stock shelves and write orders. this is a fast pace job that requires multitasking. Before a sale can be finalized you must a low a store manager to approve it. The most important part of the job is building a good professional relationship with the store managers. The hardest part of the job is to sale a large display into the store.
good,"En pepsico fue una experiencia muy buena para quienes han estado alla  para quienes estan y aquellos que en un futuro llegacen alli  porque cuentan con un muy buen grupo gerencial y tambien un inmenso y selecto personal muy bien preparado para realizar todas las actividades del proceso del producto rigiendose estrictamente bajo los estandares y reglamentos del invima por ser empresa de alimentos y tambien por su reglamento interno."

good,great company with great benefits. you could tell they took care of their employees. only thing is if you wanted to go to school it was impossible with the longs hours worked.
good,"Overall, PepsiCo is a great place to work.  Management is interested in your development and supports your career path.  Unfortunately, several departments are being out-sourced, which has left many without employment; I happen to be one of those affected.  The company has a strong employee moral and does go over and beyond to recognize a job well done."
good,"06:00 da manha  temos que ja estar na rua em direção o primeiro cliente."
good,A typical day at Pepsi starts off with me clocking in and collecting paper work for my route for the day. Then I go out to my tracker to do an inspection before I take off to deliver on my route. I learned on my route anything can happen and I just have to deal it and make the best out of it. The management is very understanding when it deals issues and try their best to help out the driver and customer. My team is very team oriented. We help each other out when it comes to directions and issues they might have dealt with before. I like my team of drivers. The hardest part is the labor factor of my job but Its a job. The good perks of my job are that I get to deal with new people and am the representative of Pepsi and do my best to be professional.

good,"PBG is a really good job to work for, you are on your own for the most part which is nice to not have to deal with supervisors breathing down your back 24/7. Stock shelves and build displays. Its very physical by days end I feel like I am 100 years old. It can be very stressful at times because the upper management is all about sales and hitting numbers which they don't realize takes a toll of on us because we are the ones doing the dirty work of getting our products in stores and setting up. Also not only do we have to deal with Pepsi management but the Grocery Store management as well which a lot of them treat the vendors like scum so it can be very difficult to deal with both parties. Work most weekends and holidays and theres no set schedule, your days off change from week to week, and your day isn't done until you finish your whole route which can be anywhere from 6-12 plus hours"

Products according to schedule product release sometimes having a steady day and or difficult day. What I learned most while there during my time period was team work, how successfully multi task while given strong commitments through out the whole day.The hardest part of the job was getting all to become one as team which take a lot of strong leadership and motivation. Which would conclude us giving the best production and gaining great success."
good,"Bom Desenvolvimento e aprendizado, agrega muito conhecimento e desafios na carreira."
good,"The work can be very hard at times. I have worked a 14 hr day before. We (Norfolk VA) usually work Fri thru Mon (which totally sucked). The pay was decent $12.85 + overtime. You r going to stay in shape without a doubt. My management team was great & my family of merchandisers were great. No job is perfect & Pepsi is no exception. If times got hard enough, I would go back in a heart beat."

good,productive day.
good,"Work begins early at 6 am, I jump on my forklift and begin working on pallets of damaged product that the night crew busted up. The amount of work is overwhelming at times especially in the summer because that is our peak season. Returns of product from stores brought back to the facility by route drivers are then sorted as well. After completing my work for the day, I then help my co workers offload trailers and stock the warehouse. What I have learned is that team work really is the key to a successful business. Management and co workers are very easy to get along with. This job is not hard at all and the most enjoyable part of the job is that I have my evenings and weekends all to myself."
good,Es un muy buen lugar de trabajo solo en ocasiones especiales se trabajaban mas horas de las debidas sin reconocimientos.En el tiempo que yo trabaje fue muy productivo para mi ya que aprendi muchas cosas.

good,My day can start out as early as 1am and last until 6pm. I fill out paperwork and imput merchandise orders into the computer. I enjoy working with the group of people that I do.
good,Good benifits. Nice coworkers. Work independently. Sometimes pallet jacks were not in good condition which made it difficult to perform your duties
good,Wonderful life long friends made
good,I would start bright and early around 5 am usually have about 5 stores days would go fast it kept you busy. i learned that you should always stay focused on the task keep in shape to avoid injuries self motivation is a plus. the management was good at times they certainly look out for you the hardest part would have to be the last store being that you get fatigued but feels good to get the job done. i enjoyed working alone getting in the zone to where i know a job needed to be done.
good,Great experience working for Fortune 500 company. You work together as a team in the different channels of the business. They provide great sales training to enhance your sales skills in the trade. Many of the employees have been with the company for many years. Nice to have on your resume
good,PepsiCo Beverages was a good company to work for. The people at the organization are great. Unfortunately due to cut backs my position was eliminated
good,"Great plant to work at, however it's not my ideal or near-ideal location. Some managers are quite supportive. The pay is good, however I was told that it would increase much faster and I would outpace my other offers and my contemporaries, both of which did not hold up. Opportunities for advancement are plenty; I've been promoted on average about once every 8 months. The people at the plant are great, although due to the location, fairly prejudiced. My positions so far (supervisory in manufacturing/warehousing) have been relatively easy in terms of both objectives and people management."
good,If you go to work and do your job it can be a easy job and one of your most enjoyable job you would ever have it was away for me to get my CDL class A without a commitment
good,"You build displays on Tuesday or Wednesday depending on the store/Account. You learn how to handle everyday duties in a professional manner while out on the trade. Very independent, meeting are four times a year.  Holidays can be heavy but it's doable. I enjoy starting early with a game plan. It allows me to get home on time to pick up my kids from school."
good,"I was with the company for almost 10 years before part of the financial department was moved over to IBM. Enjoyed the environment, coworkers and flexibility."

good,"Very good company and a great place for anyone to start their career. They provide a solid foundation and encourage understanding the business cold."
good,Good Workplace. Great project. Assignment was short term. Good Project needed lots of co-ordination. I will recommend this company. Negative Contractors do not have sapce.
good,"Money is good. Benefits great. Tough job at times although worth it. Stay healthy. They take care of you in many different ways, some perks which is always welcome."
good,Management will walk all over you to further their careers and not worry about you at all. On the upside the pay and benefits were great. The hours were good with set schedules.
good,Started on nights with a split schedule but eventually got enough seniority to move to days and enjoyed the people I worked with in production. Mostly everyone has more then 10 years experience and was willing to help you learn if you wanted to gain more knowledge.
good,"Bien, solo que quitaran el.cobro de merma a los empleados estaria bien, no andar pagando producto"
good,"the pay is good, the benefits package is fantastic! Would like to see cost of living increases as we are commission based(mostly). The opportunity for growth and travel is great. Though families may find it difficult starting out. Established persons on dedicated routes earn more than Swing/Relief people. I have had great years as a relief person, so it just depends."
good,"Great place to work at, great support from other Supervisors/Managers.  Pretty laid back.  Fast pace at times.  Employees for the most part really get along and are very helpful"
good,"É um bom lugar para trabalhar, porém não valoriza os funcionários quando se trata de promoção.  Muitas vezes contratam alguém de fora, sem experiência ou conhecimento algum na função ao invés de promover alguém que já trabalha na empresa e tem capacidade de assumir a função."
good,I enjoyed my coworkers.  But the routes were unpredictable from day to day. The benefits were great.  The pay was good. You have good PTO and Vacation time.
good,"Es una empresa que demanda mucha dedicación, pero está muy bien remenurada, a demás que existe una alta probabilidad de promoción laboral, y tiene fabuloso planes de capacitación."
good,Pepsi was a great company My job requires making deliveries to various companies dealing with customer service inventory putting products away great work environment very encouraging but unfortunately I got hurt and had a rehab in my position is no longer available at the company
good,Muy buen ambiente de trabajo. Te recompensa el trabajo realizado con sus gratitudes.
good,"A lot of driving in reverse which can be hard on your neck and back, expected pick rate is 25 pallets per hour which is not easy when system sends you to other end of warehouse"
good,Generally a fun place to work there is always something to do. I got a lot of experience running a pallet jack and forklift. Management was fair and accommodating.
good,"I will recommend this company to anyone.  They are a great group of people.  I have come to consider them a part of my close family.  "
good,"Good opportunities to move up and try something new and make more money, great co workers and big lunch room. Management is awful and do not fix reoccurring problems."
good,"The job is very fast paced and the workload can sometimes be very high but the job is not that bad. The main issue is team work. There are people who will do anything in there power to pin the blame on you. The best part about the job was being independent and having some control over schedule but with corporate and upper lever management constantly pushing new time wasting expectations it can be difficult to keep a good pace. "
good,"At the time, the Mountain Region office was based in Phoenix. Since then it has been closed and absorbed into another region. If you enjoy working towards getting more food on a a shelf, and expanding the category space of a supplier, then PepsiCo is an excellent place to work."

good,Was een leuke ervaring jammer dat je uitzendkracht was en dat het minder werdt.
good,"The interview process was different than any other job I’ve worked for. They put you through a physical test to see if you can I guess qualify to work in the warehouse. After I started though you get use to everything and it’s a breeze. Everyone here is pretty much family away from home. It’s a lot of dependability though bc if someone is out you could end up staying later. You don’t have a set amount of hours a day you work, you work until all the trucks are loaded and your area is clean. But you do get weekends off. Overall it’s a great place to work. I would recommend Pepsi to anyone."
good,"Uma empresa muito boa, onde valorizam seu esforço e o trabalho em grupo e exemplar."
good,"Great place to work, unfortunately has a lot of  employees with the attitude of ""its not my job"". Most never worked anywhere else so not aware of how lucky they are to have job security in a clean and friendly environment with decent pay."
good,"I start at 3:00 a.m., and usually off by 9-10 a.m.  The job entails rolling out carts of Frito-Lay product, stocking the merchandise, and making sure the front end registers are fully stocked.  Some days I visit 3 stores, some days just one.  As long as you're doing your job, everyone leaves you alone.  I see my boss maybe 5-10 minutes a week, and have no inter action with store managers.  "
good,I have worked in this company I was read new things and more about agriculture and improving my skills in This job most of the challenges I have faced
good,"If you are a motivated operator or like being in a team based job you will never work a day in your life at this facility. Anyone who wants to learn and wants to become better will thrive with this company, if you want to show up and collect a paycheck while achieving a moderate standard of performance you can do that as well. The management at times can appear and act as if they are detached from what the workforce on the floor is dealing with, but they are ALWAYS open to talk to you, which goes a long ways. Show up on time, do your job and hustle and you can reach scale pay in 3 years (start at 16.80, scale at 26~$ per hr)."
good,"Good place to work for but I hate that 1/3 of my pay check comes from commission. All it takes is a grocery manager to be in a bad mood or not like you  for them to turn down a display and BOOM, your check sucks."
good,I started in a slower pace area with Pepsi then moved back to Denver. where at the beginning i thought would work for me but when i was working 10 hours plus i had enough.
good,"Boa empresa, porém algumas lideranças deixam muito a desejar, como lideres e como pessoas."
good,"Pepsi is a cool work place . You can have your days like if it’s a walk in the park . But remember when it hits , it hits hard with the work hours and labor."
good,Great work area with coworkers and management. Always made sure u understood your work duties in meetings to make sure it was done to the best of your abilities.
good,Fast paced on your toes at all times. Once you get used to the workload you should be ok if you like physical work. They are not tight with overtime they want all the work to get completed.
good,"Overall Great Place to work:"
good,"good place to work but there are some benefits if you're in the loop..life of a pepsi employ has it's perks ..good pay hours are dependent upon how much effort you want to put in it..if you want to be lazy you're gonna be in for a long day but if you get after it, well you'll be home quicker"
good,"Typical day at work start day with sales plan with confirm execution"
good,PepsiCo is fast paced and expects a lot out of their employees. Sales district leaders are on call 24/7 work life balance is hard if you live 30mins or more from the facility. Territories can be big. Expect to drive a lot.
good,Empresa muito boa de se trabalhar com muitos benefícios e muito boa de se trabalhar
good,I learned a lot from my internship experience at PepsiCo. My supervisors are very approachable and nice. I learned how to manage my time wisely and finish my work as soon as possible.
good,Good place to work very good managers but needs more pay for the type of job. Hours are good and the customers are not to bad to work with at all just needs to be paid more then it would be a great place to work.
good,"come in clock in, get ready, get a machine, make sure its charged, and start the daily check on warehouse and machine. Then start picking orders and fill up the trucks. Take a break, after break is over get back to loading trucks. Lunch comes around we all go to lunch. When lunch is over we finish loading trucks and take a break. after we are done loading trucks we clean up and make the warehouse is clean. clock out and head home."
good,"Very good place to work."
good,"Empresa com possibilidade de crescimento excelente ambiente de trabalho com forte cultura de inclusão, respeito e ética."
good,Es una empresa solida con muchas oportunidades de hacer carrera dentro de la misma empresa
good,"Pepsico es una excelente empresa, se aprende mucho en ella, cada día hay había nuevos retos"
good,"Compañia con objetivo claros, clima laboral muy bueno, cultura organizacional de diversidad e inclusion, valoracion del desempeño por objetivos."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me receiving, reviewing, and approving invoices through a third party system. If there were any inconsistencies, i would research and keep constant communication with the vendor about fixing the problem. My management is great, the culture is great, but the hardest part of the job is we work in a corporation. Anyone is expendable."
good,Working at Pepsi as a non  union rep was very tough. The culture there is that Union People are against non union management. But besides that the work is great and very empowering.
good,The senior leaders relate to employees which is the main reason for employee morale and work ethics. Company does a good job sharing their short term and long term vision with emplyees.
good,Some days are slow but the job you do and the benefits you receive are great. Insurance not so much but you get 4 weeks vacation after 5 years in my department which is not a common benefit you come across
good,"Good pay, great benefits, and job security.  Great work hours."
good,Great company. Very demanding job. Good management. Many benefits. Perks and discounts. Commission based. High paced and expectation. Lots of competition
good,Es tiempo completo y muy bueno en el ambiente de trabajo.

good,"As the Salesman with the position of ""Order Taker"""
good,Pepsi is a good company to work for from a compensation standpoint. The work ranges from fairly to very physical. The sales team has high expectations and is very stressful.
good,trasnacional en donde se aprende sobre cultura organizativa y responsabilidad
good,"Summer time is the busiest so working hard is necessary. Overtime is encouraged in order to get your work done and as long as you show up and do quality work, no one will be looking over your shoulder. Everyone within the company treats each other with respect no matter how stressful some situations can be."
good,"Fine place to work. Fun people, hard work but worth it, good pay and benefits. Would recommend the company to others. Team environment and mostly good management"
good,"A typical day at PepsiCo is relaxed but fast paced, the team lead is pretty flexible with breaks and progress. But the faster you work the faster you get to go home. so it was a very competitive work environment everyone wanted to be the one leading in numbers."
good,I love Pepsi there’s so many job opportunities within the company. I’m a side load driver right now and it’s not an easy job. But if you have a good work ethic you’ll be fine! And my manager is definitely the best!
good,"Constant Communication with various stakeholders. Able to make sound decisions on problem solving complexity."
good,Enjoyable place to work. It was a very fast paced environment that provided numerous opportunities to excell and have career progression. Great benefit package
good,"Management were all nice. The work is fast-paced. There is a quota you will have to meet once training is done. The company provides you with a uniform so, you won't have to mess up your own clothes once you receive it. Usually 10 hour days, 4 days a week with some opportunity for overtime."

good,"Pepsi is a great company, it's an extremely fast paced environment and it definitely keeps you moving through out the night. This is not a job for anyone who moves slow, the job requires you to remain consistent in speed through your shift. Coworkers are fine, management is fine and I've never had any issues with anyone. One thing I don't like is that They lack good equipment for the job, some of their pallet jacks are old and wearing down and it slows your production rate. "
good,New CEO is putting his stamp on the company.  Should be an interesting year.  Ability to move into different positions within the company though hard to advance to higher band levels.

One of my biggest challenges though, was maintaining a proper form or posture. when picking cases when I started working with the company. As the saying goes, ""Form Follows Function"", and when I started to implement this saying and got the hang of job, It's been a breeze working for pepsi. The most enjoyable part of the Job are the people who say funny , respectable things."
good,"Envirenement travaille agreable, bon placement geographic"
good,"People wanted to do the right thing. All employees were treated respectfully regardless of professional title, ethnicity or eccentricity. Management cared about the reputation of the company and its products."
good,"Not very difficult work, therefore the pay fits. The only issue is that there is not much room to move within my department and the only real chance for movement is relocation."
good,"No está mal, pero podrían pagar mejor, además la higiene que hay en las bodegas deja mucho que desear."
good,Working at PepsiCo was very fast paced. As soon as you get there you stretch and they give you the info of how much you have for the day. As soon as you're done stretching you go to work for at least 10 hours a day. The hours depend on how much work you have for the day and how fast everybody else goes.
good,A typical day at Pepsi co was working with good and helpful employees and a fun work environment. the most enjoyable part of my time at Pepsi co would be the fun and laughs I had with my employees

good,As a Presell Account Manager you get to have a route to build as your own but work as a team too.  It is very challenging yet rewarding. Fast paced.  Steady schedule but varying hours.
good,Worked in a small team that reported to a manager in a different state. I was there on contract for a few months but from what I saw there is an okay work/life balance as I could work from home a few times a week and it seemed the norm.
good,I am a merchandiser and I would go to different stores and work orders and stock shelves with pepsi  products from the back room or the order that came in that day.

good,"Overall PepsiCo treats it's employees well.  401k, PTO and Medical benefits are well designed.  Pay could be a little better.  Managers are fair and look out of you.  PepsiCo is like a family.  Job duties are taking orders on inbound/outbound calls.  Fielding customer complaints and processing request correctly.  Lots of volunteer opportunities and employee appreciation activities."
good,When I started with the company they put employees first but by the time I parted it was not about the employees.  The last manager I worked for was probably the worst persona I had ever worked for. Not someone you would want to shadow.

good,"I worked at Pepsi for two years and I liked it. I worked in two different locations as an Account Merchandiser. Good job for college students and those who are looking to start there career and move up into leadership positions. A typical day would start off as knowing your schedule, communicating with your manager, and co-workers about any things to be aware of while running your route. Primary responsibilities included servicing customers, building displays, filling shelves, coolers, end caps, and displays with awesome Pepsi products. Keeping the backroom organized is a must in order to make sure we have room for incoming inventory at each store. My direct managers were good and handled any issues that I needed help with if needed. The hardest part was coming into some locations and dealing with backroom inventory being unorganized. The most enjoyable was interacting with Pepsi consumers and knowing how much they liked our products. I seriously think about going back to work for the company someday."
good,Tive uma experiência na parte de Recursos Humanos como Business Partner. Gostei de ter aprendido por lá e foi uma grande escola para mim.
good,"The Job is challenging on your body, you will have to drive to different areas learn the large amount of areas, you will need to be fast paced and self motivated because it is really easy to get behind with packing out most locations.

good,"Being a Bay truck driver for Pepsi is a very physical job.  You are climbing in and out of the trailer 15-25 times a day unloading and stacking products to take in to the customer, then down stacking and most of the time stocking the customers shelves.  It was very fast paced if you wanted to get done in a timely manner.  You work in all weather conditions, hot, cold, rain, snow, you're in it."
good,The only thing that can hold you back is your lack of desire at Pepsico. There is so much to learn and grow as a person. If you are looking for a challenge then you should consider working for Pepsi.

good,"Competitive pay with good benefits. You're paid a salary plus a commission for each case delivered per day. The faster you are, the more money you can make. If you are slow them you won't be sent out work very many cases which means your commission (.10/case) check will not be very much. I was a top 3-5 driver. That guaranteed me a good paycheck each week but also meant that they were losing me up with as many cases as they possibly could to help cover the cases the slower drivers couldn't deliver"

good,"Lo malo es que disponen de tu tiempo aún sea tus días de descanso. "
good,"I was hired by Pepsi because of my great communication skills demonstrated while working for their affiliate, Plastipak Packaging. I came aboard as the Product Availability Supervisor, meaning I was in control of the dock loaders moving finished product from the warehouse onto pallets, to be loaded onto trucks waiting to deliver these goods to their customers. I also assisted in supervising the loading of bulk loading, which delivered goods to gas stations and convenience stores. I finished my day by assuring the loading sheets matched the driver's scanning devices. Management was extremely informative of all happenings company, as well as departmental wide. The work environment was fast paced, as these trucks must be loaded in a timely fashion. The hardest part of the job was dealing with union issues, as sometimes the workers would take advantage of us to allow us to let them load at their own pace, instead of ours. The most enjoyable part was the opportunities to work many hours (as I was an hourly employee) and have a bigger paycheck when i desired one."

good,"No bad feelings or thoughts about Pepsico, they were always honest and great at communication. Just as a blue color guy with just a high school diploma, there wasnt a fair chance of advancement. No matter what acheivements, accomplishments, or accolades, i wasnt qualified enough without a degree. No matter the experience or training, I was good enough to train college hires and see them advance and succeed , but i myself was never qualified enough. Local Management was awesome and supportiveI, just lost faith in the corporate direction and support. Alot of hours and commitment to not have any opportunities to keep growing."

good,"Working for Pepsi was an experience. My hours were typically 11pm-9am. The job consisted of driving to different stores and stocking the shelves and displays with product. You really need to keep up the pace so you can get to all of the stores on your route. The managers I dealt with were very friendly and understanding. There were times I needed to leave before my route was completed because I was in college and had classes to get to. The hardest part of the job for me was just working overnight. It was a difficult balancing act with being a full time student, having 2 jobs, and wanting to have a life.

Politica de benefícios acima da média.Meu trabalho consistia em visitas externas, muito agradável, todas as semanas a gente presente com os clientes.O convívio com os colegas era mínimo, mas agradável. O mais agradável no dia que às vezes ao retornar à fábrica, o gerente comercial ficava na entrada nos aguardando para propor um desafio para a gente ligar para o melhor cliente e oferecer mais um volume de produtos com um preço especial e momentâneo e você fazia o contato e conseguia corresponder a expectativa daquele desafio. No seguimento de bebidas o nosso maior concorrente fazia com que fosse a parte mais díficil do trabalho.No meu entender um depósito resolveria o problema em minas gerais. Uma fábrica gerou mais despesas e consequentemente o número que vendíamos estava sempre insatisfatório para a diretoria, tendo que voltar o convênio no brasil para a ambev, que deteve o convênio antes por 25 anos e hoje opera a fábrica em contagem e a nível brasil."

good,"Let's face it there is only so much satisfaction or enjoyment you can get from driving a truck, there are some things which are annoying at Pepsi, for example, getting your assigned truck at the start of your shift, but the company does pay for this kind of downtime. No problems with management or co-workers, in fact they have been very supportive, I recently had a change in my personal circumstances and they agreed to adjust my start time and driving routes to allow more home time.  In turn I have tried to assist by going in to cover extra shifts at short notice, or by working more hours especially over the busy summer period.  Based on my own experience I would definitely recommend working for Pepsi."

good,"Pepsi is a place where if you work hard you will succeed. I started at Pepsi as a temporary employee. Within 3 months I proved myself and was hired on as a forklift driver. Shortly after when a Technician job opened was promoted. This was all due to showing that I was a hard worker and could handle the job. I have been in this position since then. "
good,"great place, always a fun environment to be in, good people who love their job and it shows in their attitude.  Aside from some personal stuff going on in my life I would likely still be working there."

good,Very productive workplace. A typical day at work included working with routing managers overseeing my duties for the route I was on during any day. Delivery and commission routes.
good,"It's a very active place to work. Though they only get you onboard as a seasonal worker and if they feel like they don't need your service anymore, they let you go."
good,"Actitud de servicio."
good,"As an intern, you are limited to just summer time work. It is a 10 week program where you are given a project that you are solely responsible for. The pay is more than any other internship I have seen so far and the work involved a lot of warehouse management training and even warehouse physical work."
good,"Pepsi is a good company with high standards. It's a lot of hard work. If you're willing to put in the time and effort, they are definitely a good company to work for"

good,"Great environment, compensation, and work-life balance. The environment is very collaborative and fosters creativity. They also focus on maintaining employee health and well-being."
good,"Pepsi can be a great place. The pay and benefits are there, but you are going to work for it. The work is challenging, the hours can be long with a lot of heavy lifting. Not a lot of drama, everybody gets along and is friendly and are always willing to help out if they can. The summer is very busy, but business falls off in the fall and hours can be hard to come by in the dead of winter."

good,Very physically demanding work environment. The hardest part of the job is working with no air conditioning. The most enjoyable part was meeting different people of different backgrounds.
good,The pay at Gatorade is great. Your work/life balance starting out it somewhat rough. With lack of seniority you should expect 12 hour day and working 7 days a week. Other than that great place to work. Only leaving to work closer to home and get rid of the 1.5 hour daily drive 1 way.
good,Great place to work and support your family very family oriented and employee friendly been here 6 yrs and it the best exprience ive had and best company
good,There is no typical day at work in Human Resources.  Employees required different answers and attention based on the personality and need of the employee.  The hardest part of the job is to terminate an employee.
good,Each day is devoted to salary/payday first then driven reports concerning items paid to employees on a weekly basis.  Health insurance management is a constant necessity to ensure employee coverage is constant.
good,"Good company to work for, very dynamic environment, very fast, plenty of innovations. There is the opportunity to work in either division (foods or beverages), or in different locations across the country."
good,Pepsi provides a fair opportunity for advancement and gives all employees a enjoyable workplace environment.  My typical work day and work week combines both being in the office roughly 20% of the week while being in the field the rest of my time visiting customers in my pre-determined territory as a District Manager.

good,"A great atomsphere to work in. great place with amazing managers. "
good,It was an internship that opened my eyes to the word of supply chain. You are able to learn quickly under pressure. In most cases you'll have a team that will develop you.
good,Team atmosphere .FAST pace running lines and on time delivery. Sanitation is most important to customers and company. Good benefits and good pay and 401k.
good,..E\It was and exxciting opportunity working at PepsiCo throughout the day. Sometimes it could get rather busy and there was a lot of pressure some days. One of the best things about that was being able to experience new products before the hit the stores.

good,"Empresa ótima para trabalhar, com ambiente desafiador e agradável. Ótimos benefícios e ótima remuneração. Também boas oportunidades de desenvolvimento e crescimento interno."

good,Employees can learn a lot while at Frito-Lay. It is an ok place to work and raise a family. I have no regrets about having worked there for 18 years. There are some really nice people that I have met while working there.
good,Un trabajo que te daba libertad en trabajar pero cumplir 6 horas diarias era obligatorio.
good,"PepsiCo is a solid and secure work environment. Nice people, good culture, but the industry is undergoing lots of change and lots of consolidation resulting in nervousness from management."
good,"Grandes viagens de aprendizado, oportunidades de crescer na empresa"
good,"building pallets of Pepsi product"
good,it was a good experience to know what it was like to work in a big corporate company. the management helped guide the contractors on the right path and show them how the work needs to be done.
good,"As a PepsiCo employee, I enjoyed working and being in an environment that was valued in team development and keeping the area neat and clean as I worked. I learned to help others and visually keep my eye on operators as machine had breakdowns as I was a relief machine operator. The hardest part of my job was when an operator did not show any initiative to keep numbers up as needed. Other than that, working for pepsi was enjoyable."
good,I enjoyed my tenure with this company. I started working as a merchandiser that led to working on the reset team. Once I desired to make more money i inquired to work in the warehouse as a loader. I soon was promoted to a PAS position and after that into Sales.
good,I really enjoyed this job. I got along with the management. They all seemed friendly and very kind. Work schedule was a little off for the pay. A second shift. If a little more money would have been perfect. Even with the shift.
good,Great company with teamwork and incredible benefits.  Management is very supporting along with fun events and  food. Rewarding employees is important to the company. I would recommend  this company to work for.

good,"Buen nivel de responsabilidad, la gente muy participativa"
good,I was not an employee of PepsiCo but participated in a student experience through my university. I enjoyed my experience there and learned a lot of marketing and management skills.
good,"As explained previous.This accounts for all previous jobs as the company had taken the depot over and distrubution off the company."
good,"Pepsi was a great company to work for: starting off benefits and pay were excellent considering that I did not have a degree going in. Over all, I enjoyed my job during my eight years of experience."
good,Good it was a nice place of employment I just left based on hours and days of the week i work it didnt fit my schedule for the things had going on. Def good company
good,From the time you walk-in to an account expect to be very busy. You can learn a lot is such a short mount of time. The team managers are always available to help when needed.
good,I wish the job would not have ended.  I really liked the people that worked there.   It was a family style environment.  The organization  needed to run a leaner more efficient supply chain and I am not mobile so as a result I left the company.  I still talk to the employees that stayed and we are still on very good terms.
good,if you are looking to get in somewhere and hit the reset button this is the place.  Short term goals can be met with the income you get at this job.  The pay is weekly and that helps out if you have kids.
good,"Labor intensive job, ensured coming home at the end of the day feeling satisfied with the work accomplished. Great people to work along side, and enjoyment in getting to know employees and management through different stores. Seasonal work to come back to when things got busy."

good,"Ambiente bom de trabalho onde a logística bem aplicada fazia com que o trabalho progredisse, assim me adequei a organização e limpeza, a direção era de fácil acesso a porta sempre aberta para diálogos. A empresa buscava sempre a qualidade e sempre procurava agradar os clientes, o fator mais difícil era climático pelo fato de ser um galpão era quente mas a parte agradável era a união dos colegas para executar o trabalho e ao final do expediente saber que deu tudo certo."
good,"Always worked as a team, making sure no one is struggling alone"
good,When I took the Job at Pepsi They offered me pay that I was getting before and a little more. They gave me an incentive to relocate. The people I worked with were great our Lab Manager was awesome. I miss working for someone like her

good,"Buen ambiente laboral, estabilidad, prestaciones de ley."
good,"buen sitio para el trabajo , todo lo que viene siendo el ámbito laboral bien solo la cuestión de descansos es lo unció que no me agrada"
good,"This job pays great and keeps you busy. You work a four ten schedule Friday through Monday. Depending on your route, you work 2 to 4 stores a day. You must start at your first scheduled store no later than 3:30 am, but you can start earlier. Work load is heavy when things go on good ad deals, and/or holidays, which also means longer work days. Communication is great from management and from some reps who order the product into the stores. Meetings occur on average every 4 weeks where you can even sample new product releases and get stuff to help you do your job. I would recommend this job to anyone willing to work hard and put forth the effort."
good,Good company to work for and hours are available for those that are looking for 40 plus hours per week. There is room for advancement and opportunity for qualified candidate.
good,"The truck drivers were treated decent.  The trucks were kept up."
good,"Buena compañía, teníamos buena remuneración en caso de llegar a los objetivos, ofrecían ventajas a los empleados."
good,"Pepsi is a great company, with great benefits. The managers are understanding, and helpful. But when it comes to spending most of your days at work, and only bringing home $900 paychecks...it's not worth the time spent away from your family."
good,"Great place to work!!  However, very difficult to get promoted if your not part of the Campus Recruit program.  "
good,"Es una empresa seria, en donde se les dá a los empleados todas las herramientas necesarias para un buen desempeño laboral, así también como las constantes capacitaciones especificas de cada puesto."
good,"Great place to work, room for advancement, global opportunities. Outstanding team building and collaborative environment. Outstanding talent. Inclusive environment"
good,The only real problem I had was the job specifically. Pepsi is a good company but being a merchandiser was really taxing on my body. I would come home from work super tired and sore.
good,"Ambiente laboral agradable, trabajo estable, pago de nomina a tiempo"
good,"learn how to sell new products, how to overcome obstacles and rejections.  the company records everything you do in the computer and get audited twice a week."
good,"Have nothing bad or good to say about PepsiCo, but expect to do a job and not put yourself out there to get cut. High performance will get you fired. Being conservative will get you promoted"

good,"Empresa enfocada a objetivos, buen ambiental laboral"
good,Aprendes a tratar con la gente y llevar un evaluo dia adia de tus actividades.
good,decent group of guys to work with at all times. management can be a tad overly micro-managerial but seems to be as anywhere else. new guy comes in and thinks they're the best thing sliced bread... if you get the analogy

good,"Its a Good company to work with."
good,"buena debido a que habia oportunidad de crecimiento, consideraban al personal actualizandolo constantemente en los cursos que el area requeria, buena relaciones laborales etc."

Management was very good in the end.Very good culture was good.The hardest part of my job was waking up at 1am. in the morning having to go in for startup,working til 11p.m.having to turn around the same day and return at 10:30p.m.That was when I was on 3rd shift.My most enjoyable, time was when my shift had the highest percentage of all shifts."

good,Pepsico is an extremely enjoyable and fulfilling place to work. I have worked in a number of locations and I would rate them all as positive experiences.
good,I quite enjoyed working for pepsi it was always a challenge and always rewarding. never knew what was going to happen on a daily basis always changed. scene and direction
good,"I drove a junker of a fleet van (I was a Reset Specialist, Small Format) and brought it up multiple times that it looked like trash and drove terribly. There was never enough ""in the budget"" to even paint it. Never had an oil change on it in the 8 months that I drove it all over Western Michigan. Management is iffy. They pressure you to try and rat on other team members (everyone has a bad day or two). The brotherhood amongst the workers is tight. Only problems I ever had was between myself and management. Worst part was dealing with managers and supervisors at Pepsi accounts that took out their bad mood on you. Other than that and the iffy management, the independence and self reliance you need to succeed are great. If you're like me, you like counting on yourself to make sure the job is done right, and there is a lot of that at Pepsi. Not a lot of 'over-the-shoulder' type management. I was let go after being blamed for a hit-and-run in the fleet vehicle. Corporations are very predictable. If you want to succeed, work hard, and be super positive and cheerful to everyone around you, even if you have to fake it. Would've loved to stay if I had the chance."
good,"en un  día típico puede que haya mucho o poco trabajo, depende de la mercancía que te llegue y el pedido que hiciste. aprendí a tratar con la gente, ya que me ponía en contacto directo con los gerentes, para tratar asuntos de exhibiciones que correspondían a sus tiendas. lo que me gusto del trabajo fue que salíamos a buena hora, los jefes directos eran muy amables y comprensivos si tenia algún inconveniente."

good,"PepsiCo has some of the smartest coolest people you will ever work with.  Although there have been some challenging times within the industry, the combination of great leadership and great people gives you confidence that ultimately you will succeed."
good,"Forklift operator, Learned how to load 18 wheeler efficiently, management team was ok.  "
good,"The company is aggressive, provides  a lot of opportunity to learn and grow in your career.  However, it is a very young company.  With the exception of the most senior team, there are few older people in the company."
good,"work under with  good leader with lots up fun , good adviser to improve our profile , every day is new learning process no difficulties at all in any situation"
good,"Pepsico is always looking to bring technology forward in everything they do, which makes for an interesting work environment. I worked in the Innovation Lab and saw many really interesting projects from creation of mobile apps for sales staff to touch screen tech for conference room availability. I would have loved to stay at PepsiCo if it weren't for my position was merely a contract job for 30 days. It's nice to see 6 years later, my work still being utilized there."
good,"straight job, with a good schedule.The days were long and you cant really plan anything on the days that you work. if you have no family i recommend this job."

good,The process was simple. The pallet stacks were loaded onto the machine 3 at a time and one at a time I would load them into the depalletizer and have to watch the empty bottles come down the line in an upright position on the way down the line into the fill room.
good,buen ambiente de trabajo y me lleve muy bien con mis compañeros y supervisor.
good,"Pepsico is a great place to wotk."
good,Great fun and time flew but we lifted many thousands of pounds per day building custom skids of a variety of product for each route drivers truck. We had standing appointments with local chiropractor.
good,"Tiene muy buenas prestaciones, pero en cuanto a crecer dentro de la empresa si es un poco complicado."
good,"Pepsico is a company  offer for the employees a opportunity to grow  in your competencies in a 360 program, is a company focus is Results and is and constant global changes."
good,"Buena empresa,bien ubicada,transporte propio,buen sueldo"
good,They are willing to help you in your needs and share the knowledge they have. They are the fun to be with and they treat each other as a family not others.

good,"load and unload boxes and containers from or onto pallets trays, racks and shelves by hand or forklift. maintained a logged record of the products shipped to the vendors"
good,Provides endless opportunities for employees who are open to corporate challenges. This company also maintains a family-centered culture. It's amazing how this company is able to go on with the different programs despite limited resources. Employees are encouraged to think of productive and cost-effective ways to control the expenditures in their respective departments. Rewards and incentives are given to those who excel in their performance levels.   The Union representatives can initiate a conversation  with the management if requested without making a fuss. This is crucial in maintaining industrial peace in the company and our external customers as well.
good,Great job with a lot of opportunity for advancement even within the department I am in. Analysts are held responsible for their work but are not micromanaged. This is an energetic group. I will say that more recent changes has brought down the morale a little bit. I don't feel that my current manager is knowledgeable in the field but they are great with helping people get on the right career path.
good,Muito boa. Condições boas de emprego e uma boa remuneração.
good,"A tough place to work, as far as fast pace, and back breaking. A great place to work as far as pay and benefits. Thought I would retire from Pepsi, as I had twenty years invested, then the plant closed."

After just two weeks of working for Pepsi Co. the manager offered me a job running forklifts for twice the pay i was recieving. The only catch was I would have to stay and work instead of leaving to go to college. I refused the promotion explaining school was more important. I worked the morning shift from 6-2. There were times where I would complete so many orders in a morning that they would send me home early because the two other shifts would not have enough to come to work. Hardest part of the job was learning the computer system on my electric pallet jack. Heat is a factor that plays with the job, the warehouse did not have a/c and could reach over 110 degrees at times.

Once I got a feel of how the day would flow, I would begin to work on the many projects that I was assigned; from designing training manuals, organizing global conferences , scheduling video conference meetings, in addition to travel planning, expense report processing, and more. I most enjoyed the multi-tasking of my position. It was a challenge daily and it was rewarding to know that I could juggle the responsibility and overall get the job done with ease. I most enjoyed working with multiple teams because I was able to learn about different cultures and how people worked differently but still had the same goals.

good,"es un buen lugar para trabajar con muchas exigencias pero todo con muy buen beneficio , muxchas cosas de aprendizaje y el apòyo de la gente que esta alrededor"
good,"and willing to make needed adjustments to reach company objectives. The company and management encouraged the employees to utilize their individual skills in partnership with their training to maximize our work performance. The most difficult part of the position was sharing work space with the union drivers, obviously their position and attitude toward the companies objectives were not the same as ours. If there was one down side it would be a lack of standard procedure for incorporating defined guidelines when exercising a persons authority consistently."
good,"Supplying customers with products. One must be efficient. There's no ""I"" in team. The Hardest part of the job is making sure the customers have enough products. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting positive feedback from customers."
good,Working for pepsi is a privilage. Very hard work but stable. My only issue is id prefer to be assigned to a route rather then be unaware what ill be doing from one day to the next. Training is understandable. We all have to pay our dues. But in the end id like to have a more clear view of my day to day.
good,As a Part time merchandiser I work along side various different retail chains and stock there shelves with Pepsi Large array of products. As the second largest bottling company in America there is job security and room for advancement within the company.

I learn how drinks was produce and sent out, and the manager knew how to manage everyone and made sure your work day went fine throught out the day. The only hard part of the day was when the line jam up and you have to stop it and replace all the bottlers on the line, because it cut the run time down for the day."

Probably the most challenging part of this job was the amount of work load, however, it taught me to develop more organizational and time-management skills."
good,Currently in the deployment stage of the end solution. Traveling throughout the country to support regions with end-user training and on-site support.

good,"I just started so I'm still learning. My first paycheck was great.. it's good money. People have been there for years,  the men are very catty. Just come to work do your job and go home.. stay away from those who come up to you saying negative things about a 22 dollar an hour job.... it's not hard work.. Management is nice.."
good,"I have worked for pepsi as a warehouse worker for 4 years, and the management is great to work with, they allow use to do are jobs, without interference. I will say a down side for someone working for pepsi, would be the hours can really fluctuate, but that is something I like to have. ( You will have later nights during a holiday week)"
good,I enjoyed the time I was there working for them. The company is good to work for except some management decision that makes you question their treatment towards employees. I would be still working there if they did not change management team. The last team did not make it fun to work. Overall PepsiCo by itself is a good company to work for.
good,"Great place to work!  Culture supports family (or other) personal needs."
good,The company is very large and growing.  Family friendly company. Lots of training provided. Great pay and excellent benefits.  Some upper management can be difficult.

good,Great Company to work for. They take really good care of their employees. The Pay is amazing but the work is hard. They have great benefits. Overall 1.
good,"Great working environment. Management really cares and tries to work with you as best as possible."
good,"A good steady place of employment. Shift work is required and it may take some time before you see a day shift. However, the wages and benefits are great. Clean working environment and indoors."
good,Tbh the job is a great opportunity and is a career but starting in the warehouse is back breaking work tbh I wouldn't complain if we had to days off but we work 6 days out the week it wares on your body
good,Zat er als interim projectmanagers in de Europese organisatie.
good,"Very competitive salary "
good,Like most jobs we are paid on performance based duties. There are some areas of pay that could be more fair and job assignments don’t seem to favor seniority as most jobs do. Although seniority is used for vacation and required time off due to season slow down.
good,"Lots of teamwork involved - even in an analytical role, you are expected to collaborate with team members across the company. "
good,The management is well-order and a litle bit stress but I had learned more from that. Everyday of work is getting too much fun and exciting. The hardest part of my Practicum is too have more efficient time to finish work.
good,Driving for Pepsico is a hit or miss. Some people pick up on it right away while others quit almost immediately. It’s one of those jobs you have to give it time before everything clicks. It’s a tough job but very rewarding at the same time.
good,"Never a dull moment here!  Every day brings different challenges to be overcome.  There is a different solution for every situation and I have to decide on the best course of action to take in order to resolve it as quickly and efficiently as possible.  There is a lot to resolve, but I do get a lot of satisfaction in being able to successfully resolve all the challenges I face."
good,It was a great place to work. Hard work but pays well. Only thing was you would be too tired after work to do anything. Also on your days off youd be resting more than anything.
good,I was a field service tech in NJ. I was treated very well. Just like anywhere else I worked you have to come to work everyday and with a positive attitude.
good,Great opportunities to advance one's career with a strong CPG company. Strong brands and products with a focus on personal and professional growth. Highly competitive and collaborative culture.

good,Uma empresa com boa flexibilidade para os funcionários.
good,Great company to work for when I started. Now Senior Leaders are running the company into the ground. Constantly looking for ways to cut employment costs and outsourcing is now a regular practice. Love my job and the people that I work with but cannot grasp the thought process for the share holders who make the decisions in this company. They are reporting success based on flawed data and those of us in the thick of things know the truth.
good,pay could be better for the work that is expected. it is a good company to get started in but you do alot of manual labor for a drivers position  management is good and helpful and pay is good for some one starting out that wants to stay local.

good,I personally enjoyed the tasks included with this industry. It's good hard work. Everybody does the best they can but sometimes there's just more work than available hands and management does their best to understand that which I really appreciated.
good,A typical work day included making Gatorade and driving a forklift meeting the company numbers and work load.Also driving to meet our annual TE for the the region and local Buildings.

good,"Work was stimulating and allowed me to focus on the small stuff, something I have never had the opportunity to do before as a manager. I had worked for 12 years as a supervsior and manager and was always a jack of all trades master of none. This job allowed me to focus on one aspect, logistics, and really dig deep and allowed me to excel."
good,"very friendly, kind, approachable, funny, employees they will help you if you dont understand the work and they will treat you as one of them and they will treat you also like a family."
good,"The PepsiCo that I worked at was privately owned, so the party wasn't as good as a corporate branch of Pepsi. However the rules and structure was alot more relaxed, including uniform policy. You didn't have a boss or manager constantly hounding you, so it made you take responsibility and time management into your own hands. A sort of, ""be your own boss"" kind of feel out on the road. Great learning experience for prioritizing and micromanaging your workload!"
good,"I felt a strong family vibe coming from my coworkers, I loved the environment and I learned about time management working with them. the company helped me learn more about the insurance and outs of various parts or the boroughs"
good,"pepsi is great but you work on weekends and holiday as a driver merchandiser. You have freedom with no boss looking over your shoulder but working holidays, weekends and extended hours wear on you; especially when you may always be a driver with a. fixed pay rate."

good,Es una gran empresa que te brinda au apoyo y su hospitalidad
good,"I worked at PepsiCo in Holiday FL for 4 years. I was one of the top drivers and I say that proudly. In my first six months I planned to quit at least 100 times, the job was hard and I got off late everyday. After roughly 6 months everything began to come together and the job became simple. My recommendation if you plan to work for Pepsi is to remember your pick list, study your route, and as soon as you arrive at your stop you need to hustle. Don’t sit around, secure your brakes and get to work ASAP."
good,a typical day at work is picking your order with voice pick and until the minimal work is left for the night shift to finish. co-worker are very competitive when it come to trying to finish the job.
good,job allows for a high amount of autonomy as employees are for the most part unsupervised during their day. However tasks to completed carry high levels of importance which can add to stress for individuals not suited for high pressure situations.

good,Company offered an excellent training program. Each employee knew his/her role and how it affected the overall program.
good,"I was a contractor so I didnt work directly for the company, I was paid through a recruiting firm that pepsico hired. I loved going to work everyday and the people were nice. I just wished that they paid me more."
good,"stressful dealing with a large amount of cash daily and making sure your money balance at the end of day. The job is very challenge and it's a great experience, but the pay sucks."

good,Its a great place to work fast pace everyone works as a team the managers and the supervisor work with you to better your self threw out the company it is a place i would recommend anyone who wants to start a great career here.
good,"Pepsi Co of Marquette was a great place to work. The work is physically demanding, but that was of no concern to me. The crew I worked with was a great bunch of people and work was done smoothly. We would work 4 10 hour shifts a week giving us 3 days off, which was ideal to my busy life style. I would certainly suggest Pepsi Co of Marquette, MI to anyone who were to ask, as long as they were prepared for the physical aspects of the role."
good,Pepsi is a good company to work for. The people are good to work with. Lots of selling product in and making customers happy with the products brought in to the stores.

good,Responsible for shipping and receiving of product to customers and logistics of routes for all employees deliveries.  Great working environment and culture.
good,"Pepsi is a great job to have, yet it is very labor intensive and fast paced. If you aren't physically capable of working hard and fast, it may not be for you. However, if you can handle a very physical job, and can keep up with the fast pace the company expects, you'll do well. The pay and benefits are excellent."
good,En una oportunidad logre ser reconocido por mi jefe inmediato por alcanzar los objetivos de ventas y distribución numérica de un producto que a los demás vendedores le costaba negociarlo.

good,"Best Management practices"
good,Pepsico is a great company to work for management is great and so is the pay. Training was very helpful and well organized. Management listens to employee's and does a good job looking after their interests. The hours are difficult to adjust to however as they involve very early starts and are often very lengthy especially for new employees.

good,La empresa PepsiCo es una buena empresa laboral la cual me gusta por su buen ambiente d trabajo x los constantes cursos q nos daban para desenvolvernos para poder realizar nuestras negociaciones con los gerentes en tienda convivir con los compañeros en un ambiente tranquilo me gustaba mucho el acomodo d mi surtido d mercancía en los anaqueles realizar mis chequeos d caducidades hacer mis exhibiciones decorarlas manejar volúmenes en productos d galletas y botanas para alcanzar mis objetivos lo único q no me gustaba q trabajábamos en días festivos y domingos q son los días q podíamos estar con nuestras familias la empresa PepsiCo te da una buena calidad d trabajo pero en calidad d vida d nuestra familia estamos muy alejados es lo único pero es una empresa q tiene valores importantes para el trabajador y le doy gracias x esos 6 años q trabaje con ellos
good,Esta muy bien el trabajo solo q pies yrabaje en temporada mala
good,"Every day I have a route to complete with a previously loaded trailer. Over the years at Pepsi I learned how to safely load a hand truck to do the deliveries and how to load the 2-wheelers safely if the product goes up and or downstairs. Management and dispatch are phenomenal, you will feel confident talking to them for any reason good or bad news. Co-workers and dispatch are very helpful, if somebody is falling behind on their route they will help from taking stops from each other to make a route smaller and you can call anyone for directions if you are not familiar with an area. I think the hardest part of Pepsi is bumping the hand trucks up and or down narrow staircases that are spiral. The best part of Pepsi I feel is management and co-workers, I felt very comfortable calling anyone at any time and if somebody did not have an answer they would find somebody who does in a timely manner."
good,you have to work a of of hours but it's a fun place to work for a single person  not to much family time for a person with family

At two or three of those stores you with have seven or more pallets to work and organize the store and back room with. Daring the time I have been with the company I have leaned that a lot of the products that are in grocery stores are brat in by out side company's. Most of the time in this job you work by you self and only see someone else if the day you are having evolves twenty or more pallets that you have to work. This at the same time depends on if your manager has people floating around in that area. I would say the hardest part about this job is all the over time it takes to get the job done right but at the same time you do bring home some pretty big paychecks so it goes hand and hand. the most enjoyable part about my job is I do not have to stay in one store all day long, and on certain time of the year the company holds employee appreciation events were you get feed or win a prize for free. Over all I would say that Pepsi is a very good place to work even though some days the job does appear to be very over whelming and hard."
good,good place to work at in general but have few supervisors that make life at work uncomfortable at many times and don't get me wrong there is some good ones i'm just speaking on my experience

good,"Pepsi demeure une bonne entreprise cependant les derniere année les cadre de cette entreprise augmante continuellement le nombre de caisse livrée par chauffeur cela antraine beaucoup de grogne chez les livreurs qui non plus le temps de  servir les clients convenablement.Pepsi a abbolie toute les route a deux hommes,cela augmante le temps de livraison chez les clients qui sont plus difficile a effectuer."
good,"relacion de compañerismo, aprendi manejo de maquinas de envasamiento, podia acomodar mis horario al dejar cambiar de turnos ya que la empresa tiene horarios rotativos, el trato con superiores era bueno y cordial"
good,"I believe in every company having leadership. When I started it had it all, from team work to guideness.Today is nothing but beneficial to those who lead. I being with pepsi 1 year  and half  and it has being the one of the best place i have ever work. The drivers is what make this place awesome, they threat you with respect , they help you no matter who or where you come from. They go on a daily basic and and go the extra mile just bc they love what they do. They have all the right  to call themselves D-Bay drivers.I believe  takes very few men to do this kind of work. I see guy last a week and this is only during the slow season(Winter) .A day at pepsi can start as early as 4:30 am and if you  don't know what your doing it can go until 7-8 pm at night,and expect  to be back the next morning after your 10 hr break.What i enjoy at pepsi was the daily work, the job it self will keep you is shape and running. i had great costumers who treat me right, bc i give them what they needed and it was respect.I give them satisfaction in my work and in my trust."
good,I started working here as a trainee.  The next step was to get a route and learn to sell Pepsi vending machines.  I then progressed to bigger better routes.  lastly i was promoted to Territory Coordinator in charge of all of the routes in Greeley.  this company was very demanding but compensation was worth the work.
good,"Expect to work HARD. I start my day 6am and im finished around 2:30pm on certain days. Again, expect to work really hard but the good news you wont need a gym membership. You'll get a daily workout from the physical labor task you'll perform everyday. The pay is good and great benefits"
good,When I started I was promised a full time position but only received part time hours. Other than that great company. I'm still waiting for full time hours though.
good,"As a order picker at Pepsico beverages, the excitement of being employed by such a reliable employer was intriguing, My day consisted of at least ten hours a night of work, it was a fast-paced job with not a lot of space in the warehouse, Especially driving an about two ton forklift through a small warehouse, if you are not careful, it is easy to injure yourself and others. Other than that the work environment was somewhat healthy, great attitudes from co-workers and management. This made the team aspect of the job close and helpful like a family. The hardest part of working there was that you were constantly working throughout the week sometimes with no days off at all. But obviously this made the pay increase nicely, hence making my payday the most enjoyable part of my job."
good,I was only here for about 5 months. The people I worked with were great and so was the management.
good,"I checked in/out tractor trailer loads of product and supplies.  Worked rotating 12-hour shifts with a 30-minute lunch break, (unpaid).  Drivers would sign their paperwork and I would check their trailers for loaded product/dunnage.  Sometimes a very fast-pace work place and then other time a slower pace."
good,"I enjoyed working here for the most part. In the customer service department, us coworkers all got along and became family. I had an amazing director who made working there one of the fun parts. I loved being greeted in the mornings by her and she praised our team when she knew we had done well. I liked working in the office atmosphere and did my job well. I learned a lot by having Pepsi Midamerica being my first full time Monday - Friday job."

good,Long days but everyday there is something new.  Great people to work with.  The pay is low but it is a great place to learn.
good,A typical day at Pepsi. Jumping in full force when arriving   there in the morning and going full force all day. It was very interesting and the day went by fast. I learned alot about the beverage industry from when I first started  and as I worked my way up.  Its a fast paced industry with lots of important number's of how much of each flavor product that sold each day.  The sales department management style was very hands on. My co-works were great to get along with as well as team players and most of them had been with pepsi for 10 years+ so  they knew there jobs very well and were very good at muti tasking.  There was no hard part to my job as I had been there 10 years so I knew what needed done and got my boss everything he needed to get answers to his boss. The most enjoyable part of my job were the people and also to be able to say that I work for Pepsi Bottling Group.
good,Besides the long hours and intense work load. Pepsi was a good company to work for.

good,"This company has been extremely flexible with my unique life situation.  I have been able to work remotely for several years given my husband's employment, but have stayed connected with my teammates who are in a variety of locations across the country.  The team I am on has taken efforts to build skills within the team, network with teams across the company and keep our workplace fun and active.  I have learned how to take in criticism in and grow from it and give criticism in a way that builds people up.  Management is good.  I have had a series of managers that listen to what I have to say and act on the areas that I need their assistance with.  They have been responsive and given me room to test out my own ideas.  The hardest part of working for this company is the hard and fast rules that Human Resources places on promotion and raises.  Salary should be based on what an employee contributes to the company.  Unfortunately there are restrictions that are based strictly on a person's current level.  I started out right out of college at a low level position, but quickly showed my worth and ability to contribute by taking on and accomplishing tasks and projects that impacted large groups of people within the company in big ways.  I was performing far outside my level, but because of my level and salary start I could only be given a certain amount of raises, level increases etc.  If I had started with PepsiCo with my current experience I guarantee my salary and level would be much higher."
good,"Productive workplace, full of hard workers great company to work for to say the least."
good,Pepsi had a great support system in and out of the workplace. Anytime anyone needed assistance whether inside or outside of the workplace the employee always had management and his/her coworkers as support. Working at Pepsi was like working with family.
good,"I am a corporate finance professional with over ten years of experience, primarily in the food and beverage industry at PepsiCo. I have gained experiences with increasing levels of responsibility across diverse functions such as supply chain / operations, engineering and finance. I am currently the Sr. Manager of Financial Planning and Analysis (FP&A) for PepsiCo's Naked Emerging Brands, a sub-division focused on health and wellness brands consisting of Naked Juice, Izze Sparkling Juice and ONE Coconut Water.

good,"Empresa com diversidade grande de profissionais, rotina de trabalho bastante dinâmica, onde o funcionário tem autonomia nas tomadas de decisão. Alto investimento em capacitação dos funcionários e ambiente de trabalho agradável ."
good,like to move around and help out other fellow workers...I go out to set accounts and merchandise our pepsi product do rotation in cooler and chillers and also do promo and set up for sampleings..also assist in delivery and inventory..
good,"I worked there more than 8 years and I can easily say that it was one of the best places I have ever worked. It's a very faced paced and high demand job but the pay and benefits are very competitive. The hours are long, hard, and demanding."
good,very good company and very good colleague and excellent supervisors
good,"A typical day at work was be on time for my delivery. Stock my product where they was supposed to go. I've learned how to overcome objectives and understanding the customers needs. I worked in a good environment it was like a family. Most of the employees were their for more then six years so you got the chance to know them and their families. The hardest part of my job was waking up a 2:00 am every morning. The people I meet alone the way. The tools I learned alone the way. Management was good up until the last three years I was their, now its a training center for new managers trying to get in the door."
good,PepsiCo es una empresa con muchas oportunidades de crecimiento personal y profesional. Ayuda a establecer una buena red de contactos. La dirección cree en el trabajo en equipo y fomenta la proactividad y liderazgo en cada una.

La capacitación continua de su personal
good,They have a lot of opportunities to expand your customer service career.
good,average day is 9 hours from 6:30 to 4:00 get you interact with people for most of the day but you are responsible for handling your daily duties alone which is pretty cool dont really got to be bothered if you dont want to its alot of work but its cool if you want decent money and security. Management was excellent where i was working could talk to them about thing and if you were done wrong they would stand up for you. The most enjoyable part of the job is the freedom just you and the open road. The hardest part is the labor not all the time but if you can survive there you can work any where.
good,"A good steady job,and employees are treated fairly with good benefits."
good,empresa donde tienes futuro y te puede alludar a desempeñarte mejor en  tu trabajo
good,A typical day at work would be great if I had some work to do. I did learn sap. Co workers were nice with positive attitudes. Nothing wasn't hard about my job because I didn't learn anything. The most enjoyable thing was eating free lunches.

good,"Aqui unicamente sostenia una tienda a cargo ya que era responsable total de ella, iniciando a las 07:00 hrs y concluyendo a las 16:00 hrs. Iniciando el recorrido de tienda en general desde anaquel hasta espacios adicionales y enfriadores, rellenando primero linea de cajas despues area adicional terminando en anaquel, para darle la debida rotacion al producto para asi evitar la merma, ayuda a inventario y a pedido, limpieza, acomodo, cuadraje de toda nuestra mercancia, y mas.."
good,"A empresa é líder em diversos de seus segmentos e por esse motivo, existem diversos concorrentes fortes, então eram necessárias ações imediatas para combatê-los, como o Marketing de Guerrilha ou criação de incentivos relâmpagos capaz de superar as metas de vendas."
good,The job is very demanding of time and labor. It has great pay and benefits.But you do have to be able to wake up very early and lift heavy objects. The management at one point in time was probably the best I ever had in my work experience. But once that manager left it went from best to worse... Overall it is a good job but you have to have tough skin to stick it out 
good,Supervised my team to work effeciently and safely.  The work is hard a very demanding and stressful.  Make sure the work is complete by the end of the shift and that everything is ready for the next day
good,"Fast paced, busy from start to finish.  I learned to understand different cultures and abilities from a diverse workforce and customer base.  Made for interesting work, every day was fun and challenging.  Management was fare and strived for a health work life balance for all employees.  Hardest part of job would be when it came time to go home, I was usually in the middle of a complicated call and would stay until the issue had been resolved to the customer's satisfaction, even though it meant I would be working later than my scheduled end of shift.  Most enjoyable was sometimes the hardest.  I really enhoyed being able to help someone get back to being productive.  These people were always so grateful to have their issues resolved and able to get back to work so quickly."
good,"Category Analysis - Volumes & Value, CAGR, Growth Rate"
good,At Pepsico I had the opportunity to go from working at the reception to being a part of the Facilities and Office Services crew. It was amazing being able to work so closely with all the employees of the company and also help their department work the best way possible.
good,"Compañía líder mundial en la industria alimenticia. "
good,"My work day at Pepsi consisted of 10-12 hr days. Once you grew used to it , days flew bye. Management allowed you to learn as you go and informing you if you needed further information on a subject..trade-loss statements ...etc. We were all commissioned employees with a daily base wage plus commission. The Hardest part of the day for me as a driver was the traffic and as a worker was the constant tedious steps involved in my job. From matching Asset numbers to the Monies collection , to the inventory calculations  involved . Most enjoyable part was to get to the end of your work day and know that you gave 110% and you didn't skip any of the steps involved in doing the job RIGHT. Doing my job right and knowing I did a thorough job , doing the process correctly meant I had a clear conscience ...that I did the job RIGHT!"

good,"For the first ten months as a forklift operator, from building a pallet, finishing, hustling to the next, then loading pallets, was a great workout experience. One day, I wanted to try something new, and that was being a Sanitizer Tech in a different department. Being a sanitizer was a great learning experience, from learning all you’re cleaning and sanitizing chemicals, to knowing where to use it and how to use it, scrubbing, foaming everything, and running all the machines. Running the machines was the most technical learning event being at Pepsi. After good days work, on the following day, all you hear is good complaints and no one going to the hospital. The most difficult part about my jobs, was doing Millipore nights, and that consist of getting all sample from machine and running the cans thru the can line. My good days were when machines are down and won’t run until the following day, allowing me to go home early."
good,"En ese lugar de trabajo aprendi que el cliente es el numero uno para uno como provedor, siempre y en todo momento debemos de adquirir una posicion dominante en el mercado y hacer que el cliente tenga la plena confianza en el provedor ser una persona que le brinde un buen servicio al cliente, tener una mision,una vision,y unos valores que nos rigan"

good,job can be long hours and a lot of lifting but it was a good company to work for.
good,"Being the warehouse supervisor, my day started at the end of the first shift, and ended when the second shift work was done. In other words, long days/nights. My professional growth was strengthened while I was there. You learn how to handle many different situations, varying from employee conflict to product distribution. Problem solving is key. Having a good productive crew is vital. Meeting deadlines is also very important. In summary, if all of these factors are addressed, your night should go fairly well."
good,Pepsi is a great company to work for. Lots of oppurtunity for growth
good,"Great company, steady hours and geat benifits. being able to work in a fast pased enviornment and be appriciated is a wholesome feeling"
good,Enjoy working for company ..safe and comfortable work environment
good,I had a good expierience with Pepsi because the managment was some of the best u could work for. I guess when u have good managment for the first 5 years of working expierince u hold everyone else to a higher standard. Even though it was a physical place of employment is seemed to go off without a hitch. I can only speak for myself but that is a company that I would go out of my way for and take the extra step for the customer.

good,"This is not PepsiCo , this is a privately owned , family owned company . Just a really good group of people . Work hard and the sky’s the limit ! "
good,It was a good internship where I learned a decent amount about production and how a major company works. I would suggest this internship to someone who is trying to get their feet wet.

good,This job was probably one of my favorite places to work. It was a very safe environment and everyone is super nice there. And the benefits were second to none. The reason I left was I was at the point where I really couldn't advance any further unless I switched departments. Overall a very good place to work

good,Overall good place to work but non salary employees really bare the brunt of any bad situation in the plant. I don't think as a salary employee I can fairly evaluate the overall conditions at the floor level
good,"Super basic heavy lifting. Easy job and most of the people you interact with are amazing. The store managers can be a pain sometimes though if you're not fast enough but for the most part it's great. I guess I just wasn't fit for the job because I wasn't preforming well and I had a hard time keeping up with standards, but if I could I would go back."

good,Very challenging but fulfilling work.  Tremendous amount of opportunity for advancement and progressive learning.  Autonomy to make your own decisions.
good,"A typical day at work included exporting new orders, for coolers/vending machines, to a routing system, creating daily routes, importing them back to the original system, and then confirming a scheduled date with the customer to receive, move, pick-up, or exchange equipment. There was a specific script that we needed to follow when we confirmed with the customers.  I learned how to work with my field partners and create relationships with them over the phone rather than in person. This was new to me because I'm used to working with individuals within the same vicinity as me. I also learned how many moving parts there are in a supply chain. Before this job, I never knew how much work was put into placing equipment at a store. The process starts with sales speaking to the customer to make a sale, orders for equipment are then created, equipment has to be available, I then schedule the equipment, equipment is prepped and then sent to the warehouse, and then the drivers and field team place the equipment. If everyone doesn't do their part in the process, then we fail as a team because ultimately the customer is the one who is disappointed. The customer is the top priority and we all needed to work as a team to get the work completed quickly and efficiently. In regards to management, they provided advice when I had questions and was there to support me when I needed backup during certain situations. I would say that the hardest part of the job was sitting all day. Other than that, the work was challenging at times but nothing that wasn't too difficult. The most enjoyable part of"
good,"The work at Pepsi was hard but rewarding. If you used the selling tools and the coaching from the management team the job would be very Rewarding. The easiest part of the job was working with the customers. The hardest part of the Job was being a loner you had to be a team player to really be efficient, and learn the ins and outs of the job."
good,I had the chance to be part of PepsiCo Switzerland and have enjoyed the people and environment. Working conditions and salary are up to the task and have wonderful benefits for working at home and flexible hours. Could be improved the social life among the employees but I guess the country we are living in is not as open and warm as others. A little sad. Overall? go for it!
good,Continuous operations and twelve hour shifts can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on family needs.  Compensation was great and the Coworkers were awesome.  Management on track to succeed and support employees in their work.
good,"Very fast paced, management is nice and understanding. they expect you to be able to throw 200 cases within your first 90 days. its harder than it sounds. they should offer more help or training for those that are close but not quite there."

Some days are so busy that the day is gone before you know it. The skills that are passed on are of great benefit. You are teamed up with a trained person and they pass on the knowledge. Management is great, friendly and very easy to approach and they also have the ""no such thing as a stupid question"" policy which should be in all working environments. Hardest part of the job is knowing that your enjoying your job that the time is passing quickly and that your contract is coming closer to an end as they mostly take only temps."

After that i start  merchandising .Displaying and rotation of the product is the important part of my job.Management is always there to answer my job queriers and customer complaints.Pulling the heavy skids with the normal pallet jack from the back room to product sales floor is the hardest part of my job.No one bossing around me when i work."
good,"a typical day at work consisted of registering myself first thing when i get there, and then i would go to my office and start checking the incentive dealers bills. later i would register them into an 'entry book' and after calculating their deals within that month i would create sampling vouchers. at first i had to learn how to code the dealers name in 'entry book', after that many other challenges were faced, another one of those challenges were that every day i had to check all of the salesman's sales form and confirm that they are correct by using the ;entry book' as a reference. every day i had different statistics i had to check, and at first i found that rather difficult but later it became an every day routine. i personally assisted the accounts manager, who was really supportive and helped me get a grip of all of the work i had to do as assistant, all of the co-workers were super co-operative and didn't hesitate to help one another. initially we had near to 101 salesmen coming in daily and each of them were always in a hurry, therefore it was complicated trying to work under pressure whilst calming the salesmen down. overall, i enjoyed all aspects of my job and easily overcame most of my daily challenges and i definitely learnt a lot from my experiences there."

good,"On a normal day I began around 5am to head to the office at the plant in Uncasville or head to my first stop on my schedule. Before work even started my first job was to meet with the store manager or assistant manager in order to see what needed to be done for the day at that particular stop. Work on a typical day included taking stock of what was empty on the shelves, checking displays or making a display if needed, taking inventory of what was available in the back and restocking the shelves with what was available. After restocking was complete, I had to place orders if needed for the store and than I ended the day by confirming with the store manager than I was done and asked if anything else was needed. After I proceeded with the rest of my schedule. My manager and boss were easy going at times and very understanding with the work load that had to be done and were lenient at times when it was needed. Co workers were very helpful and open for advice and if they were available they wouldn't hesitate to help. The hardest part of my job was dealing with store managers at times and the work load. Store managers wanted everything done in a timely manner, however they expected everything to be done perfectly and there were sometimes lists of things they wanted done in my limited time frame. It was hard to juggle their demands and still be on time for my next stops or else the managers at my next stop would be unhappy that I was getting there later than expected. A bad start to my day meant a bad rest of the day because I would be constantly behind schedule trying to fix and deal"

good,"As I say in the summary, this job is not for everyone. While anyone can come into a position here and perform, any position here requires the right type of mentality. If you're coming into a position with this company, know this: If you're willing to give the job what it requires, you'll not only do great, but people will notice. The overarching beauty of my time at Pepsi is that those who put the work in get noticed. It is a rewarding place to work and well worth the effort."

good,"My original opportunity with PBG was in the shipping warehouse. I stepped into this position with the intention of eventually moving into sales. Once a position opened up and I had worked in my department for the required minimum amount of time, my managers were more than willing to help me advance into a position in sales. Though the days were very long (12-14 hours), I learned so much about the grocery industry as well as tightening my sales and customer service skills which brought me to a whole new level."

I really enjoyed the opportunity and challenge of applying and posting payments accurately. It allowed me the opportunity to investigate payments in question, deductions made on payments, etc. I found it enjoyable to search for and find the short cuts; thus allowing me more time to be sure of my accuracy. Management let you know what needed to be completed daily and you got it done. Co-workers worked together to complete all work daily. I never really considered any part of my job hard. Sometimes time consuming, that's about it."

good,Work consisted of giving out the daily workload to my merchandisers and ensuring that they were able to complete the work given to them. in addition I also needed to ensure that each of my accounts had an adequate amount of product to maintain sales throughout the week. In performing my duties I learned the skill necessary to promote an Increase in sales and continue to build the company name. The most challenging part of my job was having to react quickly and put to rest any issues that may have occurred on a day to day. However it was also perhaps the most enjoyable part of the job. Being able to constantly evaluate a situation and achieve a solution was one of the many skills learned during my time with this company. 
good,"On a typical work day, I woke up at 6am to start my shift. I went from store to store on my routes. Merchandising and growing relationships with store clientele. Unloading/loading our product from the back room to the shelves. Setting up seasonal displays with our product, which included lifting over 50 lbs of weight a day. Very reasonable breaks along with cool co workers and management. The best part of the job is reasonable scheduling, benefits, paid mileage, and weekly pay periods."

Work hard and you get amazing benefits. They do ask quite often for you to help other stores making your day a lot longer but it’s optional so that means more money to make. It’s a good job overall, the rsrs do try to relax on you."
good,"It was nice working with Pepsico. In the future, I will again want to work with Pepsico. The management was always trying to motivate the lower employee on floor."
good,"Working as an intern in Pepsi-Cola Products Philippines, Inc. (PCPPI) was a great experience for me. My supervisors as well as other co-workers never made me feel as if I am in the level of ""just an intern"". They treated me as if I am already a regular employee. Definitely, in terms of growing professionally, PCPPI will never fail you."
good,"Out of all the jobs I've worked at, being a merchandiser at PepsiCo is the most perpetually redundant. Every day is the same boring pattern of stocking shelves at different stores. There is absolutely no variety in day to day work schedule aside from occasional holiday rushes. However, the benefits of being a merchandiser aren't bad. If you are okay with mindless repetitive work then it might be for you."
good,The most  enjoyable part of the job is to work from anywhere you want. The company new bound you for anything. Work is good for your mind. Management of the company is very effective.

Working smarter and not harder was the key to making a day flow easier. Management was top notch and was willing to give a hand to anyone who needed it. Many times I've had a member of management roll up their sleeves and help me merchandise product if I needed some extra help. All employees seemed happy and enjoyed working there.

good,This job was a great job only problem was that it was seasonal. The nights were basic you would come in get yourhead set grab your standing forklift and wait for management to let you know what had to be done that night and who was were. Management was awesome  they were very involved and coworkers were very easy to get along with.

good,I start by taking items that are not in stock out of stock in the computer so that they can not be picked by the employees.  I get everything set up so that I am prepared at 2pm when the shift starts.  This includes getting all necessary items for the workers.  After the shift has started I run the dock and make sure that pallets are being certified and that the work is being done properly and loaded correctly.  I certify that all the trucks are loaded with the correct amount of pallets.

good,I would say the hardest part of the job is the lack of communication between databases. This makes getting a task done almost impossible. Pepsi should definitely work on streamlining all databases so that they flow into one another and work with each other.

good,"I had an amazing manager with 30 years experience. Our team did not have a culture of excuses and falling short of our responsibilities. This was difficult at first because I had been in teams where things were not up to scratch, so it was a shock to the system. I ended up loving it, however, because when the expectation is high, and you meet it, there is incredible freedom when you know you've done things properly and are continually meeting the deadlines/targets/expectations you can rest assured you are doing the right thing. Great team, great management, and this job have set the agenda for my career moving forward. I'll always be grateful, as I started as an RSR and worked very hard for just over a year before I was promoted and honoured for my work and now have a much better outlook on job prospects and career progression.

What I did enjoy about this joy is the benefits, and my co-workers."

Or we would have to stay and think of the best way to stock over 500 cases of pop with all the kinds of pop in the right area's within an hour so we could get to the next drop on time. The thing I most enjoyed from working at Pepsi was defiantly learning a bunch of different ways to do the job ""the best way"" from all the different drivers I got to work with, that was all so a bonus just because they all viewed the job differently and it was neat getting different views an different ways of thinking and just all around getting to know each driver."

good,I was there for over 3 years and loved it. They were great people great benefits and meet a lot of great people that are still my friends today. Just management would sometimes be difficult
good,was a great experience and a fun busy environment great team work learned a lot about such a big organization how it run and how important each individual is to one another
good,Muy buena empresa en cuanto al trato y sus descansos
good,"PepsiCo is a great company to work for. The more flexible you are, the greater opportunities you will have. It is always important to get connected internally and build relations to grow faster."
good,No real complaints. Great benefits cool co - workers. Lots of turn over at mgr role. Other wise a great company to work for. Just be ready to break your back
good,Empresa muito conceituada porém existe um acúmulo de função sobre o funcionário.
good,Şartları güzel calicilacak bir yer tavsiye ederim.
good,"Excelente lugar para trabajar "
good,"best place to learn and work with different types of machines such as filler machine, conveyor belt, and mold machine. excellent people to work with that have tremendous experience and expertise"
good,Pepsico really takes care and treats employees well. they supplied uniforms. coworkers are very helpful to each other. managers are supportive and considerate
good,Empresa donde más cómodo me sentí dentro de mis funciones en los procesos de producción. Destacada organización interpersonal. Avanzada tecnología de fabricación.
good,"I am only seeking closer employment. With close to same pay, options to move up. I live in Columbus and driving to the north west side of Indy. I enjoy driving, but I also enjoy fast pace hands on work."
good,PepsiCo is amazing.. wish I were a permanent employee and not a contractor.  Contractors are treated like contractors.  Otherwise it is a diverse and makes the effort to in life other cultures
good,Its a job to get paid but follow another career. very Difficult to move up. everything is fast pace and constantly gotta meet your numbers ..always having meetings
good,Working at this job helped with my social skills and it taught me patience and at this job it helped me build Acquaintances and friendships that I know will be with me for a long time
good,"Great job. Drop and hook. Great equipment. Great benefits. "
good,"estuve en el area de chofer vendedor en gamesa, "
good,Only one thing I would change about Pepsi is the management staff should go through some type of team building classes to help with communicating with their staff
good,"Lugar com um ambiente muito bom, aprendi sobre gestão, atendimento, serviços!"
good,Pays well to much over time can be very stressful at times but there are cool perks and you get a lot of freedom they drug test at plant UA and you have to have your own car.
good,Awesome job for one with good time management skills.Front line management leaves a lot to be desired. Anytime the manager/supervisor tells me how much they work I get concerned.
good,"I’ve done all the positions on the union side. Yes it’s a union job. Great pay. Tough work. But once you get settled it’s second nature. Good people in and around you. Have integrity,if you screw up admit to it."
good,"I am part time worker at PepsiCo. I drive from store to store. It is the fun to  work though the hard part of my work is to arrange the back-stock in the store."
good,"More of a work life, then having balance but very well worth it at the end of the day. It is a huge load of work but is possible to finish and meet their expectations. Fast paced, delivering, stocking, ordering and organizing to their standard schematics."
good,Excelente ambiente muy buen trabajo con motivaciones diarias pero lo unico malo es el horario es demaciado extenso y no deja tiempo suficiente para una buena calidad de vida con la familia
good,Could be better mangers in satellite locations and that rolling 12 month is crazy they need a system where good attendance fall off after 3 months....
good,"I loved the pay, but the schedule was hectic. I enjoyed the job at first, but once everyone resigned due to the store schedules. The job got very difficult, we had to cover extra stores, and work a lot which impacted my schedule for schooling."
good,Buena empresa pero hay jefes prepotentes salario muy bajo y contrato por año
good,"This was a 1-year contract with an emphasis on providing a more efficient, effective dispatch solution using a new software called Roadshow.  It was a challenging and rewarding position that I was happy to have been a part of."
good,good place to work. it is hard working. very fast pace ever. summer days are hard but the winter days are easy and slower. great place to work. must be willing to lift a lot
good,"PepsiCo is full of talented individuals that work hard and play hard.  The culture is based around achieving world-class results, and pushing yourself and your team to accomplish this.  You need to have a strong work ethic to succeed."
good,Love the company - worried about down sizing.  I have been there many years and there have been may la offs in teh past few years so I want to see what options I have for other opportunities.  Pepsi has been wonderful to me in supporting my family but they are cutting out the administrative support and I need to keep my options open.
good,Es un lugar bueno para trabajar por sus horarios y dias accesibles
good,Pepsi was awesome and I worked very hard and long hours but loved it until it became micro-managed to the point it was no fun and hard to put up with on a daily basis. We were far more profitabl and proficient and achieved far more when we were family oriented. Now employees tell me they are just a number and easily replaced as well as the overall sales in the bulk stores have decreased due to the low moral and work ethic related to the micro-management style. Pepsi Grand Rapids has suffered due to a city corporate mentality- family became numbers and sales were lost as a result - maybe it’s time to rethink???
good,"healthy Environment but looking for new opportunity."
good,"lo que mas me gusto fue estar en una sola tienda, compañerismo"
good,"Excelente empresa para trabajar. Proporciona a sus trabajadores buenas herramientas de trabajo, trata de mantener el balance vida trabajo, se ocupan de la familia y siempre busca dar lo mejor de lo posible. Se valora la flexibilidad de horario y el flex place y flex friday."
good,I loved Pepsi because the pay was pretty good for a single Mom to maintain and good insurance. It got to be too much of a work load for one person with all the travel involved. The hardest part of the job was trying to get all the work done on truck delivery days. All store managers wanted their store done first or at a certain time. With no help it was very stressful.
good,Leuke baan alleen is bijna alles in 3 ploegendienst en als dat niet gaat is er niets anders
good,It is totally a corporate company. The management team is professional. Pepsico has real values those embedded in the work environment.
good,Hard work but good pay. We had plenty of breaks. Off on the weekends. The benefits were amazing if your single harried ur with a family. Definitely able to move up.
good,"Fiquei de trabalho na empresa durante 5 meses, e nesse tempo tive uma boa comunicação com os integrantes de grupos."
good,This company offers many opportunities to develop your career. A collaborative and competitive environment is remarkable in this organization. It is a very dynamic workplace.
good,"Jornada de trabalho normal de um dia de trabalho "
good,"My years working at PepsiCo company has been a rewarding experience; I have learned a great deal on how Corporate America works. Some areas of the job was very challenging, while some of it was enjoyable."
good,"manejo del sistema sap"
good,Healthy and Fun place to work. Many Type 'A' personalities. Very open to ideas. Work environment/culture is pretty intense and you need to be a not 9-5 type of person.
good,"Trabalhar na Pepsico foi uma grande experiência que vou levar comigo. Aprendi muito com meus colegas de trabalho nas dinâmicas em grupo."
good,"Excellent atmosphere and a management style that makes one feel appreciated. However, I felt that I was unable to advance in the company without a degree."
good,"Uma ótima empresa com excelentes benefícios, porém faltam processossss"
good,"Fast pace work atmosphere with high demand to strive for improving performance and work related aspects as a job. Professional environment with dedicated individuals that push to elevate all staff to achieving results."
good,Empresas que tienen un nivel bueno tanto en lo laboral como en el dinero
good,"great pay long hrs no time for home and family but they have a lot of bbq and lunches and no cheap food!!and lots of prize give aways and money,you work monday through friday and you might get 70-90 hrs a week you will bring home a 1000 dollars or close to it every week even a reg 40 hrs check  is nice but you get two weeks vacation ands 10 points"
good,"Local super tranquilo de se trabalhar,há possibilidades de se crescer"
good,"No tie required, very casual. Managers seem to change very frequently. Some better than others. Compensation was very good, benefits were standard. Technical learning was dependent on the project."
good,This job was secure and flexible. The managers are ok. They try to work with you on certain things but the sometimes have no consideration. I still recommend this job.
good,"Buen ambiente laboral"
good,La inseguridad en las rutas de venta juega un papel importante para el sano desarrollo del trabajador
good,"Overall,  a great experience and one that I wouldn't trade. I enjoyed my time at Pepsi and value all that I learned there. I still have friends who work there and maintain contact with them."
good,"This job will teach you to sacrifice common comforts to earn anywhere from 450- 850 a week based on how many hours you work. Prepare to work a lot of overtime hours, however you will be compensated for those hours."
good,"I like working  at Pepsi as an individual, because the money I made was good. I would make sure that my job was completely done daily as I was scheduled on my work days. The pay was phenomenal and the job gave you all the opportunity to make as much money as you want."
good,Pepsico France est une belle entreprise avec un apprentissage intense et diversifié
good,"É uma empresa grande, onde pude aprender muito com  principalmente a minha equipe, tive conhecimento que abrangeram diversas áreas não só apenas administrativo, tinha contato direto com o publico que era os colaboradores da empresa e fiz o estava ao meu alcance pela empresa."
good,This was a good place to work and a good job. Driving simply didn't turn out to be something that was the best career for me at this point in my life.
good,long hours work and home life is not reasonable takes a well fit person to endure this work everyday working 60 plus hours a week. hard working job and need to have plenty energy to go up and down the truck all day to deliver soda and much more.
good,"Ambiente laboral sano apegado a los valores de la compañía. "
good,"was good work with nice teamwork especially the supervisor, I learned alot there, in addition to making good relations, plus knowing much about the management and working with others."
good,I've worked for PepsiCo for 8 months and it was a very interesting and satisfying experience. It was a part time job and there were no full time jobs available. I'm looking for a full time job with consistent miles and fair wages and benefits.
good,"Great place to work overall.  While it is competitive and requires much of you, the experience is very valuable.  There is some work life balance and work from home.  Compensation is better than most and the benefits while expensive are far better than other organizations."
good,"A MNC with highly Professional Management and Staff. "
good,"Muy buena empresa para laborar, un poco absorbente pero en general muy buena."
good,I retired after 25 years of service. I enjoyed interacting with the employees that got to be my family. I enjoyed the type of work that I did in both production and warehouse.
good,Was top District Sales Leader in USA in 2006. My team of 12 finished # 1 in the country. Had great salesmen in District that went above and beyond what was expected of there role
good,I enjoyed my co-workers at PepsiCo.  They were among some of the most intelligent  people I have ever worked with and this includes my family at FedEx.  I was treated well and treated other well.  It is a very fast paced environment that will challenge you to make fast - high dollar decisions based on the facts at that time.  The opportunity to advance was another thing I enjoyed at PepsiCo.
good,Pepsicola de Venezuela es una empresa que te brinda desarrollo profesional cuyos valores y principios están muy arraigados y en donde el trabajador es parte fundamental de la organización
good,"Estar en el puestode trabajo cinco minutos antes. no detener la maquina por nada.  esperar relevopara poder ir al baño, solo dos veces x turno.  estartodo el turno de pie.  toda la atencion en el producto y luego en sus envases, etc."
good,"Carregava e saia para vender os produtos, aprendi muito nessa empresa, o ambiente de trabalho era bom."
good,Great company to work for. Allow you to run routes as if you are an independent owner. If you don't mind early mornings and some late afternoons could be a good fit for you. Great pay.
good,Warehouse for four years then became a driver for six (was)a great job then there was no more sales drivers made us all just delivery then went hourly large pay drop
good,"One of the easiest jobs ive ever had. I always like jobs where I can get a list of things to do, do it on my own and go home and that's exactly what my job does. I like to be independent and on my own and work at my normal pace"
good,"Aprendi a me desenvolver profissionalmente e pessoalmente."
good,Empresa muito boa de trabalhar com possibilidades de crescer na empresa
good,"Good work environment, Great compensation and flexibility. The benefits are nice as the empployees are covered under the Brewer's Union. Overall I am happy with the company."
good,Good place to work as it helped me a lot to build my career from where I started 25yrs ago in the IT field. Always remember my management team which stood behind it's employees all the time.
good,I worked up to five hours a day for five days a week. I gained a lot of business and professional skill from working here. The workplace is very welcoming.
good,"Clean environment, descent wage, just the employees that have been there for 10+ years are very rude and think a new employee is not willing to work or knows nothing because they do not want to show nor help those how are trying to learn the job. Need to have better trainers who wants to be helpful with training a new employee."
good,Malas condiciones en unidades y la imagen no ayuda
good,Fun and productive place to work. Fast pace and it changes daily. I have been there for over 16 years and I can see myself retiring from the is company.
good,"mi trabajo es bastante acelerado "
good,"A empresa Pepsico do Brasil, é uma empresa multinacional, gostei muito de trabalhar lá, o trabalho em equipe é muito importante para a empresa."
good,Lástima que se trabajaba x temporada tenía de todo..
good,excelente empresa para trabalhar como motorista carreteiro.
good,I liked working there but I the company and I had a disagreement on working hours so they replaced me. It's hard work in the summer and the winter holidays but the rest of the year it's not to bad. You often work alone but you'll be in contact with the store employees.
good,"Eu queria ficar , mas que pena que só foram 3 meses. Muito bom para trabalhar."
good,"El trabajo en ventas es retador pero te da muchas satisfaciones se aprende mucho siempre cada día y  y te dq la oprinodas de ser util ,servir y ganar dinero por tus accones.  Es un maestro para subir las escaleras de la vida y ser cada día mejor ."
good,"Gostei muito, pois foi onde eu cresci na vida, mas o salário caiu e tive que sair."
good,"A highly motivated and leadership skills having a degree bachelor of science and business administration major in marketing management."
good,"pepsi is one of the best jobs i have every had honestly, but you have to be willing to work in the rain snow sleet and hail because the days you are schedule to work you go work"
good,buen ambiente de trabajo había compañerismo el único detalle es que contratan a mucha gente por muy poco tiempo y
good,Término de contrato..siempre fue un buen ambiente laboral.y con todas las prestaciones
good,"compartir con su gente muy cariñosa y amable, PepsiCo fue mi primer trabajo una gran escuela en todos los terminos tanto profesional como personal, la direccion de la gerencia muy organizada, con mis colegas la relacion fue extraordinaria, lo mas retador de trabajar en PepsiCo fue al principio el volumen de trabajo sin embargo ello me enseño y me dio las habilidades que hoy dia tengo, lo que mas me gusto es su ambiente de trabajo"
good,"aprendí bastantes cosas aunque el ambiente fue un poco pesado, lo mas importante es estar concentrado en lo que había que hacer para que el trabajo rindiera."
good,working here was very pleasant other than the shortage of people which are willing to work these days. The work is very hard and the hrs are long if you are looking for family time.
good,Great place to wok bad management! I worked for this company for over a year great perks! Tons of vacation time. Lots of parking available. Drive was  little rough with the new company's coming in.
good,Great company to work for. Working in production I gained valuable warehouse & bottle experience. The process of keeping & maintaining clean beverages was something valued a lot by the company.
good,"It was ok the benefits and pay was great. Management was horrible no matter the rank. Good place to work though "
good,"Excelente empresa para trabajar, enseñandote los programas de gestión y buen ambiente entre compañeros y gerencia."
good,"Dynamic and fast paced environment"
good,"Uma empresa agradavel de se trabalhar."
good,"Uma ótima empresa, com uma boa infraestrutura e localização. Um ambiente agradável de se trabalhar e uma equipe ótima para se crescer e alcançar os devidas metas."
good,"I loved being a temp there & learning new things. was a great place to work & my shifts went quick, pitty it was only a temp role"
good,"Worked in Pepsi's refurbishment department my entire ten plus years with the company. Great work atmosphere and many opportunities for advancement in job title and compensation."
good,"Empresa otima de se trabalhar , com funcionarios completamente dedicados e com grande possibilidades de subir de cargo !"
good,"great place to work, great culture and great employee relations with everyone at work. it was a consulting project at school to assist pepsico on human resource issues."
good,Great place to work for. Lots of training is available Co workers are team players. We are a family. A pleasure to work here.
good,PepsiCo is a great place to work and provides an awesome work life harmony. The culture is very diverse and it feels more like family than a job at times.
good,"Empresa onde adquirir conhecimento como também passei conhecimento , aprendi trabalhar com rotas , trabalhar com sistemas  de nota e conviver em um ambiente de trabalho em grupo ."
good,"I repaired coolers and vending machines, drove forklift, kept parts inventory, and trained new employees. The company had a lot of food and contests and treated us all really good.The hardest part of the job was moving the machines by hand on and off of pallets. The best part was how the company treated us."
good,The job I had was very productive and rewarding. We did shipping. I worked on an assembly line and was a bale operator.  I learned that working as a team made the job fun and productive. Management was more than ready to help each employee. The best part of the day was when I met my goal of warehouse responsibilities. Things were never boring at Pepsico as we were always busy and that made the day go faster.
good,"Mi trabajo era ir directamente a la zona de venta,realizar el recorrido vender todos mis productos, agregar la mayor cantidad de clientes posibles,mantenía un contacto diario telefónico con mi supervisor y colegas,lo mas difícil era que todos los pedidos salieran completos,pero fue una experiencia laboral satisfactoria."
good,Superb.. This was my first job.. So whatever I learned from here only. All team & staff was very supportive. Excellent work culture. Good Career growth. Ample opportunities to explore more.
good,"Pepsico was a great place to work.  However, the balance between work and life was unbalanced to the point that it was difficult to pursue higher education."
good,There is very low rate for advancement in this area. Work is easy and company provides vehicle and cell phone. Just want to be able to move up in the company and that is hard for this area.
good,"Pepsico se caracteriza por ser una empresa enfocada en su Capital Humano, enfocada en el logro de los Objetivos reforzando La Calidad y la satisfacción de los clientes como los elementos más importantes en la fabricación de sus producto, cada día es un proceso de aprendizaje por lo dinámico de sis procesos y particularmemte en Venezuela por las legislaciones laborales."
good,"Los jefes eran accesibles, se preocupaban por la seguridad de los empleados, nos indicaban que tareas íbamos a realizar en el día,nos organizaban para poder ir al comedor, y era muy ameno la hora de"
good,Es una empresa grande el buen manejo de las areas de los señalamientos los compañeros no son tan agradables en psrticular es buena la empresa
good,"Aprendi vários processos, o SAP um conhecimento que sempre quis e conquistei."
good,seria buena por que para ser una empresa de clase mundial le falta mas capacitacion a su personal
good,"Would go in at 3:00-4:00 AM and work till 5:00 PM "
good,This job kept me busy. I learned different skills here regarding basic warehouse work. I liked mangement and it was an  good job.
good,"Great place to work, management really listens to your needs.  Hardest part is all the driving and wear and tear on your car. I enjoy meeting different people."
good,Pepsi is a very respectable place to work and they were very flexible and accommodated to my needs. I liked that they let me take off during Winter and Summer breaks and when I came back it was as if nothing had happened. Every employee is very nice and very hard working. My managers offered me work whenever I was available which helped keep me busy and helped me pay my rent.
good,its a busy job - heavy lifting and long days.  Great management that always tells you where you stand.  Work independently with most co-worker contact via email and cell.
good,"I  associate with an organization having challenging work front and"
good,"A Great Company that promotes team work."
good,"A typical day as a Sales Rep (AOM) at PepsiCo. consists of being at accounts by 6am and ordering products for those customers. Rotating all Pepsi products in coolers and shelves to make sure customers are not buying expired outdated merchandise. I have learned that one on one relationships with my customers has made the job alot easier. If I have a sales number that I need to meet, I have customers that I know I can go to to meet that quota. I know they will sell the product and they know I will take care of them. The hardest part of the job is manageing those who dont want to be lead. Sometimes you have those fellow employees who want to follow before they lead. Well that winds up getting them in trouble and the team in trouble. So, we have to back track and find the problem with our act now problem solving. I follow that with saying the best part of the job is being apart of a team and the one on one relationships with my customers."
good,Customer service and quality assurance. Reviewed files on customers and placed orders making sure to keep in contact with the Plant to handle disputes. Worked 8-5pm and enjoyed the environment and the clientele.
good,"PepsiCo is a great environment to work with numerous employment possibilities.  The company has great opportunity to grow and succeed.  With so many sub-companies under PepsiCo you can work anywhere and take different paths in your growth with the company.  "
good,We take inbound call to serve the customers in a professional respectful manner.
good,"Siempre estas rodeado de gente creativa y con muchas ganas, el ambiente de trabajo es excelente."
good,"Take customer pepsi orders and try to sell in new products, customer service."
good,"En general todo es bueno, solo el tiempo es todo el dia y no le das calidad  de tiempo a tu familia. Es lo unico que no me gusta"
good,great job great pay I learned how to do my job with upset store sup.
good,it was a great experience and i always learned new things and new people ! i traveled and i enjoyed the benefits they provide for my insurance!
good,"es agradable por que encuentras apoyo con otros compañeros(as),amigables, me gusta el trabajo por que siempre aprendo cosas nuevas."
good,a good place to work lots of hours pay is decent management is ok coworkers ok long hours free lunches an picnics an give aways
good,Enjoyed my co-workers we brought out the best in each other despite the work load we always pulled together and got the job done
good,I loved going to work every day meet a lot of people working there
good,"I am responsible for all the next days deliveries.  I make sure that everything being loaded is accurate and up to Pepsi standards.  I started as on of the loaders and have worked my way up into management and have learned many aspects of the business from logistics, to being a public representative, and being a leader.  I am happy with the  management, as they are a close group that are always willing to help each other to continue our success as a whole.  The employees are good men and women that have a sense of accomplishment at the end of each day.  Pepsi is a challenging place to work with the changing economy and culture, but with the innovation that we incorporate in the market place and at our  many locations we are able to move forward with a positive outlook."
good,"Daily process and prepare bank deposits"
good,"This is a great company to work for. They care about their employees, and they offer competitive pay."
good,"un poco estresate "
good,"Stocking, rotating stock for bad dates, friendly customer service and keeping backroom neat and orderly."
good,Ambiente de trabajo bajo estrica precion faborable para el aprendizaje
good,it is a selling part of company with a high quality of product with an international brand..
good,The working environment is excellent...cooperative co-workers.helped me develop my analysis skills.
good,Muy positivamente todos estos años en diversas funciones.
good,"es una buena empresa en donde puedes creser como persona, en donde se necesita ser una persona responsable, maneja un buen ambinte de trabajo y lo que mas me guston de esta son las ganacias que obtienes al realizar buenas ventas"
good,"I start at 6 AM and manage to work five stores a day. I am responsible for getting the pop to the shelf, for partnering with management to resolve problems. I also maintain the stock in the backroom and make sure things are organized."
good,"Very fast paced, I learn how to self motivate and work with all levels/types of people.  The managers tried really hard to pull individuals through the organization. My co-workers were awesome to work with and learn from. The hardest part of the job was depending on others in other functions to do their part in order for certain parts of my job to be done efficiently.  The most enjoyable part was bringing money back into the organization by way of chargeback funds recouped."
good,"Grupo Pepsico Tiene una cultura laboral de que quien más tiempo está en la compañía es el mejor trabajador, cuentan con un manejo de agenda un poco deficiente. Los horarios son exhaustivos de 6:50 am a 9:30 am de Lunes a Sábado sin horas extras. "
good,"worked a lot of hours"
good,"Empresa dinâmica e agradável de Trabalhar, cheia de oportunidade, incentivos aos funcionários (faculdade)"
good,untipico dia de trabajo tranquilo era lo mejor terminabas rapido la ruta y te ibas temprano aprendi a manejar camiones con dual y abia una comvivencia agradable con los demas compañeros y lo unico que no me paresio de la empresa fue que me quedaban mal con mi sueldo y un dia termine alas 2 de la mañana y entraba alas 6 de la mañana
good,"Un día típico de trabajo era dinámico, lleno de aprendizaje continuo y equipos multifuncionales que daban paso a diversos proyectos innovadores. Aprendí a planificar y manejar presupuesto, elaborar diseños instruccionales y el proceso de Desarrollo Organizacional. La parte más difícil del trabajo eran los viajes continuos que implicaban pasar tiempo alejada de mi familia y lo que más me gustó fue todo mi aprendizaje."
good,"Pepsi was a good place to work. My typical day at work was driving my semi around locally and delivering Pepsi products to our accounts. I worked very long hours some days but I loved the overtime offered to me. I was always the one picking up overtime and helping out the company whenever I could.  It was hard physical work but I greatly enjoyed my job. I learned a lot through my ten years at Pepsi. Our management was okay, sometimes I felt that they didn't have their employee's backs in certain situations. There was not a lot of room for advancement or career growth within the company. My coworkers were awesome! I truly enjoyed working with each of them. They felt like family and we were always helping each other when we could. The hardest part of my job was working in the extreme weather conditions but It didn't bother me much. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning new things about my job and my company. I felt like I knew pepsi in and out and that I was great at my job. I also truly enjoyed working with my customers."
good,"•	management is so friendly and supportive"
good,"dia bem dinamico sem casa dia diferente, sempre resolvendo problemas sempre com contatos com os gerentes de lojas, ótima gerencia contato com ele mais por telefone mas sempre escultando o que agente tinha para dizer e perguntando o que agente achava melhor pra fazer, pouco com contato com os funcionários da empresa eu tinha mais contato com os funcionários das outras empresa muito legal, parte difícil da empresa o deslocamento para as lojas que eu fazia as lojas de Peruíbe ate praia grande, parte mais agradável do trabalho o ambiente de trabalho que era ótimo."
good,"A empresa possui processos muito bem definidos, a gerência apoia e incentiva as iniciativas dos funcionários, assim como o trabalho em equipe."
good,"Trabalhamos com o sistema TAG time auto gerenciavel, onde os funcionarios recebem a programação de quantidade que se deve produzir e eles resolvem quando e como trabalhar, ou seja, arrumando horarios conforme disponibilidade de todos os funcionarios e equipamentos alinhados. Aprendi a trabalhar mais em grupo e ter um espirito de liderança tendo em vista que todos decidem pelo melhor da empresa sem escala de importância entre os cargos. Meus colegas de trabalho são em sua maioria mulheres, divididos em 2 tipos, nós pela empresa e os outros pela terceirizada Proficenter. A parte mais dificil do trabalho é de certa forma não ter um gerente, acaba por dar liberdade demais ao funcionario e um ou outro não sabe aproveitar dessa liberdade. A parte mais agradável é o reconhecimento da importância do funcionario através de beneficios e gratificações dados pela empresa. "
good,ambiente k fomenta el desarro personal pero empresa muy exhigente laboralmente ablado devido a k desarroya a las personas a comprometerse con la compañia absorbiendo mucho del tiempo personal con grandes areas de desarrollo
good,"I enjoyed my job , ran fork lift to load and unload trucks . Everyone was very friendly and the management was nice."
good,_Conoces nuevas personas
