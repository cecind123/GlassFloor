good,A typical day is answering 15 - 25 calls and helping people troubleshoot their software and or hardware issues via telephone. I learned how to use the iOS software system on multiple devices and how to fix issues to avoid having to make a unnecessary trip to the store. The management was wonderful and upbeat. If there were any issues or concerns they were addressed immediately. I loved it when they had pizza or hot-dog day and there were people on the social comity that made it a lot of fun to work on holidays. My favorite part of the job was when I was able to help a customer and hear the joy of partnering with them to resolve an issue.

good,"Thou the company gives too much pressure on you to work hard. It also molded our own capability on how to handle things well. Workplace is indeed comforting specially those who are away from their Family. the hardest part of the Job is Body Clock adjusting, because you have to work on night time, but you'll get used to it. the most enjoyable part of the job, is when you reach your goal for the shift. passing the score means good intensives. that's the reason why  tenure agents stays. a good compensation."

good,"This company allowed me growth and opportunity. If your looking for a company that will develop your work skinny pls, this is a great company to work for"

good,this place groomed me in the bpo business i learned every thing i needed to know to be a great customer service agent and later to be a good Operations Manager and there is room to grow at convergys
good,"Convergys is an amazing working environment for those seeking to pursue a career in the business field.It's an amazing wonderful experience,to being working in."
good,"Best facilities"
good,"When I worked for Convergy's, I was a Customer Service Rep for Comcast High Speed internet. This was by far the easiest job I've ever had hands down. You're basically sitting in a cubicle helping customers either get his/her internet (sometimes home phone) service back up and running and sometimes getting new customers started via chat. You have two 15 minute breaks, which are optional, as well as a 45 minute lunch break. Seriously, how cool is that?"
good,"Management structure and goals/direction solid, good working environment and secure. Friendly atmosphere and plenty of corporate involvement with the local community."

Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,managers were friendly and genuinely invested in my success . a typical day at work consisted of working with customers over the phone. we had employee appreciation days where we would gather and have lunch and games in the break room and outside paid for by the company. raises were a normal occurrence.
good,"answered inbound calls, listened to customers complaint & try to find a way within my powers to retain the customer, transfer customer to esc if it led to that. My team was AWESOME! my coworkers were friendly & helpful."
good,"Personal family problems are why I am no longer an employee. To begin, I loved it from the very start. The moment I accepted the job and flourished into a brilliant, promising, and strong advisor, a lot of opportunities for growth were open to me. If you love the job and what you do, then this will be easy. You’ll rarely have a tough work day. Its customer service, of course you can’t please everyone but you have to remember the good that outweighs the bad. To me, management had always been caring and supportive. It was like a big family especially the team I was apart of. This is one of the best jobs I’ve ever had. My site was unique because I got to see minorities in management roles, which I don’t see often at most companies. That instantly speaks to people like myself. They can work with your schedule but you need to communicate that. You work 8 hours a day, come prepared with a cup of coffee or something to snack on. You’ll be rewarded especially if you show eagerness to stand out. Every job has their cons but if you stay positive, you’ll have more fun. I don’t think I was a favorite but I definitely was someone who wanted to have a good work experience so that meant I had to come work ready with a smile and bubbly energy. Your energy definitely rubs off on everyone else, you’re around these people most of the time than your own family. You don’t have to make friends but build positive work relationships. It was overall a huge learning experience for me and I’m grateful for the opportunity."
good,"I loved the environment. I enjoyed working with the customers on their purchases, kind of like getting to know them on a personal level due to the information needed to create their perfect PC. I would truly love to join a team working in a call center environment again."
good,"Answering phone calls from customer, What I've  learned is always think that in every call that is the first call, be friendly to your customer, make sure to cover all concern of your customer and don't make them feel that your not interested even if the concern of your customer is not about your job, be energetic and active in every call make them feel that they are very important, show your willingness to help. The management overall is great, people there are very kind and friendly. for me the workplace is organized, the hardest part of my job is to make sure that my calls will go smooth and perfect. most enjoyable is when your customer give you a feedback that you did a great job."
good,Excellent. Contcentrix is a way to give a chance to some one to show their abilities and talent. It gives a chance even to fresher. I think its a best platform for me because I was also a fresher when I joined the Concentrix. It also improve my communication skills as well as I learned a lot of things.

good,"working at convergys was extreamly fun but extreamly worked base had raffles as well as really good work enviorment some times was very stressful, but over all was very good."
good,"When I worked at Convergys, I was on the AT&T Calling Card project. I received calls from AT&T Calling Card customers concerning their accounts. These would range from calling card bills becoming separated from their home phone accounts to customers wanting to apply for stand alone cards. I learned how to handle rude customers better. Management there was very professional and always had my back. The culture while fast paced was semi-relaxed. As long as you do your job they are flexible if you need time off for unforeseen events. To me there was nothing really hard about this job. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people resolve their issues with AT&T."
good,I loved my time at Convergys and would recommend it to most anyone who values customer service but they recognize that they are not competitive in the call center pay market.

good,Its a very good experience to work with such a good organisation which helped a lot to enhance my skills and communication and other things like management skills and how to work in a competitive environment confudently
good,Usually my shift starts at 11 pm. A lot of calls usually come in around this time. We huddle first with our supervisor to review metrics or any ongoing outages the we need to be aware of. We take in calls for 2 hours and we go on break. I get off work around 8 am. I have learned to multitask and deal with different types of costumers. Its a very stressfull account since we are dealing with tech support and we have no limits regarding our support to our costumers concern. Hardest part of the job is handling issues that are beyond our call centers control like outages and weather disturbances in the US. Theres not much to enjoy because of the stress were getting from the job but I have a family to feed and I use it as motivation. Workplace culture is somewhat bland since all of us undergo the same strees but its ok. Convergys is known for that type of culture wherein we are paid to work. I was in it just for the income.
good,"Work life balance, work seems to be fun, nill pressure of work, working hours are long sometimes but seniors are very much cooperative. No gender biasness."
good,"I have no complaints about Convergy's the only reason I left is due to no daycare for my children on Sunday's. Other then that it was a great place to work and the management was willing to help you succeed with the company. I haven't worked for a company who was so willing to hire from and promote from within. I have worked for this company 3 times and never left on bad terms and still have many friends that work for this company. It's a great place to work and they give great benefits, discounts, and the insurance plan was great."
good,Hours are nice and there's always room to make more money.they have incentives every month and your able to adjust your schedules if needed. If you have transportation its a easy job  to keep up with.

My supervisor and bosses are very polite and professional. I learned almost everything when it comes to call handling, maintaining good metrics and to be competitive (I was a member of a team that won 3 Top Team of the Year Award consecutively) that's why I learned that everything that you're good at can be perfected or trained for this specific skill so you could be excellent at it.The hardest part of the job is when you're not somehow meeting your customer's needs that why you have to check everything and make sure they'll hung the phone up smiling or satisfied with the customer service experience. The most enjoyable part is when you're actually helping the customers, being with your co-workers and that's it."

good,"My job was to solve all the  issues our customer is getting regarding their Xbox console or with their account. They might be getting issues about billing, hardware, software and they might have inquiries. I need to solve whatever issues they have as soon as possible.  It was not easy communicating with not one but two chats at the same time but it was fulfilling. I learned to multi-task and to do not one but many things at the same time. I also learned to improve my skill in communication because we trained to be polite and use positive words when talking with our customers.  In my work It is important to choose very careful the words to say with our customers so we can get their confidence and be able to let them listen to us."
good,Training was really fun. They made u feel comfortable. Never pressuring you. Always so nice and sweet. Training was paid which was awesome. They would work with you if you need help understanding something. They would put you partner you up with someone so they can show you how the phone calls worked.
good,As an intern even though I was only assigned to one department I requested to be allowed to do various tasks and help around in any way I can in the other hr/recruitment duties. They gladly allowed me and I'm grateful for it because I learned a lot to the point that I can say that I can man a post with only me and two people. Multi-tasking is an important skill I learned especially under stress. They taught me how to maintain composure even if there were a lot of applicants and some were being irate.

good,I think Convergys is an excellent company to work for. I have enjoyed the work environment and management. I love that they promote within the company.
good,"Convergys, formerly Stream Global Services, has been a great place to work. This company wants their employees to succeed and gives every opportunity for the agents to learn and grow. I have had the opportunity to work on several contracts and have been given the tools required to be able to do the job. This is an inbound call centre,  we take on contracts from other companies to assist with the service of their products, calls are taken from people who are having issues our job is to resolve them. This can be anywhere from highly technical issues to charges on a customer account. I have learned how to use a computer which, when I started I did not have one, to now being able to assist customers using the computer skills that I have learned and feel confidant using every day. I have also been able to use that knowledge to assist my colleagues with their calls as well as taking escalated calls. The most difficult part of this job is knowing that we do not always have the same shift we have to bid on them and where you are on the list is determined by your stats.  The part that I have enjoyed the most is the friends that have been made while working here and how much fun we can have."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I had a great time working their and the pay was very good for the work you did. It thought me a lot about customer service for customers and how to better help the clients.
good,"At Convergys I provided customer services and sales for a major cable and cell phone company. I learned a lot about how to de-escalate upset customers and how to overcome objections when it comes to sales. The hardest part of the job was trying to achieve the sales goals everyday. If I was struggling on a certain day, it was easy for me to talk to my manager to see what I could do differently. This was a really fun place to work with a lot of incentives to keep all of the agents focused and energetic on the calls."
good,"A typical work day at Convergys is pretty entertaining. Convergys is not like any call center, you come to work and as soon as you open those doors, you see happy smiling faces everywhere. You learn a lot in training and on the production floor also. There's a lot of things that you don't cover in training and that can be frustrating at times, but the co-workers are there to help you at all times. The management at Convergys is pretty good. You have the Team Support Supervisors that are there to help most of the time if they're busy. Then, you have the Team Leaders who coach and help you improved your statistics and things like that. The most enjoyable part about working at Convergys is the break room. It's a cool relaxed environment where you can watch TV, buy snacks, and play on the ping pong table or Xbox 360!"
good,genrally my stayed with convergys is a good one. the management can be approached anytime. the work with my coworkers is not toxic at all. it is an enjoyable thing to go to work everytime. i love the fact that it is night shift no traffic. the hardest part of the work is when the clients cant be catered to and when the need the owner of the account. it is a frustration that you cannot help them. the best part of the job is when we can really answer their querie and requests in a reasonable time like say five minutes and everything is done. it is worth more than the salary when the person on the other end of the line had what he wants and he ends the call with a thank you and not a sigh.
good,"It was always a fun job to have. I'd always walk in and smile, also get smiles returned to me. The only problem I was having was the fact that I was told that Direct Deposit took months to take affect and for me to be getting my paychecks deposited right into my bank account, which prevented me from paying bills on time and having to push back due dates."
good,"It's very nice working with this company. This is the first BPO company that I've work for and I learned a lot of things. From non-agent person up to the boss of the management, they're good and friendly."
good,This place was actually good to work. Coworkers and supervisors made the job nice. A typical day was answering phone calls and any questions or complaints customers had. Also engaging with my senior supporting or supervisors on several occasions

good,this company is a nice place to work at. The compensation was good compared to its competition. They provided good training and constant retraining. Getting a better position is also fast to qualified individuals.
good,"Its tiring , fun and at the same time you will also learn alot. I learned how to minimize interruptions, multi tasked, to be polite still even the customer is already disrespectful."
good,I liked working there as every moment of my time was getting counted. They made all of us feel important and treated us accordingly.
good,"theres no downtime at the office, such easy job, but always seating and night shift is sometimes boring, there are a lot of incentives, attendance and skills, when you hit the target snother incentive, but im starting to get burned out because of the same routine, with no sunlight exposure"

good,"Peoples company, right from basics to everything it is in place here, if you are serious about your job, the company is serious about you too. the qulality training will make you a different person"
good,"Every day at work I would go to my desk and immediately take phone calls. I would helped customers over the phone with troubleshooting AT&T Devices and help them out with contracts and payment options. I learned how to use programs efficiently such as Clarify and the AT&T websites. I was able to quickly navigate directly to the source of the Customer's problems. My management team was incredibly helpful and amazing to work with. Whenever I had a question they were right there ready to help. The hardest part about working at Convergys was having to try and calm a customer down when they were livid. Even though I was able to keep them calm and successfully helped them with their problems, it was still pretty difficult to talk to someone who was shouting in my ear. The most enjoyable part of the job was the satisfaction I got when fixing a customers issue with their AT&T Device. I loved the feeling I got when the customers would thank me and put in a nice review to my management team. I also loved the environment I worked with. My team on my floor were a lot of fun and were always there to help when needed."

good,"I love working here and have been here for over 4 years, This job is what you make it as with any job. And yes it is sales and service. And I have seen people on here talking about having to do sales to make the extra money, That is what you are paid to do when it says sales. I go all in and you can do both with serving the customer and sales if you apply yourself. New upbeat atmosphere.. I love this place give it a shot and yes the points are good cause what other company says here at some point during the year take some points you got 12 that is like 12 days you can miss for no reason. but if you save your pto and plan it right, you don't even have to use those. overall I love my job and would ask everyone to come work here"
good,Its a good place to build your career.. Its just that there are some supports who is very rude and not being helpful at all..

New tickets would come in and the higher priority tickets required my team to be on a bridged to work the ticket real time until it was fixed or a work around put in place.  If a work around was put in place the bridge would be closed and we would have to work on a permanent fix for the problem.  Sometimes this would require working a window starting at midnight an ending at 05:00.  The company is exceedingly well managed.  I worked with a great team of people, we had our good times and our bad times.  The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the changing IT environment.

good,"I enjoyed working there for the most part, under certain team leaders. Sometimes, the weekly performance reviews could be intimidating, and overwhelming. You would be required to listen to a call you took, and give your good points and weak points. Once I was under team leaders that understood how much I disliked this, they would review basics I could do to improve, and my goals for the next week.

At times, the atmosphere would be stressful because of people taking time off or calling in, which caused a decrease in manpower, however, I would enjoy telling a joke to the representatives to make them laugh and reassure them that the one bad call that they received is over and the next call will be your best call ever. The hardest part of my job was letting people go. I don't like it because I believe everyone can be successful, although life can bring obstacles, its up to the individual to fight through them. My managers and workplace environment is always a positive and upbeat atmosphere."

Management is so nice and cared about you more than anything. If you were sick they wanted you to feel better no matter what and did everything they could to make sure you wouldn't get in trouble for being sick. The hardest part of the job would most likely be not being able to help the customer and having to send them to someone higher than you. The best part is how nice everyone is especially the customers as well as being able to work at home!!!"

They try to make sure that before agents will be endorsed to the production floor, everyone should be competitive enough to face the real world of call center regardless the account that they will be endorsed with.

Everyone is really nice and helpful.  Management is great and they are very helpful when you get stuck on trying to find something or on a way to help the customer. If you enjoy helping people and learning new things Concentrix would be a great place for you to work.
