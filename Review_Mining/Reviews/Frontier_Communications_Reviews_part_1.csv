good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit. The pipe dream they guaranteed to Frontier and the employees they did not honor. They changed all the policies after the grace receiving period. Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"This is probably the worst place I have ever worked. Management is racist towards the minorities, they pick favorites and black ball certain individuals. A really toxic environment. Currently looking for a new job so I can get my sanity back. I hate coming to work everyday and the best part about my day is leaving. This is a great place to work if you love to feel undervalued."
bad,"This supervisor was awful, she criticized those trainers and people working there like nothing."
bad,Refuses to listen to qualified technicians who know how save this sinking ship and completely uninterested in good customer service and providing quality well supported products
bad,"I really don't have anything nice to say about Frontier.  I will say this, living close to work was a plus but not feeling like I was welcome as an employee ever."
bad,Work here if you want to be without a job after a while and your job to be sent over seas. Frontier does NOT care about their employees and sacrifices good employees and instead uses cheap vendor call centers.
bad,"Since expanding in 2016 Frontier continues to sink further in debt with month over month net loss of customers."
bad,Frontier took over in Florida and customer service went out the window. It is no longer a phone company . they abuse their employees and dont care about customer
bad,"I'm completely traumatized after working for Frontier. They care about the employees just as little as they do the customers. It makes no sense to offer on every call such as death, loss of job, customer calling into cancel, lost home due to flood or house fire. It comes across extremely rude and uncaring. Also Frontier LOVES to threaten termination even for the slightest of things."
bad,The customer service sales postion was stressful and agressive. Quota was hard to achieve during the Transition of CTF states. The customers didnt want upgrades or new services from frontier. The time on the phones were basically retaining the customer more than upgrading and informing the customer. There was a lot  of un organized  situations.
bad,Not a good company to work for management my Subs no education noting work unfair no good pay not good and not nice will not pay you the money u made for the week
bad,"Frontier bought Verizon's assets in several states. The culture in Verizon was great, within Frontier, if you made more money than other agents then they look for ways to get rid of you."
bad,Working for frontier is definitely the worst job I've ever held in my life the company is not oriented towards making clients Happy their main concern is the bottom line they don't repair their lines and the customers suffer due to them only half way doing their jobs and patching lines that have been there for 20 + years and the customers have had 10+ outages when the simplest solution in the long run is to just replace the entire line
bad,"Frontier Communications gets worse by the month, with high turnover and rudderless direction by management. I really will be surprised if they survive as a company."
bad,"I don't know what to say. Better than no job at all I guess. I think it's good for short term but not for long term goal. If you're fresh graduate then, this would be fine job for starters."
bad,"Would not recommend wasting time with this company, unprofessional management with poor training. Hours are horrible, union willing to take your dues but never uphold their standards when company breaches them."
bad,"Unfortunately, this was a terrible place to work. This was done through Empereon Constar. Nobody knew what they were doing. Customers were always escalated and unsupported by the company."

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,Company headed towards bankruptcy.  Commission is low. Processes are archaic. Management does not have a clue. Lots of backstabbing by other sales people.  Company will find some reason to not pay your commission
bad,"Overall failed setup, no real planning our contract setup causing unobtainable sales goal preventing bonus payout. Frequent loss of management team due to repeated issues and lack of support."
bad,Perfect attendance. Great sales. Awesome customer service. My thanks? No rehire after I had to move out of state. Not when I was promised another position and not 5 years later! Total joke.
bad,"When Frontier bought the landlines from Verizon it was a literal nightmare and it's only gone down hill from there. They doubled the amount you paid for insurance and gave your less coverage, put a freeze on all pay raises, took away bonuses from management, and provide no mentoring or leadership training or advancement opportunities."
bad,"Depending on your position here and who you know. You will either be well liked, or under appreciated. Management only cares about sales and not helping their group become better potential leaders themselves. When you need help, you have an online database they expect you to depend on they rarely want to help and when they do because they are ""experts"" they make you feel less than you are. however, the job is a decent job for someone with NO degree and needing something more than minimum wage."
bad,"Management is all about mis-management.  No consistency.  There are favored employees, no one else has a chance.  If you are in the club you are considered a cool.  If not, you are an outsider."
bad,Definitely just a job for good money. The management doesn’t care about anyone. They care about your numbers more then our customers. There is no room to grow or move up in the company and the company is about to go bankrupt.
bad,"The CEO has removed bonus's, raises, cost of living increases, promotions are often given with little to no compensation on top. Employee care is at an all time low. Not a good place to work."
bad,Those that work hard are punished while those that get nothing done are promoted. Its very much a failing upwards type of job. They have no issues with making promises that they have no plans to follow through on and in the end they would rather take advantage of their good employees and then watch them leave than using those people to make the company better
bad,"The systems at Frontier are numerous, outdated and not interconnected. This makes for a poor customer experience and frustrated employees. Not a winning company."
bad,I wouldn't recommend this place to no one to work here because this place is poorly managed by the top dogs and the managers is poorly trained and very unorganized.
bad,"The management is a joke, they don't care what it is you need and don't provide you enough time to get doctor's notes for any medical conditions you have.  The company is horrid, the customers would call and complain about poor service or not having a technician come out timely as was promised but the company didn't allow for us to help them or compensate them in any way."
bad,"Poorly operated from the leadership down, I was previously a manager in the call center and my hands were so tied in order to help customers Frontier was OK with them canceling there services instead.,"
bad,Everything about the job is awful. You wont like it. Management is the worst - either they don't care at all or they micromanage to the point of making you want to quit.
bad,It really was one of the worst companies I ever worked for. The company is falling into a hole. The way they treated their employees and their customers were not good.
bad,"The company is implementing “projects”  for “cost cutting” aka firing employees. they elimated the bonuses,  they work you to the bone (no work life balance). management acts like nothing is wrong or has changed.. they should be worshiping the people that stay.. oh and they pay way below market value"
bad,Frontier likes to claim that they are customer oriented but they are not. All they care about is the bottom line. Even though this is a union shop they will take advantage of you at every turn. They will not put any money into upgrading their infrastructure and refuse to hire enough employees to bring each reporting center up to strength. They then try to force the employees to work overtime to try to make up for these issues.
bad,"Deceptive, Unethical, Poorly Managed, No Sense of Direction. Horrible leadership by upper management - decisions not made with the best interest of employees. No work life/balance. Job cuts often."
bad,"This job was very difficult. I accept that maybe I am not the best person to work in a huge call center, but the management breathes down your neck, and sales are your number one priority, even more than customer service."

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"I don't have 1 nice word to say about this place,  They promised us so many things and would not lose our jobs to 2 weeks later, we found out we lost our jobs, and not able to go with our jobs."
bad,Nothing to comment on. You are welcome to have your own experience within this organization.  Lots of opportunity to make Frontier a better place to work.
bad,"The job was not for me. Upper management was not nice, really didn't care if you succeeded or not. The benefits and vacation time was nice. Commuting was horrible."
bad,Working with this company once you are outside of your home office is amazing. They actually acknowledge your hard work and dedication. The Fort Wayne location has poor management and big on favoritism. They do not recognize stellar employees instead they look for ways to punish them for doing their job too well. 
bad,This is the worse technical support job I have ever had.  You are required to sell products to customers in addition to solving their issues.  That is distasteful.
bad,"Likes to hire new Techs with out all the Benefits."
bad,"Take back to back calls with no time between them.  Take abuse from customers calling in because the company lacks focus on how best to support their clients.  Have to constantly lie to customers because the company wants the ""vendor techs"" to sell to them without actually fixing the problem and allows them to get away with it constantly."
bad,"Frontier started out as a great place to work, 5 years ago. As time has gone on, they have made poor business decisions, resulting in losses for investors and the workload then put on frontline employees with little to no tools to assist the customers."
bad,Poor work environment.  Management was not concerned about employees.. Conflict within functional departments.  No focus or direction.  Not Client focused.
bad,"awful, biggest mistake made. terrible work format. bait and switch service provided to poor souls.. not one second to take a breather or finish notes until next call plows through."
bad,"Senior Management takes forever to make a decision.  They also have a very bad habit of communication and kicking the can down the road on projects."
bad,A lot of turnover and layoffs. Pay is bad and management is even worse. No recognition for good work and constant criticism for anything you do. Don’t take a bathroom break because you might get fired.
bad,"Honestly if you are going to work at frontier communications, you are writing yourself a ticket to the most inconsistent and poorly managed communication companies presently"
bad,"fun place to work you never get anything done, you can advance in this place if you're not a caring person, if you're the type that likes to lie,cheat and still from your customer then you will go far at frontier."
bad,"Frontier is a terrible work environment. There are unbelievably unscrupulous tactics used to intimidate sales staff and drive numbers.  If you are not comfortable in a setting with no guidance, zero coaching, unethical, incompetent managers, then Frontier is not the place for you!"
bad,No advancement no raises not a fair place to work and management are not experienced or professional.  Left the place for a more professional place to work
bad,"This was the worst position. Everything breaks all of the time, and the company turnaround time to fix the problem is always long, which result in very Irate callers all day every day."
bad,"Frontier is struggling to survive, and appear to be headed to bankruptcy in the near future. They have lost many key people recently, and are unable to replace them. The job I signed on for changed significantly over the time I was there, with more and more work being placed on less and less people. At the support desk, you were required to not only take calls that required focus to troubleshoot, but at the same time take multiple chats that also required focused troubleshooting, meaning you were required to not provide good customer service to anyone, and the excessive stress caused many to burn out."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"Definitely not recommend for anyone to join this company, poor management top to bottom and worse employee satisfaction I can rate. 80% turn over rate in PMO->hardly anyone will stay."
bad,"Treat their employees badly "
bad,The company is failing tragicially and the culture is to blame. No 2 parts of the company are in line with each other. They have a high expectation of sales with out the ability to install said sales on the back end. They are setting them selves up for failure and they know it. Any one who mentions the reality of their situation is black listed.
bad,"try working under a seniority based system when youre at the bottom and theres a hiring freeze for 2+years. poor schedule, poor training, poor management, company is poorly run from the top to the bottom."
bad,"Overall i have worked for this place for almost 3 years , switched my whole work ethic, did multiple interm positions with no raise in pay , and also switched my schedule numerous times and t be let down again and again management is below average treats you like a number not a person ."
bad,A call center is not the funnest place to work but Frontier tried their best to make it fun. The business was getting bought out when I worked there so there was a lot of confusion and changes happening. Maybe it was just bad timing but I didn't love my experience there. I did love working with the customers though. That is what made the job worth it.
bad,"When I came on board when the new purchase of Verizon in the south (FL, TX & CA) I was promised the world and when I asked questions to the hiring manager I was told to stop talking and asking questions. I stayed at a top 1 & 2 position in my state in sales revenue against other reps. My manager was a complete joke who lies constantly to the VP about her production and daily maintained a hostile work environment. People were recording her in sales meetings due to her screaming and cussing to have evidence of how she treated us and she wasn't willing to put forth any efforts in being a leader or showing us how to do anything. The commissions were changed 3+ times when I was there and started to seemingly be a quarterly thing. Very few in the company had any idea of what was really going on with the business model and we all just counted the days until the next 1,000+ people were let go. I can't say I recall even one sound executive business decision as far as a plan to grow the south. Everything they did was sloppy and in a ""hurry up and wait"" manner. I cannot warn you enough about this company and considering working here. In fact, I was placed on administrative paid leave because of my own manager's hostile work environment  and I never received a call at all telling me what was going on and one day they just stopped paying me. I had done nothing wrong and it has been right at a month now I've gone unpaid and I still have not received any notification of termination whatsoever. Nothing more than disconnection from my email, company phone etc. no call, nothing.  My legal team"
bad,This used to be a good place to work with good benefits and livable pay but there has been a lot of recent changes that have made it an awful place to work It used to have a quarterly bonus but that was taken away. It used to have a Sunday differential but that was reduced down to table scraps the management does not listen or seem like they care about the employees opinions save your self some heart ache and try somewhere else you never know when what you have worked for so hard will be taken away when all you did was work hard for this company
bad,the company was a scam. the management is awful. the company as a whole is terrible the company was a scam. there's not enough money you can pay me to continue to lie to customers
bad,"When I first started it was great. The training had me really excited about the company but then after working there that all changed. My advice to anyone thinking about working here is.."
bad,This company plays around too much. Enjoyed the job when I first started but after a couple months they start to change everything they told  you when hired. They have so many issues that need to be worked out but they have done nothing to get them resolved. If you work for this company I truly wish you the best!
bad,"They may forget to pay you, they did me so I left them and they made up some other reseason to justify it, Frontier was ok at frist then they started down graded it and later out sourced them self to some type of call center for someone else"
bad,This is the worst place I've ever worked. Not sure what all the reveries are about saying money is great money is horrible do not take this job. Do not know of one person who is happy in it
bad,AS frontier was taking over territories from verizon customers prices went up without being told. Also they couldn't get there on demand channels working.
bad,"I have ethics and morals and Frontier"
bad,"a typical week was flying out on Monday and working long hours and flying back home on Friday."
bad,The company is run by bullies who encourage back biting and playing the blame game.  Over worked and underpaid.  No process to show appreciation only processes to discipline.Horrible workplace where who lies and complains the most and loudest wins every time.
bad,"They don't care about the customers at all. I feel bad for those people waiting at home for days for install the service, but they even don't have service in that area. The system is so awful . I was about telling customer to get another provider. "
bad,"This is most dump company in this universal. I meant they have no managements at all. The Supervisor is the god , unbelivable. Job training is awful, they put u on the phone before train you. O star if I can give to them."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"I was very delighted when I received an email a day after applying for the service representative position.  I promptly set an interview date for the next day. The first interview is a group style interview, pretty basic group activities see who can multitask and stand out in the group. A few days later the recruiter called to set up a second interview with the hiring manager. This was a traditional interview the hiring manager asked questions which I answered, he then rated the questions on a 1-5 level. The hiring manager seemed to be very impressed by my answers and scored me mostly at 4's, he seemed hesitant to give me 5's though he said I couldn't answer the questions any better. He followed by showing me the office and telling me more general information about the office and position. He then walked me to the elevators as we said our good byes he informed me that they would be moving ahead in the hiring process and I will definitely be starting with the next training group. A week later I haven't heard from the recruiter so I sent her an email asking for an update, two hours later after being told I had the position and stopping my job search I received an email saying that I wasn't hired."
bad,"Not enough work to go around, no training program at all, nearly everyone is underqualified. Very overly political environment in office. Supervisors are out of touch with employees, and heavily favor certain people over others."
bad,Frontier is fast paced and super busy. There is much to keep you busy at all times and is thus easy to stay focused. The management   does what it can.
bad,"There is no room for advancement except only if you have friends in a higher position. Management is very unprofessional and very rude to their subordinates. Extravagant duties are asked of you just to retain your job. The benefits are horrible and there are no perks. You will be extremely overworked and will not be given the proper resources to do your job because it is not cost efficient. I know there will always be someone that complains about a job, however all "
bad,"After being separated for the dumbest of reason they basically played the shell game with my last check. This company doesn't care, no calls back and even worst is the number of complaints people have filed, there's even a Facebook page for it. If you need to work fine but don't set on a career here your better off somewhere else"
bad,Do not expect to have any sense of job security here.  I was never granted access to the database and was expected to perform without any training or computer access.
bad,This is only a job. This is not a place that I will see myself being for more than 6 months (maybe). Training is horrendous.  If training is poor it sets the tone for the job.  You are pushed out onto the floor with Google being your main tool in your belt. You feel as if you have No SUPPORT SYSTEM. The company is definitely about numbers and you must sell to get them off your back. The service is more down then up and the field technicians are quite slack. I don't know how this company stays afloat. Tenure is quite low( people think being there for 2 years is a long time).the pay sucks..management sucks(inept people)..morale is low..this place as a whole sucks. I cringe walking in the doors..
bad,"This was one of the worst call center jobs I've ever worked.  I was brought on as a technician, and quickly learned that none of the technicians around me had any technical expertise whatsoever.  None of them knew the first thing about troubleshooting or resolving customer issues.  The only thing beaten into the heads of employees on a nearly constant basis was that we must must must find a way to sell sell sell the overpriced services frontier offers to our customers, regardless of there being superior versions of these services available online for free.  At no point during my tenure at Frontier did they care whatsoever about my ability to troubleshoot, diagnose, and resolve issues.  I was just another number who did not matter because I was not willing to make unethical sales."
bad,"No room for any advancement, unless you can kiss butt.   I learned nothing, company says they want to serve customers, they only want to sell overpriced add on products.  Management is terrible, they are only looking for yes people.  Co workers are okay, you never really get to know them.   Hardest part of job is biting your tongue often. The most enjoyable part of job, lunch, breaks, leaving for the day."
bad,"If you need a job this place is good to get back on your feet.   Long term money, management, and culture are what you would expect to find in a call center that does contracts and 3rd party support not support for their own customers.  Training is lacking and the policy to sell sell sell no matter what they have or how many times they callback is driven home.   Lack of sales is about the only thing they will fire you for in any position."
bad,"Taking in/out calls, assisting training to new employees, giving basic technical support to callers, Ensuring best quality service."
bad,"great challenging place to work for, had many wonderful opportunities."
bad,I assisted customers with service questions and processing payments. I also set up new service.
bad,All this place cares about is MONEY... If your a USED CARS SALESMAN then apply you will do great. IF you care about Customers then keep moving on.. This place does not care about people either employees or customers unless you are bringing in money.. IF you make money you get the Sales Calls if your not you get the Billing calls.. I would NEVER EVER recommend this job to my worst enemy..
bad,"This is probably one of the worst companies to work for. If you are a Veteran, there is no respect for Veterans. Expected to work without overtime pay. I know numerous people that have Department of Labor investigations against this company."
bad,The company was great to work for when it was Commonwealth Telephone Company until it was taken over by Frontier Communications. It went downhill from there!
bad,Aggravated and trained me then moved to Florida 6 monthes later
bad,Horrible company. Regret ever having to work for them. Was there almost 3 years and was the top in the building on sales and resolutions. I didnt get anything except told i could do better next month.
bad,"Unless you make a sale every signal call of their products, then you won't be treated fairly. Time schedules get changed faster than changing your cat's litter box, and the company cheats people out of their bonuses. The other departments don't like to help and you handle get any help when you need. If you can convince customers who call in upset about the services to buy something for another 15 dollars, then this is the job for you."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,Company is going down hill.. service really sucks.. cheap company. No advancement opportunities and management likes to micromanage but  lack the knowledge to perform.
bad,Poor management skills.There's a terrible lack of communication from management to staff. Frontier has turned into an unfriendly and negative work environment. Minimum to no pay raises and no incentives to help boost team morale.
bad,"Frontier is a good company to work for, but they do  make a lot of changes and don't tell their agents. Frontier pushes more for making sales instead of the actual CUSTOMER SERVICE that the reps are told that's what they are hired for. They don't train you on the correct things that the agents are supposed to actually be doing. Instead they send you out on the floor without knowing anything."
bad,"Mandatory overtime, they switch your hours to whatever fits them the best. They dole out your paid time off only so many days every 3 months so you can't really take a good vacation. If you ask for help they say something snotty like you should know that already. They are too overworked and stressed out to help the new hires. Not enough time given to actually do the job you will have to work through your breaks and lunches to get your job done each day."
bad,"Frontier used to be a great place to work as they had management that cared about their employees. I am just one of probably 50+ people that has left the Deland Frontier call center in 2018. The management only cares about their money, not the reps success. They treat their consultants like children, and there are insect infestations everywhere. Also, there are a lot of leaks in the ceilings, and I am sure mold. If you are good at selling, by talent or unethical practices, this is the job for you. They cater to the sales reps, most of which are unethical. There are only a handful of good managers in that building, the rest will run it into the ground. If you are tenured enough to work the earliest shift, you might get a parking spot. If not, you will have to park across the street where your car can get broken into. Homeless people may also use your back seat to take a nap because they swarm in the parking lots outside of the Frontier building. There are also rent a cop security parking attendants that will have your car towed in minutes if you park in the wrong spot. They used to have what they called “power hours” where you could enter into a raffle everyday to win a gift card and get a snack- now they don’t even have good snacks!! Just oatmeal packets and individually wrapped twizzlers! If you’re lucky, you might find a piece of Halloween candy. Is that what we are worth to you Frontier? Oatmeal packets????"
bad,"It was always cold in the building; some of the employers were sick a lot.   We were not allowed to bring in heater.  When I was hired for the job it was a center for disconnection of services like telephone, satellite and cable.  In the middle of the year we were changed to a call center without any training.  The hardest part of the job was try to understand what the customer wanted done to their services. I enjoyed working with the people their.   I wish they would not change the work schedule like they do; one day you are working 8:00 to 5:00 next you are working 11:00 to 8:30 at night that is very stressful for parents and people who has second jobs."
bad,"Angry over the phone customers, hard push to make sales, though was Tech Support, and general avoidance of responsibility from co-workers and management alike was a typical work day. I learned the this company needs to collapse. Management was happy to let you know your shortcomings, hardly praised you, and would, if you were lucky, occasionally work with you if you had an outside situation. Workplace Culture was a living embodiment of Dolores Umbridge. Hardest part of the job was trying to make a sale to a person who is mad that the service they already have is not working, so good luck trying to sell them a more expensive version, bucko. Most enjoyable part of the job would have to be that I no longer work there."
bad,company could have been good but grow to fast.higher ups have no idea what to do and are making all the wrong decisions. closing center in US and going to vendors to cut costs.
bad,Terrible company. originally worked for Verizon which was great and when Frontier took over it all went downhill.Commisions went down the company purposely found ways to take away sales opportunities from the sale teams and provided it to less paid employees who were not paid on sales commission.
bad,"Frontier is not an easy program at Sykes, but if you want to be challenged, go for it. The training with sykes isn't as helpful as I thought it would be. I've been working and learning about Frontier and I am already pushing to look for another job because the pay doesn't make it worth the work."
bad,They relate and allow a hostel working inviroment and don't respect there employees and like to favor people unpleasant working inviroment also very stressful. Due  to the company and the fellow employees.
bad,I was not with the company long enough and the transition did not go as smooth as I thought. I do believe they have potential to move forward in the future.
bad,"Frontier is by far the worst company I have ever worked for."
bad,"The most dishonest company I've ever experienced working for in my life time."
bad,"Frontier should adopt the Verizon culture of Employee Satisfaction.  Frontier Senior Management is solely based on the bottom line.  There is no flexibility on this issue.  Managers do not support their Supervisors unless it is beneficial to them.  Human Resource Generalist are not professional."
bad,"Worked at Frontier Communications for over 3 years and never got moved into a better position. Being that the company gives pay to every one no matter their level of skill or work is horrible. If you are a slacker and dont want to work hard, this is the company you should work for"
bad,crickets ... My mother always told me that if you cannot say anything nice you should say anything at all.
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit. The pipe dream they guaranteed to Frontier and the employees they did not honor. They changed all the policies after the grace receiving period. Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,Distrusting management...micromanaging due to their inabilities/insecurities... rightfully so. Authoritative management incapable of honoring/respecting associates.
bad,"Micromanaging culture with management that was corrupt and abusive. Senior management was demanding, absent and displayed no leadership except barking orders. Out of touch and treated their sales people like robots. CEO was absolutely careless and outright clueless."
bad,Let's just say this: Frontier Communications is a  sinking ship. The products/services suck and they have equally disgruntled customers and employees.
bad,"Poor management throughout, no support or training, bad customer service,  no accountability throughput organization.  Company directives change sporadically with poor communication and no enforcement"
bad,"Management sucked, union sucks, no career advancement. If you enjoy long hours, no time with your family and lazy co workers then let me tell you this office job is the one."
bad,"poor management no work/life balance.. absolutely no missing work, dont even think about getting sick because you will lose your job. money is nice but not worth the stress"
bad,"Worked at the company for over 5 years. As the years went by, the worst the company got. The bonus's started to get smalled, the micro-management continue to become ridiculous. The tripled the cost of their insurance. The hourly raise continued to decrease. The annual raises stopped. Seemed as if they were hiring any drug addict off the street. The drama that took place at Frontier, was worst than drama at a local high school."
bad,"My opinion of Frontier changed shortly after my start date. 3 months into my time with the company, I learned just how little the company values lower level management as half of the supervisors in the state were laid off and the annual bonuses were taken away from the remaining supervisors. We did get a title change to manager though...and the amount of techs we manage doubled."
bad,The management is a huge fail.  Not sure if I can make this more clear as to how poorly this company is run.  The culture is adversarial toward the employees from/by management and this is a  intentionally perpetuated by upper management.
bad,"The company claims that their main concern is customer service, but in actuality, they are not concerned about the customer at all. During training, you are taught to basically sweep problems under the rug and attempt to upsell the customer. There is a very high commission level that you are supposed to reach each month, considering the poor service the customers are given. This was an extremely stressful job with a high employee turnover rate. (Out of two training classes of 8-10 people each, only 3 remained when I left.)"
bad,I currently work for Frontier. Management is poor. Department to department relations is non existent. There is a lack of communication between departments. Base pay with commission. They mess with commission metrics so much you're lucky if you even hit it. The benefits are excellent. That’s the only real good thing about this job.
bad,"Fast paced"
bad,"Upper management has no clue as to how to be profitable.  Commissions are low and quota is unreasonable due to service availability.  Company is bleeding money and can not find a buyer, Recently laid off 200 sales reps. Best course for company would be bankruptcy. Support staff has no sense of urgency. Installs take months to complete. No money to expand network."
bad,"everything about this job is a con- the hours are crazy unless you have seniority, the management only cares about sells and meeting their personal quotas not helping you become a better version of yourself."
bad,"This was by far the absolute worst job I've ever had. They promised the potential for unlimited commissions on top of the hourly rate of pay. They fail to mention the amount of favoritism and nepotism that goes on with the company. If you are looking to advance your career and you are not a pretty female or you do not have family that works in management, then forget about it. Not happening...."
bad,"The upper management does not care about the lower level employees."
bad,"Get ready for a popularity contest. Education & skills do no matter. The most important is how you look and playing fake to get ahead. Don't expect to have a life outside of Frontier either. Before Verizon buy-out, life was better there. Now, not so much. A lot of fake people and bosses willing to lie, steal etc to keep themselves from being under fire. The only thing that keeps people there is the money, and sadly that has slowly declined."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"The only good thing about working for Frontier is the money, they throw it at you. Literally every other aspect of the job is terrible. Upper management ignores mid level management and there is no support at all. The culture is also very poor. Most people are only looking out for themselves and would stab you in the back in an instant. HR is also not on the employees side, you get the impression that they are always trying to find something on you. Work/life balance is great for anyone below management level since schedules are based on performance and seniority. The problem is they do this with management as well. Since there are only a handful of managers, it has no effect on your ranking, so if you have a bad schedule, you will be stuck with it until they hire more managers, which they are no longer doing for the foreseeable future. Would not recommend this place to my worst enemy."
bad,"Terrible leadership, lack of direction.  There is hardly any delegation of authority - decisions are made almost exclusively at the SLT (senior leadership team).  Bureaucratic and hard to get things done.  Employee morale is terrible.  Cross group collaboration is non-existent with fiefdoms everywhere."
bad,While Frontier communications does have middle of the road pay and benefits. The work environment is extremely stressful.
bad,Not a good time to be a part of this organization. Benefit coverage has been reduced while cost continues to increase year over year.   Poor direction and limited communication from management to front line employees.
bad,"Exceedingly poor company to work for. Manipulate their own computer programs to discredit and remove employees that dont make enough money for them. Extremely poor managers. Customer sevice reps can use illegal actions to add products onto customers account without permission, and instead of punishing them they give them a raise. FTR is a shady company. They mistreat their customers and their employees. The caliber of people they employ is extremely low. AVOID WORKING HERE AT ALL COSTS. They are not caring of personal work, breastfeeding, funeral time, holiday time, school, ect. You're better off flipping burgers!"
bad,"They have been closed down for business. They were not very friendly, they based 1 month for training on how to make a new customer in their system, but we worked in the retention department. We were not trained at all on proper techniques to keep customers from leaving. We were only being trained as if each customer we received a call from was a new customer."
bad,"Micromanaged, abrupt changes in direction, unrealistic expectations, each group works in silos, directors building independent empires, no synergy, no trust in employees - managers make all decisions"
bad,"This place is a disaster from the top down, at one time I would not make contact with my supervisor or manager for 2 months and could not do my job!  No equipment, no support."
bad,i would not quit mcdonalds to work here when it was commonwealth telephone company it was awesome to work there but now frontier bought them it became a miserable place to work
bad,"This company has too many issues to mention.  Senior leadership seems to make bad decision after bad decision, work groups operate in silos, commission structure is not adequate, etc..."
bad,Lack of clear corporate direction.  Too much internal conflict.  Departments work in silos using different tools and policies.  Communication is poor.  Little respect for workers.
bad,"I worked for this company for 6 months as a consultant training service reps in financial service and customer service. I was a retiree that went to work   temporarily. The equipment, processes, procedures and training materials were from another era (many years ago). I was expected to give 100% when the training that I recieved to train their employees was so terrible. If you have to work for any of these stupid fools, good luck. The rudest people I have ever worked with. I should have been a peer but was treated so badly. Never ever work for the training department. They are stupid and you have to take direction from them."
bad,"With the Capital One project, the management is the worst.  I advise not to work here ever.  They won't let you change your schedule, or to part-time if you start at full-time.  They say they are all about the employees, but don't have your back.  Didn't get a lunch break most the time, or other breaks."
bad,"old systems, dsl not good at all, if it works, pay scale for engineers are well below the industry standard , so I assume all other positions are as well.."
bad,"company cheats customers on their billing statement and products and services are unreliable. drives workers to the edge on overtime. mandatory overtime shifts which are unfit for any normal person lifestyle. health, family church, all goes away."
bad,"This company used to be a fun company to work for, they have taken it to a different level and they do not care about their employees any longer."
bad,was promised $20 an hr but only received $9.60. I cannot survive on that. There was no immediate supervisor. Old ATT employees can go into the system and steal your sales and nothing is done about it. The stress from Frontier was affecting my health
bad,I don't have much to say about this employer.  Not a very well managed company.  Benefits and pay were good.I liked the people I worked with.
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"Support daily business operation and problem resolution, migrating 100's of databases from old data center to new data center,  Setup and installed new databases to support various application environments.  trained DBA's,  Setup Data Guard and enterprise monitoring tools."
bad,Frontier Communications is hectic and fast paced due to the number of changes both internally and externally that are currently occurring. A perfect fit for thrill seekers
bad,"The maneger had more personal issues with people and I felt alot of racism from Management and employees. Working alone in the shop was a daily thing, unsafe equipment, they wouldn't allow you to bring tools."
bad,Sign of the times. Company is buried in debt and struggling in today’s telecommunications market. Upper management has been unsuccessful in trying to turn things around. Not sure how much longer they can survive.
bad,"Line managers are great - above that? Most poorly run company I've ever seen as an employee or investor. Selling off assets, losing customers in droves, and desperation moves by overmatched upper management - there is a reason stock value has lost over 95% in the last couple years."
bad,"The only thing keeping them afloat is some really good, dedicated people in the trenches. They have a tendency to run off top shelf talent."
bad,"Shady Company,. Greedy. This is a terrible employer. They make it clear every day that they do not care about employees, nor customers only money. Employees are treated like garbage, talked down to on regular basis.. They mess over your wages and do not report properly to IRS nor to Department of Labor.  I was audited as a result of an invalid W2.  Had to file amended return and was brow beaten about it and retaliate against as a result. Company is boiler room sales environment and has a high turn over of people quitting and being fired. Pays $12 hourly which is too low for the level of stress to retain all of the angry callers, and poor leadership. The so called commission is a joke because they keep changing the quota required for receiving a payout and the commission is taxed to death and added to your last pay check each month instead of wisely issued separately from pay period. You pay out even more taxes as a result of including it in your regular pay. This slick company Frontier Communications knows this is an additional tax disadvantage to employees but a tax benefit to the Corporation to handle commission payments this way. Terrible experience from start to finish."
bad,This is a sad story of a company that is not getting on board with the new realities in the market for technology.  They need to start rolling out fiber and get speed to their customers or they will continue to bleed customers to Comcast and others.
bad,Not able to balance family life.  No flexibility in time off for dr. appointments or child issues.  Poor communication between management and employees.  No job security.
bad,There was no work/life balance in my position whatsoever. There was not enough staff to cover the demand and the work hours were not reasonable or healthy. Highly stressful environment with extremely long hours. They used to have perks like free tickets to events and concerts but it is no longer offered. There are no incentives and no bonuses for certain management tiers. The salary equated to minimum wage considering the hours worked. Union employees have better health insurance rates. They no longer offer free purified water or coffee.
bad,"I love the work I do at Frontier. Unfortunately, when Frontier purchased most of Verizon's landline business, they stopped all expansion of the Fios product into new construction, decimated the management team, ceased all but online training, laid off local employees in favor of centralized call centers. The telecom industry is in decline generally but Frontier is leading the plummet with a 97% decline in stock value."
bad,strictly sales....the product is substandard....they expect you to sell this  to people who do not need it...the training is a joke....a lady got written up for being taken to the hospital.....IN A AMBULANCE...dont waste your time here
bad,"No job security, bumps possible from senior employees, relocation at times necessary, rules changes daily. Must do after work hours to keep up.  management cut throat and very self centered for their own security. Work has to be done after work hours to keep up with desired pace. Every key stroke, every work, every conversation live listened to and watched. "
bad,"Working here was like riding a bike that was on fire, the floor, and your desk was also on fire. You were scored based on metrics that were not fair. Great pay, and when I was there the benefits for insurance were great after I left and they had changed over I heard the benefits were not so hot, and hours were not flexible at all. It was full-time or nothing. "
bad,"Poor company to work for.  Management did not care what we had to do on a day to day basis and completely neglects their customer base.  The only thing that could be done over the phones for our great customer base is take their money.  99 of our day was trying to explain to customers why something went wrong with installs, billings, service interruptions, and many other things  Should be shut down.  The only thing that made this job worthwhile is the pay which was carryover from Verizon's union contract."
bad,Difficult environment when Company under tremendous financial constraints.  Great people.  Hardworking and passionate industry.  Corporate leadership is struggling.
bad,"remember no one in there is a friend , and although it has its benefits there are more cons than pros, not to mention their products are horrible. The Union is a required fee to pay , whether you want them or not and when you need them they do NOTHING, unless you are an old AT&T employee."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"HORRIBLE - that sums it up "
bad,Everything is knee jerk reaction after the fact.  Management has no idea what it happening in the trenches.  Very hard to get anything done.  They need to slow down and follow through with existing plans before undertaking new projects.
bad,"If you like taking advantage of people, work here. Frontier wants you to deceive customers, Then when the company does not perform the CSR are blamed."
bad,"Received rusty/dusty laptop off junk pile first day of work and sent to Training with defective computer. Everyday life completely opposite to picture portrayed at interview. Job site located in drug-infested location with U.S. Armory appearance of 1940s. There are so many different processes as a result of various corporate acquisitions, no collaboration of systems under one procedure. There is no employee handbook. First two hours of the day spent booting up my computer with involvement of IT. "
bad,"The typical day at work consist of receiving calls from customers assisting them with networking, wireless, slow speeds, computer issues, email, pc tune ups, and security sales and installs. I enjoy helping the customer with educating, recommending and assisting the customers and co-workers with related pc issues. The hardest part of the job is the keeping up with the consistent changes on processes and changes made by the company that are not clearly thought out or defined before implemented. The most enjoyable part of my job is when I am able to educate an assist a customer with a pc issue for resoulution."
bad,"Micro-managed,  management with little or no idea of systems or how to implement them.  Human resources is a joke.  No one wants to do their job and is quick to point the finger."
bad,"Trainging is 6 weeks, if you fall behind in class you might as well hang it up for the day. You are only given the very basics,  everything else is hear-say from other reps for learning tricks/trades of the job. Do not miss work unless you have vacation time or you get a verbal / written up.( there is zero room/ tolerance for error if you miss. You will take back to back calls with very little help, so be prepared to figure it out on your own. You will only have 2 hrs personal time to use the bathroom only, and that's 2 hrs a month, if you go over you can be disciplined and  can lead up to termination. Learn your job security is a day by day thing at frontier. You coached when needed and are forced to sell regardless. They are union , but the union WILL NOT HELP YOU they side with the company because they also work for the same people we do. You will be 100%on your own . FRONTIERS MOTO IS DONT GO IT ALONE, HOWEVER I ASSURE YOU YOU WILL GO IT ALONE ."
bad,Job is horrible. You work in the disconnects department (retention) but yet you have to make sales . They have you selling products that do not work . You miss on day of work expect to have a discussion. Only way an absent us excuses you have to have FMLA.
bad,Very hectic and confusing at times because supervisor and management had no clue on how to help. If you are not a self learner you could be overwhelmed.
bad,"micro manage,not too concerned about customer,does not provide the appropriate needs to do the work,management does not value workers concerns or suggestions."
bad,Terrible management!  Failing company.  This company has no idea how to retain customers.  All failures are due to poor management and an aging plant.  No money spent on maintenance of plant.
bad,"You will be constantly harassed by second level management or directors. If there is a problem with anything, no one knows what to do. The only people held accountable for anything withing the company appear to be the techs at the bottom of the totem pole."
bad,"- I cannot recommend this organization in its current iteration. It has the ability to do great things, but they continue to lose money and share value. "
bad,"company has a good base pay rate, but bonus pay matrix favored the employees who were good at or allowed to avoid calls and those that were proficient at scamming the customer to buy extra services they did not need., and sometimes never authorized."
bad,"No raises in 2 years, job atmosphere has changed and not really motivating to work for company anymore. The employees wanted to go for a union and employees were slowly let go for anything to save money. Managers dont know job. Especially Harvey."
bad,"Over the course of my career with Frontier I have seen numerous CEOs and executive individuals come in and basically pillage the company of it’s wealth in work force.  Product improvement has been absent from the reality, despite claims of enormous investment.  Resources were disposed and deficits were acquired.  Executives blame the workforce for their unachieved goals, while depriving the workforce of the much-needed tools and equipment."
bad,I love this job but hate the way the company is run. The benefits are fantastic and my co-workers are very helpful and friendly. Management is poor and needs more structure.
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"After years of putting in a lot of hardwork for this company and getting my compensation and bonuses changed every other month to ensure we get less money after working to meet their original goals I managed to move up and relocated just before they closed my old office, just in time for them to close the new office. Frontier would rather get rid of the employees they can train and track and actually do the job in favor of untrained vendors who repeatedly made bigger issues. Much more interested in gathering up new areas and not converting properly instead of fixing what they already owned."
bad,Ive worked at this job for two years and it has been very stressful . The co workers are great and the pay you get is unreal but after a while the payment is almost not worth it because the job will leave you exgusted and mentally drained.
bad,"Micromanaging is rampant. Too much emphasis on sales, not enough emphasis on customer service. Hardest part of the job was being threatened constantly with termination if I didn't meet metrics. Workplace culture is hostile and management does not communicate. Processes vary from person to person and no straight answers are given."
bad,"The company is focusing On copper upgrades instead of deploying more fiber or working On the fiber network. as far as advancement in technology, the company is going backwards. It was still a challenge and I enjoyed the work, but since Frontier took over, its not a company I see a bright future in. Also, I was part of a union with the company, and I'm not a fan of unions to say the least."
bad,"Typical day is call after call without proper tools to do the job effectively. I learned a good deal from call center, management was lacking big time."
bad,"Performance (sales) demands are unrealistic.  Zero flexibility for sick days or necessary personal business time.  You get penalty points for being late, or being sick.  You have to be on the phone every second that you are scheduled to be on.  6 minutes of potty break time per day."
bad,"Too many Chiefs and No leadership, bad decisions, Too much money paid to management, not enough people in departments to work efficiently, closing too many depts. to get work done."
bad,"two years working here the money just couldn't keep me. anymoe The company is not a good one. management is backwards. vendors and offsore reps get most of the sales credit while you fix their errors. customers are rarely ever happy. it's just stressful and the goals are tough to reach. very, very sales oriented, not for me."
bad,"No balance for life at home and work.   Constantly stressed.  Management needs a lot of work.  Over worked and under paid.  The plus side, you have great health insurance to cover the many health issues the place causes."
bad,company went through to many changes in procedures and then got bought out by sykes daily the work was easy working with online accounts for quickbooks online
bad,"Verizon was an awesome place to work, the whole dynamic changed when frontier took over. Everybody was always on pins and needles and scared they were going to get fired all the time. Frontier also blamed the employees bc their product sucked after they took over."
bad,"I loved working and going into work every morning, the benefits are wonderful, the people around you are great, the way you are trained is good... But somehow in the past 6 months this company has been going completely down hill. They increased our bonuses and then lowered them 3 months after. Management never listened to our concerns and pretty much laughed off anything we told them. Coaches are useless, they spend their day on their cellphones and refusing to help agents but they are the first to start micro managing if they see even the slightest amount of laughter or talking with other agents on your team."
bad,I worked for Frontier for under a year. I enjoyed working with my immediate supervisor but this was not the job for me. I enjoy dealing with customers but this company expected too much for the low salary they provided. The perks were not sufficient for the work.
bad,"A typical day at work is being on the phones all day doing customer service and sales.  Management walks around like hawks harassing you to sell things and make you feel horrible for not selling their services.  They even email a list to all the salesmen showing how bad you are to shame you for being a bad salesman.  They pull you off the phones to harass you about how bad you are.  The center I worked at was the number one center in the world, and even on days when we were beating all the other centers in sales, management would still tell us we were doing horrible and could do better.  They would also look for any reason to write you up.  When I worked there, I was dead inside and the only reason I stayed was for the money and the benefits.  I learned that keeping a job that kills you inside just for the money and benefits is literally bad for your health and not worth it.  My coworkers were nice, but you can tell they are as dead inside as I was.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all of the FMLA paperwork, because any time you were sick or had to take off to care for a family member you had to go through weeks of calls back and forth to the company that handled the FMLA because they always messed it up (to which the company later admitted after several employees were disciplined or fired because of).  The most enjoyable part of the job used to be the nice bonuses several years ago (iPads, hundreds of dollars in gift certificates, high end electronics) but now they push around a shopping cart with snacks from the vending machine as ""bonuses"" for selling things."
bad,This is a company that started off after the Verizon takeover with a good ratio of management to non management workers. Since then however it appears that for every 1 staff position 5 management positions appear to oversee that person.
bad,"When I was first hired I loved it. But then they got greedy. They bought Verizon property then we could not get people out to help our customers. Our techs would deny jobs show up late just leave work early you name it. This caused us to get all the negative calls and management didn't care. We were told many times that the calls are the same as always and just do our job. They refused to listen to us. Take into account before the ""changeover"" with Verizon, out of maybe 25 to 30 people I'd say 15 to 20 were making commission then afterwards roughly 5 maybe were however the calls did not change, we just got worse I guess."
bad,"Was very stressful, treated fairly by management ,overall a decent job if you can handle the stress. The venifits were pretty good and the time off was decent"
bad,Management ask for unattainable goals and when you can't obtain their goals you will be written up. Management has no clue about field procedures. They are very quick to write the technicians up. Be prepared to be micromanaged ans stressed if you are emplyeed by Frontier!!
bad,"Company is undergoing a serious culture change as it is struggling financially. Processes as set by various groups within the company and changes frequently, leaving employees confused and unable to efficiently perform tasks. My group is now concerned more about the quantity instead of the quality of the job. "
bad,"I enjoyed the people of Frontier, however, the rules & options for bonuses are very strict. The environment can be very productive, but the parking was a bit extreme."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"I was hired as a contract employee awaiting the conversion to complete from buyout. Then we were abruptly let go 45 days sooner than contract."
bad,Working with Verizon and in teams based on technology;  made coming to work enjoyable .Since frontier was basic new company;  that made for a confusion.
bad,"The overall culture is quite friendly and they encourage participation.  However, management never explains changes, understands them, and you always get different answers based on each individual you ask."
bad,They refuse to put money into the networks and not spend the time doing maintenance or upgrades. The upper management team has no idea how to run a profitable business or treat people!
bad,"Frontier is a really tough place to work if you actually care about people, and want to actually help them out. You are hindered by poor computer system interface, and the abundance of other employees doing down right unethical things in order to make money. If you want to be in an atmosphere where mostly everyone is unhappy about their work and lack of ability to help when they were actually interested in doing so."
bad,My job was to work with my Network Supervisors so that we could provide the best technical assistance to our customers.  Also partially responsible for helping the sales reps make their sales numbers.
bad,This place is going under fast. All the managers have been let go in the last 1.5. The work is spread out far and wide. Some people now have travel as far as 3 states if they want to keep their jobs now.
bad,"The culture at Frontier Communications is extremely stressful. Their process and procedures are  outdated. They have no updated computerized system which makes it very difficult to meet customer expectation. Executive management is top heavy. I left this company because I did not share their values, and customer focus was not a priority. Frontier is very disorganized and lack stellar products and services."
bad,it was a poor company to work for was laid off after six months. due to company moving work load to west coast. the money was great but two weeks notice of lay off was poorly handled
bad,answer incoming collection calls loved my co-workers but our job was not protected with the company when they took over Commonwealth
bad,"I have never worked for a company that cared so little for its employees. All but two of a management staff of 7 actually knew their job.  Their idea of training is to hand you a piece of paper with poorly written instructions and say do this, then you receive a poor performance appraisal for not knowing your job.  TOTAL mismanagement and disarray but if someone of upper management visits your location everyone is instructed on how to dress. This is to give a deceitful look as if they are a well run operation. This couldn't be further from the truth.  Employees are treated like second grade students and the office operations manager is as fake and phony as the weave she wears on her head."
bad,"The job pays well,but the goals are way to high, They go up every month. If you do not meet this goal you are written up and will be let go if it happens 3 months in a row. If this company is all about customer service then why do they push sales instead of customer services. This job is so stressful you are on pins and needles everyday fearing you might say or do something wrong. The listen to your calls and provide feedback. Make you feel like they do not trust thier employees to do the job they trained them to do. So all I can say is nice people at this job but the stress is unbearable and if I did not need the money to feed my family I would not have put up with this. So like most that are there we need a job and they know that so they can do what ever they want to us and we take it. Please Frontier go back to being customer services and not all about the sale and the company would be a lot better place to work and a better company to do business with."
bad,"Answered 50 to 70 calls a day answered questions, went over billing, was also part of the sales team and setup new accounts daily also, had to leave because the environment wasn’t good for me any longer"
bad,Frontier doesnt have the resources to maintain the telecommunication status that Verizon had they are ill prepared to handle customers demand or needs they outsourced work to other companies that do not have the customer best interest. The are not loyal to customer or employees the reason the pay stays good is because the union fights daily to maintain the workers right
bad,Most of the management above supervisor level are just yes men who pass work off the everyone they can. The CEO ran company into the ground in 3 years.
bad,"This place is a joke. Outdated lines and equipment which makes for extremely unhappy customers that, as an employee, you get to deal with on a daily basis. The training is way below average and they shove you pretty much blind out on the floor. There is a total lack of communication from the higher ups. An example of this is:"
bad,"I don’t really have anything else to say about Frontier other than if you choose to apply there, do yourself a favor and apply for a work from home position,"
bad,"Frontier Communications paid it's employees an above average wage, but they treated their employees in a wrongful way. Weekly, we would get emails about how we need to strive to get better, even though we were beating the other 7 Frontier call centers in sales every month. Everyday employees would get sales emails stating, ""If we don't do better, then maybe this isn't the job for you."" A very demotivating company to work for in the end."
bad,"Client asked us to improve customer service, than found we spend too much time with customers, and put policies in place that prevented good customer service, which created a lot of unhappy customers. We were penalized if customers were not please with their customer service experience."
bad,I learned that a sales environment was not for me. I clocked in on my computer and stared at the time until shift end. I didnt mind talking with the customers but I didn't like to make a sale to customers that I knew were not wanting to be sold something when I couldn't fix their issue that they currently had.
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit. The pipe dream they guaranteed to Frontier and the employees they did not honor. They changed all the policies after the grace receiving period. Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,This place can change on a dime so be prepared. the thing they ask you to do are repetitive and tedious. Half of the stuff doesnt make sense and the systems are ridiculously flawed. Being threatened on a daily about job security. just overall bad experiences. There are some shining moments but i would not recommend this job to anyone
bad,"I loved working for GTE, then changed to Verizon, then Frontier."
bad,"We constantly misquote and miss bill customers.  There is no integrity.  Verbal contracts are refused to be honored.  Early Termination fees are charged for customer getting almost no discounts, but have their term auto renewed, and this is never covered verbally with customers, just a message on a bill.  New fees constantly added to customers account.  No communication between management and reps in the trenches to see how we can improve.  All rep empowerment has been removed, cannot even process a credit of 4.50 if we feel its valid."
bad,"Everything that is pitched to prospective new hires in the recruitment meeting ends up being hollow.  Zero opportunity for advancement, even for the most qualified of agents who spent more than a year taking calls full-time."
bad,"General day at work includes caring for field tech issues, network provisioning, outage maintenance, internal tech support.  I have learned a lot about Telecom and various provisioning systems and element management systems."
bad,Horrible management poorly ran company from top to bottom    no outlook  compnay constantly changing things   services are poor and customers complain of outages or not working at all
bad,"Too busy buying up new territory instead of fixing issues and letting representatives go to cover the loss of revenue from customers. Not a lot of training and no responsibility when a mistake is made. I really love my coworkers and my direct supervisors and we all work to help each other, but there is not enough of us who care in the company overall. Now our center is closing because they want to look better for investors and they still constantly lose customers due to poor experience from all sides."
bad,Frontier is going under!! you do not want to work here they blame the employees for them losing customers but it's really frontiers issues because they don't provide a reliable service!! they keep screaming save frontier but they need to just throw in the towel!!!
bad,"Frontier doesn't upgrade their network. They're customer service and quality is poor. The stock price is dropping like a rock. Do not bother applying for any position,"
bad,Self involved hateful people. No moral complained about job constantly. Hatefull toward each other. No diversity in my workplace. Discrimination ignored. 9 years of torture for a paycheck. The pay was good though.Finally had enough.
bad,"Not only are there services very poor, but, the way they treat employees is not favorable to keep employees.  They rush some people through training, they take employees family members over complete new hires and baby them along.  While letting go of the new hires."
bad,Company not moving forward. The employees are paid well but they don't allow for people to move up within the company. The union setting doesn't allow.
bad,"Hired under a Verizon Contract, Frontier bought them out. Contract negotiations and fear of job replacement led to me accepting the buyout offered to me by Frontier and pursuing another career."
bad,"My manager was sleeping w a new team member, her husband found out...drama...nothing but drama here...if you like to kiss people's butts, then go for it"
bad,"The company is going down fast, the pay is good, but who knows for how much longer. They are looking to get rid of employees as fast as possible. I would avoid if possible."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"Since the take over from ATT, I did not like the direction the company was going."
bad,"During my experience with Frontier I trained Verizon employees on the Frontier systems and processes. Frontier has acquired Verizon properties in Florida, Texas and California. I trained a total of 5 - 3 week classes and provided floor support to the students after training. "
bad,upper management is pathetic. shows no remorse for firing half of the front men and just keeps churning and burning through them.
bad,Will give in person only- I can supply customer appreciation notes etc. Frontier has a manager I don't care for and I would like to work in a more progressive company
bad,"There is opportunity at this company for new hires, however, they are currently in downsizing mode.  Therefore more senior employees are having their positions eliminated and new employees are thus able to transition into various positions that open up."
bad,"The company has no organization. I had a medical condition the company would not acknowledge, And I was not even allowed to talk to HR and explain my medical situation. Even with 4 different doctors notes and explanations!"
bad,"Management doesn't have a clue about telecommunications, the GM's big telecommunications position prior to being the GM was sales in the wireless area."
bad,"management showed favoritism towards certain employees, let them get away with murder almost. co-workers were very caddy and unprofessional. the job its self was relatively easy and there were times when I loved my job but the environment just puts you in a horrible mood which lasts all day and I found I started loosing myself to the negative energy."
bad,"It started out good at Frontier. However, after a large financial purchase, the company was unable to handle their business any longer. The prices are increased weekly. The customer service just disappeared. The customers are treated horribly and given no options of help or relief. The stress level is extremely high and the business has become too unethical and shady in their dealings to continue. Not to mention, most all employees are unhappy so you are treated very poorly by eveyone. The numbers are so exceedingly difficult to make that it is next to impossible and they are raised to unattainable levels monthly. I don’t foresee the company in business for much longer."
bad,Company hire temps and they are forced to pay union dues. Contract employees are not given any benefits of able to take any days off. After contract is completed; contract employees are not hired for full time benefits.
bad,"I did like Frontier, but as time has gone by (month 4 of employment now), it just gets worse. Computer systems crash more often than they should. The commission is pretty good (if you actually hit quota). They started me in residential service and they require a seven week training course which is fine, but they don't tell you until you're in training that this is ""customer service with minimal sales."" Then, when you get to the floor and start taking phone calls you realize its a selling on position."
bad,"Frontier lacks investment in their employees across the board. Network investments are limited based on financial concerns. Customers view Frontier less than a core service provider and that of a regional player in the market at best. There are some really good people there, but if not cared for they will end up moving on."
bad,"Company is poorly managed and upper management continously makes poor decisions that are rarely thought out, often cause issues accross the board in sales/fullfillment and make literally everyones work life needlessly difficult and stressful"
bad,Peers are great to work with. Company is not investing back into the area. The culture created recently has everyone walking on egg shells every day. Worried.
bad,"Frontier used to be a career choice, but now is just a job. The leadership has moved to a micromanaging level. Have taken all decision abilities away from employees."
bad,"Good company to work for if you're meeting your monthly target/goals for a commission. The money is the main driver here....and it shows. "
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"The company froze raises and bonuses for 3 years for anyone NOT in a union role, or under Executive Vice President level.  Then the stock tanked and a large RIF was done.  There are fewer employees and more work.  No one can keep up and management doesn't care.  They just don't.  The ability to move laterally or up is hamper by leadership.  Yes, they will stop you from taking other positions, due to the needs of your current role."
bad,This company has lost its way. When I started with Frontier I truly thought that this company actually cared about both its customers and the employees. However sense 2016 the company has lost its way. After buying several areas from Verizon the company botched the transition and has never truly recovered. The company is now only about sales and customer service has gone to the wayside. The company has cut back drastically on internal employees and depends to much on 3rd party vendors to sell and provide customer service. These vendors do not care about customer service and only care about sales as that is how they are compensated.
bad,There isn't any direction other than survive another day. Too many meeting with the expectation that you are still produce like you could spend all day not meeting. They tend to put people into positions to fail and then ding them for it. Probably the worst move in my career.
bad,Don’t work here if u aren’t desperate. Horrible company and management. Hours suck!! No organization. Overall the worst job I ever had. Wouldn’t recommend this place for my worst enemy
bad,"They switch you from one Dept to another and don't provide adequate training. Floor support is not the best ,some of the managers wouldn't even give you the time if day."
bad,"Management doesn't really listen to the people on the phones who make this place run, moral is horrible , and the working environment is stressful, co-workers are great."
bad,"I was with the company for over 5 years. When I started there were about 4 million customers. After a couple more acquisitions the customer base went up to over 12 millions. Between too many acquisitions back to back, poor business decisions, and poor contracts with the union represented; you have to fear for your job after every quarter. A woman was let go after 39 years. She found out on her 39th anniversary. Now it that isn't shady I don't know what the heck is! The contract I worked in was negotiated poorly, but the health benefits are great. The health benefits are ranked one of the highest in the state. Being promoted is based on who wants to be the next puppet working 50-60 hours per week, and being paid for 40 hours only. "
bad,"On a daily basis I have back to back project meetings to review Requirements and Project Scopes. Then tend to team meeting for Product Backlog Grooming, User Story creation and other ceremony meetings."
bad,"Poor Management.  No investment in infrastructure.  Relying on 40 year old copper for growth. Slow processes internally ""this is the way we have always done this procedure"""
bad,"It's it as okay job, handling a lot of problems with billing and angry customers most of the day but the pay is okay.  Its from home so the environment isn't bad just having to deal with issues that could've been fixed but customers call all day  saying how bad the company is can weigh on you at times"
bad,working with frontier would of been fine is the services worked and provided the customers with what they needed to do . the internet is not reliable depending on where you live or if your in high demand . and then on top of that to even get service is a hassle with in its self.
bad,Used to love this place then they constantly changed management and ceo's now its chasing the drain.They buy more territory and expect employees to pay for it with benefits and pay cuts .
bad,"The training process followed by the Sherburne assignment center is excellent. Well informed and they have teachers that convey the material. That being said the same processes are not followed universally as a company which results in many complications."
bad,"While I met some wonderful people working here, I also found that they play favorites. Advancement is not usually based on talent or skill, but who you know and if they like you or not. They also adopt the punish all instead of one type of management. If one person did something stupid, everyone got punished for it. The other thing that sticks out is that when presented with evidence of harassment by a team against a particular team member to the point that this person was afraid to come to work, management said they ""looked into it"" and nothing was ever done. When brought up again, they told the individual that they were being overly dramatic. They really showed that they didn't care about their employees."
bad,"great company as far as benefits but plenty room for growth. but professional wise the employees such as supervisors and higher employees will steep on you to come up , please be mindful of whom you trust. worked for the company for many years worked my way to the top and was dropped down to a lower level with no investigation . work is work and home is home but you have no personal life with mandatory overtime with no say so. this is a new company so, be mindful before you decide to work there."
bad,"It is a good place to work if you never want to advance, if you don't mind lack of communication and such."
bad,"I applied to this job to pay off my student loans and to save up money to leave Connecticut. I'm grateful for the opportunity because I paid off all my debt within less than a year of getting the job, but this is the worst job experience I've ever had. The management never wants to do their jobs and for how bad the work environment is, the pay just isn't enough. We have terrible systems, so it's difficult to help customer's and the supervisor's refuse to help you when a customer is demanding to speak to them. Unprofessional place, working here has broken me down mentally."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"The employees that have been there for years, many don’t know their jobs and are in the position due to seniority, don’t want to learn but be told what to do and only do that. The supervisors don’t know what the employees are doing or anything about the job, they only monitor the ACD(telephoned). Who’s taking calls and who are not. They have no minds of their own and if they speak out against the culture or the MANAGER they are terminated. And with the company in downward spiral I would wait until the old regime leaves and someone else buys them before I would even consider working there. So beware and be warned."
bad,"Rochester workplace no longer exists.  Management made some mistakes and decided it was a good place to eliminate to reduce overhead, Undisputed top location for prviding technical support eliminated in the name of cost cuts"
bad,"The job used to be excellent, but has taken a strong downturn over the last 3 years. Customers are generally pleasant, but micro-management and constant back-to-back calls have left people feeling burned out and ready to leave. Advancement opportunities have been taken away and our resources have dwindled to almost nothing."
bad,I am the lead engineer here for Frontier Communications in my area and am not receiving Comissions that align with the amount of Revenue I bring into the company. My Manager is not qualified to lead Sales Engineering and does not compliment our good work nor does he provide any guidance or assistance with Customers I know they have a weak management platform here at Frontier.
bad,Frontier Communication is not recommended. My recommendation is to avoid the Telecommunication industry altogether if possible. It is volatile and unstable at best.
bad,It has been a while since I worked there I took early retirement. When I first started working there it was a small telephone Company. It was then bought by another company and so on till Frontier took over.
bad,"The company had a lot of favoritism, hardly any advancement, the company failed to inform updated prodecdures and polices. Hardly any recourse for customers wanting assistance. Overall a highly sales driven company that only cares about sales no matter the cost."
bad,"Company has a solid base of under utilized employees, leadership within the company has failed to develop and share a strategic plan for the future of the organization. Wage suppression for front line employees has been in place for two years."
bad,"Some of the best and worst frontline managers you'll ever work with. They have some serious process issues. Very typical to not be trained on tools and products in a timely fashion."
bad,"Frontier is a non player in the market.  The company has disintegrated over the last 3 years.  It was a great place to work for the first year in the market and spiraled after that.  Senior leadership is out of touch, implementing programs and policies which just don't make any difference.  It's too bad, it could have been a real force.  The company's former CEO was a disaster, shooting from the hip and management followed like sheep.  No dissension when they knew a program was going to fail and admitting that to their reports. Bullying and harassing culture. No winning....run away."
bad,"8am to 5pm"
bad,"My job at Frontier Communications was a challenging role that I excelled at as along as I was able to proceed.  I have learned how to work on my own, being able to multiple task under high pressure job. I was left to my own to handle all daily functions- allowing me to finish the jobs in a timely matter."
bad,"Top management lacks respect for employees with considerable experience. Treated ex-Verizon employees disrespectively. Reduced their pay, then laid them off."
bad,"The mangers are a joke , they dont want to work and it was a very stressful place.I really have not one good thing to say . They make it sound real good to work for and it is the most stressful place . They have the NERVE TO GRADE YOU ON SURVEYS FROM CUSTOMERS .And the customer were mad at the company ,you still get a bad grade. Pass this Company  ."
bad,"Fast paced environment.  Perfect for someone who is self sufficient, self motivated and can resolve conflicts without supervision.   Work with Technicians in the field who are excellent at their craft."
bad,Upper management is always over promising and under delivering.  They put process in place with no though to outcomes of those situations.  CEO pulled our bonuses and blames middle management for decline of the business even though our customers and stock prices have done nothing but drop since he took over.
bad,Very poor upper management.... Top down driven company has pretty much ruined what was once a great place to work...retired VZN personnel have been hired by Frontier which has led to a demise in customer service.
bad,"expensive health insurance for management"
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"Long hours, unrealistic expectations.  Heavy workloads for the majority of personnel I have had involvement with.  Need clearer definition of company policies and strict adherence to these."
bad,Nothing is Secure/ financially failing from verizon aquizition. they ask an extreme amount of work per person. Departmanets fail to work togeterh well. Lack of communication. Poor materizals to work with.
bad,"I took this job for the tech support aspect, which that is what you get, but if you don't sell on every call then this place is not for you.  Our job is tech support, not salesman, and salesman is what they want.  Now don't get me wrong, the incentives to sell are great, and the services that they offer are good, but I'm not a salesperson, I got this job for tech support.  The pay is by no means the greatest, the hours could be better.  When people call Frontier, they are typically calling before their internet doesn't work, but before they get off the phone you have to try and sell them something, so even though you may not have fixed the original reason for the call you are already trying to get them to spend more money.  Frontier needs to focus on working/fixing the equipment for the existing customers and not try to expand and get more customers."
bad,I never felt inspired and never got any sort of direction from team members when it comes to new technology or directions for the company. Too many different projects being worked on at high levels to propel the company into growing and advancing with technology.
bad,"missing hours, computers breaking down making is impossible to look up clients information.  Customers calling in for 2nd time cause issues weren't taken care of."
bad,"Lying was part of the job, you sell horrible product at horrible prices as if they were equal or greater to compettitors. Communications equipment is still in the DSL(Copper/Dual Copper) cabling throughout most all states, except four, which is a lot less than the fiber optics that most cable companies can now offer in almost all areas."
bad,"The wages and benefits are good and the actual work is enjoyable, the management has become completely cut throat."
bad,"Sell home phone, internet, Dish network.  Base salary + commissions."
bad,"I worked for approximately 8 months at Frontier communications. In that time, I was told 3 different ways to keep my job, countless ways to do my job, and was fired after following advice for sales that did not improve my sales figures."
bad,Job paid well. But the company as it stands is going to fall apart. Genuinely tried to better the company and was punished. The best part of the job was my other associates and the customers which I genuinely feel bad for.
bad,I was taught  if you do not have something good to say about someone ( in this case Frontier) don't say anything at all!   That being said .. Co-workers are good people
bad,"I tried to like it, the money was fantastic (commission at least, on average made 1500-2700 in commission alone)."
bad,it was a place that was not organized and needs a lot of improvement  ca lot of client concern about the service they received and not a lot of resolution
bad,"The good new is there is a lot of work to be done.  The bad news it, there is a lot of work to be done.  Overwhelmed with demands that are unattainable."
bad,"Was a great place to work, the only down fall was that the Managers had no clue what they were doing (They hired anyone to be a Manager)"
bad,"I started as an IHD technician. I was a DSL internet help desk tech. I was hired before Frontier took over Verizon Fios in 3 states. Once that happened the job went swiftly downhill. There was no organization. The customers were very unhappy with their services and felt like they didn't have a say in the matter of Frontier taking over. Frontier's network technology couldn't keep up with the bandwidth requirement of these customers. It was back to back calls every day with very little training or floor support. "
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,Struggle working on systems that were placed in the early 80s.  Hard to find parts for repairs and some of the field plant is over 50 years old.  Not keeping up with the times to compete with other companies in the phone and internet world that we live in.
bad,"Can’t make up their minds what should be done or by whom. Contracting work to substandard contractors is not a solution when qualified, highly trained personnel are being “let go”"
bad,Stressful enivornment with little to no direction from immediate supervision.  Archaic system for all circuit designs.  Frequent system crashes and frequent loss of stored data.
bad,Company started as fun and enjoyable till acquisitions were made over 2 year period that really shined a light on company products and how management handled changes after realizing mistakes made during that time
bad,"Just look at the stock prices.  This is not the place you want to work, and upper management has no idea what a chain of command is, or why it is in place."
bad,"Going into the job I made assumptions that proved to be wrong.  I feel that the support I required to make the transition to a new computer operating system, a new language, and a new workplace was not strong enough."
bad,Pay was fluid therefore difficult to manage your financial needs with family and life needs. Middle management worked very well together however senior leadership did not communicate proactively or effectively.
bad,The emphasis is on sales not actually helping the customer. I had great bosses but the drive to get sales was more stress than I would have wanted for a career.
bad,"This place feels like a high school with an incompetent principal. Rumors fly and favoritism runs rampant. They fire the good supervisors and customer service reps, and leave the ones who are inexperienced, lazy, or condescending. You do work well above your paygrade with no recognition, and you get blamed for poor business performance, by the incompetent CEO. Avoid this job if you can."
bad,"They offer you support. "
bad,No overtime. Won't make repairs for customers. They don't even seem to care about her clients. If you are working on a problem for a client and its time to go back to the office you are to stop and explain that you will have to come back the next day. Frontier only cares about the bottom line and not there clients or there workers.
bad,"the job has poor management and is very territorial. you were told you would make X amount weekly and then when hired it  was actually about half, you must make the sales but sales are not easy to make."
bad,"The site leader for sales tries to increase sales through fear driven incentives. As a result, morale is very low. Trying to advance through residential sales is very difficult because many departments seem to operate on the 'Buddy system.' It seems acceptable to hire old friends, as opposed to even interviewing a more qualified existing employee of 6 years."
bad,Clear disconnect between upper management and field ops. Some of the decisions made have negatively impacted the overall customer experience. Evidence has shown that Frontier's churn has negatively impacted the company's value.
bad,"Frontier communications does not care about its employees or its customers."
bad,"If you're a robot, and you don't care about personal gain or advancement, by all means this is the place for you. The pay is wonderful, the benefits are great, but management and overall morale is horrible. No one, and I do mean NO ONE that isn't in upper management is happy there. The turn over rate is sky high and the tools they give to do your job are literally archaic. There are good people that work here and much to learn from them. But run far far away if at all possible. Go work at 7-11."
bad,"If you like to be micro managed and be watched everywhere you go. Then you must like prison. If your not at your desk you must not be working mentality. VP walks around and checks if your there at AM and PM to see if your on time. Be prepared to pass the blame it's always someone else's fault. If you do perform well be prepared to get more work assigned. "
bad,Great company to work for. Training was limited and resources for help were limited. Overall very flexible and great team of people. Needs to work on improving current services before obtaining more.
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit. The pipe dream they guaranteed to Frontier and the employees they did not honor. They changed all the policies after the grace receiving period. Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"A typical day is taking 60-100 call per day, dealing with frustrated customers and explaining why their service has been turned off when they haven't paid their bill in 4 months. When hired you are constantly reminded that you are ""low man on the totem pole"" by getting the worst shift possible and never being able to get time off in the summer and/or around the holidays. The pay is pretty low for what they expect of you, not to mention you risk the chance of being shot or stabbed walking from the building to your car.."
bad,"While the pay is phenomenal, it does not make up for the lousy management, corporate policies, or stress of the job. They are entirely inflexible with schedules."
bad,"this company is very unorganized, it is also very messy as far as personal business, you basically live at your job, no holidays are off, time off is hard to get"
bad,"Over 7 ""managers"" in 5 years - most not interested in employees; very little guidance from management; very little credit for accomplishments; learned plenty since left to ""figure it out for myself""; co-workers wonderful"
bad,"Working in IT, management is awful, can not say its a nice place to work, the older managers/directors/team leads can't really manage or maybe just the ones I worked for need to have some morals and some people skills too because their rash methods infects newer employees.  Telephone lines service is a declining industry and so that may have some bearing job culture and employment prospects.  The team i was on was awful but there are some nice people there and I really like the city of Rochester, NY and if there is a great job at a great company there I would definitey consider going back to Rochester."
bad,"pleasant people to be around but systems are outdated.  it is very unorganized and advancement opportunities seemed non-existent. They did not appreciate experienced people and promoted young non experienced people. They did treat their employees quite well but seemed to not be concerned with customers who were having repeated problems.  An 'oh well' attitude seemed to prevail. Would promise customers that a tech would be out to fix problem, and then did not make it a priority to get one there. Not a company that one was proud to work for.  Removing i.d. card after leaving the building was paramount."
bad,"I've worked for this company for the past 4yrs (after it purchased Verizon landlines) and there still is no direction from upper management. Once something is in place, they change it the next day. Employees have no idea who does what anymore. Circus!"
bad,Company is experiencing tough times.. Poor job security.   It is a job.
bad,a typical worked: if you don't like to work hard don't apply at this company you will answer 100+ calls daily.
bad,It is a work at home job. It is supposed to be a customer service job but is almost completely sales. Since it is work at home there is no culture created by the company and you get a feeling of isolation.
bad,"Going unnoticed is best here. if you are too good at your job, you will be critizised for not moving further, but if you do a bad job, they will not fire you since they need the people. they just give you horrible hours. People are cool, business is not worker friendly."
bad,"Answer calls, answer customers questions and notate the account. Help the customer with their account and close accounts upon the request of the customer."
bad,"This was once a very strong company with a clear path and direction.  Recently the executive management team has become myopic and they simply have no idea how to run a successful sales organization. "
bad,"Plenty of irate customers to help, many have had on-going issues for over a year. Management has no vision and doesn't seem to understand the business they are in. "
bad,"Frontier management says they have an open door policy and will listen and take constructive criticism, but in reality they listen and then ignore. It’s a really negative place to work because leadership continues to make poor decisions and this creates fear and h certainty around the employees as you continually watch other departments or staff members loose their job because their position has been eliminated, or at least eliminated in that office, and there is no offer to reclassify or move."
bad,Company suffering from poor management. They are unsure of the direction they should go. Sales tools are old and out-dated. Company need to re-evaluate how they process a sale after agreement has been signed.
bad,"Company losing customers like crazy, stock is close to being a penny stock now.  If you want a long career, don't stop here. Employee benefits and pay have also been cut."
bad,Lots of opportunity for the company to grow but management is taking company backwards and the public hates us..The company could turn it around if they would put the customer first and place money back in the infrastructure.
bad,"They did take care of us as employees we had good break rooms and food, but the job itself was very stressful. Training was pretty fast and I don't think it fully prepared employees"
bad,"Decent company. Huge employee turnover. Were told one thing when hired. But, it was not accurate.  The company is not doing good financially.  Very stressful atmosphere"
bad,Frontier that i worked in was involved in redistributing/rerouting telecommunications along with other operations. Currently they are involved in WiFi and internet which at the time i worked there that was not available
bad,Direct manager is very supportive.  Opportunity to work from home.  No comp time for all of the extra hours required to get the work done and you must use PTO for doctor's appointments or sick days
bad,work there for two years after the aquisition of att wireline in connecticut. i had 29 years of service and i felt the company wanted younger leadership/ and i think they regret it now
bad,"Excellent pay & benefits, Union-negotiated.  High amount of talent and ability among the assignment.  But, micro-managed, poor management/leadership, no support from HR. Talent  recognition amongst managers in serious need of improvement.  Corporate needs to place a firmer hand on assignment management. Dysfunctional, overbearing, incompetent assignment management, and a bitter HR manager creating a culture of a dictatorship, with harassment and targeting being the normal behavior of front line supervisors."
bad,This place is really going down hil after the acquisition. They put more into creating new ways for their employees tho LIE to the customers then to actually fix the issues.
bad,there was poor schedule and hours. there was only one mothers room for nursing women. there were not any nursing breaks. in the training course you cannot miss any days regardless of the reason or it would result in a write up.
bad,"Frontier was a very unorganized company when I was involved with them, mainly because they were undergoing some major changes in company structure. The training received was decent, but left a lot to be desired as many real life problems you experience on the floor was not covered in training."
bad,"Team members made the job fun. Very strict on phone use, short lunches. Hardest part was being told its slow and to go home. That would make our checks short."
bad,"Retention agents are hired with a low wage with the opportunity to earn commission.  Commission plans have changed in the last year countless times.  The company can't come up with a plan that works.  In the meantime, agents suffer.  Last change just occurred. Many people will need to see about getting state assistance in order to feed their children. Metrics are not attainable to receive a decent commission. The company is struggling since it purchased Verizon properties in California, Texas, and Florida.  Now the employees are paying the price for a poor transition and bad decisions made on a larger scale.  Thousands of people have lost their jobs in the last year. Not a place I would recommend working."
bad,"Many Management overturn in IT Department in a year, I have 3 different manager in my Team.  Worked long hours plus weekend with a less than 1% salary increase and not recognize my hard work."
bad,This company gave many problem programs to the consultants where the programming staff could not fix. There was much information needed that was not given for a solution.
bad,"Frontier Communications is a great place to begin a career in telecommunications.  The reason for this is actually bad longterm.  A new account executive, which is a B2B sales position has the opportunity to sell many different types of solutions to a customer. Therefore, an active AE can get significant exposure in mane areas.  However, this is also indicative that Frontier lacks a strategic direction.  Management is strong in some areas and weak in others.  Sales as a whole is still bogged down by unnecessary work--items a salesperson should not be completing."
bad,"The biggest issues here are as follows: 1. Poor communication between all our departments and a definite hatred between them as well. ; 2. No one is willing to do their jobs as we have hired so many unqualified people it's obnoxious, which causes a headache for our customers.; 3. Too much emphasis on selling 3rd-party applications and services and not enough on assistance and infrastructure improvement."
bad,"Wonder work family, Most enjoyed working with my customers.  Multi system tasking, billing, orders, collection and repair calls.  Retention/Saves calls"
bad,The job is good. Too bad they are closing the call center down.I really don't have much to say anymore since I will no longer have a job by January 3rd.
bad,"I was a contracted employee and you could tell right off the bat that everybody had been there for quite some time and they were all long time friends and had favorites for certain things, When we were all laid off for budget reason and told we would be brought back by a certain date others were not everyone."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"I hate the building we are in and also there are no windows here. I would like if they had a gym, cafeteria, and maybe weekly perks. Management is good sometimes and sometimes they are not here most of the time."
bad,"Great benefits. Management has room for improvement from top to bottom. Terrible products to sale, unethical approach to getting new customers. Technicians rarely show up for installs and repairs."
bad,Did not enjoy working for frontier communications. Compensation was great but management was horrible . Most enjoyable part of the job was Compensation/Benefits.
bad,"CResidential Service Consultant"
bad,"Frontier has a fast-paced environment where there are constant changes and challenges to meet.  Co-workers and immediate managers are great, and do their best to keep the “whirlwind” at bay while we work to achieve the goals set by upper management."
bad,"But I find their management and planning to be very poor. I don't think it very business savvy to require 2 hours of mandatory overtime a day for going on 4 weeks, all due to a conversion in another state."
bad,"This company is pretty great don't get me wrong, and as far as the online sales and support position goes, the company is pretty much willing to just throw money at you. Things start getting kind of bad though when you're in a brand new call center and they demand overtime every single morning once you're out of training, then get upset and threaten to fire you when you take pto a few days in a row because the stress of talking to hundreds of customers a day who are yelling at YOU because of something someone else did is starting to get to you."
bad,"Management is more horizontal. Not much hierarchy in working with senior management which is a plus. But this horizontal structure works only with company which is willing to adapt to fast changing market place with innovative internal systems and offering products. Frontier is struggling with this dilemma and need to find its core competency asap to keep up with its competitors. Working so hard on old processes, procedures, systems and M&As on outdated wireline businesses are simply shooting themselves in the foot long term. Co-workers are simply doing their best to survive a job, not adding much value to drive company growth. In addition, the company is struggling to find top-line growth, hence diligently finding savings in headcount reduction. However this only contributes to backfire in work quality and value-adding, which recycles back to stressed top-line."
bad,"Managing service sales reps"
bad,"Frontier has neglected it's customers to the point of no return."
bad,Communications company with a lot of systems issues  and unable to provide data speeds to customers computers are slow and technicians are missing the commitments for installations.
bad,"Constantly Changing with limited interaction with co-workers due to demand of job, workload greater than amount of workforce to complete the work timely"
bad,"Was a good place in the beginning, but horrible now :(. Union got involved, downsized positions and no promotions. Groups quit instantly. Even started a campaign ""SAVE FRONTIER"" , are you serious lol. Good people, horrible infrastructure."
bad,"Frontier used to be a fun place to work at, but over the past few years they've gone into major debt. This has made management more scattered because more tasks have not only been put on their plate but then also put onto yours."
bad,"Frontier Communications is broken on so many different levels.  Leadership is struggling to focus on core issues, fighting hard to find a band-aid large enough to cover the debt for another quarter. "
bad,"When Frontier took over the company , it went downhill. The transition was total chaos. They do not have any consideration for their employees. The main focus is all about money, such a shame.   The  management changes often, at the same time some are laid off without any notice."
bad,"Company lacks infrastructure that allows employees work life balance. Engineers are often tasked with operations duties beyond what's reasonable. "
bad,the above title says it all.  Micro managers too many meetings no one in entire company can explain the commission structure it is a big secret.  Set people up for failure.
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"On the application side, the IT culture is very toxic.  IT executives are not culture bearing people.  If you get past that, the people work hard.  Doubling the size of the company with the Verizon acquisition will not be positive anywhere but the stock price."
bad,"The office enviornment is inviting, welcoming, and friendly."
bad,"Corporate Mission Statement and corporate directives from management conflict, making a career somewhat frustrating,"
bad,"Help techician with service orders, purchase supplies, assisit service reps with customer issues, Time card and vacation tracking"
bad,Frontier Communications is a job that includes good benefits and higher than minimum wage pay.
bad,"Its always rush to wait environment, Deadlines all the time, Then wait for work to come in again, Telecommunications is unstable in general, I did not feel secure at frontier because of all the cell phone companies getting cheaper and cheaper now offering new services all over the United States. I liked working at frontier but it was poorly managed , My co workers were great, I got to learn so much about telecommunications in general, I got to learn about DPI, and telephony engineering, I enjoyed working with others on big cut projects."
bad,Lack of culture and local engagement with their employees. Very little emphasis on growth and personal development. Compensation and security promised only to those who are tenured.
bad,"The benefits package at Frontier is top notch. The pay provided is better than most employers within the area. Most options are seniority-based within a work group."
bad,Positive Workplace but the company has very poor business practices and is going bankrupt quickly. No room for advancement and shaky job security. They do their very best to keep morale high however and try to be very motivational.
bad,"After working for SNET, SBC and AT&T for decades we merged with Frontier Communications.  They had their own way of doing things so we had to be retrained in somewhat heavy-handed and archaic methods.  I adapted and embraced the change eventually but in doing so a lot of progress was lost."
bad,"Pay good, PTO good, worked from home"
bad,No decision making authority. Most if not all decisions are made without key communication.   No structure from a leadership standpoint.  There needs to be more focus on fixing processes and systems which cause heartburn for customers and frontline agents.
bad,Management is confused and understaffed.  Information is contraditory and changing for no reason.  Company having trouble keeping up with technology and changes in the industry. Losing subscribers and market share.  Employees are demoralized and overworked.
bad,"A typical day was attending meetings and being sent  out into the field without direction. Training was limited, management was clueless . The hardest part of the job was having a question answered. Best part of the job was social functions with my colleagues."
bad,Too many changes in management. Company is going down. Cut commissions to try to save money. No yearly review or pay increases. No management support.
bad,The work environment was ok however it was the management that was enforcing the insane company rules. I had an emergency and my son ended up in the hospital at which time I was released due to missing 1 day of work.
bad,"Some people make 23-45$ an hour and others make 13-17$ an hour, but can work on the same projects. Most of the time the employee who is paid less does harder/more work. You can be trained on multiple new things and are required to handle those projects (on top of your existing responsibilities) and get no raises or any kind of compensation for the workload."

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,Company does not have a positive future with several quarters in a row with triple digit million dollar losses.  Company may go into bankruptcy some experts predict by 2020.
bad,"Process exists but it is often not followed.  Quality assurance is often negatively impacted to meet aggressive timelines."
bad,The Frontier leadership needs to engage and invest in the front line employees. Due diligence can do wonders for moral and customer satisfaction - with the right intervention.
bad,"I do enjoy working for the company and have for 13 years.  However, Frontier is laying off numerous people and nobody has job security anymore.  A lot of employees of Frontier are currently looking for different jobs."
bad,"Although this has been the best paying job of my life I sense our board and the execs have no clue about running a company well. We're bleeding badly but they continue to let outdated systems, processes and people without the vision to move into a new century run things.  When I hired on things seemed great: family oriented, work life/balance importance, people were important. This place has become the laughing stock of the industry and they aren't investing in technologies that will take this company far in the next 25 years. Our contract said we'd get bonuses but we're going into our 2nd year and it looks like we'll be sucking it up again because the top dogs don't know what they are doing. No one is on the same page as far as across the board training.  Processes mean one thing to one person and another to the next person.  Departments don't work well together and care more about their paychecks than the customers."
bad,"My immediate Supervisor was outstanding and always went out of her way.  But the company has been very unstable for the several years I worked there, was always going thru layoffs from the moment I became an employee."
bad,I learned about many different products and how to apply them to a customers life. I learned how to use multiple systems at once to offer the best fit for our customers.
bad,"My weeks consisted of 4 ten hour days, supervision was minimal."
bad,"I've worked for frontier only 3 of the 23 yrs I've been at this company, first it was GTE, great company to work for, cared for the customer and the employees, then in 2005 Verizon bought us , best product in the industry, fiber optics for internet , phone and tv., great 12 yrs . then frontier buys Verizon, very hard company to work for, they don't want to rehab or fix anything, they want us to put a bandade on everything, very frustrating.i don't know if they don't have the funds to rehab, but this outdoor plant needs serious rehab to keep services workin properly and keep customers from leaving us for another provider. that's the hardest part of the job. some day the bandages are gonna run out."
bad,Working here was stressful due to not knowing whether or not you would still be employed tomorrow.  The companies financial struggles made it scary for anyone to work here.
bad,"They are just hiring fill in people after thousands of layoff."
bad,recommended staying away from this company. there is no job security or work balance  life balancing. Job culture is only great if they really apply to the workplace.
bad,"Very unhappy w training and tools . Nobody new the processes , nobody there to help you . Very hard to get any where in Frontier . Quota is horrible and no way able to reach . Run don’t work here you will be unhapppy ."
bad,"A majority of people I worked with were great. Unfortunately management and corporate had very poor communication, especially with the frontline employees. It got to a point where employees from other centers would drop very irate customers on our center and although you could “write an act ticket on them and send it to your supervisor” no disciplinary act would take course and it just got worse. Pay was OK but in the end Corporate ended up cutting commission making it difficult to make money off of any sale and then we would get daily emails saying how poor our sales were. The president of the company even put out a statement blaming the failure of the company on the hardworking reps. The systems that we had to use were constantly failing or down creating a difficult time in calm handle time which also impacts your pay. The hours of operation made it incredibly difficult to plan anything around your schedule during the week (unless you’ve worked there for a long time). And there were many times where our center was threatened to be shut down with the other centers nationwide that were discontinued. The company lost so much money and went downhill so rapidly that in the year and a half I worked there, my center went from over 150 csr reps to maybe 30 due to either people leaving scared of job security or being let go."
bad,"Company has good processes, pays well but has had many layoffs of critical team members who were part of large deals for sales, such as SE's. Flexible in working from wherever, some managers better than others."
bad,Not in a hurry to do anything.  Changes in C level suite results in new objectives/focus frequently.  Local management team hands are tied to incent sales and customer service.  Limited product set and service territory.  Aggressive pricing.
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,Basically there was nothing wrong with the company as a whole.  Except the company is circling down the drain and they dont tell the employees whats going on.  Preferring silence or lies.
bad,"The culture is average, nothing special. A typical day involves responding to emails, a handful of conference calls, evaluating results, motivating the team, listening to calls, and providing solutions to problems."
bad,"I do not recommend."
bad,"This is simply a job that one uses to get another. Use this job to catapult you to where you wish to be. However if one wishes to climb the corporate ladder here then by all means, try."
bad,"Frontier has the worst customer service in the industry according to CNN."
bad,"Via company provided mobile device, smartphone and tablet, i peruse my work in the morning and device a course of action on what will be done on a particular job.  This is done not only first thing in the morning but throughout the day.   I make calls to customers and inform them of a time of arrival that bests fit their needs if inside access to the premises is needed.  This is usually for installs involving broadband,Fiber,phone and cat5 wiring.  If a repair ticket is dispatched i call to let them know that i will be stopping by to troubleshoot their line.  One thing I've learned during my tenure at Frontier is that you have to have effective communications with customers, co-workers and management. However, the difficult part is when the customer is told that they won't need to be home.  I'll tell them that i won't know if the problem is inside or outside until i get to their home and troubleshoot the line.  This can have a tendency to make the customer irate if the problem is in the home and customer service told them they would not have to be their.  On the contrary, this would also happen, if the customer was told to be home and the problem was outside This is when you have to put the customer at ease and convince them that it was not their fault and everything will be done to repair the issue.  The most rewarding part of the job is seeing a job through a successful completion.  This means a customer who is happy and satisfied with the product that was either installed or repaired.  Also, problem solving for me tends to keep my mental focus sharp and always searching for"
bad,It looks good on paper but often provides the sales team with not enough material or changes vital things which is needed to work. They also decided to change how were paid without explaining why and how were paid and when we had issues about our pay it was handled roughly and many time mistakes were made.
bad,"I worked here for over a year, I was moved to new departments and jobs a couple of times with no pay raises. I was promised promotions and told that they cared and promoted from within but the reality was much different, I only saw 1 promotion from within and they were fired soon after to get the old person back. There is lots of turnover so you won't work for the same people for very long, due to the company firing people if you don't get enough surveys and people quitting due to bad environment."
bad,Company is going through a rebuilding phase and is still finding its way back into the market.
bad,"Run with a skeleton crew, management and upper management do not fill empty jobs in an effort to save money but expect (unrealistically) for all the work to still get done on time."
bad,Don't apply to Frontier. Pay is a bit low - your employment is based on your sales.
bad,no other department is willing to help with issue everyone is looking to take care of their self . Directors and above are running scared and don't want anything to do with or help the techs .
bad,There was a lot of patch work. Never being able to fix problems only being able to put bandaids on. Customer never seemed to come first in managemensts eyes.
bad,Do not apply here. work culture is great. Management are difficult people to work with. Changes every day or other day and heavy work load without warning with no increase pay
bad,"A typical day at work is taking calls for 7 plus hours out the day and Troubleshoot, Very quick-paced in which I loved. The management really brought the morale very low and cost plenty of good workers to leave. I have been here 3 years and still no advancement. I am looking to go forward, not backwards."
bad,Needs more internal support for Account Executives. Not enough support personnel to work the orders and assist customers with billing issues. You can expect to consult with several people to get the answer to questions.
bad,"I dont want to review the company as a whole.   Just the local call center that I worked in.  If you can handle customer service, and working in a call center, its not a bad place to work."
bad,Enjoyed the people I worked with on a daily basis. Other than that it was a bad personal experience overall. The Management Teams are the worst I've ever worked with.
bad,"The company as a whole seems to lack a sense of urgency however."
bad,"I'm a current Sales and CSR in one of the Frontier call centers. My colleagues and our environment are wonderful. Working at Frontier would be great if senior management would recognize the following..."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"It is widely known by veterans within the company that when the changes occurred upon the transition from Verizon to Frontier, the atmosphere become tumultuous with rumors of whole app groups being cut - with other groups scrambling to cover. Technician service groups cut. Keeping our job became priority one while being placed in the position to do more with less - much less. My division was fairly insulated initially from the hard work of our manager, but was eventually cut drastically. They are currently replacing the seasoned workforce in IT with lower paid workers and interns."
bad,"Where do I start. The management is HORRIBLE. While working there for 4 years it went from 9 sups to 3. Everyone left. It's VERY stressful that they offer you 5 weeks of outpatient therapy, because trust me, you're going to need it. They pressure you to sale. They could care less about customer service or the customer...they darn sure don't care about the employee. The turnover rate is the highest I've seen of any company I've worked for. The benefits are the ONLY reason most stay there. The pay is great and they keep you there with the incentives and bonuses/commission. They went from over 200 people when I started to now about 15/20...smh"
bad,"Frontier is shutting down the call center, They hire outside of the company before they promote from within that is the reason why my husband left, management doesn't care about you"
bad,Work environment started out as being very fulfilling and gave quite the instructional background on multiple networking systems and programs within it's work environment. Unfortunately as the company grew at too fast of a pace this lead to bringing in multiple forms of bad management and lesser employees which created it's inevitable downfall into almost bankruptcy as multiple call centers and locations had to be shut down and put hundreds of employees out of work.
bad,"Frontier owns enormous assets in the telecom industry, the people are all friendly and easy to work with .  Accountability for what people actually do is lacking and trying to work through an overly complex organizational structure makes it difficult to work cross functionally and drive initiatives forward."
bad,"Frontier had a nice, quiet work environment.  Meetings not often held unless necessary to discuss work details.  Overtime usually not required which made it a good place to work if you have a busy home life."
bad,Started out being very customer oriented but after a year showed true colors and seemed to be out for a quick buck too milk the area of all the money they could. While putting nothing back in
bad,"Frontier never established an ""identity"" when it purchased AT&T in Connecticut 3 years ago.  Management would implement a new proceedure, new products, new territories only to change in 6 months.  We never had a full year on any program or comp plan."
bad,"An economical company for people seeking cable and telephone connection, but is disorganized with work and the amount of people hired in this company."
bad,Too much work taken home.  Not worth the stress for the money. Managers were not helpful and training taught me nothing to learn how to work by myself in the store each week.
bad,"The company has had financial and valuation setbacks and reduced customer base.  Company is reorganizing for better financial efficiency and improving marketing operations."
bad,"the job is somewhat stressful and has had some big issues over last year and half with conversion with Verizon, lay offs and people leaving and a lot of phone line and others big problems. but I do have to say I like the people I work with and the PTO and benefits are pretty good"
bad,"IT Management believes everything their ancient, uneducated, legacy IT guys tell them about their mainframe.  This is no place to work if you have modern skills.  When Frontier acquired Fios Cable from Verizon, the personnel who came with the acquisition were very demoralized by the quality of Frontier's IT systems.  When I was there, they tried three times in 3 years to implement their relational DB modernization project and they failed each time and no one was fired.  On the contrary, senior management relied more on the legacy guys who guided the failed project.  Management won't acknowledge they have a problem."
bad,"While I like my job and my immediate management, I cannot recommend Frontier Communications to anyone.  The company is destined to fail or at best, receive some form of bailout.  It is poorly run from the top and they are constantly taking away benefits.  Not only were there no merit increases or bonuses for 2016, they did away with the bonus structure altogether.  They reduced the 401K match.  Most recently, they did away with work from home privileges."
bad,"Frontier Communications is in transition after their recent acquisition of operations from Verizon. They can turn things around, but it ill take some time and there is a lot of uncertainty."
bad,"Fast paced start up environment with great opportunity to marketing high tech, in demand products. Lots to learn as the company develops new vision after doubling in size in 2016 after large acquisition. The most enjoyable part of the job is things can be implemented quickly to impact change and growth. Great people to work with and a wealth of collective experience."
bad,Hate call center environment. Pushed sales where your job was on the line all the time. High stress levels leaving everyday for not meeting certain amount of sales in a month.
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit. The pipe dream they guaranteed to Frontier and the employees they did not honor. They changed all the policies after the grace receiving period. Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
bad,"Everyone in the office I worked at is amazing and friendly. Management are very nice and understanding of work and personal issues."
bad,Cold calling for sub-par products is not ideal. They can't compete with the cable internet and tv providers.
bad,very stressfull job customers are verbally abusive management sometimes has no idea how to handle situations and gossip runs rampent throught the company.
bad,Frontier really shows appreciation towards their employees.
bad,"Was good while I was there, co-workers were great. I liked the work, it was fun and challenging."
bad,"The work was fun and engaging but new management has decided to micro manage the technicians rather than address the problems in the infrastructure. After doing this work for 48 years, I am quite adept at all aspects of this work. Hard to be micro managed by someone who’s never done the job."
bad,Frontier closed all offices where they had experienced employees and hired inexperienced employees for less money 
bad,"There is very little if any support to perform your daily duties. work in a remote location without engineering, management, construction crew, line crew, or warehouse personnel. those job duties become yours along with your job duties."
bad,A typical started off answering incoming calls I would handle anywhere between 15-16 calls a day. I would handle each complaint in a timely manner to resolve the customer issue regarding their service issues.
bad,"Frontier has great compensation, however they took companies that were there before, GTE/Verizon and ran it into the ground. Closing the company and displacing over 250 people."
bad,"Frontier is a nice place to work and the benefits and my co-workers were awesome!  However, this is my second layoff at Frontier/Global Crossing.  I don't believe they make good financial decisions starting at the top.  Be very careful if you apply for a job."
good,overworked and under appreciated.
good,Chase in Arlington TX was able to provide a job when I needed one however the pay was not worth the interactions that we were forced to deal with. The
good,"The company offers no flexibility with schedules, no promotion within the company, benefits are ok but decrease with each contract, the union is weak, and management if horrible."
good,"We promise superior service to our customers, and we"
good,I would not recommend this company for a long term position. It wears on you quick and you get no satisfaction from the job. This should be a temporary position only. If you stay much longer than 6 months you just might start beating your head on your desk.
good,long hours and very hard to use your PTO since they go by seniority there. office temp were always extreme either too cold or too hot. must be able to multi task .
good,A typical day at work is dealing with multiple customer complaints due to frontier not wanting to upgrade there facilities. Reviewing orders that may have been cancelled by the system and apologizing to customers when techs have missed multiple installation appointments. Setting up accounts for new install and reviewing customer statements
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"not customer friendly, job was customer service however it was to push sales only. Systems issues most of the time and problems taking care of the customer from getting the customer the correct services and getting customers taken care of in a timely manner."
good,I would rather be in a job where I am interacting with the patients and actually helping someone. I fell like this job is not for every one. For one thing we were not paid enough for the job that we had to do.
good,When I started out a great job then went in to high goals and no sales calls.  We take calls all day.  All Marketing calls go to vendors and then the raise our sales goals.  The metrics for compensation are not clear and changed often.
good,If you need quick money to getout it is good. But a place to stay and grow... No way. They are all about numbers and competition between employees. Nothing is fair... Complete popularity.
good,• Responsible for Test plans for Billing and Service platforms
good,"From the beginning, the training was unprofessional. It was like being in kindergarten!! They utilize 9 weeks of training that could be decreased down to 4 at the most. They hire many with NO sales experience at all which sets you up for failure because once you hit the floor, your pretty much on your own. I learned more on the floor than I did in training. Trainer was a phony. All smiles and giggles in the classroom then give you a sour look outside of class. Supervisors walk around yelling to sell, sell, sell and make you push certain products. Customer could hear this in the background and would always comment on what they were yelling. DISH rep threatens to ""talk"" to you if you didn't meet HER quota. UM, excuse me, I work for Frontier...NOT DISH!!!! Had to keep an eye on my schedule because it changed every 6 weeks. Their computer systems are unstable. Spent more time rebooting computer than on the phone. Frontier is the definition of Micromanagement. EVERY TIME you have to leave your desk, even to use the restroom, you have to pause your system and give a reason of why you are leaving. If you take too many bathroom breaks, you are spoken to about it. They are more about sales than customer service. They promote from within. They advance top sellers to floor supervisors that have NO experience on being a supervisor!!"
good,Customer service based. Working deliquent accounts of clients that have services with the company.
good,"good career when it was Verizon.. Had great management and co-workers. CEO didn't manage budgets well and many employees lost their jobs. Frontier was a small ma & pa business and should have never taken on a giant verizon. People weren't able to get retirement benefits, no 401k"
good,after training no 1on1 coaching except to tell you when you did wrong but no offer of how to fix.. Changing mission weekly to suit companies monetary goals for quarter.
good,"When i started there was lots of room for advancement. That was before the acquisition of Fios . Now they over spent, did not combine systems properly , there is no support for employees or customers"
good,I have been here about 2 years now and have never been more dissatisfied at a job in all my life.   I honestly cannot believe I have wasted so much time on fail company
good,"I'd rather not review a company that I am only an entry level employee for, my point of view reflects nothing into the companies workings."
good,"Frontier is a good Company, however working for Capital one was very very disappointing. Did not agree with how credit card regulations are enforced, and did not want to take calls from folks who were angry and wanted to argue all day. Culture was fun when breaks were allowed. Friendly co workers. Management was ALWAYS CHANGING, did not breed continuity."
good,Helping customers get the work/services needed/wanted. Making sure customer has all services available to them to met sales goals.
good,Too bad FTR never invested in the rural ILEC areas and paid way too much for CTF.   Getting support was tough and sales management was both arrogant and  clueless.
good,I liked the job when i first started but after a while i really started hate it... you are yelled at and could be fired for not hitting your monthly goals the management here is the worst very messy and unprofessional the commission structure has change so much in a bad way. It was so easy to make 2000$ now it is almost impossible. They need to pay more this is the most stressful job i ever had in my life i cant even believe this place is still op this flrt want branch will be closed sooon they are losing everyoneen how bad they do tthr customers
good,"I was orginally very happy with my career at Frontier however, the last few years have been a little rough.  The folks there are great as we are all pretty much the lost children of Telecom.  I enjoyed the flexible work hours and ability to work from home.  Telecom is always up and down and its impossible to say when you're going to be very happy or mad as blazes. I hope that Frontier does better in the future and that once again its on top of the world!"
good,It was ok.  Downsized lost my job. Employees are not appreciated.  Pay and benefits were good however haven't had a decent raise in years.  As lays changing and never give enough notice.
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,I have good days and bad days just like with all jobs. over all it is a great job. I just want to make a difference and make a change. there are some obstacles that are in place that I feel can be moved.
good,Frontier seems to have made a mission to buy all the rural networks that other phone companies have deemed failing and tried get government subsidies to support them.
good,"Frontier  bought Verizon in texas about a year ago.  Ever since then its been horrible.  Nothing like verizon.  Pay is horrible.  Leadership is horrible and no direction.  They don't have money for anything, including for their employees."
good,"If you enjoy customer service, it's a great place to work but for me it just became very repetitive and mind-numbing. They pay okay but it comes at a mental cost."
good,Good place to work if you are looking for Temp work and daily changes. Fast paced and friendly environment. Many over time hours are available to be worked.
good,Tied to the  phone  is  how  you got  paid. Unorganized  management because  of merging  of  Verizon with Frontier communications. Unprofessional employees.
good,I feel like it is a good job for a entry level technician. There is not a lot of forward growth within the company. Management is sub par.
good,Dealing with customers and co-workers. Implementing adds moves and changes for residential customers. Dealing with upset customers who have been given services they did not ask for.
good,A multi faceted job with ever-changing tasks and goals.A challenging and demanding work environment that always motivates you to perform to your highest potential.
good,"I worked in the DeLand location. We are used as guinea pigs for experimentation with new projects, changes in systems, commission structures, etc. However, the company expects you to deal with this without additional compensation. If you are ethical with your sales (as you should be) it's extremely difficult to hit sales goals to reach commission."
good,"The team that I work with is excellent, professional, hard working and conscientious. Our supervisor lets us collaborate and trusts us to do what needs to be done to accomplish the job."
good,"I loved the travel. The people but i disliked all the phone calls. I drove to Indiana, Minnesota and never received any money to travel.  I felt pressure to get so many sales a day."
good,"The  atmosphere at Frontier is fractured at this point, there seems to be a lack of clear direction emanating from upper management. This leads to a workforce that are in need of a plan."
good,"The only perk of working at frontier was the commission, the paid time off, and working from home. This is not a job I would recommend to anyone. The residential department is well-run, but the business department is lacking in professional supervision."
good,"Worked their 4 yrs,  never received a performance review,  never received any formal coaching, was basically on my own from day 1 to figure things out.  People were great, however Senior Management lacked a clear direction.  Moved the business offshore and back onshore 3 times in less than 2 years.  "
good,"Frontier is not the highest paying employer in the market by a long shot.  It is a fair pay rate though.  Union employees are well paid, but management is not."
good,The company's stock has been in decline indicating financial issues. I also don't believe they apply a customer first policy as well as they should. The employees for the most part are focused on doing the best job they can and are very customer oriented. The systems deployed in my environment often cost more time than the one replaced which was very frustrating.
good,"Great benefits. Not too many opportunities for advancement. Typical day in my position requires taking phone calls, troubleshooting video, voip, fiber optic internet. C"
good,"They never listen to what's right! They are always changing things, like procedures. They work in a negative way. Each time you think things will get positive they let you down with the same old thing. Management does NOT know their jobs! People all place into the wrong jobs, like in decision making positions. People just don't care what you do!"
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"During my time with the company, we had 3 center managers.  Each was removed for reasons unknown.  The level of disrespect shown to each (regardless of what they had done) when being removed from the building was unacceptable."
good,Since I was part of the call center I didn't get the whole experience but I can say that its a good job to make money for an emergency I wasn't aware that it was going to be temporary but I enjoyed my time there.
good,Depending on what job field you in it is rather busy and always room for learning. some places train you very well and some not at all. I learned a lot in the Metro E department. I pretty much with a few other co workers started the NOC from nothing. Management as usual some are great some are the best you have ever met and followed you your life. and some the world could do without. Workplace is fast paced. The hardest job is the one I have now it has not training ground. Hardest part of the job in the current is the trying to find the help needed to be successful. The most enjoyable is meeting some of the people and working with some of the best in the industry.
good,Office closed.  Did not absorb any of the jobs when closing the Marion branch.  However they did provide many services available to assist in starting a new career.
good,"Disorganized processes and poor customer service. Fragmented internal support. Poor execution and delivery of services. Systems information does not workflow, multiple databases and tools."
good,Commission requirements are being adjusted to an unrealistic goal to qualify also the hourly wage is based off performance so the commission changes will be negatively impacting hourly wages in the near future
good,There would not be a member of management around to assist resolving an account.Unable to assist customers due to lack of management. Unsatisfied customers
good,"Fair pay, paid breaks and flexible lunches. Good benefits and 401k. Good environment and good people to work with. Only downfall would be that your job is not secure and depends on stats."
good,What started out as a great place to work turned into a company where the only constant is change. the company was not doing well for the last 2 years and has recently implemented many new lay offs and downsizing.
good,2 of my friends work there.  Office enviroment is ok.  All cubicles.  Company is consolidating departments. Too many contractors.
good,Lot of internal politics and have to always be concerned about job security. Wrong estimates for projects. Management is not capable of understanding the needs/views of developers
good,The company literally could careless what happens with the employees and especially their customers.  Co-workers are fantastic and a lot of the management on my level are good. just overall the company is strictly looking out for themselves.
good,"The company itself is a good company, but when they bought Verizon areas it went downhill and they have been struggling. Leadership is worried about staying alive to even think about anything else right now. The company needs to invest in their people more than they are willing right now. Pay was good, but in this area you never know how long you will have a job since it is a union shop. If they can fix their training and get systems that are not from the 80's and get competitive speeds in a lot of areas they will be in good shape."
good,its an average company to work for. compensation is very low as compared to market. Management keep changing that is effecting the chain below
good,"Job security was non existent, you're hired in batches, and even the managers joked about batch names and participants. Depending on how much the teacher likes you determines the outcome of where you'll be placed."
good,Good pay and benefits. Forced overtime makes it tough to balance home and work.
good,"On the phone with customers helping them with complaints, troubles or getting services."
good,"Great people, decent culture. Company has been drug down by lack of accountability from the highest levels after repeated catastrophic failures and lack of traction of repeated culture and vision changes."
good,"This job no longer exist. The company closed down its Jefferson Rd location in 2019 due to lack in sales. The compensation for the hard work that you did was definitely there, but the customer were always upset due to the company's process in repairing issues."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,Can’t wait for frontier to sell to another company They’ve turned into a micromanaging points system to where they expect you to get a certain amount of points done per day but don’t give you the resources to get it done
good,"It used to be a fun place to work. But, after failed CTF acquisition and losing 500b dollars it slowly became hostile. Management seems friendly but are under pressure as well and are NOT your friends. They're there to do a job too."
good,"Way too micromanaged, supervisors pretended that you picked up and learned from their stressful coaching, which in my case also caused me great anxiety that stayed with me for month's. Commission was great whenever it was actually possible to obtain. Things are way different now and not for the better."
good,"Fast paced sales and customer service. Supportive Leads, good atmosphere, everyone is willing to help when your new. The classes are a lot of talking and not enough hands on experience needed to learn the many software programs. The commission program is good if you are in the sales queue otherwise you get many billing and complaint calls. You can still get sales from those type of calls though.You have to love working with people and finding resolutions for customers problems. Sales is the biggest thing to push for of course. The first 6 months to a year very important. Attendance is number one and a must. Watch with which management you deal with."
good,Frontier is a good company with the right management behind it. There is pressure to sell also. The management are all friends and thus causes chaos with the employees. Youdo get paid by commission really well as long as you hit your monthly target.
good,Their seems to be a huge disconnect between management and craft.  Management has no technical experience...it's about the numbers.  No trust between management and craft.  Therefore....working there can be difficult.
good,In hindsight my time with Frontier was a growing experience. Frontier as a company has alot of growing to do if they want to keep up with the giants like AT&T or Verizon. Compared to those Frontier is outdated.
good,"At first it was had great career prospects. However, after a year the benefits were starting to disappear. When the career advancement and education benefits left, it became a job."
good,"The company was owned by Verizon when I started, where the benefits were great. When Frontier took over, we went back to archaic data entering systems. Our billing systems were out of date, and constantly wrong."
good,Frontier needs alot of changes to happen for it to be a 5 star work environment. Employees are not protected against un-necessary attacks by groups that are established in the work place to interfere with someone who is progressing and being promoted. Lots of jealousy concerning those who sale alot and make lots of money. Lots of people who get away with trouble making.
good,The company requires strong leadership with focus on customers. They need to get back to the basic and understand what the customers needs and wants are and satisfy their requirements.
good,"Frontier used to be a wonderful place to work with excellent pay and bonus structure paired with a fun, fast-paced environment. Now the office culture remains but the skyrocketing sales quotas makes hitting bonuses very difficult for not only the reps but the sales managers and as a whole, the center. which creates an environment of stress and pressure. That pressure to hit numbers results in unethical sales practices by the reps which is initially celebrated until it is discovered, then the reps are fired and a new class comes in being held to standards that VERY few are able to achieve ethically."
good,i learned to deal w/ customers over the phone. some of the management were very understanding while others really did not care. scheduling was very bad
good,I only worked 11 months at Frontier.  I left early because my personal life could not handle the stress and mix messages coming from Project Management.
good,worried about job security.  hours change every 3 months.  job duties change every three months as well.  Supervisors are losing jobs.  Many changes that feel wrong.
good,A typical day a work. It begins with not knowing what holds in store for the next 8 hours. We rely on a very small work group to maintain a large network. We are a very dependable and conscientious group. We get things done with very limited resources and normally go above and beyond what is expected.
good,The company is failing due to a botched cutover of Verizon landlines in 2016 and is bleeding customers.  I was laid off due to a reduction in force.  There will be many more.
good,"I worked as a customer service/sales agent for frontier. Things started out great as it was paid training, started at lowered quota, and raises based off performance. I liked most of the management but I feel there was a lot of favoritism at play. There were also months where quota was held too high and almost impossible to reach. Also for the type of customers that we worked with I feel that if you did not reach performance levels the pay was not worth the stress. eventually there was a conversion of properties with another company and started to put frontier in a bad place. Too many customers at one time. They turned our center into a retention center even though we signed up as sales and customer service. but we were still held to the same sales quota. I believe that the management put too much stress on their employees and by the end it was unfair and held to unreasonable expectations. I think the most rewarding part of working at frontier was the people that you work with. I built a lot of long lasting friendships through the company."
good,"As with every job for a corporation these days, there are too many chiefs and not enough Indians. Focus is only on what we can do for profit and not on the customer's services or upgrading and/or maintaining facilities in areas that severally need it. Management will look you in the eye and tell you that their main focus is the customer, but all of their actions prove otherwise. Moral is at an all time low due to a summer and fall so far of mandatory overtime...6 day work weeks and 2 hours extra at the end of your 8 hour shift each day with only a couple hours notice that we where going to be forced to work that day/night. Serious mismanagement at the majority of upper level management areas, with many different departments not knowing what each other is doing. We are a communications company that doesn't communicate. A few weeks ago a customer told me what he thought and it hits it right on the head...""Frontier is the most unprofessional and uneducated phone and internet company in the US."" All I can say for certain is if the pay wasn't so good, they would lose at least 60% of their workforce in the blink of an eye."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,We have been in a constant state of crisis since acquisition by Frontier.  Our center was just informed we would be closing despite being high performance center due to cost.
good,Frontier is a company that needs to realign its vision where retaining customers is just as important as finding new ones. More training is needed for its frontline employees and 3rd party vendors. There are awesome employees within the company
good,"When I first started with Frontier it was a great place to work. Pay was fair, benefits were great, and there was job security. Three and a half years later the company has done a complete 180 degree turn. They are in so much debt that they can't afford to properly pay their employees anymore and have to hire low skilled contract labor to fill their voids. Would recommend 3 years ago but definitely not now!"
good,"While I worked there, it was a set schedule that was completely inflexible no matter your situation. Advancement in the company was next to impossible unless you were amazing at your job and were there for months-years."
good,"The company has changed the corporate structure after I left."
good,Coworkers and immediate supervisor great to work with. Company becoming very compartmentalized. Work processes getting difficult to maneuver. Transitioning from efficient to the purchased company silo mentality. I very much enjoyed the work I was involved with and worked everyday to provide good customer service
good,"Started as a great company.  Unable to keep up with customer demands with technology.  Having the security of the union is what kept this place great.  This was going to work with family, the company just could not support their customers which lead to loss of revenue and forced to downsize."
good,"Great place to work ! Excellent Workers, Good benifits"
good,It was a nice place to work if you were single and did not Have Children because the hours you worked you di not have a personal life or time to spend with your family. Also it did not pay to Sick because you dont really have the time be off to get better
good,"Great pay, many chances to make good money. Great benefit and vacation time. Management is horrid in terms of remembering you're a person. Required overtime, whether you wanted it or not. Poor communication between departments."
good,"trial by fire, training was very light needed to be more than how to fill a form out, using old system to handle day to day work."
good,"This company is a company that rushes to wait.  Project management is not consistent as they say they follow the SDLC life cycle but work backwards from dates given to them by the business and tells you to write up the work effort but does not put into consideration that you are working on 3 to 4 projects.  And when there is nothing going on they do not schedule training but when there is something going on , we will need to finish work and do trainings."
good,"But when it came time for me to chose my son or work, i chose my son. A company who doesn't value family has a serious issue. I wouldn't refer anyone."
good,"Company could really use some training for upper management. Employee in charge of Indiana has no concept of ""give/take"" he just does whatever he wants and does not care who is in the path. Do not trust any type of upper management. They MUST offer management a class on how to lie to lower pay grades... Really not sure how this company stays afloat. Sorry I just cannot tell a lie!!!"
good,"Enjoyed the camaraderie that existed with fellow supervisors. "
good,Enjoyed the time I had there.  There is no assurance of placement.  I did feel secure in my position at Frontier no matter how well I performed.
good,"better to work for than subcontract for... nice people for most part"
good,"Call center was in best described in one word, ""Unorganized."" Typical day at work was always stressful and inconsistent.  "
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit. The pipe dream they guaranteed to Frontier and the employees they did not honor. They changed all the policies after the grace receiving period. Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"Dial in, access load proceed to work.  The most challenging part of my job may be dealing with other departments and getting us all on the same page. The most rewarding part of my job is to see everything fall in place at the end of the day (WOW)."
good,I learned customer serive skills and management skills.   Was able to travel and attend management seminars to better my management skills
good,"answered customer calls, variety of the nature of the calls"
good,Frontier was a nice place to work but they only kept our team for one year so we could train their team on our software and then they let our team go. This does not leave a favorable thought in my mind for them.
good,"The hours didn't work out, it was a 2nd shift position. I tried to make it work but it didn't work out with my family."
good,New gm management structure would be a success with a change in job requirements.
good,"Frontier Communications (Deland Call Center) is a very comfortable place to work for entry level associates, either in Outbound or Inbound Customer Service. Quotas are fair and easy to achieve, the pay is quite high, especially for this area. All in all, it is a very nice place to work if you are looking to stay at entry-level for several years. Due to the ratio of entry level positions to more advanced positions (probably somewhere around 100:1) the likelihood of moving up in the company is slim to none, even for excellent performers."
good,"Did a great job with training new skills.  Work from home was a dream. "
good,"Although Frontier's compensation and benefit packages are very competitive,  The company does not promote an atmosphere where you can expand your career.  They also don't give you a comfortable feeling regarding job security.  The company has customer service representatives that have been in that position for 30-35 years. They could easily be managers."
good,"Most co-workers remained, some retired. The new systems were not available prior to takeover on April 1, 2016. Some engineers retired and a few 1st line supervisors were laid off. After a year I decided to retire."
good,"Frontier was a good place to work for despite its upper management failing to realize their choices heavily impacted  their support centers wrongly. Management was at a loss cause when issues about other centers cause the constant remark was ""not my monkeys, not my circus!""  They paid well with good benefits and  gave you an opportunity to advance in short time(6 months) or change to a different department. If they were to open another center in Rochester I would reapply again"
good,". Typical workday would include taking calls throughout the day back-to-back typically the hardest part about the job was to the get through calls quickly enough to make your sales goals by the end of the month.  Was a good workplace environment, management in my location was pretty good, upper management has been horriblehas detroyed moral and earnikng potential, which has caused over half the ataff to quit or gwt fired.thlast few years has destroyed moral and cause"
good,"Managers go on vacations with certain employees and have personal relationships instead of professional. Example, ask manager to have an employee to look into a business issue. The manager ignores."
good,"A normal day consists of taking customer calls all shift. on average you would talk to between 20-30 customers a day. i have learned a lot from this job, ranging from customer interactions to basic command line for trouble shooting. the job can be a bit difficult as you would be dealing with upset customers on a regular basis but it can be quite gratifying when you help to resolve any issues the customer may have."
good,If I was presented with another job I would think about working there again.  It would need to be something I could advance my career under. I though worked there for a year and was laid off due to cutbacks.
good,"Document step-by step processes to ensure the system that we tested were accurate and efficient. "
good,Verizon was a better job hands down.  Typical day is working on a project handling customer complaints.  Management seems to micromanage.  Descent job
good,"Frontier follows the ""penny rich, dollar short"" mentality. They skimp and scrounge for budgets, but refuse to invest the necessary capital to improve the infrastructure of the company."
good,"Although the training is extremely thorough, and it is extremely easy to exceed sales expectations on a daily basis, when problems arise that require a lead's assistance, leads are almost never available."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,This job never shuts down. you are constantly tied to your phone and laptop and no day off is a true day off. The management is wonderful but mostly they are glorified information forwarders than actually being a mentor. They barely know the job.
good,"Trying to make the company successful while having to rely on obsolete technologies.  Experienced workforce with strong desire to help the company find a way to exceed is a positive, but difficult to see the light at the end of the tunnel."
good,"Starting out as my first job, Frontier provided a platform for me to grow and evolve as a full time entry level worker. My skills and abilities to perform have largely grown in part due to the company."
good,"I loved my job.  It challenged me, it was hard if you wanted it to be and was easy if you did not want to challenge yourself. You were left alone if your did your job."
good,"Everyday was different but you learn a lot in your specific field in a short amount of time. I was in a marketing department and was able to do add a lot of projects to my resume and portfolio after just being there for three months. However, job stability is something I questioned and was the reason i had to leave in the end due to budget cuts. They would spend a lot of money on projects that never got rolled out properly."
good,POOR - Laying newly hired people off after a short amount of time.  Poor business decisions.  Management does not take responsibility for the actions that they bring about.
good,They were great until they sold part of us. They have management that do not know how to do the job of agents and therefore give advice that is not helpful and can sometimes hurt you. They always hire from outside and hardly ever promote.
good,"Frontier employs great people, a typical day at work can be mixed depending on your position with the company. I've heard good and bad from various people in all positions. In my experience with the company all the people in essence are ""good"" people. The job has some of the best pay I've seen and the benefits are also very good. The managers are also good people however I am not a fan of some of the policies in place. Also there is a bit too much micromanaging (in a ""bad"" sense) for my taste. You'll see favoritism and people jockeying for the favor of managers all the time. This is also a union shop as well which can be good and bad depending on your point of view."
good,"Must be able to both sales and customer service. This was a fun company to work for, however top management isn't the best. They make poor requisition decisions and then handle the process poorly.  Many customers angry and employees losing jobs."
good,"Frontier started off a great place to work, but after the California, Texas, Florida conversion, is been a wild ride ever since. I'd be lying if I said I like working here now."
good,"Very customer-focused company with strong representation at local levels.  Talented, committed employees who are passionate about their customers and building the company."
good,growing fast passed environment. sales goals and quotas with commission compensation plus hourly. use multiple systems to complete daily tasks. not bad drive
good,"Frontier is going through a period of growth, buying up facilities and networks throughout the US. Because of this growth, they are now restructuring the company and during the month of November reduced their management work force by nearly one thousand employees, including me."
good,"I enjoy problem solving and that is a large part of my daily duties. I have had the opportunity to wear many hats in my 23 plus years in this job. Customer service, sales, customer complaints, complex billing and order problems, customer retention, peer coaching and training."
good,comapny very unorganized and took on too much responsibility. Decent training but it is who you know and who likes you to get to the next level of advancement
good,"training did not really prepare me for being on the actual call floor. It was also pretty stressful if you didn't know what you were doing. "
good,great place to work starting off but to move forward to become more successful in life I personally feel like frontier doesn't fit my 5yr plan
good,"as the company grew the team environment lessened. great benefits and good pay but often last minute changes to budget affected new position openings, bonuses, and overall moral."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"I really appreciated my time at Frontier and the relationships that were formed. The people are all wonderful and make the day to day easier. Unfortunately the service that we provided was not the best and subsequently created a lot of unhappy customers. In all of my years working customer service, this was by far the most difficult. It did help me become a very patient person and my listening skills are second to none. I can say I do really appreciate management and the comradeship that was felt there. I am very grateful for all that I have learned in my time at Frontier."
good,"While at work a typical day consist of taking calls in a active social environment,we would sometimes have spiffs and games to compete with other employees for who can make the most product sales,and the winners would get prizes this was a highlight of the job i also learned how to improve sales ratings from management feedback and help from other employees,also had tv's for us to watch and gaming systems to play while on breaks and lunches which made the job fun."
good,open door policies and open lines of communication all sound good until you use them. Tough culture to break. A lot of its always been done this way or we have tried that thinking.
good,I liked working for Frontier because they allow you to be able to balance you home and work life with out much trouble.
good,When Frontier first bought out Verizon they were great! then they hired all the idiots from Verizon that ran Verizon into the ground now Frontier sucks management are a bunch of idiots horrible place to work! I took early retirement with 6 years left to retire couldn't take it anymore and now they're filing for bankruptcy!!!
good,It was an ok job but too many rules and regulations high turnover rate paid isn’t the best this is a good job for college kids not someone who has a family not enough money to pay bills
good,"Overall working at Frontier was a decent opportunity. I was promoted once, allowed to work from home and was provided many opportunities to earn additional income with Bonuses, Commissions and Overtime. Co workers were great friends most of the time. The bad part was that the work can get extremely stressful at certain times, blame goes from top to bottom when something isn't right. Frontier's customers do NOT like Frontier at all so that was tough sometimes. Schedules/Holidays are chosen by seniority instead of rotation so after almost 5 years I was still toward the bottom on that list. Frontier did increase the hourly pay rate a few times to compensate but in the end the company just couldn't get things right which led to my center being closed permanently and employees laid off, sad."
good,"Typical day at work was spent monitoring the switches for problems that could be cleared remotely, taking calls to provide support to outside technicians, attended outage calls and assisted in restoral of outages when necessary"
good,The people you work with make the struggle of this job bearable. There are some great perks to the job and good benefits though. You have the opportunity to make commission just make sure to keep track yourself of what you sell. The schedule when starting isn't the best if you have another job because the schedule is based on seniority and changes every 3 months.
good,Upper management are idiots they do not care about the customer they would rather have contractors do the work instead of the technician if overtime is envolved
good,"If Union:  not much room to advance. benefits are better than management. union/management relations can be pretty tense"
good,"In the area in which I worked. The company was unable for some reason, to compete with it's competition in the area. The manger I had was, slow to say the least."
good,"You'll have your hands on some of the coolest technology in the industry.  In IT, we are running the latest and greatest systems and software.  No easy day and plenty of work to do.  Tons of technology to master and a number of great folks to collaborate with."
good,"If you can get on with one of the union centers this company provides more than adequate compensation for work. All benefits provided on a 90/10 scale including health, vision, and dental"
good,Frontier has provided many opportunities for my career development. Frontier has taken on territories across the domestic US and made strides to standardize product services and systems.
good,"Frontier had great benefits because it was aquired by Verizon in this area and the union fought to keep our pay comparable.  The company had been poorly managed in many aspects and is financially challenged due to acquiring territories in CA,TX, and FL."
good,"Answer calls and troubleshoot about technical issues with customer DSL, FIOS, and Vantage TV problems. "
good,"Upper management expects middle management to be responsible for every aspect of reports, even when out of their control.  No data/reporting provided to perform tasks.  Expected to figure it out.  Peers are extremely helpful, without them, job is unbearable."
good,"Frontier Communications offered a tremendous salary and benefits package. My work week was Monday through Friday, from 8-4:30. We were mostly unsupervised, adults, that were able to perform our duties."
good,"They started off paying a certain amount and certain benefits like bonuses, which were appealing for the little pay. Then they increased our areas of responsibility but took away the incentives. They were also changing the support tools every few months and they became less efficient each time.  I worked in the Intuit Quickbooks Enterprise Solutions department."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"A lot to learn, but you are taught OJT and formal training is sparse and usually very minimalist in nature or not applicable to our level of work.  This results in large amounts of time fighting with systems resulting in extended outage to customers.  Management is hit or miss, having your back on some issues but ignoring others.  Lots of money spent trying band-aid fixes that often have to be rolled back."
good,"Very very competitive, fast paced. Most income is made from commission. Definitely a job for only some people, you don't know if its a job that fits you until you try."
good,Technical jobs at Frontier allow you to push yourself as much as you want. There are many opportunities to field engineer solutions and build strong co-worker relationships.
good,The hardest part of my job in the 1 hour 30 minute travel. The most enjoyable part is fixing the problems on the network. My typical day at work is solving network issues...
good,it is a nice job but the management doesn't really care. and they will not give you a good schedule to work with school or other things that are going on even if they tell you that they will
good,Everyday is a work day without regard to weekends and holidays. If that is what you want go for it. The people are nice the expectations to high. good stepping stone job.
good,"I was a former Verizon employee. We were paid more than Froniter employees. Once contract the merging contract was up, they started laying off management and former Verizon employees, bringing in contractors, or lower paid employees. Management make poor long term financial decisions causing us to loose customers. Some workplace environments are very tense, while others are more relaxed. The hardest part is not knowing if you're going to be the next to get laided off. The most enjoyable part of the job are your co-workers."
good,"Hard working company leading tech. great pay great benefits. "
good,"Great family/friend workers and everyone is there to help but the main thing is that the big wigs do not know how to run the company in terms of information being transmitted to the lower management and staff. Sorta like telephone, its never consistent."
good,"If you are a mother with children or a father. This job is a great place to work for stability and the benefits. There isn't a lot of room for growth in the company they would rather hire from the outside, the pay is okay and it's a union company if you choose to be in it."
good,"The supervisors expect you to do the work of 3 people and they don't even know how to do the job. THe pay is decent, but not for the amount of work you're expected to do."
good,"Very challenging and competitive environment. Good benefits and vacation time. Hourly plus commission. Centrally located right off the freeway, parking is not too bad."
good,"This was my first big call center job. It started off great before the Verizon merger. Once the accusation happened, we bit off more than we could chew. That led to everybody getting laid off. Management were helpful whenever problem occurred. The pay got better after the raise. Overall it was a good learning experience."
good,General day included being on phone for 8 hours answering questions concerning various accounts.Work at home give great opportunity to balance work and home
good,"Frontier is a company that has been unable to provide current products that are relevant, This creates a stressful work atmosphere for all employees.."
good,"I have worked a call center before and this one was much more intense about you being more than perfect on every aspect of you call. The products you work with are all well outdated and hard to have the moral integrity to push to your customers. Be ready to spend 70% of your time following orders where someone in the field or in programming has dropped the ball. The job says to focus on customer service, but plenty of ex coworkers i knew only succeeded when they focused on nothing but sales, some were rude and hung up on their customers. The management is in disarray and there is no structure in upper management, The former CEO was actually replaced and moved to the board, then resigned after a fiasco with connecticut acquisitions and the former CEO went to college for Biology with no telecommunications experience. The only positive I really have is Frontier helps the community, even if it means just putting their name in the paper, and the pay is good if you can follow metrics and sales to a T."
good,"The best vision/dental/health insurance ive ever had.... its incredible. But its a very high pressure environment, and the job requirements more than doubled in the time that i worked there while compensation stayed the same. overall its a decent job capable of providing a decent wage"
good,"I re-entered the telecommunications industry with Frontier and found the work crew that I supervised to be knowledgeable and yet still eager to learn. Great people at the local level!"
good,"The medical benefits and compensation were very good for the time I was employed. This was a union job so when the contract would come up for renewal this was always a very stressful time for everyone. I had a couple different jobs while I was employed there, some more interesting than the other."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,Fledging company. Hope to see it grow in the future. Good management but they need to improve on their marketing strategy.
good,Not with company long enough to properly evaluate company. Structure was still mainly  Verizon and the conversion was still in flux. I have no way to properly judge this company.
good,"Enjoyed the company of my coworkers, it's hard to give an accurate review since the Frontier company I worked for was under the control of IBEX Global which led to more uptight policies on going paperless, and no use of pens nor pencils and heavy amounts of monterization when it came to going online in between calls. My supervisors were very helpful and empathic. Working with Frontier was rewarding in knowing I was able to make any customer's days and having a living wage."
good,"When I joined the company it was Verizon but it was purchased by Frontier in 2010. At that time my job description was forcefully changed from a Customer Service Rep to a Consumer Sales Associate. Hard selling isn't ethical to me therefore I felt it was time to part ways with the company when a buy-out package was offered in order to reduce staff, I accepted."
good,I enjoyed working for Frontier on salary plus commission. Then rules & regulations started changing. I enjoyed my co workers it was a fun place to work.
good,"My jobs were assigned on a daily basis and I planned my day according to the jobs that were assigned. I was responsible for repairing and installing phone lines and HSI for residential and commercial customers.  I learned the importance of providing good customer service and was able to work independently with a little bit of supervision.  My co-workers ranged from very seasoned to less experience then myself.  The hardest part of my job was the lack of team collaboration. "
good,"My job was to provide an outstanding experience for both new and existing customers by offering cost effective, superior product solutions to address customer needs. Requirements were to drive company sales via outstanding communication skills, customer focus, overcoming objections, working independently while having autonomy in making solid business decisions."
good,"under-qualified, unethical, discriminatory management"
good,The people I have worked with here has made my job and often make my day.
good,"Handled inbound calls, assisting customers with questions about billing and products."
good,"just had regular issues with customers, funjob,"
good,I performed my duties to the best of my abilities but this job was not my passion.
good,when I started the job it was a customer service job and after being there for about 5 years it turned into a sales job. We had sales goals that weren't there when I started and frontier focused more on making money than helping the customers needs.
good,Dealing with issues within quickbooks can be tiring. Some days you are extremely busy or some days it is extremely slow. Training for about a month helps but its more hands on
good,Stressful - worried if company will survive.   Need to move on to another career after 35 years.  Communications industry has changed so much a new avenue is needed
good,"Each day was different . Every customer's issue was different  as well as their personality.Enjoyed working as a team and learned a great deal for the time I was there. My immediate supervisors were excellent. Always had my back. Most of all the director of call center , Gregg was awesome. He was the director the entire time I worked at Frontier."
good,This job definitely comes with an exciting atmosphere but at the same time this is a sales job with a lot of turnover. If you are good there are great monetary benefits.
good,"Recruited in to company by former director that I worked with at Sprint/Nextel.  Frontier gave me the opportunity to learn the ""wire line"" side of communications.  Excellent management team."
good,"I enjoyed working for Frontier. I respected Frontier for being diversified. I liked the fact that it was a company that allowed it's employees to work from home depending on the position,  I left the company to move back to Pennsylvania."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,Frontier has constant middle management change. (6 managers in 14 months). Still not sure what the company culture is supposed to be ? Too many systems to write orders.
good,"This seems to be a tumultuous time for Frontier.  In a few short years they have experienced aggressive growth followed quickly by expense reduction, downsizing, restructuring, and now news reports of renegotiating corporate debt."
good,"ok job, just didn't like customer service. Being glued to your desk all day with back to back calls is torture. They were eventually bought out by sykes."
good,"By far the best group of people I worked with. Extremely knowledgeable and always willing to help customers. Unfortunately, I wish we had more direction and a sense of job stability."
good,"Based on the time of year, average workload to hectic and end of year. I work with field technicians to turn up and test Internet Network devices all over the country.  I assist them to getting me remote access to device so I can program and make ready for deployment of customers internet service."
good,What I learned at Frontier communications is a wealth of knowledge. The company is going through growing pains and have not resupported the lost workforce.
good,"benefits are generous and very reasonable with out of pocket cost, schedule is ok, no flexibility for appointments must use vacation time union job that does offer great pay"
good,"I was hired as a CSR. I loved the job itself and the people that I worked with however the company was open from 6am-10pm, 365 days a year. We were told when hired that we would work in 14 week blocks so we could plan things around our schedule.  The farthest out our schedule was only 3 weeks out. It was impossible to plan anything such as family time, doctor or dentist appts. I did not feel that this was a very fair way to treat employees. When I inquired about the 14 wk blocks I was told it was in the works. When I gave my week notice it still was not at the 14 wk blocks. I felt like it was a loosing battle."
good,"I worked with many smart and kind people.  However upper management made the work more difficult by poorly managing its plant which directly affects customer service.  Frontier is held in a bad light by its customers.  Still, the people that worked there cared, and they do the best they can."
good,Great at first in training. Thought we had every thing we needed when we hit the floor but i was. Hired on during the verizon to frontier transfer. Crazy times. Either way pay was decent.
good,"40+ hours of work weekly/ OT as needed/ New and upcoming training documents/ morale of company is decreasing daily/unhappy employees & customers increase daily. "
good,I work from home so the work place is excellent.  I have an isolated home office so it's quiet.  Absolutely the best part of this job is working from home.
good,"Frontier Communications is a Fast pace and competitive environment , it is very beneficial to remain knowledgeable about changes in the products and services offered by the company"
good,"Los of good work to do, payroll isn't easy. It made it a challenge ever day. As such, it was fun while it was with Frontier. Sykes was not the same..."
good,Great place to work but no career advancement. Management is good and flexibility. Not good benefit as good other company. Life balance between works..
good,Good pay and benefits package based on union job. Management could be better. Need better training and skill set in ADA and EEO issues. Company as a whole could be more caring toward its employees.
good,The company operates nation wide giving residential or business customers telephone and/or internet service. My position as Facilities Assignor is to help the technicians as they are out working to install or troubleshoot issues with our customers.`We also process orders that come in to make sure they are given the right facilities for them to get the best possible service .
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit. The pipe dream they guaranteed to Frontier and the employees they did not honor. They changed all the policies after the grace receiving period. Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"The actual job is great, at least the department I worked in. Pay is well above average compared to 90% of other jobs in the area. Good benefits and being in a union was good. Not a lot of unions around this area/state. My direct supervisor and manager were awesome, but management as a whole for the company is the worst. You can address problems but nothing ever happened afterwards. So why bother. Lack of communication throughout the company. No one knows a definite answer and it takes going up to director level to get any supervisors or managers to respond to emails or voicemails when asking for updates on anything. Out of 50 contractors only 15 or so hired permanently and never updated if your contract was being renewed until the day it expired so you didn’t know if you still had a job until literally 5 minutes before your shift ended on the day your contract expired. A manager even “forgot” to contact a temp agency to renew contracts and ended up losing 20 people and nothing was ever done. No one cared. Managers should know how to do all jobs in the department they supervise, in my opinion, but not one manager knows the job. Select few are great and put forth effort. Company needs structure and communication overall and it would be a lot better. Work environment great and relaxing. Loved the job and people I worked with. Most employees don’t even have Frontier in their neighborhood and if you did, they don’t give employees discounts for cable or anything. Most companies give employees a good discount if you work for them. Frontier is all about money and not customers"
good,"Frontier is a company in transition, and has been for awhile.Upper management has had no real strategic game plan to correct sales strategies.The company seems to be sitting back on marketing and competitive strategies to grow business."
good,nothing to say.  I wouldn't recommend working at this location.  The people were great locally.  The over all management always seemed to be operating in panic mode
good,Frontier has really helped me grow since I got hired at 18. But things have changed a lot since I was hired. It is a good place to work but not so much to grow
good,Work independently on jobs.  Some weekend work is required.  Start work at 8 am finish around 5 pm. Vacations and time off based on seniority.  Management seems to change often.
good,I have been at Frontier for 6 years and in that time I have grown and developed into a strong leader and member of Leadership. I have been mentored and developed by National Directors and Leaders from across the company foot print. For someone starting out in sales or sales management this is a great organization to gain fundamental management and sales skills.
good,Networking is your friend in this business.  If you can impress someone in upper management your chances of being successful are much better.  Just doing a good job isn't enough.
good,"A typical day at work is meeting the expectation of customer request within a certain time frame."
good,Work environment is good. Opportunity to grow. Supportive management. Always something new each day. Work culture is caring. Opportunity for advancement. Friendly place.
good,"this was not a bad place to work people most of them were good jokers also they did have a company picnic every year"
good,Frontier Communications should of put a more thoughtful transition on beta accommodations to retain great workers for future hires.Frontier is a  great company to work for.
good,"company provides benifits and competitive salary. fair amount of turn over and union based hourly associates. company services 29 states. has approx. 18,000 assets throughout the nation"
good,Frontier has been a decent place to work with decent pay and benefits.  Since the CTF acquisition last year promotions have come to a halt with no career growth.
good,"Employed for less than two years before retiring early. Sales orient corporation compared to att with outside field employees. Extensive exposure to sales. great experience. Offered early retirement, time grandfather from att"
good,"Very fast paced, great opportunity to meet people and learn."
good,Very cut-throat environment.  Co-workers were enethical and dishonest.  Constant complaints at things they had done.  Managers were always trying to fix the problems created.
good,"Took multiple calls per day and assisted customers with technical issues. The work place itself, is very relaxed and everyone is very friendly and helpful."
good,It was okay to work here.  There is a lot of changes and it is all over the country so you might not be in the loop on a some stuff even if it is related to you.
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit. The pipe dream they guaranteed to Frontier and the employees they did not honor. They changed all the policies after the grace receiving period. Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,if you can handle the shift then it is a wonderful paying job however I was a young mother going through personal issues that could not be accommodated
good,Worked in a department that had horrible management.   Group eventually all left the company and manager replaced.   They hired the right person and I believe it's better.
good,"Frontier has come along way in 7 years, with the advent of purchasing territories from Verizon to network investment and customer care, Frontier continues to grow."
good,Coworkers are amazing management not so much they are all over the place meaning they don’t even know what they are doing customer service is really not their priority and making employees happy to work there is definitely not in their interest
good,Great place to be during my tenure. Local Engagement business philosophy played a huge role in the success of the region. Super internal team helped solidify market performance.
good,"Company has poor executive leadership, and they are taking away pay and benefits from workers because of poor management decisions.  There seems to be poor strategic planning at the executive leadership level.  Good people are leaving as a result."
good,The pay was decent in comparison to other companies and the same field of work. The management staff was half-assed and the  Field manager was just okay.
good,I was former Verizon who went over to Frontier only to be riffed 7 months later.  I did get a severance package which was what Verizon was offering but was paid like it was time worked.  Taxes taken out.
good,"Most of the staff works at home. Monthly spiffs to when things for free. (Gift cards, pizzas etc.) Semi- annual shift bids. Paid time off and holiday pay."
good,"Frontier was great to work at , but the company has fallen on hard times and laying people off.  the pay was great and the benefits .  as a coach it was a great position . but they ran off old out dated systems and had bad comunications."
good,"Was OK place to work but I found union employees set in their ways."
good,"On a typical work day with Frontier I talk to incoming callers having issues with their FiOS services. I've learned different sets of computer skills and working with system for remote troubleshooting internet, tv, and phone. Management is over sees our call control and coaches agents to better assist customer we may struggle with. They also enforce company policy and detail us on many company changes. The hardest part of my job is call control when a irate customer isn't willing to cooperate or listen to our resolution steps, but I still manage to get through to the customer with patience and understanding. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting the customer services working again, or providing a guaranteed commitment date of when a technican will be out for service repairs."
good,"Frontier is very nice company , i feel like it just didnt fit me and my personality . For me it was kind of stressfull having to do all those things and training was a whole month , so having to cram all that info into us in one month really didnt sit well with me"
good,"Frontier work training program utilized co workers for training. Good atmosphere for learning new things. Good skills for building a career problem solving, multi tasking, and interpersonal skills."
good,I read the reviews of the job for frontier and did not take them as a new employee I asked the coaches and mentors about what I read and they said not to pay that any mind little did I know I should have listened about what I read from all the reviews.
good,"I learned to be more sympathetic towards customers.  I also learned how to multi-task.  "
good,"Frontier Communications has many great employees, but it is run by executives who have no coherent vision for the company and are wholly out-of-touch with its employees and customers."
good,"Frontier was a good company to work for at one time. It has recently gone through some changes in leadership and it has directly affected the quality of work and product, services offered."
good,very good money but not worth being yelled at everyday by backwood  country customers company Is bad unstable  if you want to make money  real quick this is your place but its not long term
good,"The message from management is to be a productive member of your neighborhoods and in doing so, it spreads to the ones you are working, with daily. Lots of successes in the behind the scenes forums of a telecommunications company. Plenty of missteps were made, but were corrected as fast as humanly possible."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"Telecom industry’s largest and most complex flash cut, when acquiring California, Texas, and Florida territories (CTF). Maintained unwavering customer focus throughout. Work place culture is transitional in the CTF area. A typical work day for management is 10-12 hrs. Currently working through many system compatibility issues."
good,Bad service to good people can't do it had to quit pay is fine if you don't have a issue selling their service but want for me nice job nice people but it's Commission based
good,"I really enjoy the opportunity to learn more about the product each day, and pass that knowledge on to my clients. When handling each call, they are not rushed, we are able to take the time to research and provide the client with a resolution"
good,"The job and pay were great, but the management at my location was completely unprofessional and the bias towards union workers in HR was obvious. I reported a coworker for sexually harassing me and the company did nothing because management felt her actions were justified, even though her accusations were fabricated. What's the point in holding workers to the code of business conduct if it's never enforced due to favoritism? I put in my two weeks notice after making the choice to return to my studies."
good,As a contractor I helped with the analyses of data for the Verizon sale of telephone lines to Frontier.  This was a 4 month contract.  We worked 50 hour weeks to get the requirements together.
good,The place is a good place to work they have not worked all their kinks out as for there training. When you get out on the floor you are confused because they don't have sufficient answers for their clients about how to solve their problems.
good,"During the period I worked for Frontier, the company worked very hard to serve its mainly rural and small town customers.  Frontier offered advanced telecommunications services in areas that other companies would have ignored."
good,I felt that Frontier didn't really care about their employees and less about their customers. I was a customer service and sales representative but I felt that I was not able to assist the customer like I use to when I was hired back with GTE. Just see what you can sell them and get them off the phone.
good,"I started working at Frontier as part of an acquisition and the company has been in fluctuation ever since.  I don't feel like I have a good enough feel for how the company will be working in the future with so many new departments, processes, and systems still being integrated into our regular business operations."
good,"good place to work at money is stable and you get the hours you need people are nice there , the hours are very good you get a set schedule , you get one day off during the weekend ,"
good,I had fun working at Frontier the people are talented working with FIOS and VOIP. Unfortunately the company was falling on difficult times and I was caught in a reduction of force.
good,"A typical day at work in the Assignment department will always include dealing with a crisis or outage, and reacting to those things that are out of our control. However, it is a fun and exciting place to work because of this. Each day brings new challenges and inspires creative thinking of how to best deal with each scenario."
good,"came in to telecom without any experience and was in the top 2 in sales my first 3 years.  instrumental supporting cast, and obtainable quotas.  Enjoy having a supporting cast that is professional and experienced in the industry"
good,"Can be a good place to work, depending on the company's current goals. Those goals can vary, depending on the specific project and on current expectations of management."
good,"I enjoy working at Frontier.  The work itself is pretty interesting and I enjoy the people I work with for the most part. "
good,"Worked 7-3:30 daily researching and determining the legality of fraud alerts coming into the network. Took responsibility for Toll Free trouble tickets in order to determine what carrier had to process the issue and fix the problem. I worked in a fraud database as well as switches.  I learned a database related to 800 toll free traffic."
good,"We are constantly changed around thrown on projects we don't even want to do and have our pay effected because we can't perform to what they would like. Management is poor, they make you believe they will work with your school schedule but yet I need to get off an hour early for me to go to school early and it may not be approved. "
good,"Good company but facing challenges.  Need to invest in infrastructure and develop more products to meet market changes.  "
good,"a typical day at work is filled with system errors, the inability to work around the error and then angry customers who assume I just don't want to help when in reality I can't perform my job without the proper tools"
good,"Frontier provides updates and communicate  to their employees about changes taking place, etc. new promotions, customer feedback and how we compare to our competitors"
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"it was a very interesting place to work for,  very demanding and not to  flexible with everyday life.  coworkers were nice but difficult to do sometimes call volumes would be very overwhelming at times.  but iam glad i tried it."
good,"I loved this job. Sales were not my expertise. I was a dedicated, hardworking, Dependable, reliable & exceptional customer service employee. I loved reaching out the customers to show then I cared and that I was more to them then just another customer service. I took time to make a trusting relationship with clients. I gave my info for them to call me back when in need. Even took time to send a email to say not only am I here for you I am here for you this hour.  And I took the time to call them back to say YES! I am still here for you. My work ethics & drive for me to overextend my concern for the customer’s needs and prove to them I cared. Unfortunate I did not have the sales skills for this Job. I prefer customer service over sales. They loved my customer service though. I got along with everyone and was a favorite with co-workers. The coaches were helpful. I proved to the coaches I was the hardest worker and highly dedicated to do a job well done. My job consisted of inbound calls assisting customers with billing, questions on account and finding orders, fixing orders and giving the customer a reassurance I was there for them to make a difference. I followed through with the customer’s needs. I went above and beyond at times to assist them. For me I loved my job and I proved it by doing it well."
good,Liked the experience with office work and bookkeeping practice learned how to create monthly spreadsheets for accounting and learned to manage the office accounts and revenue vs expenses.
good,Company specializes in telecommunications service for business and residential.
good,"My job at Frontier requires a lot of inter-departmental communication and coordination, often in the early morning to ensure the best possible customer service. That part I enjoy. Its busy but the days go by fast. The management staff occasionally gets together for off-site meetings where we discuss the Operations stategy, and get together for some team building. The employees are highly talented prfessionals and are great to work with. Installation/ Maintenance operations at the phone is a complex environment, and that makes it difficult for me because there is a lot to learn with the limited training I have had in the field. I like the fact that there is a new challenge and something new to learn on a daily basis."
good,The company is okay to work for.  The company needs more direction.
good,"Frontier has an average workplace culture. There is a tad bid of a tendency towards a nanny state. As with most employers, you need to have accountability for your time spent at work. I would say it is an average place to work. There is no social or political tension. You do not feel like one group is being favored above the rest. In that respect, it is a very comfortable environment. "
good,"Fielded an average of 50-70 customer service calls per day. Recommended and helped"
good,"good manager and staff"
good,guidlines for support boundaries very fine between supported and non supported. Poor managment
good,"•	Answering a multiline phone and assisting customers with their questions and troubleshooting issues"
good,"The people that you work with are very friendly. The amount of calls per day varies so you never know how your day is going to go, but once you get the hang of the job process, its easy to do."
good,Frontier is a company of constant change while trying to right size it's various departments.  They are 2 years into a purchase of additional territory more than doubling their size.
good,it was a good job with benefits. answered phones and took care of customers with there billing problems and adding products to there accounts
good,A typical day for me is taking a call from a customer that either wants new service or has a current issue with bill or service. I definitely listen to the customer and proactively resolve their issues. I got along with my co-workers well and the hardest part of my job was being too trusting of other people but what I did learn is that it is ok to say no sometimes.
good,"Started working at Commonwealth Telephone Company but was later bought out by Frontier Communications Services. Having work there for nearly 40 years of which the greater part of these years as under Commonwealth, my work was a big part of my life that only provided a means of living but a life in it's self.  My co-workers became my friends and my family.  I grew as a person gaining self confidence with each new job experience and learning on a daily basis.  I was challenged and challenged others to learn new and exciting processes that came with the new technologies.  The hardest part was losing my job as a result of restructuring that also comes with new technologies.  My experience was positive and rewarding and I will be forever grateful."
good,My 26 years there allowed me to make a comfortable living with a family/life/work balance.
good,"Telephony, land lines, DSL, has gone through some major changes because of the cell phone industry. We (40) of us were downsized because of this. The hardest part of the job was we were evaluated on sales. Hard to sell when everyone was leaving. Enjoyed the job. It was a good run for almost 14 years."
good,"Frontier Communications is an open, friendly working environment. The staff is easy-going except for the constant push by management to have the help desk technicians to sell. There are multiple attempts to show a reward system for top producers of sales, not resolution of internet issues and advancement is weighted more toward top performers on a close ratio of same. There is a genuine camaraderie amongst technicians and most supervisors to achieve the common goals and knowledge is shared openly. Enjoyable parts of the job include the generous use of flat screen televisions throughout the facility and multiple break rooms and personal cubicles. A typical day at work included investigation of various issues which were service affecting along several geographical areas. Follow-up with Field technicians for resolution of physical challenges."
good,I would stay if they let me. Feel comfortable here.
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"I was growing in my potential way faster than the company was. The company has sooooooo many defaults, I believe they will be bankrupt over the next couple of years."
good,"This is a very challenging place to work, at least in IT. This is a fast-paced place to work."
good,Was a great company when it was Enterprise Telco. It was unstable when Global Crossing purchased it. Lost a lot of it business clients when Citizens Communication took over. They let a lot of good people go. Everyone became just a number.
good,enjoyed working with co-workers on customer accounts and inquiries
good,"My typical day at work would be having meeting everyday before going out in the field and walking door to door to customers homes talking about their bill. What I learned from this job would be different kinds of DSL, DISH and telephone service are out there. the management there is never satisifed with the hard work we put into the company in the neighborhoods we have been in. The co-workers here are as good as anyone that works here with their job and sales. The hardest part of the job is to make sales with people that don't know what kind of company they want and how much their bill is a month. The most enjoyable part of the job is working outside everyday."
good,"It was a fun ride.  I worked for GTE, then the Bell Atlantic merge that created Verizon.   I rode the Verizon train into the Frontier acquisition of the first 13 states, then was laid off as part of the final frontier acquisition of the final 3 States."
good,"Depends on department.  Sales can be very stressful and difficult but the pay is very good in most states, depending on whether there is a union or not.  Some jobs are much easier and still pays good.  Then you have employees who do next to nothing that make the same pay as the one that works their butts off.  Some management is great, while others let it go to their head or really have no clue or play favorites."
good,"I recently joined the newly created Frontier Cybersecurity Operations Center in July '19.  This group is responsible for detecting and mitigating internal and external company threats.  Coming from a telecommunications background, the learning curve for cybersecurity is steep.  However, I am fascinated by this field and don't might struggling to comprehend new technologies knowing that it will make me a better employee long term."
good,"Bought all of the old Verizon copper network.  Don't see any future in that."
good,"It’s been a journey. I’ve transitioned from  GTE, Verizon, and Frontier. As always in the telecommunications company that is fast paced and is constantly changing"
good,"Stable work place with continuous improvement. Has production support and Enhancement projects. I learnt Sterling CRM and had hands on experience in multiple technologies  like Implementing Restful Services, "
good,"When i first started the calls were steady but not overwhelming, now its back to back to back. Your stats are heavily micromanaged, and a number of company policies treat the employees like children."
good,"Frontier has great people working there and has a chance to be an amazing company. But they are playing catch up and are always 2 steps behind. They are focusing on older products and what other companies have used or done in the past, instead of thinking about what the next solution should be."
good,Great company and culture. The company was going through some growing pains while I was there. I think that the fiber infrastructure that the company owns is and extremely valuable commodity.
good,The supervisors were good and well equipped to assist us with whatever we needed help with. The customers who call were often ill mannered and inconsiderate.
good,"Due to recent events, I do not wish to comment on Frontier. Due to recent events within the company I prefer to remain silent. "
good,I get in to work and look at the ticket for my location and just start working them. We receive 40 to 70 tickets a day.  We start with ticket that are P1.  We work all upper management ticket first.
good,"As Technical Manager you had to get there early and start setting up jobs for the crews. Lots of emails with issues to deal with. Time management was a must. Lots of issues to communicate with individual employees in many different environments and departments. Unpredictable days due to cable cuts, equipment failures, and miscellaneous outages (man made or weather). I enjoyed the challenge!"
good,"good pay, lack of communication,thought would retire from the "
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,Lack of focus on maintaing individuals with industry experience in management roles. Lack of proper training for new hires and lack of utilization of existing employee assets
good,I work in the executive escalations department. I work with customers one on one to get their service or billing issues resolved. the hardest part of this job is handling an angry customer. the best part of my job is resolving the customers issues and getting a thank you from the customer.
good,"Call Center with a diverse group of employees.  Employees are close and they care about the welfare of each other.  The company is community focused, employees participate and support many different causes and charities."
good,"Love working here; however the senior leadership is destroying the company. Mid level management is really good and somehow holds things together. I would like to stay, but the company is doing very poorly and there is a great deal of uncertainty."
good,"Good place as starting in a help desk role."
good,I worked with a wonderful group of people. We all worked well together to achieve goals of the day. My supervisor was always willing to help us improve ourselves and listened to all our concerns. My manager was very caring and was always there if we needed his help.
good,"Great job, expected to retire from Frontier."
good,The company is very strict on attendance. It is a Union job so that is a plus and probably the reason I stayed as long as I did. The pay is good if you are a competitive seller as most of your pay is based on a commission This is a very stressful position
good,Can wear a person down. Business needs change on a dime. One moment it is one thing and then the next helping different departments taking up the slack.
good,There is constant change and reorganizing that takes place and this leads to uncertainty about job security. The company is trying to stay up with the competition.
good,"bad management  "
good,I would not recommend working here to anyone it was a very hard place to balance life and school.  They were very disorganized and I spent a lot of time correcting mistakes on accounts.
good,"Outside sales has autonomy  in work life balance, management could be better. No real direction on how to be successful in this department. The most difficult part about this position is the management, I wish they had more experience doing the actual position."
good,"company valued sales more than customer satisfaction. had to help customer within a specified time frame and always had to sale a product no matter the call type."
good,"I worked for the company after it bought portions of Verizon Telecom. Great people, good pay, excellent benefits. The company decision makers took on a large amount of debt acquiring territory from Verizon. In the effort to expand the footprint, money was not spent maintaining the existing plant. Additionally, the company has recently moved away from it's US based employees only model. Finally, the company has worked towards hiring contractors in increasing numbers in lieu of hiring permanent union workers."
good,"There is very little oversight which is good and bad.  It means you can make your own hours mostly but you also have to be self motivated and self disciplined.  Coworkers were all friendly people and it was a nice atmosphere."
good,"Frontier is a Fortune 500 company with a lot of room to advance when I started in 2004."
good,Frontier is a very high stress environment. Expectations of high survey returns and call volume success rates there is little support from management.
good,"Once in office, setup everything in store and start working. making calls to sell. As well as speak with people who might be thinking about getting our products."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"Love who I work with, The job itself has changed since being sold in 2016. We continue to grow and improve each month. Best part is the people who I work with"
good,"A typical day could be good and bad, learned how to handle and explain IT issues. The management was very accommodating. Worst part was being yelled at"
good,Frontier Communications is a good place to work with good pay and average benefits.  Locations in many states affords the possibility to transfer to other states.
good,"Was part of the sale from Verizon to Frontier. The team remained the same as we changed shirts. Frontier operates a little different, but we were still under a Verizon contract so for technicians not much changed"
good,"Fast paced work environment. Customer focused, always looking forward trying to out-due the competition. They need to support the employees in new training areas better but do offer good benefits to the union employees. Frontier is always looking for experienced sales associates and knowledgeable Ethernet knowledgeable transport technicians."
good,A lot of work and not much room to advance.  Most of the people are very friendly to work with.  Have to be self driven to get things done.  Make sure to negotiate what pay you are going to be happy with because the raises aren't much if at all.
good,"Good company with a very knowledgeable and supportive lower and middle management. A lot of opportunities to learn and grow--I truly loved my time there. However, I think they may have bitten off more than they can chew regarding their acquisition of Florida, Texas, and California."
good,Overall it was a fun place to work and a lot of the experience depends on which project your with. They do incentive's and company activities that you can bring your family to.
good,"I love the people I work with, but management and the always changing rules on a day to day make it stressful. So it takes away from the company as an over all."
good,its great to work with my company there is a good and competitive colleagues always a situation of healthy competition environment.
good,"Worked in call center environment as customer service representative handling inbound calls, also worked on an automated dialer making outbound collection calls. Worked last 2 years out of my home which was very nice. Was laid off along with 50 other people in 2013."
good,"Frontier is a challenging, fast pace, growing company that is working to improve it infrastructure and provide the best service available."
good,"Typical day at work is show up log in to the phones. You're granted a 3 minute 'grace period' from when you shift starts to when you're supposed to log in to the phones. If you are even a second over you're tardy. Once you're all situated and have your 7 different programs up and running your ready to work. You go to the work distribution and time tracking program to get your tasks and while you are working from that you are simultaneously getting calls and chats with people needing your assistance on service orders or needing clarification on anything service order related. This is how work is until closing. Sometimes busier than other times but for the most part the same. "
good,Job was great but not so much the department managers and especially human resources. The team managers are awesome though. Human resources will find every excuse to terminate you or force you to resign if they feel you are not doing a good job. My manager hated to see me leave and did everything in his power to make them let me stay but human resources was not having it. I am not the only employee who has been let go because of nonsense.
good,"Relatively low stress work environment with good work life balance on IT side."
good,"The typical day is sitting down at your workcenter and providing customer service (however, when the issue is unable to be resolved, escalating it to a higher-tier representative)."
good,"Pros: nice environment, good benefits, helpful team atmosphere"
good,"Loud work environment.  Not your typical office. Great people, but not my type of work environment"
good,"I've been with Frontier for 2 years, 1st year Sales and Service which is very stressful and schedules change so much, don't know how people did this job with kids?? The commission is not worth it to me, but for some people they enjoy people yelling in their ear for the extra buck!! Transferred to a Offline specialist which was the best decision ever, I am not a sales person so this was perfect and my whole attitude change, I love my job and my co-workers are like family.  Schedules are pretty much the same, they don't change often in offline but atleast its job security! And managers are more understanding in offline, for Sales the managers are all about money, if you don't make your goal (commission) you don't matter!!"
good,A typical day at work would be taking forty to sixty calls that vary from sales to customer service to trouble shooting. I've learned that offering products is another form of customer service because the customer may not know the full extent of our products. The management and coworkers are helpful. 
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit. The pipe dream they guaranteed to Frontier and the employees they did not honor. They changed all the policies after the grace receiving period. Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,Great pay and benefits but horrible management and very disorganized and unprepared. Systems never equipped to handle newest customers and In return reflected poorly on the employees. Hands were tied and customer service was poor due to lack of communication and focus on the severity of millions of unhappy customers.
good,Overall okay company to work for. Low moral but great pay. Techs take care of eachother however upper managment is not the best to work for. Great job training prior to having jobs on you.
good,It's a good job but since it's in computers and communication things are always changing and it was hard for the trainers to keep up with the updates to the CSR agents due to so many changes.
good,"Frontier (at least when I worked for them nearly six years ago) took care of their employees in terms of pay and benefits. The hours were fixed, Monday through Friday. Though some departments work Saturdays, I never had to work a Saturday in my entire six year stint with them. The benefits were hard to beat. I had medical and optical insurance, which was among the best, at no cost to me. The employees are a part of the IBEW Union, which were great with negotiating the best benefit/pay package possible. "
good,"PRO - My whole Building is closing so this may come off bias, But the people and sense of family in THIS building is great, honestly this job was amazing, been here since 2016 and i have made a lot of relationships. PAY was amazing, and PTO was awesome unless you got sick a lot then you may run into issues, but that could change depending on your center. "
good,"Job duties change frequently, webinar training plus monthly review on productivity. They offer internal job advancement plus training. When we run out of work time is offered to take the day off without pay unless you choose to use personal or vacation time"
good,"This was the most back stabbing, inconsistent place I have worked. No were to be found, the forward advancement. People would burn you down from management to regular employees at any moment and you would need to be able to talk, work, lie your way out of ever took place...."
good,"Our team sold internet, telephone, and cable tv services to residences. Unfortunately, Frontier's internet speeds did not compete with the speed of Comcast internet. Therefore, getting consistent sales was hard."
good,"A typical day at work would be an upbeat tempo, assisting customers, possible spiffs to win prizes."
good,Customers would call in about their bill being high or incorrect. We would have to educate them on their statements or handle supervisor requested calls and try to deescalate the situation with credit or referral. I did like the people there but it almost seemed as if the supervisors did not want to take any phone calls from our customers unless it was a kudos call. Not a bad place to work and training was great.
good,"Frontier Communications was a great place for interns to get real sales experience. Call volumes were very high, but rewards for sales were also very respectable."
good,"The best part about this job was my customers. Although they came on the line usually irate and wanting to cancel, the challenge of developing a report and trust in order to keep their business was awesome.  The issue for me was the internal systems being poorly developed. This make giving customers exact costs and discounts very hard, thus adding to the regular stress of the position."
good,I learned alot with gte and verizon but the technology went backwards with the smaller company. it was a good job and i wish i had it back but i made some mistakes in my personal life then.
good,This is a decent job with okay pay and hours. The management could use some improvement. But they give paid time off and benefits. But you may have to sign a union contract.
good,"Most of the staff works at home. Monthly spiffs to when things for free. (Gift cards, pizzas etc.) Semi- annual shift bids. Paid time off and holiday pay."
good,Management was good to work with.  The company is losing money and laid 23 employees off.  It does not look like we will called back to work for Frontier.
good,Receives  incoming calls to troubleshoot and Dispatch Technicians to make phone repairs for landline customers in 38 states. Assist customers with adding features and making changes to their accounts.
good,Great place to work and take care of family they offer good benefits vacation time you can make a decent amount of cash flow to generate great capital for you family.
good,"On a day to day basis, giving the company an honest 8 hours and striving to do the best I can to serve the customer, I find joy in balancing work and family life. Continuing to learn each day new ways as processes change and remaining competitive in a workplace where I may not measure up to some of my peers. I enjoy making connections with people locally and abroad as we interact with employees and customers from other areas and states."
good,"A typical day for me, Starts with checking the schedule to see who is working what functions for the day. I then begin supporting the agents that are assisting, our Front line agents, Field techs and Bucket work. I assist with answering questions on procedure, and assisting on complex issues that require, out of the box solutions to resolve service issues. this requires me to know our systems and equipment thoroughly. My knowledge of our Fios operations, as an online agent assiting Technicians and as a Trainer, from time to time,plus as a floor lead. Allows me function above and beyond expectations, so we can resolve ongoing service issues. I have had the opportunity to work with some of the best that the California Region of Frontier has to offer, My current supervisor is one of them."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,Enjoyed working for Frontier. Took the sales job because they had no local implementation positions in Oregon. Was the Lead sales rep helping the new ones learn the systems and processes. This last year Frontier changed there focus. Decided it was time to move on even though I met my quota.
good,Communication company currently in transition with many changes over the last few years. Co-workers always friendly and focused on getting the job done.
good,"Though I have no hard feelings whatsoever, the Verizon to Frontier transition has been tough. To the point that I was part of a mass layoff. I believe they have a plan, and all will work itself out in time. The pay is great, the executive management seems to have the best intentions. Once everything settles down, I believe it will be a fantastic place to work."
good,The work environment is good with room for growth and imagination. Management is friendly and always wants you to succeed at what you do. Much but manageable pressure
good,"Great company to work for.  They work very hard for their employees.  Each employee was professional, cordial, and very prompt.  They do an awesome job of selling employees to hiring companies.  They have many relationships established with companies; thus, increasing chances to interview and make process flow smoother and faster."
good,"I am inspired most when providing leadership and taking ownership of key projects. I have a genuine passion for working with and guiding individuals and achieving and retaining high standards, I continuously strive to understand the bigger business picture and utilise excellent communication skills to solve business issues. "
good,Overall this company is ok to work for... Pay could be better but still a secure position
good,"This was the best job I ever had, lots of various things to do..My manager in Idaho was awesome....the corporate structure was ever changing..."
good,"Customer service representatives work from home, which consist of incoming customer calls. Phone and computer systems are through virtual private network which can cause some issues. Attainable sales requirements."
good,Towards the end of my employment with Frontier the pay was excellent and add pay for performance you had a great place to work!!! Managers all had different styles so you would have to adjust ever so often.
good,I wish the company was a little more stable and not teetering on bankruptcy. I am the newest employee in my area which means if layoffs come I am first on the list. I really enjoy my job but the uncertainty is not fun.
good,"The CPE Group takes care of the phone and Network equipment associated with Kaiser Permanente Facilities.  After the transition from the Avaya Systems I was in charge of.  There was no training on the Cisco System Platform.  I had to learn it all from looking at it and calling peers. There has been training on Avaya IP Office systems, but I have only been involved with one installation as the Company is selling Other small phone systems to small business clients."
good,"Poor management keep all the phone and internet service working for 6 counties "
good,Its a great company with great benefits. if you have an open schedule and dont mind working nights or most weekends and dealing with customers on a daily its a great fit.
good,retirement is wonderful; only worked for Frontier takeover 9 months; 10-12 hour days; relocated to Mississippi to enjoy my family; hope for part time work
good,It was a good place to work until the big job cuts came down. My group was cut with no notice and was a blind sided call. All of the seasoned Support staff was let go.
good,"non stop 8 hours per day sometimes required overtime"
good,They had a bonus structure which they would reward you with depending on surveys. They had a training program to help you learn as well as supervisors who helped you learn as well.
good,Frontier is a great business the work sometimes is slow  but I learned alot I traveled the east coast delivering to different offices and also picked up orders for the Durham offices and warehouses your on a time schedule  so there is really no time for error
good,"I worked at Frontier Communications as a temporary employee for 18 months. I found most of the employees there were friendly and that contributed to a pleasant work environment. I would have liked to have been hired as a full-time employee, but the company was reducing staff due to business climate. The company's business is providing internet service and land line phone service, which is a shrinking industry."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,Excelled in multitasking with daily challenges from problem solving to customer service.
good,A typical day is sitting with a head jack on waiting for a call. Talking to customers about multiple issues. You different ways on how to approach each situation with each customer. My co-workers are very helpful at times I can't get a supervisor's help. The hardest part I would say is trying to keep your hold time down and the average helding time down. The most enjoyable part of the job the motivation to sale.
good,"I had a blast working there, but the pay was too inconsistent to live off reliably. With the number of cancellations based on factors outside of my control, it ended up becoming quite frustrating and lost me a lot of money."
good,it is a great job to have and it would set you up for the rest of your life if you were willing to put in the time but I couldn't work 14 hours everyday six days a week
good,Job security. Good location. Great pay & healthcare. Good work environment. Great vacation & personal days off & paid. Good work associates. Good work enhancement options.
good,"Overall, the culture at Frontier is good. The individuals are nice, work hard and are collaborative. It's not a cutthroat environment. However, the Senior Leadership Team lacks vision and execution. They continually make the same errors over and over, which can be seen in the company's revenue, etc. Longevity is not on anyone's side at Frontier Communications."
good,Working at Frontiier Communications is a great place to start off as an intern. The works there are very helpful and very patient with the training and when your working the floor with customers.
good,"It's a call center job, so people are going to yell at you and verbally harass you, if you make it through that, its a great job. Management is loveable, you will meet the most wonderful people ever at Frontier. But the job is stressful."
good,"This is a good group to work with.  There are so many different aspects this job requires for all the skills that have been taught.  The most important is to be able to relate to the customers face to face.   Our community is very small and we are well known, even outside of our work hours.   "
good,great place to make a lot of money if you like to work a lot of overtime. management and technicians work as hard as they can to keep work moving at a steady pace.
good,I loved the job and hated the culture at work. I am grateful to have had this job because I learned basic accounting principles and now know how to use quickbooks online. So when I do run my own business I know just what to do
good,"The company is going through some changes right now and is a bit unstable.  Once they reorganize and work out some bugs, it will then be a great place to work."
good,Company had so much potential and was so promising pay was 14- 17.25 per hour PLUS commission. bonus opportunity every month and awesome benefits and PTO. unfortunately the company bought over verizons three biggest territories for residential services ( phone internet and tv) company drowned itself with money loss and took too much they could handle. entire building was laid of shortly after hiring. only 4 weeks severance pay. this was SUCH an awesome environment to work in how ever and managers were amazing. i loved my job it was an unfortunate mistake made by the company causing its down fall.
good,A company  that just had made  it to the Fortune 500 list. a very busy work enviorment daily. I learned how to manage different systems as well as increase my knowledge of Microsoft. A very a good support system with management as well as co-workers.
good,"Working in a NOC environment is mostly laid back and the overall culture here is friendly and jocular.  There is a lot to do when major outages, fiber cuts, or storms hit, and you've really got to stay on top of the alarm systems.  "
good,This was an enjoyable work experience. I believe more training could have been offered to the customer service team.
good,was a great place to work and i did learn a lot while there. the only hard part bout the job was the up and down sales goals that made it very hard for a person to manage his/hers goals monthly.
good,With customers you may have a good customer that is understanding or a customer that is very upset with the company. Most of the Supervisors are more than willing to assist you  and help you with every problem.
good,good people. fun place to work. This place is no longer in business as well.  Was an upbeat place to work. played lots of games and had plenty of incentives for a job well done. staff was nice.
good,Great company  to work for when it comes to schedule and benefits. However not the greatest when it comes to job security. As well as not very good with business choices.
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"This is my first call center so perhaps this is typical of a call center but here goes: the company has many advances for pay and opportunity to earn bonuses. Probably the best advances for pay at any job I have dealt with. You get 4 weeks a year PTO starting out and full benefits after 90 days. Pay and benefits are 5 star. If you take intuit calls you will learn lots of great information to put on your resume and its rewarding to help people on the phone. There is also lots of competitions and incentives to make you want to hit goals which is also rewarding "
good,I had the opportunity to advance and move around in the company it was just unfortunate that I was not able to move to a diff dept that would provide me with the same pay rate I received now.  The company has great benefits
good,"Clock In"
good,Frontier has a lot of work to do with there customer relationships. There management does a wonderful job with teams though. They have a high energy environment that is always looking to succeed.
good,"The management is really cool, the benefits are cool, and the break room is awesome. The hard part about this job is the actual job, because there are usually back to back calls with very little time to breathe. There is also mandatory overtime, which can be a pro or a con depending on who you are."
good,We used to follow the Water fall Model.It was a great pleasure working in that company.
good,"This job is for people who are very flexible with hours and etc. This job makes it to where you have to travel a lot and at a moment's notice, sales is very challenging but rewarding."
good,"They are under new management, and it's been a downfall since they changed."
good,"Great pay biweekly, used to have over time. Okay management. High turn over rate for every position though. "
good,When Frontier purchased Verizon Fios it was very chaotic at first.  During this time the call center I was assigned was abruptly closed.  I hope things are better since this merger.
good,"A typical day at Frontier would be coming into work 2 hours early to work my mandatory overtime. I would log into the computer and open my phone line to receive customers calls. Calls would vary from billing or account questions, repairs, sales, collections on delinquent accounts and disputes. I was required to handle every call myself because we are given all the tools necessary to do so. I was required to make so many sales in a day and was required to offer services to every customer when it applied. I was on an open phone line which means as soon as I hang up with one customer  there is another one on the line until my shift was over. I had to handle a great deal of confidential information at a time, while managing multiple programs at once."
good,"Good working environment and flexibility. Chance of learning new technology. Mostly focus on developing web application in various platform. Although hired as intern but gives change to work in big projects. I leaned various new technologies like Angular JS and web api. Very friendly co workers. "
good,"Great insurance. "
good,"I've learned that some companies only care about quantity over quality. Over the span of my time here, I have noticed that they care more and more about the numbers instead of how they treat their employees. My co-workers are the ones that keep me going there! We have a great group of people. Coming into work and working with them and our customers is the highlight of my time there."
good,"online chat representative handling billing, taking service requests, loved my co workers, hardest was working as large business representative i loved.."
good,"Initially sold on how the job would be, had expectations set. Then that was all taken and flipped on it's head.It can go from family oriented to cutthroat in a blink of an eye in there it seems."
good,I had just had a child and it was tough with the rotating schedule. I hardly was able  to spend time with him so i had to leave. They had a great training program for new employees
good,The cable/video business is very competitive.  Frontier is a publicly traded company and had a board to report to.  Funds are limited in able for them to be a true competitor.
good,It's a great place to work and have gained lots of experience in working with union workers. There are a lot of constant changes and no solid procedures for everyone to follow and be on the same page.
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"Management is great, compensation is not always what is should be or the norm for the area.  While there is room for advancement, you have to know the correct people."
good,"Very system driven role, get experience receiving such exposure on the systems side of the business."
good,"staff we awesome very helpful, laid back environment, customer service did pretty much everything"
good,"I loved working here and actually miss the place tremendously. Great team, great management great opportunity."
good,Looking forward to utilizing my career as a trainer and/or team lead. Frontier Communications gave me the tools as a consultant to expand into certain fields of interest and learn different aspects of the company.
good,"Each employee hired at Frontier Communications had to essentially ""survive"" the first round of employment - Working in Residential Customer Service. If you couldn't pass the class, you were not hired. If, upon hire, you couldn't have 2 of 3 months of good sales - you were terminated. After a year of success, without write-ups or warnings, you were allowed to apply for other jobs within the company. These were union positions. As long as someone with higher seniority than yourself didn't apply, you would be considered. I lucked out getting into Dispatch, away from the call center. This allowed me to move into a various allotment of jobs doing everything from Dispatch to Complex Billing and Large Business Sales."
good,"Amazing staff of co- workers in an poorly managed company. A few star performers have been kept, who excel in knowledge of telecom and customer service."
good,I had to answer calls for customers who dialed for Operator or for Information.  Sometimes dealt with difficult customers who complained about my voice or not being able to do searches by category (411 requires asking for a specific name of a person or business).
good,"The telecom industry is shrinking and Frontier continues to make poor decisions about how to spend what little money they have left. Not by upgrading infrastructure, but by frittering it away on useless tools and gimmicks that are replaced in a couple of years, wasting time, money and resources that could have been used to advance the company and its employees. "
good,"A typical day included taking multiple calls to resolve issues with DSL internet. Expected to provide excellent customer service."
good,"You have to take things with a grain of salt. People are mean and you have to keep yourself grounded, keep to the point. They are the one's that are not paying their bills."
good,Upbeat and fast paced environment. Making sure customers are happy after being frustrated towards company. Helping customers resolve issues and making sure services and bill are correct for future.
good,"I love my job and the technicians I work with daily,great group of technicians but upper management needs a lot of help. Company heading in wrong direction after acquisition of Florida, Texas and California"
good,"Future of company is questionable, if you can live with that uncertainty it's not a bad place to work. Frontier would not invest in local outside plant and systems leading to continued customer loss due to poor service."
good,"Typically for salaried employees you are working in the office for your normal hours, then remotely from home on call as needed or afterhours as required by business needs.  Sometimes difficult to find work/life balance.  Generous PTO policy.  Culture shifted over the last three or so years causing many departments to have a negative shift in morale overall.  Hopefully culture overall improves as it was once a fantastic atmosphere where you would consider your peers like family."
good,"Good place for steady employment. I enjoy my colleagues."
good,"Has ups and downs in the course of a day as far as issues encountered. For the most part in our office we are left alone. Our Manager understands our capabilities. We are forever changing as everyone is freaking over the finances so new "" BETTER "" procedures and Tools are constantly changing... without notice often"
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"Supervisor was amazing, yearly raised were good. Mandatory Overtime every week was  very stressful especially if you have daycare. Company has a union"
good,working with customers to help them to keep their services and make payment arrangements. The hardest part of the job is that the customers become frustrated when they have to be transferred to another department and the wait is a very long time for them.
good,"This was my first experience with a technical support role. Looking back on it, I feel like the company didn't really pay too close attention to the contract, and what was going on through their internal channels."
good,I gained a larger understanding of customer relations and how different one customer can be from another.
good,"Good company going through tough times. overall vision is finally aligned, lack of asset management put the company in a bad place. however it seems they are getting back on track"
good,"Co-workers are a nice diverse group. The company held many fun things such as free sub day, raffles, and family day events. Pay was great considering how easy the work was. I did hear though that shortly after I quit the pay changed and they laid a lot of people off."
good,"While I only contracted for this company, I was able to see how they treated their employees and I was impressed.  Though people that actually work for the company may be privy to more information."
good,"People were great, except upper management were disengaged in practical spending in needed areas. I think overall the company needs to start upping the game in the R&D department."
good,Culture is fun and family oriented. Not sales heavy or customer service based. Management is friendly and willing to help. Training was fast paced yet thorough
good,Frontier is a good company to work for. They are unionized on the non-managerial level. They also offer bonuses and incentives. There is not much more to say this is a great company to work for.
good,"Most places now a days do not offer full time or benefits and the starting pay is usually less than satisfactory. I've held enough jobs to know a decent company when I see one. Before Frontier, I came from a call center that offered the very basics of benefits, horrible late night and graveyard shifts and no say on whether you work it, no compensation for working holidays and you better be there because you're working all of them, overtime pay stipulated with loop holes, and management was not very nice, so it was refreshing to see that at Frontier you're guaranteed Sunday off, they're only open until 6 Saturday which is better than a graveyard shift at other call centers! They're also only open until 9 pm Monday through Friday so no extremely late nights! The benefits and discounts offered to us through local businesses is awesome! They are very involved in the community and with veterans. They observe holidays and compensate you if it's a holiday they don't but to see that I don't have to fight for Christmas off to be with my family is more important to me in the long run! The starting pay is above average. When push comes to shove it's a call center. There are expectations and goals that have to be met, accountability, and a flawed system with the customer feedback that unfairly impacts agents but I have yet to a find a call center that doesn't do this as well and when you weigh the good to the bad, it's worth it. Anywhere else you'd be surrounded by people who don't care. At least they value their employees. I also am confused on the down size talk. They just hired about"
good,"Full P&L responsibility for east Portland, Oregon and southwest Washington.  Directed all activities within delivering Frontiers fiber to the home network (FiOS).  Reported directly to the Senior Vice President for the region."
good,"Learned to be an independent self motivator. Demonstrated proficiencies in telephone, e-mail, fax and front-desk reception within high-volume environment."
good,"Frontier Communications is very fast paced environment where teams network together to resolve issues and brainstorm to come up with new out of the box ideas while living the Frontier values of ""putting the Customer first and treating each other with respect"". Frontiers Senior Leadership Team ""walks the walk"", lives the Frontier values, always keeping  an open door and open ears, looking for creativity and innovation from the ground level and up. The hardest and most enjoyable part of the job are the same, the ever changing industry and technology keep you learning daily.   Frontiers advanced online  training program is available to all employees, taking away any excuse not to be on top of your game."
good,"Here is what I really think, but not really what I completely think, because who knows how private this is - and why should I provide career info for free"
good,"The company itself is very great to work for, and would work for them again in the future. however, the industry itself is very unstable, and frontier has gone through 3 major mergers in the last 10 years. job security is not guaranteed for management."
good,Frontier Communications is a good company to work for with plenty opportunity. They offer several benefit packages and commission on any sales made during the call
good,"The sales team is a great group and Frontier genuinely wants to help customers meet their business communications needs.  With the recent Acquisition of the Verizon properties in California, Texas and Florida there is a lot of work to do with linking internal billing and customer service systems."
good,Definitely geared to make you succeed. They provide great training and resources.  Extremely friendly staff.  Very customer service based.
good,"Supposed to be able to work freely, however, at times you feel micro-managed, would be told I can't do certain things because they were too advanced.."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,With the transition from AT&T to Frontier in Connecticut.  There were many challenges that faced a new division of Frontier.  Frontier has been dedicated to correct the issues and to make Connecticut a well connected community.

good,Working with frontier was very fun and interesting. if you enjoy spending your days on the phone and in a cubical this job is for you!
good,"Managed clients, meetings, sales as well as customer service."
good,I typical day is ever changing and challenging every customer interaction is different. each situation requires certain troubleshooting and problem solving techniques. For great customer service accurate and detailed information was always given.
good,"Amazing boss and team"
good,"Typical day was answering phones, setting up phone service and offering new services to existing customers. I learned that i don't have the heart to try to up-sell services to little old ladies on a fixed income. Management was great, always willing to lend a hand or give advice where needed. My coworkers were nice, i made a few good friends while I worked there. The hardest part of the job was up-selling when I knew the customer couldn't afford to add services. The most enjoyable part of my job was having my own work space. I didn't have to share a computer, compete with coworkers for equipment or room."
good,"Managing a competitive sales team. Managing the normal work day involves analyzing results, reports, conference calls, meetings, customer escalations and employee issues."
good,"Interacted with Users to know their Business views while gathering the Report requirements and provided Several Report Mock-ups to finalize the requirements "
good,Organization is a must!  You travel quite a bit and meet new people every day.  The telephone and internet industry is quite exciting in that it changes constantly with promos and competitors vying for the same customer.  These positions were newly created so there has been several changes over the past few months.
good,"Great office, had my own desk, friendly people I have remained close with even after we were all laid off. Clock in on your computer, start taking calls."
good,Very good company to work for also upward mobility within the company. Management will work with you and co-workers are very friendly. Basically a typical day solving issues and offering sales. Working for the company everyday there are changes and you have to have the mind set to flow with the changes. You can not have a negative attituded working in this environment. You have to have patience and a positive attitude.
good,"As a switch programmer in line assignment, I exceeded the daily quota of residential and business telephone service installs, product and feature additions, changes and deletions. I kept abreast of various high speed internet/data subscriber line (HSI/DSL) technologies, and physical and virtual equipment/interfaces, especially within the last 7-8 years. The lines between residential and business services often blurred as more customers work at home, or both home and office. Management provided an environment that encouraged cost-cutting and revenue-generation. A constant influx of new customer service representatives in several call centers throughout the nation required my fellow assignors and me to increasingly provide telephone and email training on correct order creation, closing and posting to ensure proper revenue captures. This climate change within the company became perhaps the most difficult part of our work since it adversely impacted production levels (three business days ahead pulled back to only one day ahead). Daily challenges were keeping pace with learning and applying new products, features, service packages, and interfacing switches and platforms. Programming required great concentration and fluency in numerous switch languages and syntax. We Assignors constantly communicated with each other to better understand and effect coding to satisfy customers' needs, maintain switch integrity and protect revenues. Assignment worked closely with in-house database administrators to ensure our written coding instructions and switch access levels were up to date. Our department"
good,"I loved working there, they gave me the freedom to work at a fast pace, but at the same time we had fun and generated sales. Our managers were great."
good,"Upon arriving, previous shift would inform me what devices or segments were down and the status of the people resolving them. Monitored network and, when necessary, reconfigured router and switch systems to make them run more efficiently or properly. Learned about basic network troubleshooting and configuration. My co-workers were very competent and hard working. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the technology. The most enjoyable part of the job was keeping up with the technology."
good,My work day involved the following;
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit. The pipe dream they guaranteed to Frontier and the employees they did not honor. They changed all the policies after the grace receiving period. Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,Great job for someone that enjoys a static working environment but not for someone that enjoys change and energetic environment.
good,"I've learned how to respond to customer's questions and look up their account information and history accurately with define information provided in the training session, how to use the noble telephone systems in the call center and sell additional products and services. The most enjoyable part of the training was intensive role-playing as a customer with co-workers."
good,"If not familiar with Telcom industry, takes awhile to grasp the technical aspect.  Competitive industry, but must be motivated and not get discouraged when dealing with business owners"
good,"Frontier Communications provides communications services to urban, suburban, and rural communities in 29 states. Frontier offers a  variety of services to business and residential customers over its fiber-optic and copper networks, including video, high-speed internet,  advanced voice, SD-WAN, cloud solutions, ethernet internet access, and Frontier Secure digital protection. Frontier Business offers  communications solutions to small, medium, and enterprise businesses."
good,"fun job, if you don't mind walking for a few hours and knocking on people's doors. It can be kind of defeating after knocking on endless doors it seems like if no sales are made. You have to connnect with a customer, if theres no connection its a harder sale. Just be careful and good luck."
good,"the job becomes very repetative which makes it boring and easy at certain times , there is some room for growth but it also does come with favoritism in the work place the atmosphere was very positive but never the less competative"
good,you make it what you want it to be. the days go by fast when your busy. working in the rain and snow was the hardest part.Management were guys that were from the field so they understood when you had a problem
good,Working there was great had large teams to work with and there was no stress from management there was no mandatory overtime and they had on site lounges on every floor
good,"Good job, good manager, limited supervision, work at own pace and manager understands what it takes to do the job and issues you run into. major issue is the union the do not like contractors"
good,Job to have can’t say to much bad u worked har and they paid me for it things ended do to a fellow co-worker not following national regulations and codes
good,The workday in the field consists of many variables and challenges. It can be very rewarding meeting different people and working in different locations. The demands of the job must be worked proffesionaly and safely.
good,"Overall, Frontier Communications is a great company to work at.  Changes are necessary to turn the company around and in the right direction.  Nevertheless, I'm confident that things will take a turn for the right reason and things  will become great again."
good,"Great work experience. Good full-time hours including wage. Staff and managers do a very good job at teaching you how to excel in the job. Everyone is friendly and open to give advice, even though it is a pretty dull work environment."
good,"Management is allowed to do their own thing, this can lead to separation in work groups, however management is generally good about listening to your issues."
good,"This was a good experience, however I have a few complaints: the systems were antiquated, AS 400 computer systems that were often breaking down, and not very efficient to use. The vacation system was also tough to understand, and it was difficult to schedule time off. "
good,Wide range of background of co-workers which becomes useful when looking for assistance in different areas of the business. Many years of knowledge on within the facility.
good,"Had a great experience working for Frontier Communications.   Frontier offered me job promotions, new experiences, and room for professional growth.  I have nothing but positive to say about Frontier."
good,"A typical day at Frontier is very busy.  We maintain the account of many high end business, Municipalities, City, State and Federal accounts. With the installation and maintenance of T-1 circuits, ISDN and PRI circuits. With this job they expect you to be able to maintain and keep records of all of your dedicated accounts. You are assigned to a team of professionals who are able to assist and bounce scenarios off of.  The job can be tough when customers need projects completed for setting up new locations and or moving their existing businesses. We must be able to follow up with management and the customer in the event of any problems via phone call or email."
good,"Good company great benefits with good top pay requires hard work but pays off good union with a lot of support managera are great very accepting, not much room for advancement besides management"
good,great place to work at great benefits until we had a conversation. now there no job security. commission was awesome until vendors were hired to take our place
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

good,"Typically receive incoming calls"
good,"great place to work. ATTENDANCE is very important! some what sad how i had to end this job due to being sick in the first 90 days. but great place to move up and advance. great benefits, and culture."
good,union desk job/ $12.00 an hour with cheap awesome health plan from union
good,Very good learning opportunity with great people that worked hard.
good,"Report for work by 0800 Monday thruogh Friday "
good,Worked there for 3 years and had 3 rounds of lay offs.  Seems like unless you are in sales(and hit your numbers) or a tech(IR/CO) they like to move things around.
good,"I loved working for Frontier in Burnsville, MN the people were great and we grew to be more like a family (management and all). A typical day was assisting customers with billing issues, up-selling the Frontier products, building rapport with customers, while using dual monitors to navigate throughout system."
good,Not the best job but is the job for you if you want to see the rich side of Central Florida.
good,"I recently retired from Frontier 5/1/13. Frontier Purchased Verizon-WV July 1 2010, The transition was very taxing based on learning new systems and work load. But I have to say my co-workers and management came through when ever needed. I enjoyed seeing Broadband and Ethernet projects come to completion. A normal day at work was participating in project meetings and conference calls to help current project move along. Overall I Liked working for Frontier."
good,"Good pay by the hour and commission, they motivate you to sale and you get prices if you make certain amount of sales during what they call a ""POWER HOUR""... It is a little hard to make sales when customers call to complain about the service or the bill.. there are ways to make a sale with a customer but you gotta be ""pushing the product"" in a ""friendly way"" so the customer doesnt feel like is being ripped off.... PRO - If you are REALLY GOOD SELLER you will get a really good check, Im talking about $1,500 to $2,000 for a 2 weeks work.... CONS--There are times that customers dont wanna buy anything at all, especially during the Holidays... if you dont meet the quota managers stop helping you and then they just fire you... they only help whos making the sales because managers get a good commission out of them... ""Why feed the hungry when you can make the fat ones fatter?"" thats their philosophy ....and speaking of fat ones, YOU WILL GAIN ALOT OF WEIGHT... you are sitting all day talking to customers on the phone, that does take energy out of you, and there is always food around... Potlucks, pizza for the whole floor, candy to ""keep you awake""... I started at 180 and walked out at 245. Overall, it is a good company to work for, great benefits and great work environment. It almost make you feel like you wanna go back to work the next day....""ALMOST"""
good,Typical 9 to 5 job. Each team can have their own norms. Very flexible in that way. Old and matured firm and management. Growth opportunities are little saturated.
good,"Tough challenging, faced paced place to work. Direct management and co-workers are awesome/supportive, but corporate HR is horrible! Don't get sick, or have family emergencies because HR will terminate you in the blink of an eye, or force you to take a zero tolerance/final notice ""agreement"" to keep your job. Total Bush League!!"
good,"Great pay, union job. I did customer service and sales for 6 years. I loved it, but took a buyout in 2016. We sold home phone, home internet and dish television service."
good,"frontier was temp job but during my time there they were pretty fair. "
good,They have this rule that within your job/title or level you can be bumped out of your job. Even if you are doing extremely well in the position and the other person that has the same job title as you maybe they never worked in the department you're currently working in but just because of the job title or job level they can replace you based on seniority. Doesn't matter if it's departmental seniority they don't look at that just how much time you've had with the company even if you've never done that specific job for that department.
good,"Day to day duties were usually ever changing, because telecommunications is ever changing. There were always process changes and thinking involved. The job itself is challenging, because you are one of the front lines in the background to resolving a customers telephone programming or internet provisioning. Training alone took six weeks, and then a six month probation area, ending with a qualification. The job also requires sitting at a desk most of the day other than two breaks and lunch. Pretty strict on keeping at your desk, as with any office job."
good,"I really enjoy my years at Frontier.  I really had a good boss.  The working conditions were less than ideal, but the compensation made up for it.  I would do it again."
good,"Fast paced atmosphere with many deadlines and objectives to meet. Lots of opportunities to move around to different departments an do different jobs within the company, both locally and nationally."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,demanding but well compensated. Poor management. coworkers are good people. know what your doing or your out in the cold. Dont get involved in company politics.
good,My time at Frontier has been nothing but a great experience for me. I have nothing but good things to say about my manager. He was willing to work with me though any work situation that arose. Nothing but the best for the team and for my team.
good,"Potential for making a good salary and benefits, high stress environment.... if you are willing to put out effort then you can be successful... have to be able to work in a stressful environment"
good,"It was what it was, I knew it would never turn into a full time position. The company was greedy with the acquisition of CTF. Which in turn caused the company to loose subscribers,"
good,"Love my job. Would love to be able to retire here, but company is in financial distress with threats of imminent layoffs. Highly technical job. Over 100 programs and switches knowledge required."
good,The stress at this job is stress and management isn't always honest about everything. If you can handle stress then I would work here. It is a challenge
good,The hardest part of the job is managing through acquisition and transition.  In addition managing escalations and customer service deliver.  Working with co-workers and customer's the most satisfying part of the job.
good,"After two years the job has become too repetitive. Normall if you gain additional skills in your field you gain more pay or some sort of benefit, here you will recieve nothing more."
good,"I worked as a contractor so the value of my review may be somewhat limited.  My manager treated me very well, and the work was challenging.  I would have liked to move to a permanent position, but it was not meant to be."
good,"Selling communications for voice & data to customers in WV. Stay focused. The hardest part is using 3 different systems for configure and a proposal, pricing, and placing an order once its sold. The most enjoyable are the loyal people to interface with throughout the day."
good,"I went to work for Frontier Communications when they bought out the contract for Verizon and they states of California, Florida and Texas. Very high-paced because of the company change over between the frontier and Verizon. The customers are very irate and did not know that their precious Verizon had been sold out to Frontier. A lot thought that we stoled Verizon from them just to give them Frontier. This was a temporary job there was no guarantee of having a full-time job there. I did enjoy working there, but there was some people there that were not very friendly. If I was offered a job back there I would definitely go back there."
good,"This company was great to work for at first (and I imagine it still is as someone who doesn't work for the vendor). The company did constant spiffs, the commission ""was"" great, and it was challenging. The systems I can't speak highly of though, they were honestly not good, but you could pretty much request your scheduled days after probation, and once you got the hang of the job it was very easy. I would recommend this job to someone as long as it held the standards of when I first started working here."
good,"This is a call center job, and from what I have heard (since this was the only one I've ever worked for) It was one of the best companies to work for. It was a very high stress environment and sometimes management wasn't very polite, but for the most part, everyone was very friendly and helpful."
good,Union job with great benefits. Of course the company is always trying to take these away from us. The CEO makes millions but thinks we should be paid less. With out us he wouldn't make anything. He needs to step back and appreciate the workers he has and continue our pay and benefits.
good,A typical day as IHD is the cust has a problem you wither fix it or create a TT. I learned a ton working in this job. The management is alright. The culture is as a call center so very diverse. The hardest part of the Job is the job itself but not the concept. Most enjoyable is the money.
good,"It's a typical call center job, very accommodating, good opportunities for advancement, opportunities to work at home, not the best communications throughout company"
good,You would go in and immediately get on the phones and take phone calls until your scheduled breaks. It was a very good place to get call center experience. The trainers were great! The coaches and team leads were average. The hardest part of the job was working so late into the night and work on the weekends. The people I worked with were the best part of the job.
good,"I cant complain, Frontier pays great. "
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"Every day at the job is pretty much the same thing, taking inbound calls and providing technical support for Intuit products (for myself it was QuickBooks Online)."
good,"Internal support means being able to work in an environment in which customers are also co-workers. Much of the stress found in a call center is due to working with external customers, thus much of the work environment is relaxed. Great benefits and plenty of PTO."
good,I was a contractor for Frontier through Synergy Services for approximately 14 to 15 weeks working in quality assurance of bills.  I enjoyed creating an instructional manual to assist in training for my responsibilities.
good,I learned a lot at Frontier on the network and equipment that is needed to run a business. Management is very good as well as the coworkers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customer complaints and billing issues. The most enjoyable part is giving the customers the right solution for there needs in business.
good,"its ok. it a job that helps pay the bills."
good,loved the people and the job responsibilities.  Worked with some wonderful people and very supportive community at work.
good,Customer are the most enjoyable part of the job. A fast paced call center enviroment
good,"My team member very friendly and professional ."
good,I loved the work environment. It was very clean and the workers were nice.
good,A typical day would consist of talking on the phone all day and assisting customers with their bills and placing orders for new and current customers. There were times the center would have spurts where if you sold a certain product you could be put into a drawing for a prize. Sometimes we would get a free pizza lunch or on a hot day a milkshake or smoothie.
good,".I liked working for Frontier, 'til got laid off last December,2012,I learned alot, enjoyed working and repairing vehicles and equipments.enjoyed working with people at Frontier. The hardest part of job was learning new things on newer vehicles and equipments."
good,Frontier is a household name and I really enjoy working for such a reputable company.
good,"I enjoy coming to work everyday. I love the work that I do because I am educated and expierienced with a range of electronics technology and also interaction with customers, vendors, supervisors and coworkers. I have learned many attributes over the many years with Frontier such as the value of the customer, the value of being a dedicated employee and the importance of my job duties to the customer and employer. I don't have any complaints of how my job is difficult. I work to improve the difficult situations that arise at times, but at the end, it is a learning experience that improves me as a employee."
good,Frontier is a high speed technical company. Because of long hours sometime morale is low. Many task are tedious but necessary to achieve optimal results
good,"taking inbound phone calls from customers, assisting with technical support and customer service, asking troubleshooting probing questions to guide the customer to fixing their issue."
good,The employee is responsible for connecting the customer to the central office equipment. This is accomplished either by troubleshooting an existing customer's phone lines or installing a phone line for a new customer.  The most challenging part is locating and repairing problems between the customer and central office.  The problem maybe in a neighbor's back yard or in a difficult area to reach.
good,"Various job functions to be performed daily, some routine others not. Service numerous companies with their Telecommunications needs. Good place to work. Entailed work activity."
good,"Working  in the field as an Sales Account Executive was exciting. It kept me busy looking for more ways to create new prospects to be added in my pipeline. Hence, I helped greatly with fulfilling my monthly quota."
good,It is a good working environment with friendly staff and employees.  There are many opportunities for cross training. It is a clean and safe environment to work at.
good,"A typical day at work consist of installing phone and internet services for 3rd parties, such as Granite.  Frontier improved my computer skills and my ability to converse with people with different language backgrounds.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to learn new things and different products types, which allowed me to understand the job more.  The management team at Frontier tried their hardest to improve and keep the company morale up.  Actively celebrating different cultures and holidays."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"I am very grateful for the advancement in life that frontier has brought me. In a year I saved money to get a car and move out. However Frontier is always changing. There is always a new promotion to memorize, a new regulation to follow and even changes in your commission pay out change. What makes it worth while working at Frontier is the hourly pay on top of commission, the friendly environment and the benefits. I personally only have dental but a lot of other benefits are offered."
good,"Enjoyed working in my current position - very challenging but mentors always willing to assist."
good,I liked Frontier in the mall a lot. It was a lot of sales and I was top 10 in the market. I loved the team but the hours were until 9-10 pm. Sales is the way to go.
good,many customers have to deal with techs not calling or showing up for appointments. customer calls and is upset but we can't do anything to help them out
good,"The building will be closing its doors  july 31st 2019. It was a comfortable place to work with your own desk, a well stocked break room, and plenty of good people that worked well."
good,"- Kept engaged, always presented with new challenges in IT, so there was constant learning- whether that was a customer account issue or an IT tool malfunction"
good,"I love working at frontier.  ( 80% of the time) the compensation makes up with navigating a sea of disgruntled customers. However through certain changes they’ve made they’ve really cleaned up on their billing systems. Which improves the call types that you receive. I think most people are accustomed to a more customer service based call center. My center, in DeLand FL. Is a SALES center. You’re on the phone to both help the customer. But more importantly to SELL the customer on something that will increase the company’s revenue. I don’t believe this is explained well enough during  the training process so a lot of some newbies are taken aback  when they hit the floor. I’ve gathered so much sales experience and phone etiquette, technology knowledge, and have been able to travel and train for this company because I accept the fact that this is a sales position. If you’re not comfortable in pitching products this isn’t a good fit for you. Unless you’re willing to learn! They have fantastic tenured sales agents to assist with developing your skills.  There are sales goals that you must hit.  It takes about a good 8-9 months to fully understand to use all of our internal systems and to get comfortable enough if the product knowledge to become an effective sales person but if you truly try hard you do see results in this job. Which is why I like it.   The Deland center is constantly changing protocols and best practices so it’s better to know going in to always keep on your toes and either accept the change and roll with it. Frontier has provided me with more opportunities than any"
good,"Steady, productive, time-conscious environment. I have greatly increased my design and provisioning skillsets since coming to work for this company.  Management has an open door policy and the workplace culture encourages teamwork and collaboration. There really is no 'hardest part' of the job if you don't mind constant changes and always absorbing extra work. The most enjoyable part of the job is always learning something new."
good,Loved my job. Management made the decision to delete the marketing department all together.  Other jobs available but I did not want to work in a call center.
good,This was my first corporate recruiting job and I really enjoyed my time with them. I was part of a collaborative team and had a very supportive manager who challenged me. I enjoyed recruiting for the multiple offices I supported in the Northeast.
good,Great place to work. Excellent people. I miss my former co-workers the most. Pay and benefits are comparable with everywhere else. I enjoyed my time with Frontier.
good,"I loved working for frontier, they always paid. It’s a great place to work if you know what you are doing. I’ve always heard bad things regarding frontier but I never had an issue with them."
good,Commission program does not favor Sales person. To many chargebacks for a long period of time and techs are negative about installs many customers cancel because of tech s telling slow service
good,Most days we were kept busy.   Learned how to provision various types of Telecommunications equipment.    Supervisors was great to work with.   Fellow employees were great to work with.   The hardest part of the job was working with other Independent Carrier Customers that outsourced to foreign companies.   Most enjoyable part of the job was providing our customer with quality circuit(s).
good,"I was only a contract employee for 4 month period, but wished I could have stayed there. The assignment I had was very beneficial to furthering my career."
good,Great company to work for as far as benefits and pay but not as far as job security. The department I was in before downsizing had flexibility to balance work and home life. Not all departments are like that though.
good,Frontier is a union company so it's difficult to work for if you aren't used to that environment. Wish compensation was better but overall not too bad.
good,"Answer calls from outside and central office techs requesting to update facility or equipment to what was being used to provide a customer telephone, internet and television services. Assigned facilities and equipment for new customers or made changes to existing customer’s facilities and equipment based on what the service order requested. Built, modified, or removed customer’s telephone service by programming in a telephone company software. Worked with internet software to turn on customer’s internet service or modify the speed to ensure they were able to connect to their internet provider. Handled customer escalations that were given to me by my supervisor to handle until the customer’s problem was resolved. Oversaw a special project that saved Frontier money and outside labor hours and then was asked by my supervisor to create a step by step guide for this special project so new employees could perform this tasks more efficiently. Team leader in assisting with the transition from Verizon to Frontier and helping my coworkers better understand and learn the new job duties."
good,"Job was  good,  but   every  3  -5  years ,  the  fear  of  company  leaving   &   outsourcing jobs,  since  we  were  union.  I would  have  continued  working  but  ,  with  impending contract  coming  up,  could  not  take  risk  of  losing my  pension"
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

good,"You made a lot of money, you worked with great people and theyd work with you schedule wise, it was less than 5 miles away from where i lived and i would go home for lunch,the manager was a personal friend and he is one of the few managers who ever made me more motivated by treating me like an equal, competent staff made up for the computer errors you'd get and they had a pool table, a foosball table, a gym, a library, dish tvs a cafe, a fully stocked vending store with cheap but high end vending food inside, I would have easily worked there the rest of my life but they closed the site down after almost a year. sad to see it go."
good,"Nice place to work, they also help with your personal growth. like going back to school for a bachelors or masters degree and also help with getting industry/vendor certifications."
good,"Frontier is one of the highest paying call centers in Rochester. Things may not always be easy, but employees are compensated for their struggles! Management is caring and they give you many chances to excel if you put the work in."
good,Frontier has been a great company. During my time working for the company I assist with many special project. Many projects trained me to become a leader and instilled values.
good,Back to back incoming calls from existing and potential customers. I've learned good selling techniques. The hardest part of the job is turning a negative call into a sales opportunity.
good,"A typical day at work for front was come in log into the phones and instantly take calls. Throughout the day i would take a veriety of different  calls from billing to sales to collections. Every call you were required to sell/offer frontier products such as tv internet phone and security as well as some personal property insurance."
good,"The best thing about working at Frontier is the group of people you are working with. For the most part, everybody is caring, warm and inviting. Everyone treats you with respect and it really is like 1 big family. The compensation is great also. As a sales associate you are paid hourly plus commission with semi-annual raises so you can make anywhere from 50-90k per year."
good,"Workplace culture a lot different then when Verizon and GTE ran the business. Less customer first and more company first. Hardest part of the job would be managing employee to management ratio, has been at time 40-1."
good,"In bound call center. It was very micro managed, There manages and supervisors were awful. They really did not give the time and support you needed.Calls could be hours long it was crazy. Stuff gets added on to your work load and no extra money ,Shift be every 90 days because they have a high turn over.The benefits were good ..They have a big turn over ."
good,"good benefits and pay, MUST BE flexible with work hours because they will hire you for certain hours and then switch your hours abruptly. Be prepared to work with difficult customers."
good,"Frontier is a good company to work for.  Their benefits are competitive, and managers from other offices are friendly to work with.  The company is currently not in the best shape financially and has been laying off in rounds, but will hopefully be able to pull it back together again."
good,Good place to work. Lots of motivational spiffs. Bonuses and Commissions. Lots of good people from diverse back grounds. If you are a dedicated to work type person than this is a great place to work.
good,"Typical day at work is all about no micro-managing from above. You are treated as a professional. Workplace culture is standard - not great but not bad. Hardest part of the job is getting timely responses sometimes from the project stakeholders in the business units (Sales/Marketing/Billing, etc.). They are kept so busy that they often find it hard to attend project meetings. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with the direct project team members."
good,"I feel it was wrong of Frontier to lay me off after 42 years of service without leaving anyother options. I feel I have a lot to offer the company,in knowledge experience and communicating with other officials,including State ,County and City inspectiors"
good,"handled 30+ calls per day, inbound call center, loved going to work everyday, handled retention and sales at same time. dealt with billing, repair, collections, customer service, trained new emplyees. awarded for excellant attendance, top 10 in center for sales and retention"
good,"The job can be fun, if you do not let the customers get to you. Some are nice and some are not. The benefits and pay certain outweigh that though. Constant changes do make it hard to feel comfortable and secure."
good,Frontier was a good company to work for where you had the autonomy to be creative in meeting production goals. As an internet service provider you are constantly having to adapt to a forever changing market along with stiff competition.
good,"Supervisory duties."
good,"I enjoy working at frontier it is a good environment to be around."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit. The pipe dream they guaranteed to Frontier and the employees they did not honor. They changed all the policies after the grace receiving period. Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"On a day to day basis there was always some sort of friendly competition that would go on throughout the different departments, this would keep the morale up within the employees. Management was always smiling and friendly to everyone. The most enjoyable part for me was that I was asked to work with many different departments, so this would keep my days busy and interesting."
good,The team I worked with was amazing.  They are all hard working and caring people.  Management seemed fair.  The best part of the job was the pay that I received.
good,"Most Managers appreciated the good work and always treated employees  with respect. "
good,"Frontier took me on with the transaction of Verizon and Frontier whereby they purchased operations in the states of Texas, Florida and California.  Frontier doubled it's size in that transaction."
good,very friendly staff and they have a pool and ping pong table. they also have fusball and the breakroom is amazing. they have all kinds of snacks you can purchase
good,"The workplace either in the office or working at home is nice there are always open methods to communicate with other departments and employees. Though finding answers can be a bit of a struggle at times with the systems and methods provided. Overall it can be a nice place to work for good pay, benefits, and accommodating and understanding schedules and staff. But there is a lot with each call to manage and get done when held to requirements that don't give you much time to complete it all. Though it is definitely not boring work."
good,Job priorities changed at a drop of a hat. worked with many government and private agency as well as working with the private sector.
good,"I enjoy working for Frontier Communications.  There are many changes to come.  Interested to see how things go with conversion.  Overall a decent company to work for.  However, they pay less than their competitors."
good,Very positive work environment.  Effective resource utilization
good,Always evolving to help accommodate needs & products for the customer.
good,Long hours with schedules based on seniority. I learned how to work in a fast-paced call center environment.
good,"Having been part of that company since the merger from Verizon, I must say that the way of thinking is quite different. I would recommend this company to anyone looking to start a new career but be careful not to get trapped in one position for too long."
good,"Besides a PM, Frontier was a great place to work. The manager worked for was knowledgeable and fair."
good,"With the hourly rates and bonuses this is a good place to start for people who are looking for early jobs.  Taking phone calls all day can be highly stressful, but for the young worker this can be a very lucrative position.  This is not a place you want to take if you want to move up fast, Just apply for the management jobs."
good,Lots of technologies to learn. Very little formal training. Older portion of workforce struggles to keep up with new technologies and changes. Lots of time off and decent benefits.
good,good company with strong need for customer retention promotions and much better service record.  Too many variables and confusion with various offers and many sub sellers and contractors in the mix. Local leadership is not as strong as it should be. Strong ethics and concern for community.
good,"The hardest part of the job is not being able to satisfy every customer's need and/or request. A typical day is spenet assisting customers with billing concerns/questions, and offering products and solutions to make their lives better by adding value for the things thy enjoy most."
good,"Good place to work , but if you have family be preprared."
good,"Enjoyed the work environment at Frontier, helping/working with employees was the best part of the job. Frontier was a very teamwork oriented workplace; challenging work, always learning new things. Co-workers became long time friends. The hardest part of the job was leaving everyone behind. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the employees and assisting them in whatever they needed."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"Company is a communications company focused on Land line phone service and DSL internet service while re-selling DISH as a video offering. In the smaller regional areas there is little or no movement of management personnel which in turn stagnates opportunities for advancement into front line or middle management. However upper management has movement and a high potential for advancement. Compensation and benefits are good overall in all areas of employment and there is a degree of job security, however the land line portion of the business is in decline due to other technologies."
good,"Frontier (at&t) was once a great place to work. With a solid core structure.  Unfortunately,  at&t and local 1298, coordinated to basically destroy a well operating communications company, forcing customers to seek alternative providers., while throwing their employees under the at&t bus."
good,Great place to work good pay and benefits if not for layoffs would still be working for Frontier has a good work life balance. Also received lots of training.
good,Bleak future too much debt to overcome. We started out as a great company. Acquisition truly hurt us. Too many customers are churning. We are behind the curve with product and technology and sadly too late in the game to climb out of the financial home.
good,"In hindsight, I can honestly say Frontier excels at training their new employees. A very thorough, all inclusive program that was at least three months or longer. In this field, with no experience, this extensive training is highly necessary. Representatives are all on the same page and feel confident in their roles once they hit the sales floor. This is a highly competitive market and the reps not only need to know HOW to sell, but WHAT they are selling."
good,Frontier is a good place to work for. Not much to complain as far as pay and benefits and hours available to work. The difficult thing about the profession... not just at frontier is it requires long hours of work through the winter and many of the trouble tickets can be tedious and mentally exhausting. It leaves little room to pursue education or career opportunities. When you and your day you are generally drained
good,"Fast paced sales and customer service. Supportive Leads, good atmosphere, everyone is willing to help when your new. The classes are a lot of talking and not enough hands on experience needed to learn the many software programs. The commission program is good if you are in the sales queue otherwise you get many billing and complaint calls. You can still get sales from those type of calls though.You have to love working with people and finding resolutions for customers problems. Sales is the biggest thing to push for of course."
good,"I had never worked before this in tech support and had to learn it all from scratch. But, my suppervisors worked patiently to teach me everything I needed to do my job affectively"
good,"If the company would put more money into upgrading the plant, this would  great place to work. The benefits and pay are awesome.At frontier you learn a lot of skills and you will need them."
good,I loved working for frontier. It truly takes a special kind of person to separate work from home and be able to deal with sometimes unruly customers. I would definitely recommend this job as well as work here again.
good,"Everyone working at Frontier is a hard worker, what I personally found difficult about the job was the calls. Calls were okay but some techs were more jerks then others. Other than that working for Frontier was not that bad at all. For training they give you extra help if needed and will do one on one if that is your preferred method of learning."
good,"I started in 1996 with GTE. It became Verizon then Frontier.  I started as a 21 year to leave kid, if you’re willing to work they’ll take care of you."
good,"Great place to work until they eliminate your position without giving you much notice. "
good,"Best part of the job being the management and the company address you by name, and they practice customer and employee appreciation. Hardest part of the job is dealing with tools (and some personalities) that do not always operate or answer questions for customers."
good,"On a typical day at work you handle between 50-60 phone calls. A different day brought a different experience. Management monitored calls, people were tight. The hardest part of the job would be the company setting unrealistic goals at times or not feeling like you have job security. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people i was fortunate to meet and work with."
good,"My job was protected by the union.  Citizen's communication did no care for unions.  They moved my job to Deland FL and gave us severance depending on how long you had been with the company"
good,Good work environment with a lot of available resources for increasing knowledge. Plenty of highly skilled employees. Clear direction is lacking and there are a lot conflicts between teams.
good,"Overall it is a great place to work. If you want to move up be ready to invest several years of your life to make it no further and a team coach or sup. "
good,"Great company to work for with lots of benefits."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"Working at frontier was a great experience, a typical day would be 9-6 I learned how to take calls and work on their account at the same time. The people all around the company was great over all. Management was also good. During the holidays the team coaches would set up competitions on who decorated the best. They would also bring food on Fridays. The hardest part about the job is knowing how to respectfully calm down an angry costumer and still be able to work with their budget, while still trying to sell."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at Frontier, It was a great  first job, I worked with great people. Managers were good and people were caring. There were a lot of growth opportunities within the company too."
good,I have found my 20 years with the phone company very satisfying.  The seven years under Frontier have been challenging due to the Corporations struggles with maintaining strong stock rating.
good,"Working for Frontier Communications, led me to be the best customer service agent that I could be.  My job consisted of verbal communication with high intelligence to be able to resolve issue that may occr."
good,"Work could be challenging due to customers, although I learned to express more patience.  Management was fair and the environment was therefore pleasant."
good,"very competitive market.Treats its employees fairly.A good place to work.T he telecommunication industry is going through major changes on a regular basis which makes for a very competitive "
good,"Forced overtime, high stress environment.  Best pay and benefits anywhere.  Needs of the business prioritized over your health and family life.  Low level management poorly trained and ineffective."
good,Learned a lot with Frontier not just as a sub-contractor but overall intelligence and history. You have to know what your doing with this company so we don't have a bad rep. You have to know your job or position so also Frontier won't have a bad rep. Try always giving the best customer service on and off the field.
good,"Frontier Communications, as the name implies, is a company always at the forefront for advancement.  Conversations, ideals, and engagement embrace new ways of thinking and willingness to make the next step into directions which places this company at the forefront in advancing to the next level which can introduce a new way of efficiently and intellectually doing business."
good,"I worked for the Frontier Communications Corporate Safety and Security Department.  I managed all photo ID badges for the entire company.  I would create new ID's and renew expired ID's for all Frontier employees.  I also handled Inbound calls from customers who were receiving harassing, life threatening calls and would guide them on how they can trace the phone calls and get the police involved."
good,"Management was a great motivator to my growth within the company over the years. I enjoyed very much working there, great co-workers and nice working enviroment"
good,Good place to work. I received numerous promotions and was able to work close to home. I was there from 1989 until 2016 when my department relocated. Would recommend Frontier/Verizon as a good place to stay for a job.
good,Typical day of work is very challenging. I work directly with engineers and general managers which keeps me busy and helps time to fly by. I am surrounded by good people. As long as you have a good work ethic (which I do) managers tend to enjoy you as an employee and makes for a good place to work. Hardest part can be to juggle the calls at times. If you are good at your job more people tend to lean on your shoulders. Ultimately it is a good place to work and that makes it enjoyable to come into every day.
good,"Frontier has given me the opportunity to be a part of some very large projects that have major impact on the companies future and bottom line.  Frontier has very competitive benefits and compensation is in the top tier for my area.  Frontier has a strong focus on supporting veterans and military staff.  The most difficult part of the job that I have found here is that there are acronyms for everything.  I believe this is a growth objective for me and just comes with time.  What I enjoy most about the job is the opportunity to work on large enterprise systems, working on troubleshooting problems and resolving issues."
good,I have worked in the telecommunications industry for over 20 years. My knowledge and wealth could prove an asset in any organization. I have been incredibly self-driven and work from home. My days often start very early and end late. I am a subject matter expert in Sales Operations and always enjoy finding new ways for our Account Executives to work more efficiently and allow for more time in the field selling.
good,"Great place to work, great paying job. They are very easy to work with your schedule or if something comes up and need to take a day off. They are willing to work with you to get your day off and as well as make sure you are getting paid as well. Co-workers are very friendly and easy to talk to. Group oriented work place."
good,"This company is a wonderful company to work for. I started in the residential call center and quickly worked my way up. Great benifits, and decent pay. However a word of caution, I would not advise taking a job with them just at this time. I'm honestly confused why they are hiring more people, while they are in the middle of massive layoffs of well over 2,000-2,500 employees...which is no secret. A simple google search will find multiple reports of their layoffs."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,this is a great company to work for. The benefits are incredible and the work force is great. Sales is a HUGE part of the job and we are constantly pushed to hit the sales quota for the month. If you don't hit it you don't get any additional compensation for the month.
good,"I absolutely loved my job. I would receive jobs daily from in-house customers and external Frontier customers, Jobs could be just a simple document or it could be a huge job of 400-800 pages which also had to to be colored and 3-holed and put into binders, I loved the idea that I could get 10 different jobs all at once and I was always able to multi-task to get them done ahead of schedule. The hardest part of my job was when they decided to close the copy center. the most enjoyable part of the job was the interacting with all my customers. They appreciated all my hard work."
good,"Frontier Communications Corporation is a telephone company in the United States, mainly serving rural areas and smaller communities. It was known as Citizens Utilities Company until May 2000 and Citizens Communications Company until July 31, 2008."
good,I learned this job pays more than what I thought and it isn't as hard as it seems.
good,Frontier is the largest rual phone company in the US. They are on the fast track to being the best CPE re-saler in the nation. The peolple who work here are wonderful. This is what makes it a good place to work.
good,"Inbound call center, utilized multiple computer software, customer service, sales driven environment. Learned to not take anything personal from customers. Management was always available. Work well with others. Hardest part of the job was dissatisfaction from customers. Enjoyable part of job, different experience with each customer/phone call."
good,"Wide variety of calls all day. I get to know different personalities, their wants and needs. Management are sales driven and co workers like to sale and make extra money. Hardest part of job is handling the stress levels. Have to stay positive no matter what the situation is. I love to make the customers happy."
good,"You can make a lot of mo with this company and do it knowing you will be taken care of, as long as you know your putting in an honest hard days work every day you’ll have no worries of having a job tomorrow and will be compensated fairly also. Good company, with good people. J"
good,Place is awesome. Frontier was an excellent place to grow and learn the field of telcom.  From coworkers to management this company is a class act.  Best employer I ever worked for.
good,Was a great company to work for abd was abke to be advanced at a 6month interval and continued availiablity to make adjustments to my skill set and my abilities
good,"Worked alongside people doing the same types of jobs as me."
good,A great work environment. Friendly and helpful workers. A more family oriented place. I would recommend Frontier to people. A super place to work very awesome.
good,"I have no complaints about the company but the management could always improve, we are all there for the same reason to work and receive a paycheck,  treat your employees as you would want to be treated and much more would be accomplish."
good,frontier was good to work for . I don't Know what to say it is a big company it worked like a big company it change with the times as fast as it could they payed me on pay day .it was good
good,"Was a good company to work for, super easy going culture and a lot of employee recognition. Some management staff could have had better knowledge of day to day while others didn’t fit with the culture that was established at all."
good,The workplace culture is nice. The job does take quite a bit of training and experience before you get proficient at the work. The management is pretty good as they make sure you are on top of things and are exceeding in your work. They want you to succeed.
good,"Enterprise/Circuits is where I worked, I had a great boss and fun coworkers. The company is union so there are so pros and cons to it but nothing outrageous.  Don't work in sales,  you won't last long unless you know how to sell ice to an Eskimo."
good,"Enjoyed my time there, made good money and was trained very well.  Closed a lot of deals for equipment and network solutions. Was laid off in Feb due to company down turn"
good,"Tos- Tech support "
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,frontier purchased our territory from Verizon in 2010 .. eventually moved us employees to work from home positions in 2011 which I favored very much. Monthly meetings required on location @  Lafayette IN in an older bldg. owned by company.
good,. Some management is more so out of sight out of mind and don't really communicate or form team building bonds with staff. Others are very attentive and will go the extra mile for their team. The company does offer advancement within the company which is always good. Overall it is a good company to work for.
good,"It was interesting talking to people throughout the USA, but also stressful because we were timed on all calls, and we had to follow  a dialogue. At times I felt like a robot. My co-workers were a diverse group of people and very enjoyable to work with. The office manager was very easy to work with, and fair in her judgement. I would have continued working for them, if they had not threatened job lay-off."
good,I've been with Frontier for almost 21 years.  It's become a part of my every day life that I will dearly miss.  It's a fast paced but enjoyable environment that makes one feel like family.
good,"A typical day at work consists of handling a high volume of incoming residential customer calls."
good,"My typical day starts as I get up early and try to get to work at least 25 minutes before the ‘start time’. In this way, I can avoid any delays due to traffic jams and can still be on time for work. Then, I sit down and plan the day. I jot down what all plans I have to complete and prioritize them depending on their urgency and importance. I check my voice mails and emails and the calendar and try to make plans such as organizing meetings and such. This way I can increase my pace for doing work and can be more productive for the day. "
good,"Daily office duties;"
good,"A typical work day, would be to log in and check your voicemails, call back anyone who left a message to assure their issue was resolved or if they were satisfied with the solution. Management was already available to answer questions and help in any way possible. I enjoyed my co workers and working with the customers and the necessary departments to figure out and solve the issue ."
good,"It was a rather nice job. I had a lot of fun working there, flexible hours, decent pay, etc. I recommend it for anyone seeking a rather flexible work position."
good,"I worked with Commonwealth Telephone then Frontier Communications for a total of 43 years and enjoyed my work.  It was originally Commonwealth Telephone and had a good reputation, but with Frontier near the end of my career, there were many customer complaints.  We always provided great service, but sometimes the hardest part was dealing with customers when we were not given the opportunity to do this."
good,The work is challenging and can be stressful.  I learned  that with a sincere work ethic it is possible to learn and apply technical knowledge and have a fulfilling position.
good,"Frontier Communications is a great place to work but there are no raises after you reach $12 per hour. I need more to survive, Good referral program too."
good,the atmosphere is great but management is not always concerned with how the employees are doing. The most enjoyable part of the job is the ability to work at home
good,"I would receive instruction via work cell phone. Tried to best of ability to complete all jobs assigned for the day. Sometimes this was possible, and other times needed more time, based on unique situation. Made for variety. Lots of problem solving on the fly. Management was helpful when able to do so. This made for building self sufficient work place. Work directly with customer to solve issues.   Day could be somewhat routine at times, other times adjustments need to be made. Also had help of collaborative work force. Most difficult part of job was trying to please a customer that was not able to be pleased. Which sometimes was possible, but not always. Enjoyed trouble shooting, working with new technological test equipment, and employee collaboration."
good,"Worked with honest hard working people, that put the customer first. although the company themselves are not as popular with some people they have employees that care about the customers and will go to extreme lengths to satisfy their needs"
good,As a maintenance administrator Iwould go in at 930 sit down and log in for the day. Then i would typically check emails for anything needing immediate attention and handle. Then I would move on to see what are of WV I was scheduled to cover that day. Sometimes I would be scheduled to clear trouble tickets and service orders that had gotten stuck in system error as well. If I was covering a specific area that day then I would check to see of there were and high priority circuits or escalations to be covered. After that I would keep and eye on my areas as well as take incoming chats from representatives in customer service to check on status of service orders and trouble tickets.
good,fixed land line phones. from the office to the house or business. fixed in the air or underground. Had my own van and tools. worked by yourself. ordered your own supplies to do your job.
good,"face paced but fun place to work!  ping pong tables in the break room"
good,good place to work. good benefits. union shop. repairing anything from a small compact car to line repair trucks with buckets and pole placers. two shifts so repairs are done quickly.
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"Working at Frontier was really beneficial for me. I learned how interest works and I helped others understand it too. I loved that they didn't time our calls. I hear that since I left it has changed, but while I was there, I loved it. I was sad to leave."
good,"Challenging, lots of projects to keep things interesting. Environment is changing because of financial challenges, not as free to solve issues effectively."
good,Frontier offers 401k Dental 4 weeks paid time off plus holiday pay the only down fall is the lack of advancement or the opportunity to use your skills but over all not a bad company if you do not want to advance your career
good,"It really was not a bad job, however it was stressful. When I started on the floor I had only been out for a week before Frontier took over the Verizon FiOS tv and internet services in California, Texas, and Florida. This conversion did not go over well and ultimately cause a lot of call centers to be closed down, including the center i worked at. The pay and benefits were very good, including the commision, but for someone who was new at this type of job it was very overwhelming to be trying to prevent people from disconnecting their services when their services were not working for weeks on end and Frontier was not willing to give credits for these not working, Tech's were going on strike or just not showing up for service appointments because no matter what the did, the services were just not working"
good,I love this job with the people i work with and work for. Its is a call center setting and yyou do have to talk on the for and sale and try to upgrade people but ig thats something u in to a great job.
good,come in log into your phone and start working the que of connecting and disconnecting cable and phone services as well as putting features on accounts and take calls from tech and make sure that you help them to the best of your ability.
good,"A typical day at work is very fast pace.  The most enjoyable part of the job is troubleshooting.  The staff is very helpful and knowledgeable, with open door culture."
good,work is fulfilling but am looking to get into a workplace with more room to grow and learn as well as to be able to tackle and take on more responsibilities am hard working and my work reflects that.
good,It was face-paced and I learned plenty of technical solutions. The toughest part was being micro managed. However I enjoyed working remotely. The workplace was pleasant.
good,Frontier is a good company to work for. I have been working here since 2010 and it's been really good working with people that I like. I'm always learning something new in desktop and telephony. We have course as well that we can take to learn on curtain applications we specialized in. My management is great I can always go to them with anything at all and I'm not afraid to speak my mind.  They are understanding and work with us.
good,"I love frontier in the beginning but as time went on a lot of changes happened there was a lot of questions but nothing was answered."
good,"Enjoy the job. Is  good place to work .  Work is satisfying and challenging.   Enjoy a balance of work and family life.   Little slow on providing training,  but  people are willing to help."
good,"nice place to work, but would like more interaction with management. Work time are flex able, and management is understanding on this. They let you do your own thing but with some direction."
good,People work hard and work with each other.  Strategic direction from management has not been stated clearly and lack consistency over time.  Flexible work environment with work from home accepted is a plus.
good,I liked that I could ask people from other departments any questions.  They were always willing to help.  You work as a team which in turn helped my customer's.
good,Decent paying call center with commission wages each month and paid time off with affordable health care. In emergencies you are given a point system in which you can call out with.
good,"It's nice place to work. "
good,This was a good company to work for not only the pay rate but also the insurance was great. I enjoyed working there people were friendly and always helpful
good,"i picked up lots of overtime. they were great at working around school schedules, managers were knowledgeable and upbeat, performance incentives were near immediate. they were a little stingy on break times, but its doable, they also had a generous bonus structure."
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit. The pipe dream they guaranteed to Frontier and the employees they did not honor. They changed all the policies after the grace receiving period. Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"I enjoyed the challenges and the overall management of the company, . Compensation was average and enjoyed most all the employees I was working with. It is cool."
good,Working at frontier was a very awesome experence i learned alot from this job and would highly highly recommend this job to anyone who was looking to work there.
good,"Great Place to work, Company was a great benefits. While working there I was able to learn the basic concepts of Tech support, such as converting company files. Trouble shooting Servers, and diagnosing Quickbooks accounting software problems"
good,Frontier Communications employees about Frontier ... Awesome place to work great management stable income dependable reliable. ... Frontier has a strong focus on supporting veterans and military staff. ... Hardest part about the job is trying to figure who and where we need to contact for certain jobs to
good,Well I honestly cannot be completely negative in regards to this company. when I first began working there I loved it. They paid above average and have awesome benefits.The higher management teams are very friendly and approachable. The only thing I would say is that their is not room for growth. Once you are in position that is your position. They offer wonderful benefits but when it comes to job security that becomes a little shaky. If you decide to work here just know this should be a stepping stone door. It gets your feet wet in the corporate world but is not meant to be your final destination. Especially if you are young.
good,"Fun and friendly co-workers"
good,"Great benefits fun atmosphere. Working with everyday technology and providing great service to customers in 30 states. Building relationships with customers who trust you to help with their internet, phone & tv needs."
good,I didn't like that they would tell us that we are doing one thing and get promoted to a different position and then they would keep us doing exactly what we were doing when we were in the lower position.
good,I love this job if i was not relocating to another state i would stay. The work is not hard management is good for the most part. Every job is different and this one is not a bad one to be at.
good,I sold telephone systems to businesses and enterprise. The company held back on cutting edge technology and ended up bankrupt in the bubble. It was a great place to work though.
good,"Frontier communications is a great place to start if you need a full time job. They cover health, dental, and vision benefits. The management can some times be a little hard to find when you need them but do a great job at providing positive feedback. The work place environment is that of a standard call center. Not really much to say there. The hardest part of the job is the lack of training. What training they do provide doesn't cover much of what you will actually face during the job. Not only that the constant change. Although some change here in there is good but the policies change an almost weekly basis. It makes it very challenging to adapt to those changes. But the best part of the job is the people you meet both in the office as well as on the phone. As well as having a team that always has your back when you need them."
good,Frontier Communications is a good place to work. The insurance is through Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield. Benefits are great and the employees are great to  work with.
good,"My day can involves configuring a Cisco switch models being  3600 9010 7206, Also trouble shooting a circuit for the prem to the core router which can be a juniper or and ALU 7750, working on ALU equipment layer 2 BTI switches Ciena switches TA5000. Consulting with other teams through out the company to design trouble shoot and resolve network issue. Working in a maintenance widow to move and manage network traffiic."
good,I found it hard to work with a clear conscious. We were in a transitional period and providing service not equal to the money we charged. A lot of contractors gave us a bad rep as well ..
good,"work hard get paid , work harder get paid more, fair employers, good commissions , friendly co workers , you can transfer a lot of places, Frontier is located in most states"
good,"I worked for Verizon. Frontier purchased  Verizon "
good,It is definitely a learning experience for me though challenging at times to manage works among multiple projects. There are several technologies that one needs to hand on experience on to be successful in Frontier.

good,"Frontier is a rapidly growing ILEC.  Recent landline acquisitions have doubled the size of the company, making Frontier a strong player in the residential broadband and video segments."
good,"Its a good place to work but the employees are not the friendliest."
good,"I was thrilled to work for Frontier communications. Great employee benefits, paid vacation and time off. Due to company restructuring however they were forced to lay off my entire call center. Very hard news to take but non the less... It was a great Job, while it lasted."
good,While working in the CapitalOne division it was tons of fun and I did enjoyed the continuous learning. My supervisor was in tune with everything I did and provided constant training.
good,"Very smart, hard working teams of people working to better the company.  Good benefits and day off policy.  Management is encouraging and there is plenty opportunity to learn.  Never a boring day!"
good,"early work schedule or late schedule, all depend on your sift, for NOC they have three shifts schedule, 7 to 4, 4 to 11, or 11 to 7. nice place to work at allen texas"
good,"Great benefits, upper management is great.  Training is great. 3 full months of training sets you up for success with this company."
good,Frontier is a great place to work with many benefits and advancements but the job wasn't necessarily for me. I was responsible for selling/ helping customers with their accounts
good,"Frontier is a great company to work for."

good,"A considerable amount of multi-tasking. Enjoyed the many recognition received for high sales and customer satisfaction."
good,"After several companies buying and selling, we were finally purchased by Frontier Communications, who turned out to be a God sent for the employees. Before retiring, I can honestly say, they treat their employees well and the employees do the same. I would give them a 4 out 5 over-all."
good,"A typical day at work consist of, answering phone calls, handle billing questions, placing order and trouble shooting."
good,Inbound/Out Bound calls for 8 hours a day 5 days a week. Great place to work for but i need more money and advancement.

good,Over all a decent place to work. Employees are friendly and willing to share knowledge.
good,"Day to day is always different, and territories get moved around, the hours aren't set and most of the time there is overtime offered. The pay was really good, and the benefits were great, but you kind of lose your out of work life because it seems like you're there 24/7"
good,"This was a very fast paced job. My ability to be a team leader  and my organizational skills came in very handy.  "
good,Frontier Communications is a great company to work for. Very fast paced work. Management is very helpful.

good,Good Place. Good Staff. I would advise more people to get come and work for this company.
good,"Overall Job Is Great, Opportunity To Meet Great People, Make Good Money and Excellant Health Insurance"
good,Day at work was full of different things to do the boss was very attentive and made sure we had everything to work with. Coworkers were the same as long as we achieved a common goal they did whatever to help out. Hardest part was identifying the problem and the most enjoyable was executing the plan.
good,great place to work the supervisors are great. fast paced. shifts seem to change often. best part of the job is commissions you can make 1000 plus extra a month in commissions.
good,"Usually said ""hello"" or ""good morning"" to 30 people a day. Very friendly environment made being productive easy."
good,"just not if you have family with kids,(at least for the first year)."
good,All around a great place to work. Management is available and listens to employees. Loved getting out and meeting my customers! Best part of the job!!!
good,"Productive, friendly place to work. Typical day would be answering escalated customer calls. assisted consultant with work related questions, complete daily or monthly reports."
good,It's a very laid back job.. Great job if you like to sell and talk on the phone. inbound call center so that's definetely a plus.
good,"The Company is fair based and in many states for relocation. There has been layoffs the last 2 years in my opinion, due to purchasing other territory. There is plenty of work and possible opportunities for advancement dependent on your skillset."
good,Good people. Worked there a long time. Many great memories. Would recommend working there to anyone. They are located in so many States. Learned quite a bit.

good,I lived working there it was an amazing experience I would definitely want to return to a company that gave you growth support and guidance . I would recommend this company to any one looking for growth
good,Not to bad Of aplace to work for great pay and leadership .A lot has changed for the good and the bad but overall  a great place to work for customers can be a headache though.But with every job there’s a pro or con
good,"Frontier is a great place to work. I enjoyed the Sales department and I enjoyed  all the events Frontier was a part of."
good,Frontier feels more like family than it does a job. I learned how to become a salesman. The daily calls were anywhere from billing to technical service and I loved every single one.
good,"Most enjoyable part about this job is assisting customers & working with a great hourly and management staff."
good,"The place is fine. I left because I hate talking to people for a living. It was far too taxing for me. They also put a lot of emphasis on promoters, which I found incredibly difficult to deal with. It's a failure skewed curve with 3 negative responses that affect how much you make 1 neutral (which is still negative) and only one positive. So if you are average or don't like talking on the phone, I wouldn't work there. Otherwise it's great."
good,there was a good environment working there and the team leads made sure you had the information you needed to improve ever day in your job. it also wasn't about just talking to customers but also learning to have fun in the work place.
good,Working for Frontier was great. The company seemed to really care about employees and wanted to retain us. It's the only job I've had where all employees received a significant raise without receiving additional work or responsibility.
good,"Company was GTE when I originally started in 1993, then became Verizon and is currently Frontier Communicstions. Enjoyed working for the company overall."
good,"The managers and supervisors were very supportive. For example if one of the production applications run into problems for some reason  the managers would contact the back-end team in order to find a fix for the problem as soon as possible."
good,"While it took extremely long for anything official to get put through (pay raises, paperwork, etc) the environment overall was very good and everyone was friends."
good,"I love going to work the atmoshpere is great, we work and have lots of fun doing it. My manager is the best I ever had he cares about his employeers. My work friends are my family and the job treat you like a human not a robot or number"
good,"The pay at Frontier Communications is great and above average in the area and the benefits package is fantastic. 401k, medical, dental, vision, and paid sick days and vacation time. The benefits and pay are definitely a positive."
good,"Fast paced environment,answering customer internet/tv/phone issues. Completing a customers issue is a satisfying part of my job. I work for a positive coach with a great team spirit. We have incentives throughout our company to keep employee moral high: such as shorts pass for the summer. A new benefit for employees is a relaxation room which is to help relieve stress or just rejuvenate. The hardest part of my job is when a first time resolution can not be made and I have to dispatch a Tech. to the field. It is very satisfying to help the customer and eliminate their issue by the calls end."
good,Frontier is a great company to work for however I the hours are not the best. The benefits are great and there is plenty of room for advancement. I have learned that working 12-9 are not the best hours for me and that I don't like having to meet a sales quota every month.
good,I enjoyed working with the Managers at Frontier --they are serious about their work while remaining friendly and open to colleagues across teams and groups
good,My typical day at work would include answering phone speaking with co-workers about the circuits they were installing.  Handling all escalations that was  received in a timely manner.  Provisioning new circuit orders through out the Frontier network.
good,"High volume, organized work environment.  I worked on a regional level overseeing 10 states throughout the West and Southeast.  Responsible for the performance, repair and compliance of the Frontier Vehicles within the geographic area.  I initiated and managed the acquisition of new vehicles and the disposal of retiring units.  I was required to travel to each area on a regular basis to insure state and company compliance was obtained throughout the fleet.  Operated under budget for repair expenses and compliance regulations.  Managed the state and federal inspections for vehicle safety with consistent satisfactory ratings.  Managed and approved Preventative Maintenance and repair cost through internal accounting systems.  Maintained vendor and internal customers relations with a focus on reducing overall fleet costs."
good,normal work days 8-5. learned to use company software and work with others better. management was great and supportive with co-workers. Really great atmosphere and friendly co-workers.
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"Frontier Communications is a very nice place to work at, the pay is great and is sufficient for a good living no matter the location.  The benefits and extra perks and commission are awesome as well.  The management tries there best to provide help when needed but is often times hard for them to do, with everything that is put on their plate.  The only thing that was a downfall for me, is that the systems were not functioning at a capacity that would warrant the amount of pressure put on the employees to manage low handle time on all calls.  Also, the mandatory overtime makes it such that an employee can never really plan around their schedule during the work week.  The ever changing work schedule was a horror as well, so an employee could never expect to have a consistent work schedule.  The hardest part of the job is that when you are first put on the production floor out of training, a lot of things are still quite confusing.  It is my honest opinion that there should be more classroom training.  They should do on the job training inside the classrooms because the rooms are equipped to do so,  This would take off a lot of pressure when it is finally time to go on the floor permanently.  The trainer(s) would be able to walk around the room, observe and accurately see what problems are being had. They can compare notes and use that information and use it in a lesson on the next day of class."
good,It was my pleasure to work with Frontier communications. Frontier Communications is a very good company to work. Excellent work culture for who like challenges.
good,high school all over again. guys gossip like 15 year old girls. management never knows whats going on. still better than att.
good,"A typical day at work is being surrounded by a diverse group of people in an urgent environment working together as a team to complete daily job tasks.  The best part of my job is being with my co-workers every day.  I've learned a great deal of technical knowledge, and I've also learned a great deal about people.  The hardest part of this job is being asking questions that you might not know the answer to or being assigned a job you don't know the solution to, but the most rewarding part of the job is answering those question and getting those jobs done correctly!"
good,"Love working at Frontier, would recommend it to someone who can make sales and adhere to a strict schedule"
good,"Frontier Communications was a constantly changing environment. There was a strong emphasis on sales which was backed by a pay-for-performance bonus check and a strong emphasis on resolving the customer's issue. A typical day included being able to multi-task through several or more systems at once while addressing customer concerns and attempting to resolve their issue while creating sales opportunities. Both staff and co-workers were fantastic at offering advice and constructive criticism on how to improve with personal experience to back up their suggestions. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the somewhat steady amount of system errors that were to be expected from a constantly updating and growing service provider. The most enjoyable part of the job for myself was that every day brought something new to the table and an experience to learn from. Had it not been for family priorities, I would not have left such an exciting environment with a great opportunity to grow."
good,The opportunities for money is endless.  Great company to work for with amazing benefits.
good,"I had a great sales team, the best in the company. Managed 2.5 million dollar budget for the Southeast region."
good,"Good Pay and good management but no faith in the company's growth. You get plenty of PTO time (1 week PTO every 3 months), so it's easier to balance work with personal stuff."
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to learn from everyone around me. The cite leader was big on sharing information and making sure everyone knew he had an open door policy. I loved the fact that management was closely involved in the growth of each employee. A typical work day consisted of me taking 5 minutes to greet the team and making sure I was in a positive state of mind, booting up all my tools and checking emails, calling customers back if needed and taking calls. When I first started working here I knew nothing about routers, networks, types of services and much more, but the training I received which lasted a full month was more then enough to get me going. As time passed I started mastering my job and naturally new positions opened up to me. I can honestly say we were like a big family because we all cared about each other. If one person was having a bad day there was always someone around to cheer them up. The hardest part of the job was reaching out to higher level of support when assistance was needed. Apart from that if you knew how to do your job and how to utilized your tools you were ok."
good,"Meeting each morning with management to review daily goals. Cold call research, phone calls to gain appointments with new customers. Meet, review and present supporting offers to new businesses to provide solutions to meet their goals and needs. Team support for best practices and training issues. The best part of the job was being able to move the mindset of the company reputation and build a new relationship. The hardest part of the job was being able to consistently secure the product availability to each customer espeicially when coming in as a referral from an existing customer."
good,"- Poor decision makers in leadership"
good,"There were many shift times throughout the day, but for the most part, you could choose which shift fit best. Shifts were only able to be changed so often, along with supervisors. As far as the actual work goes, I enjoyed it. I took calls from customers about their services. I was able to schedule installments, uninstallments and even upgrades to their products. I did have upset customers over billing, but it was always easy to deescalate and resolve by myself. I enjoyed the fact that I was able to help customers for such a big company."
good,"It's pretty fast-paced. Expect to have to meet metric requirements. The management was okay to work for, although they were stressed all the time to meet certains goals and get their teams there. Overall a good company though."
good,"Frontier has great benefits and some areas can be long term.  I have been able to work in three areas and I have learned a lot working her.  It is tough to go into Management because there is no union and it is possible to be laid off or fired is it is felt the position is no longer needed.  I feel instead of firing or laying people off, they should get an option to try to apply in a different department."
good,"Work day begins when signed in on time.  Consistent work through system, working adjustments from all over the country.  Work is timed every day for productivity.  Well cultured company, although hardest may be times of system changes which is apparent, and most enjoyable is the team work."
good,"fast pace work in a call center environment, requires muti tasking in order to process changes while on the phone with the customer. Management works closely with employees to ensure standards, goals and industry compliance is being met"
good,typical day of work was a fast past day where everyday was a learning experience on technical changes management was easy to talk to and very cultural the hardest part of the job was when you have to tell a customer that they could not be fixed at that time and had to wait for a field tech i enjoyed the people i worked with the most
good,I worked hard and I advanced. Not much more you can expect from a company.The benefits and time off was in line with most large companies. I only left to pursue a noble cause.

good,"Frontier has taken care of me the last 6 years, it gave me an opportunity to spread my wings, grow into the role that I have, great culture and environment for me to cultivate my leadership skills."
good,"Intuit's atmosphere was one of creativity and loyalty. They understood the hardships of the job and knew great ways to motivate their agents into doing the best job they could. They allowed me to be an agent who was unique and encouraged out of the box thinking."
good,"Frontier Communications has been good to me, they provided me training and opportunities to grow , since i have been with them i went to 4 departments and I learn a lot."
good,"Loved the environment, Coworkers and adversity there, The management made work fun and really accepted suggestions."
good,Sales and service frontier products to customers. The job requires you to answer customer calls from an office desk and help them manage their Frontier products while trying to sell more and bundle more products to customer accounts for the commission and sales based part of the job.
good,Great pay and benefits. Management team was fun and easy to work with. Co-workers were very union oriented and many were not friendly.
good,Fun place to work. Co-workers are by far friendly.  The company does a great job by selecting applicable employees.
good,"When few big companies left me feeling not important or just another employee, Frontier Communications step in and made me better about waking up each morning to an honest day at work."
good,"If you're good at sales then this is an excellent place to work. If you aren't, you'll get the boot quick. But all in all, it really is a fun place to work with great people. And the pay and gifts you get is wonderful. They really do try to make things special there for their employees."
good,Frontier is a good company to work for and I love being able to be outside all day every day!
good,"Although my year mark was coming near, i had to leave frontier because of me relocating to another state. I learned so much working in retention and there’s room to grow. Pay was great as well"
good,"I believe that Frontier is a very good company to work for.  If it were up to me I would still be there.  However, I must go on and hopefully use my acquired skills in another company/position."
good,Friendly environment and good communication between technician and managers. They offer paid training and have college reimbursement program. Day to day work varies and is challenging.

When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit. The pipe dream they guaranteed to Frontier and the employees they did not honor. They changed all the policies after the grace receiving period. Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"As an employee of Frontier, I enjoyed my job and the opportunities it offered,  assisting customers,technicians and fellow co workers . "
good,"I ran the different departments. Would have still been there if I wasn't laid off. Data entry, research and production supervisor.  Environment at Frontier was a learning expereince."
good,"Loved working for this company before and after Frontier took over."
good,People literally congratulate you and acknowledge you for making sales. Coaches are always there for support and assistance. Always keeping the employees up to date with the latest information and teaching us ways on how to always put the customer first.
good,"- Learned quite a bit, many different vendors equipment to support."
good,"One thing I can say is that I never had a day where I woke up and dreaded going to work. No matter how bad your morning was, the second you badged through those doors your entire day was made better. "
good,Enjoyable work environment with lots of friendly and supportive employees.  I enjoyed interactions with management and learned a lot about the telecommunications industry.  The most enjoyable part of this job was the team I worked with and opportunities to learn new things.
good,"Enjoyable work experience, a really good company to work for. Frontier has good pay and good commission system. A lot of customer cold calling as well as a lot of time spent on a computer."
good,"I enjoy helping the customer get their quickbooks set up. I enjoy teaching someone getting started on their new business or even the most experienced quckbook user. It is an exciting program for anyone to learn that has the interest. "
good,"provide phone and Internet service and we also partner with DISH network to provide customers with satellite television. My particular department is CCSG although; my main function is Lifeline. My job obligations are to provide the customers whom may qualify with assistance on their telephone bills, also producing flyers and brochures to provide information on the program. I worked with a numerous amount of people to get this task done, may it is caseworkers, and family, department of Human Resources, Or My very own support team at Frontier Communications"
good,Very good company to work which gives an opportunity to work/life balance and demonstrate and enhance your technical skills.
good,The work is easy and the benefits are great. The customer base is not the most friendly folk.
good,"A typical day would start with answering email and voice mails from the previous day an processing new work orders."
good,"In day to day job, I was given the flexibility to project manage all my own projects and provide bi-weekly status reports to my manager and/or director. They trusted in my ability to complete all projects on time and with high quality. I made great relationships with all my clients and made sure all were happy with what was provided for them. I was able to work from home which allowed me to double my productivity. I was able to work in an office that contained the target population of most of my projects and allowed me to ask questions, test scenarios and get their input first hand."
good,"Good Company, trying to get organized after buying out Verizon.  I think once the company irons out everything it will be an amazing company to work for.   Management very nice."
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was everyday was different.  It was very fast-paced and team player environment.  My most recent Supervisor was outstanding and my Mentor!!    She made us always feel like a team and we were working together for the same goal.  She motivated us every week and I always looked forward going into work everyday.  I loved my job and my fellow co-workers.  The OSP Engineering team and upper management was outstanding and always went out of their way for each other.  I greatly miss working for this company.  In my short 12.5 years I gained a lot of knowledge and respect for the company and my fellow co-workers.
good,"Working here was a great experience, I really loved the training and updates, they were able to keep everyone up to date on anything new with the product and partner ship we had with Intuit."
good,"Family owned and operated place to work. The owners seemed to really care about their staff and helped many of us advance. I started as a switchboard operator and less than 6 months I was already doing many office dealership tasks, such as DMV, financing, balancing drawers and in charge of petty cash. I was also given the task of Account Receivables in which I was responsible for all the payments we had to make to other business and payroll. The most enjoyable part of my job was that my Management gave me the freedom to learn and work in so much more in such a short period of time. I was also in charge of planning all company wide parties and meetings."
good,A typical day at work is coming in and getting ready for over a hundred plus calls. I learned a lot about call centers and having to sell multiple products. My managers were very professional as well were my co-workers. The hardest part of the job is to try too sell a product to customers they have no knowledge of or can see the product. Having the relaxed environment to work in.
good,learned over the years that customer service should be a one call solution

good,"I wouldn't recommend this job too anyone it requires too much and it is not worth it. youre in more of a hard core sale, sale, sale position that customer service that is just to bait you in."
good,"A typical day at work comprised of managing customer accounts. Items such as promotions, connectivity, and product bundles."
good,good company and willing to promote you but not a true corporate ladder. In the end its a place to gain experience. . Financials are a fabrication and they should be audited as they create their own rules
good,It was a job that I looked forward to coming to everyday as the time grew longer it hasn’t been a pleasure. In the future the company should look out for number one and that is the customers with out them you will not have a business
good,"6 week training course 9 hr days."
good,Great local place to work the work load is not hard meeting goal are easy it depends on you if you meet them or not . You will meet alot of people. Upper management is noticable.  The customers are rude .the service provided is not the greatest
good,"I enjoyed working at Frontier Inc. You work very hard and get a lot done each day."

good,"Frontier was a great place to work, they had no problem motivating their employees to do better and make more sales, they offered great incentives such as high value prizes like game systems and large TV's, paid trips to award shows and vacations, etc. Typical day at work involved me coming in, clocking in on my computer, and going online and taking calls, my coworkers and I always got a long and it was almost as if we were a family. My manager was great and was very understanding about really anything that I had to say and anything that was going on in my life at the time and always did his best to accommodate."
good,"Very busy with customers and Regulatory Agencies, great co-workers and supervisor.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with very angry customers that don't believe you're going to help them.  Once the issue has been resolved for them they usually apologize and you can hear the relief in their voice."
good,"This is sales and it was interesting, but was not my field. "
good,I appreciate my present job as an outside technician.  I enjoy the fact that my truck is my office.  The best days are when the weather cooperates.

They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,"I have had many wonderful years working for the telecommunications companies. I have learned so much throughout the years.  The company has changed hands on 5 different occations and has given me the opportunity to learn new systems and working conditions.  Being a ""team player"" is what is most important to me, because if we all do not succeed, then we all fail.  I have not particularly found much with this business difficult, but more enjoyable because there is always something new to learn and helps to avoid boredom.  The most enjoyable is the opportunity to keep my customers happy.  I am currently relocating back to Indiana where I have a home and can continue to raise my family."
good,"Enjoy the work enviroment, co-workers, and high work loads.  My organization skills has driven me to become successful and committed to all tasks on time."
good,"- very productive, team-oriented atmosphere"
good,"Daily tasks included maintaining an organized work space and calendar.  I was also responsible for providing excellent customer service as well as meeting sales requirements.  My management was very supportive in helping me learn the best ways to meet sales quota each month.  The task most difficult for me was remembering product details and information.  The company provided so many helpful products and services that would be useful to just about everyone.  It would be unfair to both the customer as well as the company, if I didn't offer some type of product to each customer I came in contact with so I found myself making sticky notes and posters in my work area as reminders and go to guides.  My favorite part of working for this company was being able to interact with my customers daily, whether they were happy and fun or grumpy and not so fun.  I enjoyed having a problem brought to me and being able to solve it by the end of our time together."
good,"This company was bought out by a larger telecommunications firm. When I worked there, management was very friendly and supportive."
good,Great place to work. Great benefits. Wish I could work there again 
good,"My favorite job ever.. Made excellent wages, and the guys I worked with are just awsome. Miss the job, but dont miss living in Indiana."
good,"Get to work and plan the day with work orders. Everyday is a learning day, always something new to learn."
good,Worked from home. Excellent working conditions. Work week was always 55 hours.
good,Audit networks - search each circuit and track from end to end to find the assigned port and IP address.
good,"Company was good to work for, unfortunately once the data they received from Verizon territories was converted to their systems, all former Verizon employees in remote locations were released."
good,"Frontier Communications is a great place to work. The most enjoyable part of this job and working with this company is having the opportunity to work with professional team members and satisfied clients. A typical day at Frontier consists of prep time and team engagement to prioritize daily goals and task, working directly with our clients to resolve concerns and identify further needs, and taking the opportunity to match existing and new customers with appropriate communications products to fulfill the customers needs. At Frontier I have learned the value of sales strategy, punctuality, attention to detail, and the Customer First philosophy. All in all a great place to work. A place where every individual learns to utilize new skills and make a positive contribution to the customer and company."
good,"A typical day at work would be monitoring the security cameras, checking employee's badges for verification and assisting contractors and visitors. My co-workers and I work well together and the most enjoyable part of the job was training for different positions in other areas and attending classes on (Terriosm, Code of ethics) etc. The hardest part of the job was learning every employee's name within the business or company where employed. Overall it's a very good company to work for."
good,The only reason I left was because the company closed my department. I would go back if I could. Most of the people I worked with probably feel the same way I do.
good,"Citizens phone company, and Frontier Communications bit off more than they could chew by acquiring the West Coast, and not knowing the type of customer service that would be demanded of them. Especially in the Los Angeles market, where the competition took every dissatisfied Frontier customer they could find. Tsk Tsk Tsk"
good,No job security. Great salary. Don't ever go to management or they will let you go. Love the employees.................................................
good,"a typical day at work get to your first job, interact with customer."
good,My overall review of Frontier is that they are small telecom company that is an America first company. They attempt to keep all there employees here in the United States.  The good thing about Frontier is that they have less layers of Management than most companies their size.
good,I started as a Customer Service Agent on the phones. Within one year I was in Resource Management on loan as a local Analyst. From there I moved up to an Analyst at a National level. I continued for the next 2-3 years gaining new responsibilities. I feel that now I am ready to move up some more. I am looking for a place to do that.

good,"*Fast pace environment, Call Center, strict adherence policy,"
good,"sales, repairs, orders and maintain all customer accounts"
good,One of the best companies I've ever worked for. EXCEPT the pack of sales calls being routed to you. The company controls who gets what calls and if you aren't on the best team for sales then you don't get the sales calls
good,This Company has benefits with Insurance and 401K.  Great team members.  Would be nice if only operated Monday - Friday with better hours but overall would recommend.
good,Work/family balance skewed.  Expected to be available 24/7.  Little to no room for advancement.  Upper management out of touch with lower level employees.
good,"They havent ruined it as a great job for a tech as of yet. Working in the field is all I would ever do here. Get your work, be where you are to be, do your job and you wont have any trouble."
good,"They do what they can to create a positive work environment but the majority of incoming calls are from angry hostile customers with network service issues. "
good,"learned something new every day"
good,very unhealthy work environment you get in trouble for moving around
good,"Overall good place to work ! Great benefits and workplace environment , would return to work here if a position is open again"
good,"I have greatly enjoyed every aspect of this company, we are truly a family and there is always someone willing to help or help push me along to help in my success."
good,Over all they were a great company to work for. I worked from home for a long time and loved it.  The building is nice and has a lot of great people including management.
good,It was amazing to work here at first. I dont really habe anything negative to say. Tbh. Once you push your self you will see the sales flow. Sometimes the calls are ruff but overall decent.
good,"Greeting customers, responding to questions, improving engagement with merchandise and providing outstanding customer service. Operating cash registers, managing financial transactions, and balancing drawers. Achieving established goals."
good,It has an extremely great work environment that always keeps you motivated. You are always surrounded with a positive attitude. I would have to say that this job has taught me so much and i would recommend the job to any of my friends and colleagues.
good,"Awesome company to work for . They care about their employees and customers. The culture is essential to every day business. "

good,This job woo-ed me. they start out so awsome. but after getting on the floor they start to micro mgmt. but it all about on your team. enjoy the time you have there. no long term position there
good,"Very good ,highly knowledgeable 7 months of working experience in FTR. Worked fairly independently receiving minimum level of detail supervision and guidance. Good team player and maintain close and highly responsive relationship with end user and co worker."
good,I enjoyed 8 years at frontier. Management was not the greatest.
good,"Using a comprehensive Telephony software suite, Frontier stays current with Telephone industry standards as well as provision/billing of cable TV and Internet usage. The software not only tracks financial aspects but infrastructure of facilities and Electronic Data Exchange with other business entities."
good,Overall worked with several different interdepartments regarding customer impacting escalations in addition to working as project lead for special operations anyalis
good,I really enjoyed working at Frontier the opportunity for advancement was amazine. I was promoted twice while working with this company. Unfortunately after 9 years I was laid off.
good,Great place to work. Nice peers and friendly management staff.  Learned several items from cross functional standpoint. I was able to work with so many depts to accomplish project goals.
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was working with the customers and helping them in any way possible. I also enjoyed the freedom or working with little supervision.
good,"Good environment,  easy to understand while training the people were great as well as the customer base. The management could have been better when it came to communication but other than that amazing place to work at."

good,"In my opinion, Frontier Communications is one of the best places I have ever worked for. The company's policy and how they carry the company and professionalism is out of this world. I love the way they run the company. I have no issues at all."
good,"I enjoy helping customers resolve their issues in a one call resolution, whether its billing or a simple repair. I have learned a lot in past 2 1/2 years, how to de-escalate a call. how to manage accounts, setting up deferred paying arrangements and researching multiple ways to help a customer with their inquiry. My co workers are great, I am surrounded by genuine people that care for one another and help each other in difficult situations. Hardest part of my job is that we are universal reps, which means we take billing, collections, repair and supervisor calls. I enjoy the incentives that Alorica offers, it helps me and my family a lot"
good,"great company to work for, would still be there but was hired as a temp.  great pay, nice co-workers very enjoyable job.  the hardest part about the job is the training, the most enjoyable part about the job is getting to help the customer resolve their issues"
good,"Love this job. Had games and different items to win if sold so many packages. Would go back in a second if i get hired back. Management was great. Co workers got along with well there. Answered phones and took calls one by one. answered any questions customers had, got them to the right department if needed."

good,With Frontier you are able to enter at any level and have the opportunity for advancement. They are a company that truly cares for it's customers and employees.
good,I received payments for telephone bills. Put in work orders when problems arose.
good,It's been rocky with the changes but management from the top down has worked to get things back on track. Frontier has increased my knowledge within the field immensely.
good,"Nothing good to say about Frontier they moved into our AT& T   Worked on the road for months at a time, no rhyme ono reason pay was only good because it was in place before they took over"
good,"It was a solid job- I dont know why I have to review all these jobs tbh; if any of these jobs were that perfect, I'd have never left- too many workplaces need an overall upgrade on how they handle management and distribution of hours as well as pay. Half of the jobs listed nowadays barely helps you live. But they take the one resource in this world thats not renewable- and thats out time yet we get severely robbed of that compensation"
good,"This job was way too hard for the pay but it was still easy. I loved going to work everyday but I did not like how I was not getting a salary, I need more than 100-300 every week."
good,Frontier Communication was a wonderful place to work.  It had a mix of old and new people who interacted great together.  I learned so much in just the time I was there.
good,I have thoroughly enjoyed working for frontier communications for 8 years. It is a great place to work and I would recommend it to anyone. Great benefits and pay.
good,Nice place to work technology wise or team. people were helpful and better management. Worked on fios vod which was challenging . Over all I would recommend this company.
good,"Work day most of the time was 8 hours with occasional over time. Union job, learned many fascists of layer 1 transport . I got along well with all 4 supervisors I had over my 7 plus years with Frontier . Our work place culture was good with the group as well as my supervisors. Hardiest part  was probably the fact the manager ( my supervisors boss) micro manged to the point that it hindered our ability to grow as an individual . Because I worked second shift he would not allow us to get training in the metro e  ( despite my supervisors request on many occasions).  It cost me the chance to stay with the company with a transfer to Florida. I enjoyed the technical side of the job with the challenges that came with it."
good,"With direct communication with Frontier's CEO and Chairman, we implemented an on-site chiropractic wellness program that was paid for by the company and allowed their employees to direct on-site care with no out of pocket expense.  this was set up 2x's per month and was not renewed due to budget reasons."
good,Great place to work for but not a place you want to stay . They pay is great and its a new clean building. a new company and has room to grow and take you with it .
good,Frontier was an excellent job with some of the best trainers. Although the agency was temp to hire and the project did not continue. The pay and benefits were excellent and overtime was offered but not too often. The hardest part of the job was writing the orders for CLEC accounts. The environment was friendly and welcoming.
good,"Great work environment, Tv in the work area for entertainment between calls, ping pong in the break room and fun management as well as co workers. such a fun place to work."
good,"I loved working at Frontier. I enjoyed helping Customer get the Internet, Cable TV and Home Phone working. I learned how to troubleshoot Internet, Phone, and TV."
good,After working with Frontier Communications for almost 3years I couldn't be happier. Great support from both local and national leaders who are genuinely interested in your personal success and development.
good,"Pay is great and bonus, a lot of event. Management is great to work for. Benefits are great,pto, health,etc.. No work life balance though. Schedules can changes ever 90 days"
good,"Frontier is an excellent place to work. The benefits are great, the people, the vibe that everyone gives off. I have learned a lot of things there and it has definitely made me who I am today."
good,"People are very serious about their internet, other an the few customers that would throw a fit,  it was a fantastic work opportunity. Mon-Fri  8a.m-4p.m weekends off!"

good,"A day at Frontier is great, the environment and people I work with is great. The company has taught me that my multi tasking is beyond what I thought I could handle. I have learned to take care of 2-3 customers at once in resolving there issue all at the same time."
good,"Loved working there only wish it hadn't been a temp position "
good,"It was great to work at a company that knows what customer service is all about.  I was able to give the best to my customer and they wanted to stay with our company.  I was able to help customers with their bookkeeping needs with QuickBooks and Quickbooks Online, either personall or in their business.  I hated to leave because I enjoyed this job so much but I relocated to Georgia."
good,"You take calls all day, but the work environment is amazing. I absolutely loved my job there. There is basically no job security even if you are a good agent, but if it doesn't show in your stats then oh well. Love working there though. One huge family."
good,"Personally, I loved working for Frontier Communications and losing my position there was the biggest heart break I've had in my career path. The days were always upbeat, interesting, and there was always a reason to enjoy your job. I learned how to sell, how to manage what I say, and how to work with the people I was talking to. The management was terrific and they always made it fun. My co-workers were like a family and i enjoyed them much more than any of my previous jobs. The hardest part was definitely keeping customers straight, not calling customer B customers A's name because you just hung up with them. The most enjoyable part was definitely making a customers day when I confirmed they could get Frontier services."
good,"Working as a DBA , you some times are required to fix a problem at the shortest time possible and the minimum data loss. You get filled with pleasure when you are able to do what is required of you  and save the company out of loss. This was one of my experiences."
good,"I am on contract assignment for a special project.  I am treated like a full time, professional staff member.  My Director is very flexible and supportive.  He is very easy to communicate with and appreciates the hard work his employees puts in."
good,I loved working at frontier due to it being a union and was ALL US based
good,"This is one of the friendliest places I have ever worked. It was my first call center job and definitely wont be my last. Between the management team and co-workers, we are a very close knit family. The most important thing i learned from Frontier is overcoming customer objections in regard to purchasing new product. The most enjoyable part of everyday is the constant competitions within the teams and the center and winning the majority of them is by far the most rewarding"
good,I was honored to work there. I decided to quit due to a personal reason.
good,"Highly competitive and mentally challenging, but you develop a second nature for multi tasking that no job after it would be a challenge. You must learn to adapt quickly to be successful."
good,"A typical day at Frontier Communications this was my first time working a sales job, I've learned ways to master our sales call flow.( Overcoming objections & placement of calls ) I also was granted a opportunity to be a lead for the center. The hardest part of the job is taking the calls you never know what the customer experience you're going to get but with the training from management should me the ways to deal with the unexpected."
good,"good manegmant good pay, you are your own boss. union job raise every six months good job security good frinds you get a truck and tools good tips and nice customers"
good,"We worked on various projects for the company.  As long as you stayed in the norms of processing times they were happy.   (note, I'm not sure why Indeed is making review)."
good,The employees were wonderful to work with.  The job is rather physical.  It is not uncommon to need to crawl through a crawl space or an attic.  Can not have a fear of heights or bugs.
good,"I miss working there. They have an awesome environment and although the job isn't always the funnest when it came to angry customers and the repetitiveness of the job, it was always made fun by co-workers, daily, weekly and monthly spiffs, and it's a really family-oriented environment. It's a very easy job but can be stressful."
good,I loved working for Frontier and would go back . Only reason i left was because they had a huge lay off and let 1300 people go . great place to work would recommend it to anyone
good,"I loved working for Frontier my project manager was very laid back and understanding. I was able to work overtime if I wanted to, the pay was great, and my team was very hardworking."
good,Working at Frontier Communications was one of the best experiences of my life.  The people that you meet were great and really wanted to see you succeed.  Also the pay and commission structure on all levels was great as well.
good,"Frontier was a fabulous place to work. We hated to see them have to sell off our division. One of the best companies in 40 years I had the pleasure to work for. Friendly, helpful, community active, really believed in family. It's rare today to find a company that when they say they care about their employees, and they really do. When they sold out our division it was the saddest days of our lives. Unfortunately the company we were sold to, for all who stayed on and gave them a try, eventually everyone quit. The pipe dream they guaranteed to Frontier and the employees they did not honor. They changed all the policies after the grace receiving period. Cut pay that was in place, cut positions and cancelled benefits. Went from heaven to heck in the matter of months. If you can find any other branch of frontier, dont ignore them. They truly are a great company from what I experienced in my division."
good,I love working here I just feel there is no room for true advancement. I also like that the hours change frequently. Benefits are amazing.  Large diversity.
good,"I was only at Frontier for 8 months after their acquisition of Verizon's CA, TX, & FL markets so can't really give enough insight on the company. The experiences I did have with employees who had been with the company before the acquisition were all pleasant ones."
good,"A great group of workers"
good,I would essentially get to work and take calls from customers and help them with questions and help them resolve their issues. I learned how to use the Quickbooks Online product and also the Salesforce website. The hardest part of the job was receiving a call where you had no clue what they were asking and needing. Making it hard to please the customer. It also was hard speaking with angry people all the time.
good,It was a great company to work with. There would be lunches and breakfast available if working on weekends. Great work environment . Coffee available all the time. Great team
good,Calls are non-stop and the customers can be pretty cranky sometimes since we're dealing with their credit cards and money. But the work environment is so fun and pleasant with good friends and good coaches all around.
good,"Pretty good place to work. I would work there again, Great benefits and fast. 12.00 plus commission. Not too stressful, really good trainng"
good,"Company management is very fair & compassionate, dealing with each of us as individuals & understanding our unique personal situations. They worked with us on things from benefits to vacation scheduling on a regular basis.  The wages were fair based on sales performance.  Working conditions were excellent . I was even able to work from home towards the end of my time with them. This was incrediblely convenient since I live in Apopka, FL & their offices were in DeLand, FL.  I was setup with my own computer & two nice big monitors, as well as a wireless Bluetooth headset."
good,"This place is very challenging  and aggressive for all deliverable. "
good,"Starting everyday with a jaw exercise was not abnormal. Talking to guests navigating through Quickbooks online and desktop was no easy feat, some people needed more time than others. Overall, it was a very rewarding position but also very difficult in that not all callers were satisfied with their service. The hardest part is getting people to be satisfied with their service but some people are not always willing and feasible to learning new tricks."
good,"Interning with Frontier was so great! Unlike internships I've had in the past, they gave me actual work to do and it was the real deal. With other internships, you're just following someone around and grabbing coffee when needed but this internship was different. I got hands on experience and had deadlines to meet. What I got out of it was the readiness to work in a corporate environment. People always tell me that life will be so different after college and I actually experienced that life briefly interning with Frontier. The hardest part had to be the adjustment of how I multi-tasked. The most enjoyable part had to be the moments I got to talk to other interns as I was the only intern on the floor I was on. My co-workers were so great and supportive. And were a huge impact on my overall experience there. I am honestly so thankful for the time I spent there and all that I gained from it."
good,The coworkers and staff at Frontier Communications were always enjoyable and energetic. Everyone seemed to encourage one another through difficult times and stuck together to make days go by pretty smooth. I've learned many things that will benefit me with my customer service skills.

good,Excellent experience on a short term contract assignment for the data conversion of the AT&T Connecticut market.  The work hours were long but the team was great to work with.  The requirements gathering process was intensive due to the short time lines to coordinate with the stakeholders and get the business needs clearly documented.

good,"Paid training was excellent.  Internal communications via emails was excellent, any changes to policy was connived to employees.  Good benefits and vacation time.  I had  a previously planned vacation that I could not change at the time of hiring.   I advised Frontier of this and they honored this unpaid time off, even though I was not out of my 90 day probation period. I was thankful."
good,"very stressful job at times when needing to install services"
good,Frontier Communications in DeLand Florida was bought out by Sykes Enterprises inn 2017.  I loved my job at Frontier Communications.  The company culture was relaxed and adequate time was given to learn a skill or achieve a goal.  Management was able to connect with individuals on a personal level and provide flexibility.
good,"I worked as a contractor. I was scared of going full time and working a graveyard shift. I also should have stayed on the data side of the house instead of going to the 911 support group."
good,"Awesome Place to work! management is amazing, Management really works directly with you. I enjoy my day at frontier from the time i walk in til the time i leave."
good,"Frontier was experiencing growth pains after purchasing Texas, California and Florida from Verizon.  As a result I was laid off.  I would work for them again given the opportunity."
good,"The company had excellent benefits and time off. I had a lot of freedoms and worked independently, the starting pay was nice but the raises were very small."
good,customer service can be challenging and stressful at times depending on calls received and or customers. maintaining a positive and good attitude goes a long way in this field.

good,Being an employee at Frontier Communications  was very interested a typical work day would be for me would be a heavy call volume. I learned that you must have patients with the customer on the other in. yes you will be disrespected but you must always keep calm in any situation. my co-workers was very helpful in many cases. if I didn't understand my co-workers would be there to back me up and I would do the same. There was really nothing hard about the job you just had to know what screens you needed to assist the customer. the most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people.
good,"Although my job required a lot of answering phones, I did enjoy the office ""busy work"" There was constant work. The job paid well, the management and employees were all in sync. Another pro & con would be the competitiveness that comes along with commission , but I will say it pushed everyone to work harder and as a team.  "
good,"I loved working at Frontier but unfortunatly it did not work out becasue I became ill and I had a documentation sent to them from the hospital about the illness I had, which was mononucleous, and since I was still on probation period with them, they let me go, the probationary period was 6 months and I was in with the company about 5 months exactly. In that time I was given many good customer reviews, and also I was the third best in sales for the center for the quarter, that is out of about 300 people."
good,"A typical day, the management somewhat makes the job a lot easier. I learned many technical troubleshooting skills, I established a great relationship with other employees! The hardest part was mainly to communicate effectively with the supervisors. The most enjoyable part of the job was the benefits."
good,"Great company, great trainers! Plane They took the time to explain what you would be doing on the floor. What you calls would be like. They made sure that the times that you said that you were coming in was it a time for you to come in as well as the company itself availability and dependability was working both.

good,"I would take inbound calls from customers who had questions, comments, or concerns about their account or billing."
good,"Start up computer, open up all programs needed for the day, and sign into phone. Training was 7 weeks long and went through basics on how to process certain orders. You meet most of the supervisors during training and they give you encouraging words. Management is very, very helpful. Coworkers are ver diverse. They have many options to win prizes, but most of which you have sell something certain within a certain amount of time. I love being able to help customers, but feel I haven't been able to learn everything I should to do my job accurately. The job does require a quota, but you aren't really taught how to ""sell"" until a month after training and a month after your quota starts. It's a very good company, but you shouldn't go in if you aren't able to sell or ""talk"" people in upgrading to ""better"" packages."

What I can say about management is that I love when they are there to help whenever needed. I like a culture that is open to all different types of back rounds and willing to accept.
