rating,review
bad,"Overall, we as representatives had to take too much of a bluntly disrespectful customers. I was called a racial slur on the phone calls on the regular bases and we were not allowed to disconnect calls when needed!"
bad,"this is one of the worst places that i've ever worked. You are expected to endure stressful training for weeks.Then 2 weeks  after training were told the company that just hired us are not renewing their contract, so we have until April with the company. Very bad business"
bad,"If it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. During the hiring process, promises were made that were not kept. No paid time off. No holiday pay after being told we would get them. No pay raises EVER. 2 weeks ago the whole company was short on payroll. No one got paid their expected hours regular hours work or overtime. Managements response was they didn’t know if or when we would get paid. Also commented that we should plan for episodes like this.... I’m sorry I didn’t know I needed to plan on not getting paid for hours I worked for. It wasn’t until the news crew contacted them that an update was sent out to employees."
bad,"Stationed at an Entergy facility for decommissioning of the facility.  Therefore, I am not in a position to give an opinion of the pros and cons working for this company."
bad,This company treated people very poorly. they would withhold wages and service different communities improperly. They have experienced law suites from which caused a lot of people to leave the company.
bad,Entergy gave me my start working in call centers but there is no room for advancement they have their picks and chooses. Managers are always in huddles whispering.
bad,If you don't know how to politic your way through the system then you may find yourself stuck in a rut.
bad,Senior Managers at this company are usually external and are considered above reproach when they act unethically on their way to the next Manager/Director position. In my 2 years here after 20+ years at two other nuclear facilities I have witnessed more unethical and disrespectful Senior Leadership behavior go unchecked here than ever before.
bad,"If you're looking for a paycheck ,cool job, but security and management that understands you this place is not it . Horrible job"
bad,"I loved my job and my co-workers. The work was pretty easy and the pay was OK, except when you had to work 16-20 hours a day during a storm and forget about your family. We received a 1% - 2% yearly raise during the past 10 years. I was told to go to school to get promoted and did from 2003 - 2005. After I graduated, it took 7 years to get my promotion and I had to leave my group to get it. I was given the work of my promotion during those 7 years but was NOT paid for it or given the title. I tried calling HR and the hotline to get help and was given the run-around every time. They called my supervisor as soon as I got off the phone with them and told him everything I said. They asked me why I didn't go to him with this issue and I told them I have for years and it has gotten me nowhere. I'm tired of waiting. Last December they let go of 800 workers. I had 15 years and was let go when they had people who were retiring in months that were kept on instead of bridging them for early retirement. Don't work for these idiots!"
bad,"This is definitely a last resort job! The managment are horrible, they do not hold thenselves accountable for any mistakes that they make. I NEVER worked at such an unorganized place in my life. I have been in utiliies for 5+ years, the augusta site is by far the worst! Hey, try it for yourself you will see!"
bad,They claim to work with you and they life happens don’t get sick and have proof that doesn’t matter to them  fired me and my wife because she has cancer and other issues and I wanted to accommodate her at her appointments and had proper documentation
bad,Working for this company is only beneficial if you grew up in a swanky neighborhood and went to private school and can travel the world. Not diverse at all.
bad,Currently operates the three worst ran (INPO Column 4) nuclear stations in the country which demonstrates their lack of commitment to nuclear safety.
bad,"I made jobs for the guys in the bucket trucks to replace rotten poles, add new customers, re-route lines for roads, replace broken poles hit by the public, etc. Quite a few times I had people on a fixed income ask about moving a pole so they could get a loved one out of a vehicle who is now in a wheelchair and I must tell tell them it cost thousands of dollars. At the same time big businesses get away with damaging lines that cost over $50,000 to repair and pay nothing because they give a director some tickets to see free shows. Or a private school that pays nothing because the CEO's children attend that school. Then say they are not making enough money and must lay off 800 people?"
bad,Too much micromanagement but corporate. Corporate management likes to make all the decisions for the field. Too much emphasis on safety as long as it doesn’t cost the company
bad,I was a great opportunity for 15 years. I responded to request and calls from customers related to client specific programs and products. I made attempts to resolve issues and deescalated issues of irate or dissatisfied clients.
bad,Poor Management and No Advancements for all the work load you have and mind you the skill set and knowledge you've gain doesnt amount to anything when your not getting the raise the you deserve.
bad,I was terminated from this employer even though I had proper documentation from being off work with a sick child. I feel the policy is unfair to employees
bad,I am currently looking for new challenges and better opportunities to further my career and quality of life.  I have reached the glass ceiling in my current position.
bad,Alorica  in which Entergy is contracted out to now is a very stressful environment with no holiday pay. they don't value the employee at all. I wouldn't recommend Alorica to anyone
bad,"The pay is good, but the hours are excessive. Management treats union members horribly. They only give 5 sick days a year and mandate tons of overtime. They preach safety and family, but could care less about either.."
bad,Entergy is undergoing a process to maximize profitability through the method of reducing staffing. This is increasing the work load of employees without an improvement in compensation and with a negative impact on work/life balance.
bad,"I was hired on as a full time worker through temp staff at the beginning with a understanding after the first 90 days were over my class and I would be hired on with Entergy full time with benefits and time off.  90 days came and passed with nothing, and 6 months passed, and a year passed.  Finally out of nowhere the manager who was very nice gathered us up for a group meeting.  She explained to us Entergy was now on a hiring freeze and they were laying off people and letting my class and I go.  We were all surprised."
bad,Im only posting this because indeed is making me.  Its a terrible place to work.  Corrupt from the top to the bottom.  Very hostile and retaliatory environment.
bad,"A typical day at Entergy would be taking customer payments, assisting them with payment arrangements, and energy assistance programs. This company not only withheld money from employees but, also treated their customers with no regard. People would always call in and complain for legitimate reasons. They would file complaints and talk really fowl about the company. I would be as nice as possible  however, it was nervous or tension on a day to day basis."
bad,"I was really grateful to  have employment coming from another state, however I have never worked for a company in this poor shape in my life."
bad,"•	Stationary Engineer"
bad,"the management is not helpful they are very rude. "
bad,"I thought I was going to be able to be able to advance.  I found out that they weren't wanting to advance you, so basically they lied to tell you that so that you would work hard to get your contract ended."
bad,"Great as long as your needed. As long as your job is needed your needed, when it's not, your not. No transitioning help either, unfortunately."
bad,The nuclear division uses the word Safety  all the time.  The truth of the matter is that Indian Point is very unsafe. So many corners are cut leaving the public unsafe without their knowledge.
bad,"I have had 6 managers and 5 directors in the past 10 years.  Entergy lacks stability in leadership, change management, and in a proactive approach to obvious and critical challenges such as software integration and compatibility that is not based on the cheapest vendor.."
bad,"You only advance based on who you know, and not merit/ contribution/ job knowledge. Several people are exhibiting inappropriate behavior with upper management to advance; The same pool of middle management employees are rotated for new job opportunities;  middle management has no clue as to what their employees do and don't care to know; Many of the tenured employees were forced into retirement or lost their jobs due to outsourcing; there's a constant revolving door of contract employees who either don't want to work or see no incentive/ motivation in continuing as an employee due to low morale, stressful working conditions and unknowledgeable management"
bad,"Pilots are overwhelmed with collateral duties. Schedule changes every minute, when you’re not flying you find yourself with a mountain of in-house company training, staff meetings, safety meetings, and a two-hour (gear-up) call out, and it happens very frequently. EXTREMELY HARD to get vacation approved. Management constantly tries to tell you how to fly from their desks.  "
bad,"The plant is closing in the next two years.  Management does not appreciate the employees or out of work lifestyle.  Management demands lots of unpaid ""professional"" time while they pay contractors for every hour to do a lesser quality work.  The benefits are okay, but Entergy continues to take away whatever they can.  Employees are also on-call for about 15 weeks a year."
bad,heavy turnover rate - unfriendly environment - company likes to over work you - departments are unorganized - hard to find parking
bad,Managments needs to be better. You don't receive benefits until 6 months. You treated like a number not a person.
bad,"No career advancement. No protection for non- union employees from under qualified leadership. Supervisors are allowed to do whatever they want and there are no repercussions or avenues for employees to file grievances without retaliation. "
bad,To many friends and family working for friends and family. Not a company who encouraged thinking out of the box. The company had a group of managers who felt that they had all of the answers. However they never worked for another company and relied on consultants. You were only allowed to think outside of the box if you were white.This cause the company to implement change that didn't work. Examples are financial operation system and company financial structure. Major delays becasue internal implementation team members didn't have shills and knowledge to execute deliverables.
bad,"The benefit of this job once you've been there long enough is that you can work from home, which saves you gas money. And if you like money that can be up one pay period and down the next depending on the overall quality of your work meeting numbers and all then this job may or may not be for you. The good thing is if you don't mind the stress of not being able to have an answer for your customer or a supervisor not being available and they could be sitting right there doing something else then join this job at your discretion. The job is fine and can actually be fun if you love helping people that's never an issue. This job does have mandatory overtime so from your 8hrs-12hrs) that can change a few days or a few hours in advance when there's shortages. If you try to get out of this you loose your job which tell you in advance. This is the only call center I've worked at that have 10 minute restroom breaks says its a Georgia law. If your on any meds that make you tinkle even with a docs excuse. Think again this can not only effect your numbers, but your hours, your pay which can do that up and down thing from earlier.  The job can be overall fun and allow you to make extra... just not the rate of pay at which can adjust anytime during the month or the restroom breaks which takes you that long to get to the restroom and hope the cleaning lady isn't at the one your going to, oops got to climb stairs cause the elevator is going to take longer. Which is why I can see why they stay hiring."
bad,"Pay is good enough to keep you but benefits have been changed for the worse with each contract.  Found out by watching the morning news at home that they were closing my plant, management is terrible, makes terrible decisions.  They do not care about the workers here at all. Notorious for promoting managers that have no clue how to do their jobs or how to actually manage people."
bad,Interesting and challenging work tasks under a variety of conditions. Compensation is fair but work environment is demanding.
bad,Was a great job until I had to depend on other coworkers to relay information for completion of training. Atmosphere was not bad for a working environment.
bad,I worked as a nuclear security officer for 5 years. The management was more concerned with their own advancement than the well being of their employees. The pay was good but working 12 hour shifts makes home life horrible. The horribly high turn over rate made over time so high you would end up working every day. If you have a family when you start you wont after a few years.
bad,The work environment was very stressful and fast-paced. Some days we would have mandatory overtime and when you are ready to leave at the end of your shift it hard to stay.
bad,It was ok...I learned a lot about the job there. The hardest part was the phone ringing back to back none stop. The most enjoyable part was the rewards.
bad,"Do not wish to share--was downsize out of a job.  We were only given a thirty day notice, no severance package or compensation.   Employed at this company for over 17years and was asked to come into a meeting one morning and my world was turned upside down. My shift was eliminate too."
bad,A typical work day is 7am-4:30pm. Most of my learning was on the job. I prefer not to comment on management and co-workers. I do not consider any part of my job as being hard. The most enjoyable part of my job is being employed.
bad,"This is definitely a job to just use as a stepping stone. You can expect to take over 100 calls daily and a strong 70% of calls end in (no).  Entergy doesn't care about its employess, yet prides itself on opinion based customer surveys from those same customers you had little choice but to say (no) to. As a customer service rep your pay is based on those surveys.  The company will use you and not care about you one way or the other."
bad,"Overall Good Company to work for."
bad,"The day starts fairly early in the mourning with a brief truck inspection. While doing that,your specific route is being loaded into your Itron or handheld as we say. U stay uniformed at all times while on the job,you go in and get out. That's pretty much what has to be done on the daily. U read the meters as quickly & accurate as possible and leave quietly. I learned how to save money within my household with this job. It also taught me that there are a lot of out the box people in this world and you should always pay attention to your surroundings. My management was really good. Had great co-workers and made a few friends in the process. The hardest part of the job was the job itself. Meter reading isn't easy as it looks. And every dog isn't a good dog. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom and the way they always gave us a chance to improve!!"
bad,The immediate supervisor appeared to be paranoid and insecure which made my job hard.  I think Entergy would be a great place of employment if one has a good manager/supervisor
bad,"Worst management I've ever had to work with. The work culture was depressing, full of complaining at all levels. If you value happiness DO NOT work here..."
bad,Entergy Nuclear New England as a whole is being decommissioned or sold off. The southern branches of the company are better for career longevity to those who are interested in employment.
bad,"To be a fortune 500 company, Entergy could have treated it's employees way better. To have done us the way that they did was just awful. I worked for Entergy almost 8 years and to switch us and make us contract out and do the same work with NO BENEFITS is just wrong on every level. I am at a loss for words right now as I type."
bad,Inappropriate business practices.  Most older employees counting the days until they can retire at 55.  Management disconnected from  work that is important.
bad,"My daily tasks were to work on a line crew to construct overhead and underground power lines. I was on-call 24/7 to respond to crew power outages. I worked storm restoration in other states across the Mid-South. It was enjoyable working with other men from other entities. Especially, to see the smile on customer's faces when we restored power in their area."
bad,Voice Engineer - We had a Nortel Option 61/81 phone system and upgraded to CUCM 8.0. I was responsible for everything from testing and accepting the T1's SIP test & turn up to customer service engineering. Once that project was complete I was offered a job internally where I was laid off after a year and a half.
bad,Entergy is a great place to work.  There are many different opportunities for various career paths. I have worked here for the past 3 years and have made a lot of friends and happy customers in my job here at Energy.
bad,"Monopolies and highly regulated industries typically charge more and produce less.  This also impacts the culture.   Since there is no outside competition the workers act accordingly,"
bad,"The company lies and tells the workers one thing while telling the public something else. They do not like to spend money on equipment that is broken,"
bad,Good money and secure position as long as you keep your head down. Managers move up by making examples of others and placing blame on others for their poor mismanagement.
bad,"I did learn endurance and self discipline."
bad,"This is the worst job I've ever had.  I literally would get nauseous just coming to work.  Entergy pays well, but the things they asked me to do when I worked there was unbearable. "
bad,Entergy  is a investors first company and its employees matter very little to them. They talk a lot about  integrity honesty and so on saying it is there building blocks for success. they do not fallow this in any way. they constantly lie to there employees and the public. people stay for the pay as it is very good. But it is a job that works harder at trying to replace people then it does at keeping them. please keep in mind I have worked here for 14 years and at the time of writing this I am still employed here. just trying to give a honest review of my experience with this company.
bad,During the time I was at Entergy it was ok but after 4 years it became more hard to do.
bad,"It's always interesting to see how corporate companies are ran in different cities. Entergy has a negative corporate culture. No support from upper management or employee relations. Poor internal communication and overall poor management and leadership."
good,Friendly company. Would be a lot better if it wasn't closing.
good,The phone calls from the customers would make you laugh but I would have stayed if they would have offered a full-time position (worked a contract worker ).
good,Entergy was a very fast paced call center and the call volumes were extreme and the work load was heavy but they gave a lot of incentives to keep the moral of the center high
good,The job in itself was easy and co workers were helpful. The management and the way the work process that was set up was not good at all.
good,"Entergy is a fast paced company, constant talking to customers, daybegins just as your day ends on the telephone.  Sometimes customers get irate , and you are not to react to these customers.  It could be that they are having a bad day, have experienced an power outage for hours or days, or just want to act out.  It takes a lot of prayer and patience to do this job. Some co-workers make this job enjoyable."
good,Majority of supervisors change often and provide little oversight or guidance.  Unable to advance because there were few qualified and competent engineers in the organization - therefore I was stuck as the only qualified engineer.
good,High turnover rate because your hired as a temporary employee at first. Mandatory overtime when there are storms or bad weather. To many training classes.
good,No security or certainty in your position and I worked at Entergy for 20 years. I was stuck in the same department all that time.  Available positions for advancement are all political.  If you dont know the person in the department youre interested in applying in you have no chance of advancement. Not family oriented at all....they say so but not true.
good,"Get there for 8:00am stay on the phone until 11:00am go to lunch then I was transferred to the research dept, and work there for 12:00pm until 5:00pm or 6:00pm depend on management and if the customer where not satisfied. I sent out bills to customer, research if the bill was to high."
good,"My job is pretty much routine. I mainly know what to expect when I come to wok. We are ranked according to our stats on and off of calls, from quickness of first call resolution to customer experience scores. I am currently ranked # 1 out of 150+ reps. The hardest part of my job is getting a customer that already has their mind made when they get on the phone. However during my duration here I've learned how to deal with the most challenging customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is resolving a problem after a customer has spoken to multiple reps prior to myself."
good,The Media and Project Management took most of one building for Headquarters. While a warehouse shared another building with engineers and a training facility for controller operation training.
good,"Good job, just not enough pay for the physical demand. I enjoyed the independence and opportunity, but dreaded dealing with violent animals and unexpected injuries."
good,Working at Entergy was a good job however it is very cutthroat and it has a good old boy mentality. Great pay but no compassion for older workers. Did pay well
good,"This location was a very fast paced environment. Assisting customers with electricity issues and bills required a lot of patience but with a limited time slot to solve the problems. The co-workers were wonderful and got along well. The hardest part of the job was when customers did not want to talk to you and demanded a supervisor, but a supervisor told you to handle the call."
good,"Great company, excellent customer service, low opportunity for job advancement for new hires. Office culture is moderately positive but temporary worker status interferes with  job performance."
good,Did firewatching at Entergy plant.  Productive and fun place to work.
good,Has the capability of being a great company. However need to walk the talk and balance work with quality of life. Tough business in a tough market.
good,"Pay and benefits are great, employer places great emphasis on health and promoting good health."
good,"This is a good company if you want to get buried in an office or travel back and forth from New Orleans to Houston, but not real concerned with advancing your career.  The management will say they are open and trusting, but it is the opposite.  Everything you say that challenges their opinion will be held against you .  Many are petty and appear to hold grudges against employees.  I have not experienced this first had, but I have seen it done to others.  Career advance is only for a select few that fit into the Entergy Management character style.  Soft spoken, risk-adverse, passive aggressive."
good,"A typical day could be 10 hours of good maintance work or 24 hours  of back breaking hard labor due to equipment failure or storm damage. Hurricanes,ice storms,thunderstorms"
good,You felt like you were being watched and monitored constantly.  The pay and benefits were good but the atmosphere and attitudes of the supervisors was very lacking and inconsiderate.
good,Busy cleaning rooms for quests. How to community with other races in this world.Management very poor didn't have respect to the workers. Divisity. Been able to get the job done and to keep a positive additude at all times and to show respect to everyone . when the quest tells me to keep that beautiful smile on my face and to stay the way I am and enjoy life.
good,"Great place to work, management leaves the job up to you. Responsibilities are held to a higher standard due to being a nuclear facility. The office environment is structured but fun, mingling with co-workers is encouraged."
good,"I had the opportunity to work in several areas at the plant. This included Radiation Protection, ALARA, Training, Emergency Planning, and Quality Assurance."
good,"After clocking in we had 5 minutes to get to our desk and log into 8 different systems. The little time I spent on the phones was what we called ""outage and emergency"" which was when the customers were calling in to report their power being out due to storm or other incidents. The management team seemed unorganized and unsure how to run the department. The hardest part about working for this company was learning the important laws in Arkansas, since they were different from the other states that were serviced. I really enjoyed the people I worked with. We all had fun when we took breaks from being on the phones and learning our jobs."
good,Nice first job  out of the Air Force job was low paying that is the reason moving on To GE.
good,pays wells old management was sometimes hard to deal with. I've heard they have changed and I don't know how it is now. Maintenance department has taken over the planning department .
good,stable utility company.  Good benefits.  Many transfer opportunities.  Many locations.  Fortune 500 employer.  Good incentives.  Focused on customer service.
good,The pay and benefits are great at first but the lack of work/life balance tends to overshadow the compensation.  Advancement opportunities are scarce.
good,"Not much interface with other employees, too much work to talk to other employees.  Plenty of money for projects but never gets approved. Management gets % of savings so they don't spend and get higher bonuses."
good,no review for this company as I do not wish to participate. The reason is solely for my purpose . I do not wish to particpate in this survey at all. Please
good,"Being part of a bargaining unit it is hard to have managers on your side.  Mangers promise things will get done but never will.  Benefits such as tuition reimbursement and professional development course are offered to company but when we ask for it we can not go.  If you ask a question that they dont know you will never get a answers.  They will tell you they will get back to you, but wont."
good,"You are just thrown into your position and expected to learn 2 + years of information in 6 months. and if you don't learn it, you are chastised. Their mission and ideas are great, they just need to make sure every single person follows them."
good,"it's a job, it helps pays the bill. there are days you don't want to be there to fuss with people about their bills. the management is something else."
good,"The hardest part of the job was working as hard as you could and never knowing if it would ever take you anywhere. It all came down to who you knew and if they were willing to advance you. However, for those lucky ones, it was an amazing place to work with amazing benefits."
good,I truly enjoy my co-workers. My superviors are some what nice but have some that this job is definitely not for them.  Supervisors do not respect employees. We are all adults and we deserve to be treated that way.  It is a nice place to be employed but the verbal abuse that we endure from customers each and everyday causes alot of mental stress.  The pay rate is not good at all but everyone has to work and provide for their families and pay bills.
good,"This company does provide a good balance of work/life with every other Friday off and seems to be above in compensation level.  "
good,"Entergy has a reasonable work atmosphere which promotes safety and diversity.  Job work and life balance is good as well as the compensation and benefits.  Company has recently gone through a re-organization which also reduced the work force.  The re-organization was suppose to align skills and experience with the new organizations needs, but in the end it was not what you knew or your capabilities but who you knew.  Management is very short sighted and do not work to know or understand their employees.  It is disappointing that management does not take advantage of the internal resources they have available to them."
good,Great job if you like shift work...pay is very good but quality of life very low.  It's your typical nuclear job filled with red tape and over the top job requirments.
good,"My work schedule depended on whether or not we were in a refueling outage or not, which happened once every 18 months for either unit.  (This meant that every three years there would be two outages that year instead of the usual one.)"
good,"You can't move up in the company, unless you are kin to someone already in the company.  Technology is very old.  Great Benefits!  Pay is great also!!"
good,The company and utility environment has made drastic changes in the past 5 years.  There is a high level of stress in the office and people are expected to do more than a single person can manage.
good,"The job is fairly easy. The job just doesn't pay enough for the  load of work, and dealing with the different attitudes from the irate customers. The job could pay more money to avoid a high turn over rate."
good,"Day starts at 3:30 am, on shift at 6 am. day ends at 6 pm.  when you first step though the door you are hit with negativeness. no job satisfaction,"
good,"takes calls for service initiation, starting, stopping and transferring customers service"
good,"Typical day at work involves person walking and driving."
good,"Utilities employer focused on profits. Countless missed Performance Improvement opportunities lost driven by cost and perceived effort."
good,Work in Entergy is really good. Have good life and work balance.
good,Just block all the negative out and just do your job.If u can do that I think everything will be just fine.Do what is ask of you .The main thing is come to work.
good,"Pay and benefits are good, but have to fight for raises and promotions. Work life balance needs improvement. If you are a good worker and strong work ethic, they will wear you out."
good,"Working at Entergy is a good experience, Lots to learn about the Nuclear side of IT. Also, lots to learn about the Fossil power generation industry and its culture."
good,"starting early as possible  completing different assignments throughout the day that would be loaded into my computer each morning. you learn to work an complete tasks without someone standing over watching you all the time, you are out on your on trusted to take care of what needs to be taken care of. The hardest part of the job o me is going to be the angry customers that can sometimes be a pain but that's nothing for me it's normal I can about deal with any type of customer without things getting out of hand."
good,Not a good place to work. did the call center and the supervisors pretty much determined if you kept your job or not. They kept laying people offunprofessional
good,"Power Plant Fall and Spring Outage Seasons.  Planning, scheduling, cost control, estimating, and risk analysis for Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT’s) and conventional steam turbine power plants, including Gas Turbines, HRSG’s, Boiler, Transformers, Feed Pumps."
good,It was nice working for a large company that provided health insurance and other insurance benefits. Like having a pension plan that some companies no longer provide.
good,"A typical day consists of taking roughly 150 calls assisting customers with billing issues, work orders, and web management. Very quick paced with seldom down time."
good,I am grateful for the educational reimbursement program that is offered by the company. There are many health and wellness programs and employees are encouraged to take advantage of those programs. Safety is the number one concern and that has created a safety first culture.
good,"During my time at Entergy, I learned my city where better than I did before,you be to yourself when you working in different neighborhoods,the management is ok depending on who is leading it,the hardest part of the day was starting the route,the most enjoyable day was when it was time to be off....."
good,"Nuclear Power Plant in Covert, Michigan"
good,"Enjoyable work environment. Long hours and good food, low moral but the customers make it fun!"
good,"Great place to get knowledge of all departments as the budget , HR, Purchasing, contracts,  and fleet are hands on for the front line management employees."
good,"The job wasnt bad at all. I was worried that the project we were all hired to do would run out soon. I began a new job search."
good,Good place to work and with good people. Safety first priority.Enjoyed my work..
good,"Handled inbound calls pertaining to Emergency, Outages, Billing and Payment issues."
good,The plant management has a lack of forsight and has a tendency to require work that is not needed. The nature of the nuclear industry causes the site to be restrictive and slow.
good,This is a great company to work for but there was not a lot of growth for my future in this company for the safety professional so I chose to relocate to another company.
good,"I was a fulltime employee at Arkansas Nuclear One for twenty years. My positions in the plant were considered front line positions.  If plant issues occurred, the expectation was that people in my type of position would be available to work around the clock to resolve the issue. Due to the nature of nuclear power all errors are unacceptable. This contributes to a high level of stress.  I retired in 2011.  I returned in 2015 as a part time contractor. As a contractor, the expectations for perfection was still there, but the expectation to work at all hours was not.  This greatly eased the stress of working there."
good,"Due to the nature of nuclear energy in the United States, working as a system engineer in the boiling water reactor nuclear plant was slow and filled with red tape. Because the turbine and generator systems were radioactive, any inspection or work on the system required federal approval before proceeding. Many days were thumb twiddling days filled with non job related tasks to justify your employment."
good,very high paced call center. calls are back to  back. you get 2 15 min breaks and 30 min lunch. you are required to be at work unless prescheduled off. very stressful
good,"I worked as a part of a two-man Physical Security Administration team. Our team developed access training materials for the physical and cyber security of critical Transmission, Distribution, and data center facilities. We managed all physical access to these facilities, as well as oversaw maintenance of physical security equipment."
good,"Working in the Nuclear Power industry can be rewarding yet very disappointing. On a daily basis a System Engineer has the opportunity to solve complex problems with limited assistance. However; problems are usually solved on paper first and troubleshooting actions can take days and possibly weeks to implement. In the Nuclear Industry documentation is key; therefore; a System Engineer spends a significant amount of their time performing administrative work. "
good,"Work places alot of demand on you, outages can take up to 72 hours per week, overtime is a difficult subject to negotiate, and they will reach out to you at all hours of the day, but the personnel are reliable."
good,A majority of my career was spent in Operations working rotating shifts. This presented many challenges but overall the experience was good and I enjoyed working with a multitude of highly intelligent people.
good,"It is a very stressful company.  It is worse during refueling outages, you work between 60-70 +.  During outages if it falls during holidays no time off.  There is no family life."
good,"For Entergy positions at Nuclear Power Plant plants, expect times of high stress (planned and unplanned plant outages), technically knowledgeable staff and management."
good,never worked for entergy. never was an employee. This must be a mistake. Never with this Company. Knew people with this company but never was enployed.
good,Working for Entergy Services was a good learning experience. On a normal day I may answer between 150-200 calls. My supervisor  was very straight forward about her expectations and what was required of us on the daily basis. If there was anything she could do to help anyone she would.  As a floor walker I dealt with several people and different personalities each and every day. The best part of my job is knowing that I was able to help and satisfy majority of my customers and my fellow co workers.
good,I guess doing youre job sometimes is not enough.I went out of my way to make sure I was around for awhile but it seems they wanted people that was not suited for the job.
good,"Entergy is a fully intergrated utulity of 13000 employees serving 28 million customers in New Orleans, South East Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas and Mississippi."
good,"I would set up accounts, disconnect accounts and or assist with bill inquires."
good,"The pay and the team that I had at Entergy was great. The company is very stingy with extras and benefits. The business isn't that exciting, and the nuclear group has a lot of extra burden and bureaucracy to deal with. If you are only working for money and don't mind being on call and getting called into the power plant occasionally, then you would like this company. Otherwise, you probably will want to look elsewhere or at least not in the nuclear part of the company."
good,"Typical day at work - two meetings, routine work."
good,"Enjoyed the co-workers and most of your management. However they was one poison Apple in the barrel that just happened to be head of my dept."
good,"My days at Entergy were very busy, i attended several meetings.  Learned how to get a long with various types of employee's from the Vice President to the craft.  Co-workers in my department were very friendly.  Hardest part was getting to all of the meetings on time."
good,"Great company to work for in regards to pay and benefits. Storm duty is a must anytime there are hurricanes or ice storms,"
good,"Typical day at work is filled with back to back customers. Learned that a customers anger, sorrow, or etc. isn't pointed towards me, but the overall company. So learned how to remain calm even with a frustrated customer to give them the best customer service to my ability. My co-workers are generally nice. Everyone has a job to do. So we are more work driven verses being social. Hardest part of my job is telling a customer that there is nothing more I can do because they didn't meet the requirements Per City. The most enjoyable thing is seeing a Happy customer that doesn't have to worry about anything after speaking with me."
good,Loved working with the people and staff. I learned a lot and worked with a lot of different attitudes.
good,Job duties and task are a breeze. The management likes to hire and stab you in the back just to do it. Makes no sense but they are cut throat people. Officers talk about other officers non stop and just drama drama. However come here to yourself youll love it
good,"The hours are long, the pay is fair, but don't expect to get a good quality of life at home. The job is a good job, but you end up with more overtime than you'd like. If you don't have a good foundation with your partner at home this job will take it's toll."
good,A typical work day is normal our busiest days are on Mondays and at beginning of the month.  I love the customers and I love my job. I look forward to talking to my customers everyday.
good,Great place to work. HR department is underpaid.  Promotions are only made one a year. Great benefit and great hours to work.  Off every other Friday.
good,"Anyone that has worked at a call center knows exaclty what Im talking about. Nothing new,  same old stuff.  Youve worked one you've worked em all."
good,"Overall the job is easy for the money that you can make.  You receive firearm training and have to pass multiple tests.  The schedule is based on a rotating two week period.  Theoretically, you’ll work half the year and have half off.  But with the overtime, it seems like you hardly get any time off.  When we are short-staffed, you can be working 60-72 hours a week."
good,"Entergy was a very fast paced, safety conscious company.  The technology was very good and up to date.  The company was very diverse and after storm support is excellent."
good,"Entergy was a very fast paced, safety conscious company.  The technology was very good and up to date.  The company was very diverse and after storm support is excellent."
good,"A good company, wish they were not closing the plant. due to age and other considerations. I have enjoyed working there and the professionalism has been great and supportive."
good,"Great job and benefits and felt I was secure to retire until layoffs.  Great health insurance. Pay wasn't much to complain about.  Advancement within the department was difficult. Overall, I was happy"
good,"Entergy is a great company to work for. I am very grateful for the opportunity. Unfortunately it does not provide services in the Dallas area, and that's where I chose to reside."
good,"Good company to work for as a contract manager...."
good,"The most stressful aspect of the job is the customer base. The calls can be hard to deal with and the employees can be cady. However, there is opportunity for advancement.The project manager and the TRC Staffing personnel go above and beyond to make the work experience helpful and stress-free. If you can keep to yourself and handle the calls, Entergy is a good place to work. There are plenty of opportunities to make more money and advance within the company."
good,Fast paced environment that requires top safety at all times. Can be a very competitive job compared to other companies in the same business. I would recommend to everyone.
good,"very productive and calm place to work, every one is very friendly and help. There is really nothing to complain about. The work load is never to much or to little, very steady."
good,"Typical day was the same as any other. Wake up at 6 get to the office for 7, get handheld, start route, read meters until 3 then return to the office. hardest part is dealing with dogs, locked gates, and extreme heat as well as wasps and very long walking distances. Co-workers and management made up for the bad parts of the job, made you feel like you were part of a small family."
good,Good company to start out with.  Company has a strong historical background within the region with good benefits.
good,Very regulated work environment. Must be able to work with other departments to complete tasks. Satisfying once tasks were completed.
good,"its an ok place to work, not much goes on but taking calls and laughing at customers who try to get over on the system. sometimes it is nerve wrecking but pay is shi*y, and you got paid weekly."
good,"Customer account billing"
good,"Excellent place to work.  "
good,"They treat their employees fairly. The nuclear industry has a ton of regulations which makes getting work done difficult sometimes.  However, these regulations are necessary.  "
good,This was a very interesting job. The work was easy. Learned alot about the power company buisness
good,I worked as an engineering intern for a summer. I shadowed electrical and mechanical engineers in their day-to-day routines. I was also assigned individual projects to complete by certain deadlines. I enjoyed the work environment and the challenges that came with working in a large power plant.
good,"The hardest part of the job is the hours. 12 hours a day is a long work day plus travel time. The rewarding end of that is the pay, health insurance, and 401K."
good,"Fortune 500 company based in New Orleans, LA. It is a great place to work with excellent benefits. Very nice people work here."
good,Enjoyed working here. Great people but lacking in creating a diverse and inclusive culture. Overall I enjoyed my time with this company and learned a lot.
good,"Entergy contracts most of it's work. Generally work and objectives change frequently. Most are are frequently overworked due to changing priorities. Decisions arbitrary with little discussion, often not planned or well thought out for long term consequences,"
good,I liked working there but after 15 years I saw I reached the ceiling of where I could go in the company. Looking for new challenges. Would love to more electrical work but not so much line work
good,"Loved my job at Entergy. Management is very poor. Work was good and the pay was more than fair. I never intended on leaving my job, but due to a manager dislike for me on a personal level, I was unable to keep my job."
good,The is easy once you've been trained. Managers are understanding and helpful. Each work day goes by fast. Everyday I learn something new.
good,"I liked working here, but it became stressful trying to juggle work and family due to long hours. They offered great benefits and tried to keep the moral up most of the time."
good, I am a team player and hard worker and dedicated. A day at work is fast track and very busy. Overall it is a great work enivorment. Enjoy commuincating with the customers.
good,I worked at this site for only 4-5 weeks.  The work site itself was okay to work at.  The project I was assigned to had some technical problems and it was decided to put the project on hold until those problems could be solved.  I was not called back after the project resumed.
good,very stressful but rewarding. you are required to work on weekends and holidays depending on plant conditions. Although this is sometimes a real inconvenience for families the appreciation for the work is openly displayed by senior management.
good,My department was Highly dysfunctional led by a selfish vindictive individual who would gladly cut your knees out to make himself look good.  I think other aspects of the company are great but the recruiting area is not a professional organization and needs to be better reigned in.
good,"Challenging and productive workday with competent coworkers that often step up to cover the workload."
good,"Productive workplace, ok benefits, great co-workers, needs better work-life balance. Workplace culture is ok, the hardest part of the job is to navigate office politics."
good,"Great place to work. The people are generally friendly and seem to enjoy their jobs. However, there are some, as with every place, that seem to dislike their jobs. I’ve found management to have a genuine care for all Personnel with a strong emphasis on family first. They understand that you have to have your family life in good order in order to be productive at work."
good,"Compensation-wise, it is a good place to work. Management and organization not so good. I am a contractor so I don't know much about the path to promotion."
good,You will be stressed at times but the compensation vs cost of living is better than anywhere I have been.  Th leadership tend to make very questionable decisions
good,"Developed my analytical skills, but they need to move forward in the times. Very old school place to work. Salaried position, but required to clock in and out, as well as always be in the office even though my entire job can be done from anywhere with an internet connection. This company has excellent benefits."
good,Entergy Nuclear is a good place to work.  Good job security and good benefits.  Not so good with proper staffing levels and work life balance.  The culture ranges at each of the nuclear facilities.  But a general grade is that the cultures are pretty good.  Waterford 3 is probably the best overall culture among the southern nuclear fleet plants.
good,"The schedule is 4 10's"
good,Working long hours and on call 24/7. Company does have really food pay and benefits. One of the worst thing is having to work out of town on storms. But you make really hood money on storm breaks.
good,This company has a great work atmosphere and and a undeniable desire to have the most well trained employees in the industry. You will work 12 rotating shift schedules with 2 weeks payed time off.
good,"Liked to work there . I work remotely there. "
good,"good up until recently, new management shaking things up (spring 2016), moved my (and many others) job to woodlands, I won't/can't relocate...you know the story."
good,"Entergy Vermont Yankee is a great place to work, at least until it gets fully decommissioned. Middle management was great at being professional but still courteous towards union employees."
good,The work experience was nice I meet a lot of different and diverse people. The educational part as far as training was right in line with our work task. my daily task included monitoring people and the overall property of the client.
good,"Co-workers seem more like family in this type of work place as we are together in what can be stressful environments for extended periods of time. "
good,"I loved my job at Entergy it was the job I always wanted from the first time I stared working at Entergy in the customer service department. Every day was different, I worked outside, under little managment. Very good pay. The hardest part of my job was when they did away with my department"
good,"Overcoming stigmas of nuclear energy was an exciting challenge. Although always on defensive from the public perspective, the internal professionals are very intelligent, capable and devoted to the industry."
good,"I was responsible for implementing straggles to recruit and retain employee volunteers and track and report the results. I was responsible for increasing the program's visibility and annually travelled across the country to make presentations to employees and retirees. I also planned and coordinated numerous group volunteer activities ranging from food drives to rebuilding homes and playgrounds to tree planting and coastal restoration. I also managed the volunteer data base and was responsible for keeping the Community Connectors Web site up-to-date. One of my biggest successes was the initiation of a Systemwide Earth Day promotion in which employees were encouraged to ""Green their Ride"" by utilizing alternate means of transportation during Earth week. Due to traveling, the hardest part of my job was organizing my schedule to ensure everything was where it needed to be. Our team of six did an amazing job working together, we all wore many hats. I truly liked the alternate Fridays program, which was an enjoyable part of the job."
good,The company pays well and has good benefits. Challenged by closing plants in the northeast due to economics.  The regulatory environment keeps workers under a microscope which can be challenging.
good,"For an intern, there was a lot expected of us, but then the compensation was also above average for an internship position.  Overall a positive experience, though more guidance from a mentor would have been nice."
good,"Entergy provides a challenging work environment.  Due to the nature of the work long hours along with nights weekends and holiday work is required,  On call for emergency response."
good,The benefits and opportunities available are vast. Difficult to maintain personal life with all the overtime. Great pay. The people of Entergy will be difficult to leave as I have developed many lifelong friendships.
good,"Too much work, less engineers to handle. Due to work load, extended unpaid working condition. "
good,"Workers are dedicated to the professionalism of nuclear power, where safety is promoted before profits. Integrity is the most important commodity to have."
good,Great company and some of the best people I have worked with in the electric utility industry. The wages were mediocre which is the one and only reason why I left. Management was great to work with
good,"Entergy is a great company to work for. There are employees that have been around for 30+ years. Entergy is very slow at modernazation and keeping up with the changing environment. Entergy is regulated by the Louisiana Public Service Commission, so any changes in business has to be approved by the PSC. Being a regulated company makes it difficult to keep up with a changing market."
good,"I worked as a temporary employee at Entergy through another company which I can not remember the name.  I did enjoy the work.  It was mostly computer entry and formulas for correcting billing errors.  I occasionally spoke with customers who felt their meter had not been read or some other complaint and their bill was incorrect.  I was one of the people who would check on and correct any errors in billing.  I also counseled the customer on ways of making sure they could control their electric bill by either accessing free government plans for evaluating and correcting the electric guzzlers in their homes or getting on level billing program.  I would have sheets provided by my head of department to work through the errors and correct them using Entergy's programs, then I would file the sheets.  I filed customer account files and shredded anything that needed to be shredded rather than saved.  I loved the hours and my little cubicle which I was allowed to decorate.  I got along with everyone and loved learning new things when classes were provided.  I would still be there if they had not had a reduction of force.  They loved my work and tried to keep me full time."
good,"Typical day was monitoring and updating project schedules."
good,Very fast paced with Call Center Production Demands. Very high turnover with customer service representatives. Can be stressful during the Hurricane season.
good,"I mostly enjoyed this job, but after 13 years, I was ready for a change. This is when I resigned and went to grad school at LSU; one of the biggest mistakes of my life."
good,"Entergy is a good company to work for,  with ample opportunities to advance and succeed. The aren't irrational and can be met as long as you do what you are supposed to be doing."
good,"Really cool place to work with supportive management. Really teaches you how to grow and develop into a leader. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work alongside my colleagues and learn from them. There was a lot of variety in what i did each day, ranging from converting legacy relay setting into the newly developed database to wiring and setting up real-time simulators."
good,This was by far the best benefits I've had from an employer. Meeting new people everyday and driving was the best part of the job. I learned about the hazards of electricity and to respect it at all times. I was constantly thinking about the safety of others and myself. Everybody has a good reason to come home alive and in one piece. I thoroughly enjoyed  problem solving and satisfying customers. The hardest part of the job was the fear of dog bites and explosions from lightning and electricity.
good,"Typical day starts at 8 a.m and proceeds to 5p.m with possible over time. I've learned quite a bit, however, the process and software implemented needs upgrading.  I love the shift because I can still spend tie with my kids."
good,The company offers many opportunities and rewarding challenges for professional growth.
good,I want to stay in the industry because I like what I do. I moved here to take this job from S.C. My fathers health is failing and I am ready to come back home.
good,"- A typical day at the office is managing hardware and software change requests supporting over 100 users across multiple business units to ensure proper change management process followed along with regulatory compliance requirements. Some days include training consultants and employees new to the organization while others include hosting change evaluation and advisory meetings and change reporting and trend analysis."
good,"I spent almost 20 years at ENTERGY Corporate in an extremely stimulating atmosphere. In 1999, my job as Manager,Retail Planning moved to New Orleans. I wasn't able to go. Instead I transferred to Distribution at Entergy, where I remained until 2005. I was responsible for asset planning in a network of more than 89,000. I gained a great deal from working at Entergy especially because I had the opportunity to work on several different and challenging areas."
good,This was the first call center job that I ever worked for. This job really showed me the importance of customer service. I had never answered so many calls in one day. I learned how to show empathy where its needed. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help everyone.
good,"Operations in the nuclear industry is of the highest level of professionalism. This comes with a lot of pro's and con's. The stress on perfection brings out the best and worst of management. The compensation is commensurate with this, but I can't say this industry is for everyone."
good,Offered challenging projects and room for advancement. Salaries are in line with positions and bonus incentives were given. Given autonomy to make decisions regarding prioritizing work load.
good,Great choice for a career. They have no problem being the start of someones career which it not seen very often. They have a great training program and great benefits.
good,A procedural driven company that expects and demands accuracy in the work performed because it is a nuclear power plant and errors are taken very seriously.
good,"Great pay, hard if you want a lot of time with family. Works rotating 12 hour shift so be prepared for long days and nights. Jobs aren't difficult, many procedures for everything you do."
good,"Good safety culture, good location, room for advancement, fair pay, gym, diverse, challenging. Plenty of paid time off, great benefits. Solid training program for all crafts. Good inter-departmental integration."
good,"It was ok"

good,"Working at Entergy was a great experience for me.  I enjoyed the people, and the atmosphere.  The way it was structured was great."
good,"Working with Entergy was a great experience for me. Very professional folks. Good working culture. I'd gladly work on a project with them again. My work was mainly in the Woodlands, TX, but did spend some time at the New Orleans HQ. Both locations were comfortable and attractive places to work."
good,"Working at Entergy making lots of money, working lots of overtime. But with that you spend few hours at home.  The job is not physically demanding, but there are always tests and qualifications that must be met throughout the year, every year"
good,"Good people to work with. Compensation is in top bracket when compare with like utility company. Avenue to grow is limited but if you are the type that love doing the same thing for a long period of time, there is a job security."
good,"Entergy is a professional organization that strives to be efficient, work in a safe environment while trying to allow its' employees to have a balance life."
good,"Entergy provides opportunities to advance within the company.   I have been here for almost 24 years and have been given the opportunity to expand my knowledge in the fields of Nuclear Operations, Licensing and Facility Maintenance."
good,"I had very close working relationships with all the people I worked with.  I was able to learn a lot of technical skills, and it was a very flexible environment.  We had fun working."

good,This was a great job that included good work schedule as well as good management.
good,"Entergy is a great employer, the nuclear industry is complicated and unique and Entergy is a leader in all aspects of the industry."
good,"Working in a regulated field is demanding, requiring a great deal of applied knowledge on a daily basis.  The pay and benefits are very good.  Coworkers, even between departments, are generally concerned for each other's work success and welfare.  Least enjoyable part of the job is call ins on the weekend.  The most enjoyable part of the job is recognizing that the work being performed is benefiting the station."
good,"A typical day at work considers morning staff meeting, area prep readiness, and daily paper work. Throughout the day the team members correspond with one another to ensure safety of plant operations."
good,"I worked at Entergy full-time for more than 4 years."
good,Provided competitive salary and management support.  Nuclear power division can be stressful but is well managed to provide employees with support (ie: nuclear concerns program).
good,"Everyone wants you to succeed. The company provides you with lots of training. The company takes nuclear power very serious, each task they complete they do with it with full integrity"
good,"It was a good place to work i got to work with my husband and i bet some awesome people, But the manager at the time didn't know what he was doing! He always gave himself all the good jobs, The pay pay sucked it was by meter and if you didn't know the job you didn't make the money!"
good,"It is a nice company. I work at Entergy as a consultant that includes fast pace deliverables, coordination between different consulting companies and vendors."
good,"I was a contract consultant and was compensated well for the work performed. Had good communications with the management personnel I dealt with. Had to insure projects met deadlines and were accurate. As a consultant, loved the freedom to work at my own pace, but insure all projects were ahead of schedule, so management could review before submittal."
good,Served as an Electrical Engineer for 3 years.  The hours are full of opportunity to learn about Nuclear protocol activities.  The plant is in a remote location which is good for overall safety to the community.
good,a good job to work  at. would help the customers  with question of the bills and being a bilingal speak spanish. and english also get payments cash handling
good,Was a great place to start my plant experience at. Great management & atmosphere. Leaves much to be desired in the form of culture. Makes a point to bring up safety everyday.

good,great company providing a needed service and product to the community.  Energy drives our economy and Entergy is a leader in the field of energy.  Great people
good,Worked in plants as risk engineer.  Also worked as a line design engineer.  Great company to work for. Built lots of great relationships.  Loved the gym at the corporate office.
good,I enjoyed working for Entergy. what i didn't like was the frequent hire and fire routines. Staff was pretty friendly in begginning. It was an experience.
good,Organization was very appreciative of the assistance that it received from it's independent consultants.  Most of the management staff had been displaced from their homes in New Orleans.
good,"Great place to work great benefits long days of work. Hardest part advising customer no more time can be granted on bills. We had good and bad mangements, diverse culture"
good,Continued to maintain a strong focus on invoice processing and approvals while meeting critical deadlines in a timely manner. Demonstrated commitment to customer demands and service.
good,"Great company to work excellent, excellent, experience , excellent, experience, excellent, experience, excellence. Wow, , Wonderful, spectacular, special"

Directed procurement for capital projects, maintenance, and operating materials and supplies. Estimated annual savings were $40 - 45 million. Led the chemical and industrial gases program, which addressed needs of 35 plants resulting in a performance based contract, saving $8 million annually"
good,"I learned a lot working at Entergy. Loved being the team player and taking leads on various projects. Worked as a contractor, so there were no benefits and had to live away from the family. That was a bit too much for me."
good,The compensation was great here.  It could be difficult to have a good work life balance though with being on call so much.  Still a great company to work for with plenty of opportunities for advancement.  Company pays for school if you choose to go back to school too.
good,Great place to work for! Benefits are great. The employees and managers are great. No complaints about the company so far. Opportunity for growth is really hard though.
good,Its been so long that I worked here i cannot really remember what the work place was like. It was before Katrina and I know we weren't really busy at that time.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of taking turns on and off duty within the plant. The company is very focused on employee and community safety, it always comes first. The management was typically very knowledgeable and easy to work for. The hardest part about the job was the shift work and the long weeks due to the outage."
good,"Entergy is a large utility that provides electric energy needs to the mid-south and north-east.  As part of their diversified generation strategy, Entergy operates a large fleet of nuclear power plants that have a history of solid and profitable performance.  I re-joined Entergy in 2014 after a rewarding 23 year career at Exelon.  Prior to Exelon, I was with Entergy as a maintenance electrician.  I joined Exelon as a maintenance electrician and spent 23 years there developing my knowledge and skills.  I subsequently rose to the supervisory level and decided to return to Entergy where there was a need for my supervisory skills.  I currently supervise an in-house crew of over 20 skilled electrical technicians in daily nuclear power plant maintenance activities.  There are multiple engineering and safety requirements that must be met in each activity and I ensure that my direct reports are meeting all of the associated challenges.  All personnel in the organization are highly skilled and dedicated to safe and reliable power production.  I currently have a dedicated and caring superintendent that I report to, who also recently joined Entergy, from Exelon.  "

good,"Excellent co-workers and managers. Learned extensive technical skills. Enjoyed working with call center analytics and performance metrics.  The hardest part of the job was extended 14 hour days during storms.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with all types of people from management, call center reps, to customers."
good,"Sadly this power plant is set to shut down after this operating cycle, but it's been a great place to work."
good,"Relaxing the best company I ever worked for.  I hate I left "
good,1994 - 2009 was not River Bend. River Bend was outage only lasting just a little over a month in 2013 Feb./ March
good,Entergy is a wonderful company to work for. There are many ways to advance.

Relaxed atmosphere. Nice working environment. Field office had casual work attire, but clean, not sloppy appearance. Safety #1."

good,"Entergy can really be a great place to work for if you enjoy what you are working on. I have been lucky enough to find projects that interest me and Entergy allows me the resources and flexibility I need to excel at my job. The work/life balance is great in my department and we really have managers that see you as people, rather than just workers. "
good,"When the call volume is high you will constantly receive calls and when the call volume is low you will receive a break in between calls.   There is a lot to learn about the job and you learn something new on a daily basis.  Once you learn the job, you can do with easily.  The pay should be based on the amount of skills you know and the minimum pay per hour should be $15."
good,"Overall, Entergy is a great place to work.  The people are friendly, caring and professional, and management understands the importance of work/life balance."
good,"At Entergy, delivering safe, reliable power is the essential goals in all phases of the company.  Employees put forth immense time and effort to ensure customers and stakeholders are properly satisfied in all facets of Entergy's daily services."

good,"great work place,good benefit,learn about customer relation,company rules."

good,I enjoyed working at Entergy. I Retired in 2015. I wish I would have worked longer. Sometimes the hours were long due to Storms or Hurricanes but Entergy is an Electric Company.
good,Go and see for yourself. There are pros and cons for every job. You are going to work long hours and spend time away from your family. The benefit in this situation you will see when you check your pay stub. The work itself is not very physically demanding. Which means there is a lot of down time. It can become difficult to fight the boredom. Once again if you take into consideration the amount of money you are making for the kind of work you are doing the job has its advantages

good,It is a very fast paced environment. It can at times be very stressful. I would say the hardest part of the job is the constant multitasking of critical information.

good,Great pay for the kind of person that likes to work with their hands and doesn't mind overtime.  work/life balance does become challenging due to the shiftwork.
good,"I highly recommend this company to anyone. The surrounding environment is fun but serious. Coworkers are amazing and willing to lend a hand when needed, and the managers/supervisors are always there for support. The hardest part of the job in Customer Service Rep/Call Center is getting an angry customer on the  phone due to no services at their location due to non payment or storms. They can be very hostile/angry/rude but you can not take it personally."
good,Great place to work. Company provides lots of training. Company culture is one that allows the employee to advance at their own pace and rewards dedication and loyalty.
good,"Peaceful and quite with a GREAT safety attitude.  Dinners provided weekly for the workers, proving a safe work week.  Complex rigging schemes verified prior to each lift."
good,Multi-tasking was a daily challenge. As the job changed various skill training was accomplished. Management and co-workers were supportive and became like family. The hardest part of the job was the challenge of prioritizing work to accomplish work assignments. The most enjoyable part of the job was making new acquaintenances and learning new skills.
good,"Great hours to work, management, laid back environment, great benefits as well."
good,"Working here was great until we got a new supervisor. We had two shifts in the dispatching area that i was in, 5-1:30 and then 11 - 8. The 5 am shift would come in and load the trucks with work orders to fulfill there 8 hour day and adjust work as needed. The 11 shift would come in and take some of the morning shift areas and monitor trucks and then take over everything else at 1:30."
good,"Overall it was a great work environment, It was very demanding of your time any outage in the coverage states could extend your workday without warning."
good,"None to provide at this time, only filling out this section because it is mandatory in order to complete the rest of my profile. Have a nice day!!!!!!"
good,"It's an 8 hour day, there are times when it's very busy with 30 minute lunches . You meet great people. The hardest part is staying on the phone  and are given time for breaks and lunches."

good,Great environment with awesome benefits and room for growth in certain departments only.
good,"Learned to operate as a team and drive for good results to meet the goals and measurements of the department. The most enjoyable part of the job is where we assisted one another who may have been weak in areas of performance and it was done out of our of care and concern. Another enjoyable part of the job was that the work schedule was flexible. We were allowed to give feedback to improve or increase the departments goals. We operated in a friendly, family like environment. We were allowed to work independently but always kept in mind the importance of customer service, customer requests and customer satisfaction. Along with that, we were mindful of the compliance to the company's policies and procedures."
good,"Honestly, Entergy was the best company I've worked for hands down. They have a great moral compass, with a customer-oriented mission. As much as the consumers are valued, so are the employees. Entergy really and genuinely invests in its employees, which is rare to come by. Or its been rare to come by for me at least."
good,"Entergy is an amazing place to work! Employees are treated so well! I started with 3 weeks paid vacation and 1 week of sick pay, several holidays, paid volunteer time, amazing benefits and incomparable pay! There are endless opportunities to advance within the company and they offer tuition reimbursement. They are also very involved in the communities where they operate and donate a lot of time and money. Very flexible schedules offering a great work-life balance. I've seriously never been happier at a job! :) My only con would be that they have a very lengthy hiring process and it can take months to get started in your new job."
good,I started as a secretary with Entergy and have advanced in my career through Educational and Development Opportunities.  I would highly recommend working for this company
good,"I’ve been working here for about a year and a half and I absolutely love it. I make a very good salary for my age. The environment is laid back but professional. The managers aren’t micro managing but they are always there when you need them.  We have great events such as potlucks, catered breakfast and lunch , paid trips, and just an overall good vibe. You are able to express concerns without judgment and they are constantly pushing for career advancement. The quarterly incentives are nice as well as our yearly bonus! Can see myself here for a long time. Thanks Entergy!"
good,We had fun doing our work. We got our work done in time and on time but we enjoyed each others company. We would open mail and send it to the correct place that it needed to be in. Some days were longer than others.

good,Company is very organized and well run.  Positions with company are fairly secure.  Company had a clear vision. Expectations were well defined.  Benefits were very good.
good,"When I got hired and went through the orientation, I felt like I was being screened to join Starfleet. They weren't JUST interested in what you can do now, they wanted to know what all CAN you do or be trained up to do even as far as being the next head of the company. Whatever your best is they would like you to develop it to the highest level attainable. TALK ABOUT MOTIVATING ! ! ! !  Then reality sets in as you come to realize that it is not cream rising to the top around you."
good,Entergy is very professional and a great company to work for.  The employees are treated fairly and the benefits are great.

good,"Entergy is a great company to work for. The benefits are great. A spirit of team player is always encouraged. Managers work with you. Diversity and inclusion are promoted. Safety is enforced in a big way.The company does what it preaches. Pay is great. In some parts of the company overtime is necessary which I wasn't so big on. Also, if there's a  threat of hurricanes and storms local or out of state some people may have to be with the company instead of family during that time which is undesirable. Some of it is understandable. Comes with the business. As does downsizing. I enjoyed helping our customers. The company trains you well."

good,"Nuclear is unique and builds a strong professional character.  I started in IS/IT with the computer group.  Quickly I was moved to I&C due to the computing being outsourced.  I was thoroughly trained in instrumentation to compliment my strong electronic base.  I was also trained in protective relaying.  My largest contribution was in the Met (calibration) lab where five of us were educated over a 3  year period in classroom theory 2 days a week and 2 days in the lab reinforcing our theory by a very special educator that had been contracted to certify us as Metrologists.  Metrology (science of measurement) is a school of engineering now and currently has a degree offered however at the time there was none.  Mainly metrology was a military function and primarily structured to maintain  the test equipment integrity when calibrating lab equipment (PMEL).  We maintained all the test equipment used in the plant as well as supporting sister nuclear plants needs with their test equipment.  We consulted with all the maintenance shops, station engineers and anyone utilizing test equipment.  Test design, setups and field troubleshooting when testing was challenging.  I maintained our databases, created tests, procedure writing and performing critical evaluation of test results to insure accuracy, consistency and reproducability.  We were a high end quality assurance for our plants culture.  The last 10 years I ran the main control room simulator where all the operators were trained, evaluated and federally certified by some of the most knowledgeable senior operators I have had the opportunity"
