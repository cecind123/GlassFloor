good,a very easy going job the only part that gets rough is the cleaning up. management is very good also. the co-workers act like a family.
good,"Working at APAC was exciting, there was so many people that called and so many different personalities. I learned a lot about computers, my co-workers were amazing and I learned a lot from them also. the hardest part of the job was sitting, I like to be doing something at all times, moving around. but I did enjoy helping the customers and making sure they were happy with their product."
good,"It is a fun fast paced environment. I enjoy that there is always work to be done. There is opportunity for advancement, although I feel that it doesn't happen frequently."
good,"I would work in cashiering and interact with the customers was enjoyable. "
good,"easy work"
good,They are always welling to help college students so far as hours and work scheduling. The hardest part of the job was sometimes being to  busy to finish all the stocking assignments before time to leave.
good,i liked to work here because it was fun but also challenging to learn new things and perfect them on a daily basis.the managers and employees are all nice and give good direction to everything
good,"a typical day at work is typically typical, just like other stores. environment is clean, and organized. managers are friendly.co workers are good. like a school you learn how to give a true customer service."
good,"To be honest...it all depends on the manager as I've had 3 different managers working as a stock associate for almost two years(recently left) the first manager wasn't really well organized so the job was a bit more tough, the last two managers made me enjoy working for this company :) as well as the coworkers! They do make you feel like family, the pay was good... except if you're paying your own bills...you might want to look for a second job as my checks didn't come out too big(sometimes)..and at times trucks were cancelled. You get the weekends off so that was always fun!"
good,"Fast paced work environment. Management is helpful and caring of employee's needs. Flexible work scheduled, amazing co-workers. Only down side is your base wage of $7.50 per hr."
good,All staff and managers were friendly and professional. store atmosphere very productive and rewarding. Enjoyed staff and trainig very thorough and friendly staff.
good,"A typical day at work involved me clocking in, going to the fitting room and assisting customers, along with organizing clothes on racks. My managers were all very kind and helpful. My co-workers were pretty nice and helpful as well. They only hard part of job was when my lines would get really backed up in the fitting room and I would be the only worker there. The best part of my job was being in a friendly atmosphere and being around friendly people."
good,"•Completed daily operations of store opening and closing "
good,"Great experience working with coworkers, you make great friends with even managers. It is always a great day and time goes by fast. I just wish they gave more hours."
good,"Ross was a good part time job, they can't give you more than 25 hours a week though.  I did a multitude of jobs, stock room was the best even though you had to be up early."
good,"In retail sales the daily duties are pretty normal, stocking customers, cash register, etc. Although the customers and staff moods, as well as behaviors vary. This has been for the most part a good learning experience for me. We as a whole staff were supportive of each other, even when we had a rough experience or day."
good,I learned a lot from management. They taught me advanced excel skills. The company is flexible. They hire within the company.
good,"return items answer phones smile and say hi give directions learning new things and meeting a lot of people, ad co workers."
good,They treat there employees very fair and with respect. It was a great learning experience.
good,"Open boxes, stocked store,cashier, and markdowns the hardest part was recovering store.The most enjoyable part was learning new things."
good,"I worked part- time and loved working for Ross, I only left because I moved to Spokane Wa. The managers are nice and easy to approach with concerns, all of my co- workers were hard working and dedicated to doing an excellent job. The hardest part of the job was not taking it personal if you I had an angry customer. The most enjoyable was working with management and my co- workers."
good,Enjoyed my time at the Burlington Ross. Transferred to the Bellingham Ross and was disappointed at the horrible management.
good,while working here there was never a down moment. there was always something to do or something to be trained on. We as employees had to maintain a clean and safe sales floor so the customers can shop in comfort. The employees maintained a smile and are polite and always willing to help.
good,I loved dealing with the peopl. Its a great expiernce. I love the job.
good,"My typical day at ross was usually spent at my register until we closed, that's when I would run baskets. Which was putting back returns and items costumers decided not to buy. I learned how to handle large amounts of money. Ross didn't get a main manager until I stopped working there but the assistant managers did a good job of running the store. My co-workers were great people and we all got along well. I didn't find anything hard about working there. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help people and meeting new people"
good,"It's a fast paced environment, so learning how to deal with the public and company culture has been a great experience. It was a seasonal job, but I learned so much about costumer services as well as maintained knowledge of current sales and promotions, policies regarding payment and exchanges, and security practices."
good,"My managers are really great, always willing to work with my schedule and answer any questions I have. I like the people I work with cause its more like a family. The hardest part is dealing with unruly customers."
good,"I work on the cash register all most all the time.  We sometimes have to deal with very long lines, but we are a great team so we work fast together to get the line down fast."
good,"After two years of working for Ross, I've come to the conclusion that it is a very fast paced job that requires each employee to give their all  in order to receive all that they can. Management was especially helpful in the everyday life of each employee."
good,"Three years retail experience as a Front End Supervisor. Responsibilities included Customer Service, scheduling, returns, store displays & money handling. Successfully worked in both team environments as well as independently. It gets really busy during the holidays, but overall not so bad."
good,"On a normal work day, I would do cash office duties. I would get the store prepared for the workday. The rest of the work day consist of customer service relations, from fitting room attendant to sales floor. One day a week I complete markdowns. The most enjoyable part of this job is working with numbers and customers. My co-worker are friendly and work as a team. There is nothing hard about this job."
good,"busy busy busy, it never stops in that store. keeping an eye out for detail & organization are the key skills i mainly used for working here along with being able to interact with coworkers & customers in the best manor with excellent people skills. this job isn't hard at all, you just gotta work hard."
good,A typical day at work consisted of entering documents information regarding to internal and external activities. I learned that you could never underestimate anyone. All MOD'S have an open door policy . Co- workers all work together as one unit. the hardest part of the job theirs always room for improvement. the most enjoyable part of the job is the friendly employees atmosphere.
good,"Management is nice and they listen to any problems and help to fix them, co-workers were nice and helpful, good hours, but they don't help or tell you how to advance to a better position."
good,Management was awesome they worked with you and try to help you with your weak points. The hardest part of my job was trying not to get stuck with the needle gun. My job was to put price tags on clothing or any items that we got.
good,"- Looked over the Front desk, including constant surveillance, multiple phone lines."
good,One day we was missing like 5 peoples and it was almost 300 hundreds boxes so we the amount of people we have left we decided to work as a team to make the job done we even stay an hour late to finish.
good,I had only worked there for a few weeks in payroll.. the employees were nice and fun to work with.
good,"My overall experience with ROSS was a positive one, I had no problems with the work or the management."
good,I really enjoyed working at Ross. The staff is friendly. I had a week to practice before they let me be on my own which was enough to make me feel comfortable.
good,very great place to work and great brands to explore. The customers are always nice and so are the employees. Everyone works together to make the experience and job worth while
good,"I  liked working at ROSS, its a fast paced environment in stock room.  Sales floor and stockroom provide great customer service and assistance.  Great shopping store to find great treasures.  Always new items coming in not a boring shopping experience.  Opportunity to cross train in all areas."
good,Worked here  3 years left due to my health issues loved this job started doing stock learn a little bit off eveverthing from stock to cashier very good work place if your a hard worked u can move up and inprove for better money and hours very good work place
good,"At Ross, they are always open to showing you new positions. They love to cross train people so that all the employees are capable and have training for any position."
good,"I've worked at Ross for a long time and I still appreciate it, but if you show incredible skill at something that you don't want to do, you'll be stuck there for a long time. I've been in the fitting room for years due to being the only person with any demonstrated competency, and other new employees tend to downplay their understanding or act like they're not good at it to get out of it, leaving me with their workload. Customers are generally energetic and polite, though as with any retail store, they can have their bad days. The team is very strong, though, I feel like anyone here can lean on anyone else, and the management may be pushed down by corporate expectations, but they generally do what they can to make sure this is a very good place to work. My only critique is that variety is the spice of life, and if you're too content to work someone in the same part of the store without any hope for advancement, you're typically giving them a dead-end job and hoping that they don't look for greener pastures elsewhere."
good,"Most people are hired as part time so you usually work a four hour shift. They always give employees 15 minute breaks and if you work more than five hours you receive a meal break. "
good,"It's very busy, I am always anticipating the needs for my customers as well as balancing time to put out products received in stock room. My coworkers and I work together to get everything done, supervisors are always available when needed."
good,"I am a chemist by profession, with an MBA degree. Working at Ross was a way to help our family learn about the area and bring home a little extra cash."
good,"Great environment, great people to work with. Positivity is huge here. The rush hour can get hectic, but it’s expected. I would recommend applying to this company to anyone."
good,"Only hired seasonal and needing fulltime employment . Great staff, great benefits for fulltime employees which unfortunately I'm am not. Just moved here from Texas as a real estate agent for 30 years."
good,This company is very busy and have to have a sense of urgency all the time. We keep busy and very friendly to all the customers to make sure we keep them all satisfied.
good,Ross is a good place of Work is a good environment to work at n pay is very reasonable. Is a sales associate job. Customer are friendly and respectful as well as employers.
good,IAM so grateful that Ross gave me an opportunity I appreciate it every bit of it.. management team was very thoughtful of there employees.. the atmosphere was very pleasant and fun!!.. they welcome me with open arms .. only thing I had an issue was hours not enough hours!!!!..the pay was nice $11 an HR..but it just seems like wasn't enough hours to go around..if they had enough hours I would be still at ross .
good,I arrived early in the morning. we had to unload the truck every day on a time limit. we also had to place the arriving I teams in the correct location
good,"it was nice to greet the customers"
good,"I highly recommend working stock team if you'd rather work with your hands than in customer service (not to imply that there is no civility in the stockroom). "
good,"Ross is a very understanding company, they make sure you’re okay! With Ross they make sure you’re taken care of, it’s easy to talk to the managers about problems you’re having."
good,"Usually work around 4-12 hrs/week"
good,"This place was nice to work at. My previous job (JCPenney) required high organized standards whereas Ross did not require high standards, leading to a messy store at the end of the day. Part of our job was to clean the mess left by customers, which would take almost 2 hours post-closing hours. Besides that, the employees were nice and Ross offers helpful benefits for full time employees."
good,"when I come in for work I clock in, go to my locker to get my watch, boxcutter, and name tag. I then either start running the opened boxes of stock we received or I start unboxing them.If I was running stock I had to write down on a sheet what department I was stocking and what time I started and finished. Management would tell you if your run time needs work or not and what to do to make your performance better. I will say the hardest part was nonexistent in my opinion. Everyone is so welcoming and helpful!"
good,"Was a previous manager, absolutely loved this place & all the people I worked with. Only time that was stressful was holidays, and when we had crazy customers. Overall it’s a very relaxed environment where you can be yourself."
good,"The managers are very professional, and appreciate all the employees the same. The only downside is, that it's very hard to get more than 20 hours weekly."
good,Management at Ross is very great they work as a team and always are willing to help whether it’s scheduling or just the communication management has always gone out of there way for its associates
good,While working at ross it was a good first actual job to have because I'd never worked an actual job besides family businesses. Showed me how to actully work with people I didnt know and just learning new skills as well.
good,At my specific location the management needs to be worked on and the organization has to be improved plus the bathrooms never worked.  Getting along with it’s cocwirkers is a huge plus and most staff is pleasing to be around. Overall they are the reason I been here.
good,"overall this job was great. i wouldn't say you could live off the pay unless you were the manager. they have great deals quarterly employee discount at %40 percent off, benefits for full time, and other employee aid as well as advancements. the real big issue is taking so much time having to organize the store after customers rudely ruin the store. being a discount store and having a non confrontational policy you can not tell a customer to politely hang, put back an item an will literally throw multiple clothing articles on the ground in front of your face. you will not see this issue at any other stores H&M, forever 21, American eagle etc. again i believe its mainly due to being a discount store and people value and respect it less thinking is a goodwill or yard sale. but great company."
good,Very comfortable environment. I absolutely loved my job and sometimes it was stressful because i was a problem solver in my position. But o honesty say i enjoyed working close with management.
good,"Never worked retail before, have learned very interesting things."
good,"Ross is a good place to work, however, their salaries is not as competitive in the market as other stores. The work culture and coworkers are great. Management is very supportive."
good,Great involvement to come round safe work place not great employees but mostly  respectful fairly pay but was a great  job to experience over all recommendations positive
good,The company was good I get to know a lot of the employees and picking up information from there how get things done and how to do it so I know for my self so I become better and enjoying the time with customer they love me for keeping there day good and always having smile on there faces when they leave from the company that gonna keep them coming backs
good,Loved working here. I learned so much from the company and my co-workers. I would have preferred a better schedule set up because they weren’t respecting my school Schedule.
good,I loved the job. The employees and managers were nice. Very diverse. Very friendly and positive environment. Helpful with new employees. Wonderful customer service.
good,"Very nice place to work managers very kind and understand your work hours . Coworker are kind , flexible shifts and hours . Love my position and experience there"
good,Very laid back environment. Good Management that works with you. Very collaborative team. Business causal. They have lots of regulations and rules but I don't mind them and think there fair. There particular about work uniforms and only accept solid blue. Everyday you work at Ross is very different they change up where you are often which always makes the days exciting and different.
good,"I enjoyed working for Ross during the short time I was there. If I hadnt decided to relocate to Oklahoma, I would have stayed there. I enjoyed my coworkers and my managers were awesome. The store was always busy and the way they handled the customers was efficient and fast."
good,"In this company I learned many objectives and one of the main one we focus on is customer service. Associates greet customers at all times even if you're on the register or on the sales floor. In a regular day each associate preforms a daily task called SET and the receive their assigned department to clean by the manager on duty. The hardest part about the job is trying to keep our store clean especially when it gets packed which are afternoons, weekends, and holidays. The most enjoyable part is working with well rounded co-workers who are respectful, and very helpful whenever you have questions."
good,"It’s a great placed to work for and you get super great discounts at this store , the holidays get super busy but it goes by so quick you don’t even noticed at time"
good,"Very fun place to work for part time. Great discount. The register is very easy to learn and use. There are opportunities to move up through the company by being promoted to an FES, and up from there. There are also opportunities for raises."
good,"•	Created and trended stores using historical information and current trend."
good,was great to work here... they work with your shedule. the job is enjoyable for the most part. it is great for students. i learned to work in a team environment.
good,"a mixture of diverse population. Young and old, people from different cultures are hired in this store. Staff treated each other as family and hours were flexible."
good,"it was a great first time job. managers were nice, customers were always testing your patience and if you work on holidays they buy you food so that was nice."
good,"Learned a lot. Great Job. Amazing people. "
good,"Love the customers, love the environment, love that I knew all the new trends and things customers like. Felt like a safe place and I love working there. Plus got a discount. Love that too."
good,Working for ross was a different experience than what I had been used to. Very much enjoyed the fast pace and always being busy. Was a very good environment to be in
good,"The staff and managers at Ross Dress for Less are all like a family. Everyone  friendly and helpful, and courteous of others, customer service is always the #1 priority"
good,While working with Ross I gain the tools I needed to further my career and Retail they had great Management training classes that I participated in they do go above and beyond for their Associates.
good,"re-stock items, cloths, run every item that was in boxes, "
good,"Excellent place to work. Training team is awesome, the management team is very attentive and always willing to help you when in need. Is a challenging work, but because of the perm employees make it worth it."
good,"Ross dress for less is a fun fast paced job, the store itself is great with amazing deals so it made it that much easier to work there. "
good,Working in stock you have to be on your feet. Constant sense of urgency. There is always stuff to do so you can work overtime. Working here has taught me to work quickly and efficiently.
good,Ross is a smooth sailing but fast paced place to work. the associates are all very kind-hearted individuals who are ready to drop what they are doing to help out a customer.
good,I loved working on holiday season because it's when you can really feel the love  and meet people of all walks of life. Plus you get discounts on all your gifts as well.
good,"really flexible with working hours, friendly co-workers, management is very understanding, i love working at Ross, i would definitely recommend it to anyone."
good,"Ross is a great place to work and the employees are team players, we have a great manager team and they are willing to help one another as a team.The hours are set on your avaliablity, it can be very busy at times, but you do get to meet new people from all parts of the world. and it can be very nice to hear some of the stories that they have being here in Vegas"
good,I loved everyone I worked with as well as the whole management team. The only thing I personally had a problem with was I never wanted to move up into management and they still tried starting me on that path. I know it's because they saw potential in me when I didn't see it but I was in a lead role at my previous job for 4 years and I didn't want to do it anymore.
good,"I absolutely love working there. The staffing and managers are wonderful, collaborative, and just make everyday go by fast. I learned a few things there so far, specifically how to manage stock more efficiently. The hardest part about the job is keeping consistent hours, because I'm new, depending on how much we sell, and what comes in on the truck. Meeting the companies standards is a challenge, but always fun. And the most enjoyable part of the job is getting everything done on time, and seeing all the happy customers walk in and out more than satisfied."
good,"Many people come to ROSS to find the latest deal, or taking advantage of the Senior Discount Day. My job was to help guide though that, and contrary to the 'last resort' store people may think ROSS is, I will always stan this company."
good,The company and management made sure you knew what each were doing and helped as much as they could. I was fortunate to have a good assistant manager.
good,Must know they are on top of how things are ran. And their big on getting the daily task completed. For the most part their kind and friendly people who make sure everybody leaves with a smile.
good,greet customers and help them . Help built new displays for every season and holidays. Put unwanted things back in there locations. Look out for people stealing
good,"Open boxes tag merchandise with alarms  put items on carts take out to floor, put in departments they go in. How to hard tag clothing, shoes and more items. I have prepped merchandise in the past. The management was helpful, the stock room was messy at times. I didn't find anything difficult in the work I did. The best part of the job was getting to learn new things and see the new items that was available."
good,"I approve of this store and the atmosphere."
good,it would be fast paced receiving the truck and processing as as well but you would get help. the supervisor should be understandable about everything and everyone.
good,"Overall great place to work, some managers are better than others but the discount is beyond beautiful, but there's plenty of employees so the work load is shared equally."
good,Ross dress for less is a great company to work for. The discount was awesome and the 40% was even better! My store manager was very nice and understanding but also wanted things done exactly to store policy.
good,"i was responsible for selling jewelry in the front and cashier and stocking, retail associate. its very fast paced environment , i learned to work under pressure especially when there is alot of costumers coming in and out of the store. The management at the time only cared about the clothes and items being restocked and organized. Furthermore,  the workplace culture was mostly high-end brands. The hardest part of the job was doing go backs and organizing all the items because not only there is so many costumers they are also misplacing things in different departments so every night we would organize and restock items before the end of the shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to help the costumers honestly because i get to build relationships with our costumers and i get to help them with what they need."
good,"I was working for ross as seasonal, defiantly would get back into the same field i enjoyed a lot. Learned a lot of new things met great people. hardest job was to make sure we had enough time to finish the shipment and to put it away."
good,"The management team is great to work, understanding, and very approachable. Co-workers are extremely friendly and great to work with. Schedules are extremely flexible."
good,"I'm a cashier, so a typical day at work just consists of me coming in, clocking in for my shift, going to my register, and doing all that I have to do. If there is no line, I'll be put on the sales floor. I have learned a lot so far dealing with the register, the Top 5, better brands within the company, what sells the most and what doesn't. I've learned about other jobs too like what the night stock people do and what the managers and supervisors do. The hardest part, for me, is I guess staying longer than what my hours actually are when I have class in the morning or when I'm scheduled at times I can't work. The most enjoyable is meeting new people every day, being recognized for my hard work, and the pay is good."
good,they cross train you quickly which in turn help you not get bored doing the same thing every day. fair with dividing working hours between employees. very fair with giving you requested time off.
good,"Clock in get straight to work"
good,It can be a fun place depending on the team your working with everyday. The only issue I have with my workplace is the area and issues with constant theft.
good,"I love Working for Ross, i've been working for them for at least 2 years i have had some advancements but i am currently looking for something Full-Time."
good,"Ross is a great company to work for, a company that appreciates its workers and gives many opportunities for advancement, especially with competitive hours."
good,unloading truck and processing as fast and correctly as you can. I've learned to manage my time wisely and to get along well with others. The hardest part of the job is meeting dead lines and trying to get everything process before the day ends.
good,"Ross is a good part time job if you need to find work, I enjoyed my time working for the company. Ross does offer full time employment to management but their motto is do everything for less which is true to their core because they only want employees working about 12-20 hrs per week which is really difficult to live on."
good,I enjoyed working around other kind people . I also learned a lot about costumer service and making the customer happy . I learned how to work around other people and be generous.
good,I enjoyed working there and was promoted to AS very quickly. My store is a family and we take care of one another and our customers. We compliment each other's strengths and weaknesses.
good,"Great Company to work for."
good,I  really liked working with the great staff and most customers.   I would recommend this job to anyone.  The only downside was black Friday..people were absolutely crazy that day.
good,It is a very fast pace work environment from the moment you begin you will be on your feet with short breaks. Making sure the store is clean and neat and the customers are quickly served.
good,Its alot of hard work and you promote fast. But they need new management because the one they have now bring their home stuff to work and that is not professional
good,The management and associates are helpful and understanding. The position isn't overwhelming or difficult. Most task are easy to understand and easy to accomplish.
good,"Enjoy the people I work with and the managment in my store is outstanding!      Managers make it easy to understand , projects."
good,"Great company a little unorganized but if you love a challenge and retail it will be a great job,  Advancement is available quickly to the right candidate."
good,The environment is amazing and motivating. Having the opportunity to always move up is always good. I would definitely recommend a friend to join aboard the Ross team.
good,Is a great environment to work at. Managers are friendly and helpful. I learn how to unload the truck with all the products and put them out on the sale floor.
good,Work hard move forward take one step a time with proper training will value with advantages and disadvantages communication is a must for better understanding of what to expect of the job ask questions be evacuated constantly will refresh on computer training as well as cross training so you have more ability to do more for the company and will lead to advancement
good,"Each and every day was a opportunity to learn something different. After a few weeks on the job I was promoted to another position very difficult to learn at the beginning, But with great trainers they made it more understanding. Hard work and dedication defiantly payed off and certainly was recogn"
good,I loved the job and it was always a nice check to be made to help support my family and time I needed a shift leader they was on hand.. Never had a problem with other worker or shift leader
good,"Ross has a great environment, but the $10.50 per hour is not worth it for all that you have to do. However, I have learned a lot thanks to them and gained enough experience to achieve other goals."
good,Ross was always busy. High foot traffic. Ive learned how to manage my time. Use a register. This place was awesome I always worked with people with great work ethics.
good,"The entire environment of this workplace was so fun and amazing that it made you want to come to work every day! The only down side to this was the pay and hours aren't enough to be an only income source. This is a great supplemental income job, but not a main income. If the pay and hours were enough I probably would never leave this company!"
good,Ross make sure everyone is happy. They have fast check out . Security have a good eye at all times. When a  customer get mad bout something we make sure we keep the problem under control.
good,"A typical day was first and foremost greeting your co-workers upon entry. "
good,The associates and managers treats you fairly. Ross has good customer service and is willing to help you if needed. It is a nice place to work at and its always busy.
good,"Ross is an amazing place to work, and I enjoy it.  The only problem is that it seems to only be part time.  Aside from that, management and the associates are all great people to work with."
good,Lots of friendly co workers there which makes working there feel better. There is also a great ammount of co workers and employees that are willing to help when you need it.
good,"We work as a team. It is a fun fast pace environment. I get to meet all kinds of new people. They let you move around, and if you don't want to be in a certain position they will try to keep you out of it."
good,I really enjoyed working here just could not get a full time position and needed it at the time. The discounts are great. I loved all my co workers and the flexibility of the schedule.
good,"I think the management needs to be updated on transfer employees "
good,Business is great caring for employees and its a very easy going working atmosphere but no structure or benefits
good,This is an amazing place to work. There are a few bugs but that is to be expected with any work place! I really love working for them and the benefits they offer are amazing!
good,The money isnt great and its entry level retail work but I really loved what I did there. I loved how there was always something to do and that helped time go by.
good,The store are run very well. Any would like to work for the company.the place is very well kept. I love my job and you meet a lot of people. Management are very friendly and kind. My over all of the company are a great place to work.
good,"I Have worked many places and the team i worked with was the best group of people i EVER met!!I was engaged,and felt like a part of the ross family my first day there.The team really respected one another and that made for a better customer experience i believe. Hard work really isn't hard when the team truly works for the same goals.Management was always very approachable and professional and it really was a amazing time in my life.Thanks Ross family pdx rox!!"
good,I had a really fun time while working at Ross. The benefits aren't that good for a thought. The pay is alright for part-time.
good,"Daily, we would review/analyze various balance sheet and expense accounts.  Prepare journal entries for month end close. Assist in audits, SOX and ad hoc reports."
good,Ross is a great company to work for. You get to meet new people everyday. The staff is always friendly and willing to help.
good,A typical day was somewhat busy. I learned how to stock and organize products on the shelves. The managers were all great and professional. My co-workers were fun and very approachable. The hardest part of this job was talking with rude customers. The best part of this job was being given a discount on store items.
good,"Overall, Ross is a strong company to work for and in retail good for a few reasons. One: associates do NOT have to sell any credit card and two, there's no sales goal. So no pressure there. Its an open field for advancement, if a worker wants that. But organization, attitudes etc. vary on which Ross. The management at the one I worked at were great, most of the time; most of my important concerns were alleviated. There was disorganization with breaks- this really is the manager's responsibility to make sure everyone has gotten theirs and assign who covers who. Employees CANNOT always host the additional burden of doing so. I also experienced they have only one associate quadrupling on tasks where there would greatly benefit everyone being two at it."
good,"I have had an overall great experience with Ross. I would show up to work even through the snow and all of the temperatures. I did not appreciate that my hours were cut, because that really hurt me. I had my own place and I worked really hard. On Black Friday, my manager did not ask me to come up to help them I just did that because that is what I felt should have been done."

Difficulties arose in the job when keeping an ""eye"" on all customers in the store at any given time.

good,Its very family oriented  very laid back I love working here. The hardest thing is waking up early in the morning other then that it goes by fast . Everyone is always positive and in good vibes
good,"Easy work, fast-paced, learn stuff quickly. Managers were helpful. A typical day was getting in, immediately start cleaning what you can, sometimes they'll assign you to a specific area.

good,"Great place , but if you are not full time hours might be short it all depends on the season. It really is very easy job its not stressful."
good,"Starting at Ross Dress for Less you are given very little to work with, but after gaining experience, you reap what you sow. I started out as a seasonal temp, working part-time, making about 8 dollars an hour, close to no benefits. I left with some managerial experience making a little over 10 an hour, I was able to take a paid vacation, I believe, twice a year. Accumulating vacation hours also paid for my maternity leave. I don't think I qualified for FMLA at the time because I hadn't been a full-time associate for a year, but having vacation hours to use was a great option."

good,"My Reviw on Toss is that they have good benefits, discounts , and good pay . But the only time you get good hours is during the holidays . The management team at the North Hills crossings is very good but very young and naive they don’t know what to expect and make a simple task harder then what it is ."
good,"the typical day at Ross Warehouse is very quiet and straight forward to the work. you would find a pallet that you want to do and then you would look at the UPC label and make sure that it matches the label on the box and if it matches, you look on the same label and look for the description of merchandise and where to stick the price tag on the merchandise."
good,This is a fast-paced job with lots to do and plenty of teamwork to help get it done. The managers are supportive and always willing to lend a hand where needed. Everyone plays their part and helps their coworkers get the job done in the most efficient way possible. You will love working with such a great team!
good,"A typical day at work was unpredictable, as in never knowing if it would be busy or slow, and that was part of the ""fun"" at work. Management was great, they listened and communicated well with the associates. If I had to say what the hardest part of the job was, it would be just all the walking, especially if you have a bum knee or ankle, but overall it's not that difficult. The most enjoyable part was working with other people and the teamwork skills to build with coworkers."

good,"Working as a retail associate for Ross is fun and productive for those kind of people who are able to be multi tasked and like to work in a fast-paced environment. Treating customer nicely and keep the store clean are the main roles for the retail associate, it's just got kind of overwhelming when it's busy but in a regular paced time when everything goes by the schedule it's actually fun besides the discount that you get as an associate....it's a perfect place to work if you want to add some extra money to your pocket."
good,"Many shifts available, very flexible hours, manager takes the time to know you and treats you fairly, new obstacles to tackle on the daily, fast pace work environment."

good,"For the most part, it is a very easy, and relaxed job. I love the people that I worked with and they are very understanding when an unfortunate situation comes and you have to call off. It's very flexible and works well with any schedule. The hardest part of the job is just organizing but otherwise, it is so easy."
good,Wish I didnt have to have the baby when I did or I would still be working there. I love everything about Ross I Started when the store was opening so imagine me & my crew making a Ross look nice I mean from empty to full. It was a lot of worked but i also enjoyed it.

good,"Clockin and do 15 minutes of sales floor clean up, then head back to the stockroom to unload the shipment and process it to take it out to the sales floor. Time-managment, unloading procedures, apparel, shoe and purse processing. Such as hard tagging and re-ticketing un ticketed items.

good,"I loved working here, I got up everyday ready to go work. The managers we're great. I'd get called in and go because I loved the job so much. The store manager is a really cool guy."
good,I have had a great experience at Ross. The management is the best. They always try their best to work with you in all situations. They always follow up with your work and take interest in you as a person.
good,On a day basis cause its a store we usually try to keep it a fun filled day joking with each other when on breaks. helping one another out when the cashier needs it and at the end of the day when we are about to close to run racks. I've learned that if you have an awesome personality and get along with people great your days there will be fun and everything you can think of. Management there isn't the best. Needs more communication and needs to create bonds with workers. Hardest part of the job is being the new person and not really having someone explain well the job duties you need to perform. The most enjoyable part of working at Ross is working with awesome people and getting a discount at your favorite store.
good,Stock room is fast past. However the stock associates are great people and create a wonderful environment. Learning the different area's to place the incoming merchandise will be a little hard but not difficult.
good,"You will be hired for part time employment but, on average will be asked to pick up extra hours and/or shifts. There will be NO raises at Ross until;l minimum wage hits $15 an hour. Corporate Ross sees, the yearly minimum wage hikes as ""raises""."

good,"A typical work day for me at Ross consisted of organizing clothing on racks, working the fitting room sometimes working in the home department. I learned how to use a cash register. Management was excellent, very friendly, patient and kind. The workplace culture was good. The hardest part I would say had to be the weekends when it would get really busy. The most enjoyable part was the discounts."
good,I loved working here! Hours were flexible and it worked well with my school and with my other job at the time. I love the discounts. Only problem was it was very hard for me to get a full time job.
good,"Loss prevention."
good,A great place to work especially if you like working by yourself. Your able to give families great memories and great photos. Your able to meet interesting people and be apart of their memory making.
good,It was a quick paced job but fun working with people of all ages and we became close like a second family. I would recommend this job to anyone looking to start work experience and make friends.
good,Ross is a great place to work if you are in the retail field. They are also very good at promoting internally. I went from store associate to supervisor in 4 months. They off good benefits but for full time only. Your PTO rolls over so you dont lose any days at the end of the year. Of course being in retail things get a little crazy at times but that is also what makes it fun. The managers there are amazing and they welcomed me gladly when i was promoted.
good,Working at Ross Dress for Less is an enjoyable experience. The managers are all friendly and willing to work with all employees . The co workers are all supporting and the policies are not complicated or hard to follow
good,I like the management the store is nice and clean. You meet new people working in this company. I like doing customer service. You get discounts when ever you purchase something.
good,Great employer but inadequate pay. Very professional management team and hard working staff.  MOD always makes sure you take all your breaks and schedules are posted on a timely manner.  Hours are low.  High volume store and supplies are often scarce.
good,"Handling money "
good,"A typical day at work depends on what day you're working. On the weekends, it gets really busy and the cashier upfront can't do anything (cleaning, restock, etc.) except help customers. The hardest part of the job is trying to work with uncooperative managers and coworkers. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get certain benefits to being an associate. We get double discount (40%) 3 times a year."
good,"Every time i go in for work and i see all my co-workers, i just see a family. Because they are so friendly and nice. I respected my co-workers they helped me a lot when i was a new comer. I asked a lot of question and they help me through it. I appreciate their help a lot."

good,i learned to delegate an overnight team with another guy we were training as stockroom lead and mod. I learned that some people needed to be pushed harder than others. the workplace is ok everyone seems to get along. the hardest part of my job would be to fill in another employee job we there is a call out and be responsible for my job at the same time. the most enjoyable part of my job we be the nights when the truck isn't heavy I get to leave. the managers are easy to get along with.

good,"I'm sure why this is necessary. I would prefer spending my time looking for a new job."
good,"Though it was only a temporary job, I loved this one almost as much as my main retail management job. As 3rd key manager, I focused more on stock, inventory and, keeping the floor organized. Customers were secondary because they did not need as much one on one assistance. As opening and closing manager, I relied on my staff to help the customers for the most part."

Backup cashiering. Trained and mentored new employees on job responsibilities. Helped company achieve best district store for 2011."
good,"A typical day at work involved making sure that the store was clean, no shoes or clothes on the floor. Duties varied. Some days I would be in charge of the cash register, other days I would be in the dressing room and sometimes worked customer service."
good,it was a part time position and as a stock associate i learn different methods from other organization that were used to unload and process merchandise for the sales floor. the associate to the management are friendly and very helpful. although it was just part time position mostly everyone is besides management.
good,"count tills and balance the safe before the day begins"
good,"At Ross, you work as an actual team. They firmly believe in anyone's ability to be cross-trained. The hardest part of the job would be unloading the trucks. But even that was easy, as you would have additional workers in the backroom, pulling products, moving them off the line and on to the floor as quick as possible."
good,"i give the job a 8 out of 10 its a good experience as stated before its more of a teaching experience in the world of retail..you will learn a lot.the most enjoyable part of the job is the people , the hardest part of the job is....the work is sometimes tedious, and you have to do it correctly its about speed and reliability."
good,"I heard it got so much better with management, the environment was so fun and they try they best to work with you also get to try things I got to work stock cashier on the floor"
good,"The merchandise is constantly changing, so when you come to work things always look just a little different, new items, not racks of the same thing in different sizes.  The prices are great so it is fun to promote the store and you get a discount if you work there.  The drawback is there are a minimum of full time positions, and if you work part time you can only get up to 25 hours....if you are lucky to get that.  The management in the O'Fallon store is great."

All of my coworkers and managers were kind and helpful, especially when I first started working there. I really enjoyed being able to interact with all of the customers and help them out with whatever they needed. I didn't like having to stay after hours to clean up the store. Another issue I had was that the longer I worked there, the fewer the hours they would give me per week."

We all get along and are able to work together as a team to get things done quickly and efficiently. I enjoy my job very much. I would say the hardest part about this job is not having a set schedule and never knowing if my shift will get cut or not because of pay roll."
good,"A typical day at work consists of customer transactions, organizing the store as well as attending the fitting room. I feel that some of the management aren't equip to handle the responsibilities of management. I got along well with all of my co-workers. The hardest part of my job was going so many hours without a break. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with all the different types of people."

good,"A typical day at Ross is usually busy.Which makes the job easier and fun. I have lean how to do returns and how to keep departments clean in a certain amount out time. Management is good, they are really understanding with days you need off and personal issues. Co-workers are amazing!! Everyone gets along with everyone and they make you feel welcome. It like we are a big family. In my opinion the hardest part of the job is just the first days of work,when you are being trained in everything there is to do.

good,I liked getting up to go to work. There was always something new in my day and stayed very busy. Great co workers. hard work a lot of  walking but loved it
good,"I loved my time at Ross. I was a backroom stock employee. I would arrive at 9:30 am every day and start on the truck. My team and I would set the stockroom up and then when the truck arrived we got to work. We pushed boxes down the line and opened them, sorting the products onto specific carts. That typically took about two hours. The rest of the shift consisted of pushing out the carts and stocking the shelves. My co-workers were the best. I made great friends. Management was always helpful and pushed us to be the best we could. The atmosphere was laid back and was nice. Overall, it was a great company to work for, and I would recommend it."

Once giving my task and get started on it and complete it with no problem. if I have troubles I have great co-workers and great managers to help me and/or explain and break It down. Only challenge would be that the customers could be really messy and/or uneasy to deal with. But at the end of the day it is my job to deal with the problem and solve it by providing great customer service.
good,The workplace is very busy and you are always on your feet. I have learned so much from this company especially my customer service skills. I have always loved working here. It is so energetic and welcoming. The hardest part I must say is when I first started working here I had to get use to working because this was my first job. I enjoy most about my job is my co-workers and definitely the customers.

good,The work environment was nice. I was able to move to a higher paying position.
good,"Ross is a great place to start for work because they give an opportunity to people like me with no work experience. Once you are in the company, as long as you do good with your job, moving up is not a problem. They give everybody a chance to train and try to move up from their position (they even ask you where you wanna be trained!). And if your availability for work changes, they will still accommodate you and give you schedules on the days you are available."
good,"Mostly by telephone, and Xterm remote login to stores and fix every type of software/hardware issue they may have or escallate to other parts of the IT deparment. I also ran weekly payrolls for corporate and stores. First job after getting my Associates Degree. It was a great place to work! The people were all very nice, and the company had some terrific benefits and opportunities for advancements if you showed enough initiative. We worked a four day week which was awesome, and we had extended lunch hours. There was several company sponsored events, and they have an on-site Cafe. Management, was attentive and positive, and looked for ways to make things work even if that meant helping you out with something personal!! I hated leaving this position!"
good,"A typical day a work for me is greeting and welcoming the customers into the store. Organizing different areas, staging, decoration, fitting-room, size and color coded products, price and ticket merchandise, did markdowns, cleaning the store, working the cash register, sales and returns and worked on presentation for the store."
good,"Adorei trabalhar na empresa, mesmo não sendo minha area e nunca tendo trabalhado com montagem de chaveiros gastei muito."
good,While working there I saw how products are packed and distributed and loaded before they reach the retail stores. I learned that there is a process to shipping and each warehouse has a different way to shipping. It was a little trying while I was working there because more than half of my co-worker where Hispanic and I didn't speak but just a little Spanish. The hardest part was trying to have a conversation with my co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have a job.
good,I worked during the holidays therefore the store was always busy but overall it was fast paced. It was a new experience for me but i enjoyed every second. The ross family was very welcoming & showed me everything i need to know.

good,Everyday i would stand at the front of the store to greet customers to mitigate theft and fraud. Every other hour i would do a walk around the store to reassure my presence. It taught me to be on my toes and all times but it also gave me more experience with people. Management and co-workers were fantastic. We were all nice and fun but also got the job done. The hardest part of the job was finding who was stealing since it rarely happened in my presence. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be meeting someone new everyday.
good,This is the job you want if you love to stay busy.  There is always something to do and people to talk to.

They made us care to compete to be the best we all could be, without thinking about it, and enjoy working with eachother in anything that needed to be done. "
good,A typical day at Ross included five minute briefings for morning team members.  Team members automatically began working once the delivery truck arrived.  I learned how to set specific goal times when it came down to opening boxes and distributing the products on the floor. The hardest part of the job was getting the other team members to reach that goal time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to get along with management and the team members.
good,"A typical day at work here wasn't too challenging. You deal with theft and prevention, stocking, customer relations and children! I learned how to better help a customer with their apparel needs, almost by ""eyeing"" them. The managers I had the pleasure of working with, will all be very hard to replace. The co-workers, not so much..Except for a very select few people. The hardest part of the job was maintaining a level head versus buying up all the great deals. The most enjoyable part of the job was ""shopping""; on the inside."

They made sure to move me around to the different departments so that I would have a greater knowledge about the store. My coworkers were great even the ones that came after me, some of which I was able to train.

The most enjoyable part was being out on the floor helping people find the perfect product for them."

The management always worried about your well-being and if something was they listened to what you had to say. I enjoyed working with my co-workers and they helped me out when I needed them.

good,"This is an efficiently run warehouse. They have a professional work environment. I was brought into the company with little experience, but I feel I have gotten very knowledgable in the industry from the time I spent here."
good,"Great work environment with lots of great people. My only issue is that the hours are not dependable and change week to week, as to be expected in a retail job. The pay is good and the workload is manageable."
good,"It's a great diverse workplace and I working there has been amazing and I plan to stay there for at least another year. The management also is pretty good and they are not to tough, but also make sure you get your work done."

good,It is a fun and friendly but busy place to work l. Always room to grow. Many job benefits and opportunities to also invest. Ross has programs to help college student employees.
good,"Working for Ross hasn't been anything close to a stressful situation. I have run into some pretty tight situations where people have stolen product off of store shelves or out of hummers/blue bins. But in these types of situations, we're legally not capable or allowed to pursue the thieves in any way shape or form other than contacting the nearest management."
good,The Ross I worked at was always busy. But my Managers were very understanding and helpful. My co-workers were very friendly too. I learned about the supervisor position and even handled it myself. I was the main back-up. The hardest part is time management. What to do to make the most of your day.
good,Sales Floor and Fitting Room is where its at. You meet more people and assist more.  Management/Supv are great helps when you need them for anything..

good,"Fast paced and lots to do, sometimes could not do enough with the hours given but still has a nice workplace culture. The hardest thing was an issue with the schedules and having to go in to check them and how often they would change. The most enjoyable part was working with people and the side talk during work, also seeing items that really interest me."
good,I learned how to work with people that was slow and faster than me which also made me a better worker. The hardest part of the job is when everyone is not on the same page.
good,Ross is an excellent company with a fast paced work environment. Although you are busy all the time you are also faced with exciting situations and are rewarded on accomplishments.
good,"As an intern, you will be a supervisor. They train you for the first couple of weeks and then they let you supervise with some assistance. Hours are early some departments start at 6 others at 5. It is a very fast paced work environment and you have to be ready to work."
good,"I am a very loyal dedicated person . , Not affraid to try new jobs n take boundaries out of same routines .. very reliable n punctual.. team player , never gives up until job done"

Overall, just a great place to work."
good,Overall I always looked forward into going to work. I enjoyed doing my job and the people I worked with were great. The manager was awesome and got along well with everyone. The work environment was very easy and manageable

Company is easy to work with .They explain the job description, training was easy, supervisor is always available for questions and they are open door policy so it makes it easy to work there. the hours were flexible ,I was able to request days with other employees and we worked together ,felt like a work family all the time."

good,"Ross is a great place to work, hours are just hard sometimes depending on your availability. They have great competitive pay and benefits for associates."
good,A typical day at Ross is very busy and fast pace. I've learned that it is very difficult to handle a huge line of customers. The workplace is enjoyable. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and what they are there to buy. The hardest part of the job is maintain your station clean and having the line at a certain length.
good,"Every day at work is exciting, whether you're having a hard day or not. The work environment is great, along with the people working there. The tasks that are asked of you are extremely easy to learn, as long as you pay attention. The hardest part of working at Ross would have to be doing stock. Although it is a little difficult because you have to work under pressure, it is the most fun place to work at."
good,Great place to work . Management team is awesome and helpful . Everyone in store have great communication skills and is easy to get along with.  Great work place
good,"At Ross there are many rules and restrictions that only apply to SPS that make our job more difficult than it already is, but still a great work place. The average day can be extremely slow or extremely fast, as with any retail job, but regardless of pace this position can be mental exhausting as it requires quick thinking, risk assessment, and at time self control. Dealing with the average customer is actually quite nice, but dealing with thieves is rage inducing and stressful. This is due in part to Ross is strict policies in regards to how to confront thieves. Along with deterring theft, an SPS is in charge of coaching associates on various things going on around the store."
good,"A typical day at work for me starts at 5:45 am, I am a stock associate so I handle all the incoming freight daily. Management is always willing to work with you, and the employees are friendly. The hardest part of being a stock associate is not knowing how long your shift will be until you get there for your shift. It can make balancing life slightly difficult. The most enjoyable part of job is seeing all the great deals that come in every day before anyone else does, as well as making sure the store is properly merchandized for customers."
good,I really miss working at Ross the staff and other employees were so nice I really enjoyed being able to cross train in the different departments thru out the building if I could return I would

good,busy store with great associates and managers. I think ross is a great company to work for they care about there employees and the managers are always there when needed

good,"The management is helpful and recognizes good work. Great chances for job advancement, even encouragement from senior staff to do so. Overall friendly and positive attitudes among coworkers."
good,Ross is a fun and great environment to work at. The company is always providing great services to the clients. Management is always willing to provide help to their employees and are great at acommodating employees needs.
good,"It's a fast-paced working environment where there is always something to do, whether assisting customers or cleaning up the store. Management and my co-workers are great. It's an easy job where there's never a dull moment."
good,"unloading truck and processing the merchandise to be put out on the sales floor. I learn time management skills and keeping on tasks. Management is good overall, but can use a little work on treating people fairly. Co-workers are what make the job fun and time goes by fast. Hardest part of the job is unloading truck. The most enjoyable part would be the people you work with and the flexible schedule."
good,"This job is okay, as you work your way up it's just like any company depending on perspective sometimes it's worth it. They give you an incentive to work faster for more money, as your work your way up the pay raise it makes it irrelevant."
good,"I had a great experience working for Ross as a seasonal worker. I learned so much things. Such as processing luggage and apparel to pricing the clothes. It taught me to be more organized. My co-workers"
good,Ross is a great place to work but at first the hours to work will be low. Staff and Manager were always great and the policies are great.
good,"its so nice to work there, usually or day full of energy and a lot of customer + you got 20% discount for working with us."
good,It was a fun place to work but you could tell people didn't like their jobs associates and managers so it was hard sometimes to work there.
good,I started working a regular retail job and I love it. it was a great atmosphere and learning place. most of all it was how great helped getting back in the flow of a normal work schedule.
good,"Great company, great people. Enjoyed going to work daily, very nice co-workers. Wonderful benefits and, incentives. Some travel based on department, frequent store trips."
good,Always looking forward to work and see other co workers. Love greeting and helping customers.the managers always motivate all the co worker and we set goals.
good,I opened the first Ross store in Calif. I started out working in the Men's Department. I had my own stock room and I had to push my stock out everyday. We all worked as a Team and always got the job done. Learning to sizes men for dress shirts. The most enjoyable was Opening new store for the company. You walk into a shell and you take a team and trainer them and step back and see what you all did
good,"Great place to work if you're in need of accomplishment and achievements. Love to work with all the associates and co-workers to help train and coach to reach operational greatness. Hardest part of the job is to achieve is to hit all operational goals with little resources to do so. The growth you gain individually is the best reward while helping others to reach their individual goal through the day, week, and fiscal year.

That's not a bad thing, but actually a VERY good thing, because sometimes a company can get TOO focused on the customers and NOT on the employees. yet with ROSS, it's evenly balanced. Not only do the customers behave politely and respectfully, but the employees as well. So naturally it'll come to no surprise that you'll feel right at home upon entering our establishment. In my time with ROSS, I've come to know myself in a whole different light. I've learned, through the help of my management team and employees, that it's not about the individual, but about teamwork. And ROSS is definetely about teamwork, which is why I enjoy my job."

Are just sitting around always helping out where needs to be. Always telling us thank you and good job. I can say probably the worst thing about working at Ross is the occasional rude customer. But coworkers and management make up for it.

Some job functions have bonus opportunities for associates based on there weekly performance and has competitive starting pay for the Carlisle/Harrisburg area. Production associates work no more than 10 hours a day Monday - Friday. There are scheduled Saturday's throughout the calendar year during times when sales are higher (i.e. months leading up to Christmas, Mothers Day, etc.). The DC is very diverse with at least 12 different languages spoken. There are advancement opportunities with job openings for eligible associates through the Supervisor-in-Training and Manager-in-Training programs. The DC is not climate controlled so it does get warm during Summer, however, each year more industrial fans are installed to circulate air and Safety measures are taken to include an additional work break if it gets to warm.

good,"A typical day at work, for me, starts off with working the register for a couple hours, until the line dies down. Then, I work on my SET assignment for the day. From there, it's either finshing my SET or picking up/covering tasks for my coworkers. The hardest part of the job, in my opinion, would be how hectic the store can get sometimes, especially during the holidays. However, that can also be considered the best part of the job, as you will stay busy and the time will fly by. I'd rather work in a hectic environment than a slow and dull environment."

And the most enjoyable time is when there no stops. And the merchandise make it to the  shipping department to be shipped out to its destination.
good,"Working in the stockroom is very fast paced, and you have to be able to work under a little pressure because you are timed for how long it takes you to deliver the merchandise. You will get trained by the stock room lead so they won't just throw you out there and expect you to know where all the merchandise goes. If you like working Monday-Friday and occasionally we receive trucks on Saturday (if you want to work on Saturday you can, not mandatory) then this is the job for you."

good,"Love it"
good,"Management varies over time, but as an employee, flexibility is crucial  to adapt but know goals remain consistent to corporate-approved standards. You will get hours as long as you work well with others, willing to learn, help others and have an open availability. Follow dress code, show up on time, and never be waiting around for task to be done. Work place culture varies on store location. The hardest parts to work are in stock room, fitting room and customer service. Stock requires fast pace that takes time to develop. Fitting room and customer service can have its bad days because some customers lose patience and can be aggressive about corporate policies and procedures. Another issue is increased holiday hours. The company likes to test and gradually increase holiday hours which can impose on the employees time with their families. The best part of the job is employee discount and if you are full-time, the benefit package is really resourceful. It is a great place to work if you work hard."

good,Great job but had a lack of advancement with proper Compensation. They did not want to work with my schedule once I obtained a second job. I was told to choose which job I preferred.
good,ross was my first job and I loved working there. I was cross-trained in every department and learned just about everything I needed to know in retail.

good,Ross is a great place to shop and a great place to pick some extra cash if needed. Make sure you are have a open availibilty in order to pick up as many hours
good,At Ross you have too multitask and be on your toes most of the time. You have to be aware of you're surroundings as well not only towards the customer but your Co workers as well.
good,"I LOVED working at Ross. The managers were all very friendly. They also were good at understanding people's personal issues that may occur. They were very flexible on schedules. The other employees were also very friendly and, great team players. The job was also fun."
good,"As a Stock room manager I would receive orders, upload and unload tucks, divide and distribute objects to the different departments, and lead the employees in a kind but effective manner."

good,Great job to have enjoyed working with customers on a daily basis.  Everyday was a different challenge  i would consider this is great place to work for students.
good,Learned how to work as a diverse team with key focus on getting the job done. Giving back to the community is another key area of focus that the company places emphasis on and it builds the teams sensitivity to issues affecting others elsewhere especially the less privileged.
good,"They are very flexible with hours, and are willing to work with any changes you need in your schedule. They offer a team based environment, and commit to it."
good,This was my first real job and i very much enjoyed the work ethics and learning environment it provided. Safety and security were extremely well taken care of and the patience the supervisors possessed was great.
good,"Management is kind, very constructive criticism. Occasionally free food, great shift schedule no mid-night shifts either day or night. The manager is accommodating to my availability."
good,"Though it's not always busy there is always something to do. There is never a moment of standing around doing nothing. There is and always will be work to get done and I really enjoy that aspect. The staff is very friendly and if you are struggling you never have to feel afraid to ask. Someone is always there and ready to help you. You will be versed in most things in the store, for example: I work cashiering/returns/jewelry counter, sales floor, and fitting room. All of these area's have a lot of work put into them, but it is fairly easy to pick up. I highly suggest working here, it really is a great place. "
good,I worked for Ross for three years first as a part-time cashier than to a full-time Front End Supervisor and finishing as a Stock Room Lead before leaving to give birth to my first born. It was a great experience and the management was amazing. They gave me the confidence I needed to succeed and helped me overcome my obstacles.
good,A typical work day you stand most of the time by the front door. Greet customers as they come in and leave the store. Preform surveillance of guests and employees as it relates to theft.

good,I have been at Ross for almost 12 years they are a great company to be with. I feel Ross is a great job opportunity for anyone who likes to work with a great friendly staff as well as customers. The management team is hard working and strives to help each and every employee that gets hired to move up in the company.
good,"I am still working Part time I enjoy working for Ross I'm still working and still will continue  typical day  includes  taking care of customers cashing out customers, workplace culture is one of everyone helping each other when needed, very friendly , management team always there to help out, the hardest part of the job was not having a satisfied customer."

I have learned to work with other and train many people. You have to be patience when training and working with others. My manager was very informative and understanding.
good,This company has taught me to excel and over achieve while having a very supportive staff. Being part of a team has always led to success and was the best way to approach the majority of tasks.
good,It was a fun productive work place. I enjoy my co workers and the management team is very helpful and willing to listen and help in any way. It's been easy working with their customers also.

good,I currently works at Ross Dress for Less for only a couple of days and I love it. The most enjoyable part about the job is you can interact with the coworkers and the customers.
good,"When I first started working at Ross Dress For Less, I learned a variety of positions, Mainly working P.O.S., because with Ross Prices, lines start to build up fairly quickly and there would need to be multiple cash registers open. I would also help ensure beautifying the premises by checking a daily ""hotspot"" where we would come to find open or misplaced items."

A typical day at work would either consist of working the fitting room, cash register, sales floor, stock room, or standing in as an SPS. I learned all the skills to work all these positions in the store, as well as work ethic and communication skills both with costumers and management. I loved my coworkers, they were all nice and we got along. The hardest part of the job was constantly cleaning up the store. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my coworkers and the costumers."

good,"fun place, fun people"
good,"Company and managers would let our friends and family use our employee discounts as long as we paid for the product up front and then off property premises we could then let our family and friends pay us back. That with in itself very flexible with discounts which was nice. Fun work environment with friendly co workers. Just a PT position unfortunately with being retail, that is all I was looking for with this position.

The hardest part of my job was learning how to take checks. The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know new people."
good,"Overall the company is a great place to work. The environment is young, competitive, and fast paced. Training is excellent and the sales team is growing extremely fast so advancement opportunities look good at the moment. Management is good and will take time to make sure their people succeed. It's nice to be treated like an adult and a true investment to a company. The only issue I have at the moment is the lack of transparency with quotas at times. I guess that's the way it goes in any large sales force. It would be nice to have some more analytics or data about how quotas are formulated even if it is just a reflection of a large company goal for the quarter. Overall I would recommend this workplace to others."
good,This was my first job straight out of high school the best is you can shop where you work at I miss the people I became close to best job ever........
good,A typical day at work is packing merchandise at a fast paced. I have learned how to be crossed-trained to work in different departments. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people.

It was a fast work environment and  thing ran smoothly for the most part. I gained an appreciation for the hard working sales associate, and observed the woman shoppers are a lot more messier than men."
good,"it is a great place to work, i love the staff they  make it like having a second family. The store has all kinds of products and we get a 20 percent discount."

good,"Work is not suppose to be a drag, and working at Ross is just the opposite. Co-workers are like friends and the bosses are there to help the day go along smoothly."
good,fun and busy place to work! I would recommend it to anyone willing to work hard. This companies goal is to promote the people that really want it. Its an easy process if you do the work and listen to any and all feedback .
good,Great place to work. Had great flexible schedule for a full time student like myself. Pay was great with yearly payups. The only bad thing was when they cut pay roll.

good,"Working at Ross was like working with family everyday, always having fun and smiling while maintaining a steady work environment. Every day held a different challenge, anywhere from and upset customer to all the registers shutting down for 4+ hours. Either way, we all stuck together and worked hard to get through each obstacle. To show our appreciation we would always hold fun events for management and associates to participate in. Potlucks, secret santa, safety events, etc. I would always jump all in, as would the rest of the Ross family."

But I did enjoy the great mark-downs we would have.

You will learn something everyday. This is also a training store for the district, so the store manager is all about growth and development. Very positive environment, and even when payroll is very tight, the managers help make it manageable for the associates. It depends on the location that you are working at. I have worked at seven different Ross stores, and non have been the same. I can honestly say working at the Plainfield Ross has been the best experience. The company is all about the growth of internal development. I have been promoted three times in the past 4 and a half years I have been with the company. With that being said, off priced retail is tough. The customers are cheap and don't realize the concept of ""you pay for what you get"". Just like any job there are pros and cons, every retail job you work in, you will always have to deal with customers that are unhappy, but it is a different demographic when it comes to off priced, which is an adjustment that some people cant handle. All in all, it is a fun place to work, it is challenging, but you have fun, you grow, you get to open new stores and the sky is the limit with this company!!!!"

I honestly can say I don't think their is a mjor hard part of my job, Im a person who catches on fast. Im a hands on person, the first day of my job I was working the register by myself. The best part about my job is working with the customers. Their are many freguant  customers who come in daily so you know we have conversations and you get to know a person.

Ross will keep you on a fast pace so there's always something to do and the customers are very understanding and helpful at times. The hardest part about this job is really satisfying  every customer. Sometimes well have a few costumers complain about pricing and demanding for 20-30% off an item, which we can not give unless the product is really damage and its only 10% at that. It gets crazy sometimes. The most enjoyable part of working with Ross is interacting with the customers, such as in conversations. At times while cashing out customers you get on a personal level of conversations such as why they came shopping or helping to put together an outfit or why  they're just visiting the country. Ross is a good company to work for."

good,"I've been seeing a lot of nasty reviews about this company, quit frankly I am tired of seeing It, and I thought I should give my point of view since I have been working with the company for almost one year. Ross Is a great place to not only work with but to learn! when I got hired at Ross I basically had no work experience at all. I knew nothing about a register, I knew nothing about customer service. before Ross I was the person who never speaks, I was extremely shy beyond the point that If I didn't know you... you never heard a word come out of my mouth. Not only that I was struggling with paranoia to be around people In public places! (100% Truth) but once I started working with Ross not only did I come out of my shell I realized I had wonderful customer service, I've heard It from my store manager! So this job has helped me with many things and It's Improved my life! I went from the person who never talks to the person you can't shut up! Furthermore, Ross has great leaders they take there time to show you things you don't know and explain things so you will. Expect to learn many things, such as the fitting room, how to use a cash register, how to do stock, customer service and the sales floor. The biggest advice I would give someone who's just been hired or looking to get a job with Ross Is to simply have patience. It's the key with just about any retail job... especially Ross. one minute you could have two people In line and turn around and you've got 25! Not only that, dealing with rude customers... just stay calm, explain, keep a smile on your face and understand. Always"

I learned to be patient with customers and how to effectively talk to customers. I was quickly moved to cust svc front desk assistant manager. I was in charge of 3-4 cashiers. Being in charge I was responsible for giving lunch breaks, proper cash in cash drawers, and handling any problems customers had. The hardest part of the job was learning all of the proper paper work. The most enjoyable part was making the customer happy with the merchandise in the store."

good,"You go in, put your stuff in the break room, they provide a locker and a lock. You clock in, ask your supervisor what your assigned area is to work at for the day or they have a sheet to look at. Ross can be very fast paced, they always have back up people for cashiers working the sales floor. The pay is reasonable, you get an employee discount, there are times of the year where you get double discounts which is awesome. Co-workers are co-workers, you choose if you want to be friends or not. It depends on your personality. The hard part of the job is just when it gets really busy, it's quiet at first and then all of the sudden everyone wants to check out but you get through it. The most enjoyable part of the job is making people happy with their shopping experience, being able to see what is on the sales floor so you can buy it later and of course the employee discount was my favorite. Ross is a good starter job and a good job to keep for long term."

My co-workers are cool, none of which I really see outside of work. The hardest part about working here is not the job it self, its keeping my mind in the right place. Truth be told everyday is not going to be sunny, and no one ever knows whats going on with another individual. My job is to just keep a smile on my face, and enjoy the time that I have. I love mostly all of my customers. They always compliment me on my customer service and how well treat them before they walk out the door. One of the things that makes me laugh just about every work day, is people trying to pronounce my name. It's always something new, and I just get a chuckle."
good,"Overall, I enjoyed the experience working for this company. The hours were good, the time spent there was fun and busy, and you can't go wrong with the discount and incredible low prices!"
good,My position is a backup manager/ stockroom associate.  A typical workday starts with me hard-tagging clothes and assisting customers at the register and with other concerns.
good,This employer encourages growth and managers see your potential. They speak in a professional manner instead of being rude. Everyone in the workplace is friendly and help each other.

good,As a cashier for this company its show you how to ring people up fast also leave them coming back for more. The hardest part was trying to listening to a new manager that didn't care about the company. But the work was really easy.
good,"Working for Ross was a great experience. I was able to work with wonderful people who all worked as a team, which really made great production days. Management was great, they were wonderful leaders, and worked right beside us especially on our busiest of days while getting their work they needed done. I wouldn't say that there was a ""hardest part"" of the job. There were challenges that come with every job, but it wasn't anything I couldn't handle.

It was all about team work
good,"On a typical work day at Ross, I would come in and put my stuff in my locker in the break room. Then I would walk up front to clock in. After clocking in, I would see where my manager wanted me if I was on register. Otherwise if I was clocking in anywhere else I knew where to go but would still ask the manager on duty what my daily assignment was. In the experience of working there, I learned how to be very organized. The management was lead by an awesome team. My co-workers were like a whole other family to me. The hardest part of the job was adjusting to the new store after moving from a different location and making sure the new store was ready by the deadline to have the Grand Opening. The most enjoyable part of the job was just the experience of getting to work there. I loved going to work every day because My goal was to make each customer feel comfortable shopping and to be smiling."

good,"Always a fast pace environment, multiple customers needing assistance finding certain merchandise. My managers would be stuck on register because the purchase line is always long. The random rushes during the day would last for about half an hour to an hour and we would still have to try to recover the store. Then after all the customers leave, the recovery of the store was always bad because everything would being in the wrong section..literally.

When at work do your work and do it right. Never mix work with personal life. Management was always open minded. Ask the Employees how to make Ross a better department store. Managers actually did take some of the employees advice and actually used it. My Manager at the time had been managing the store for over 15 years. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was when someone would call in last minute and you had already been there for 10 hours. Open to close. That only actually happened  three times out of four years. I can honestly say just made me appreciate my job more. I enjoy my co workers. It's always a blessing to go to work and have a good attitude and have a good atmosphere. Team work makes things easy going and more accomplishment's.

There wasn't a hard park at this job. I loved working with my co workers and helping the customers.
good,I enjoyed my time at the Ross warehouse although it was for a short moment and a seasonal position.
good,"great customers in a kind manner, help them with their needs."
good,"A typical workday at Ross is sometimes during the holidays are extremely busy, but it is always good to have some type of experience working under pressure, it is a fast paced job, i learn how to convect with the consumer needs and wants, i learn how to problem solve and listen to the consumer. the co-workers are a pleasure to work with, we have a great bond together we can relate to one another and its always a job to come to work and work aorund such positive people.  this job is not hard at all and the most enjoyable part about this job is knowing you've made their day by helping and providing such great deals and helping them find hidden treasures everyday."
good,"45% discount offerred for employees 3 or 4 times a year! Is a GREAT  location and is the only one in the city that has a Fine Jewelry Department. My expertise was not just as a cashier, but in the Fine Jewelry Department, and handling returns."
good,A typical day at Ross is very crazy because there is a lot going on I had to do shipment some days then I might be on cash register or fitting rooms the next day when I don shipment I had a time limit then I had to put the clothes out on the floor. The most hardest thing I would say is the time limit to do shipment because it would be a lot of clothes but so little time and the most enjoyable would have to be the fitting rooms because you would be able to help customers one on one find clothes and give your opinion if they ask for it.
good,"Processing money  order ,money grams  services and selling ticket "
good,"This honestly was one of my favorite jobs I've had. Great management, great co-workers and customers. Everyday I would meet a lot of new people and go to know some of the regulars really well. It was a job that always kept you going and made sure you stayed busy. I was either up front on the registers or in the back working the fitting room. If I was back in the fitting rooms I wasn't just handing people numbers and saying which room to go to. I was helping keep the changing rooms clean, pulling everything out of them, hanging everything back up correctly and putting them in order on a rack to be put back out onto the floor."
good,"At Ross, I clock in then begin a START assignment. This is an assignment to recover an area that has been messed up. I learned how to properly clean an area. The management comes and checks it, and I begin my daily duties of cashier and fitting rooms."
good,Hardest part of the job was learning where everything went in the store. My day at work was good i clocked in jumped right on my cash register until it slowed down enough to put back items that some people didn't want. My co-workers weren't as friendly but i adjusted just fine. My most fun part of my job was talking with customers about the latest trends and giving advice when i was asked.
good,"Computer Skills"
good,has helped me with my social skills and the only thing that's bad are the hours
good,After clock in you would usually size your designated rack and straighten up a little bit. You are always moving around which i personally love and there is always something you can be doing on the floor. I learned that fast pace environments are more for me then sitting around. I learned that there is always someone who needs help or something that needs doing with the rate of people consistently coming through the store. My co-workers were amazing. Everyone treated each other like family and had amazing teamwork skills. The hardest part of the job for me personally was probably keeping track of time because you get so busy and caught up in the rush you dont tend to remember to look at the clock and they are pretty serious about that. The best thing about the job had to be the enviroment with my co-workers because we use to throw potlucks and birthday partys for people and everybody worked together perfectly it was awesome.
good,Its a great place to work at really enjoyed my surroundings there its a great experience.
good,I work around nice people and love my job. The hardest part of the job is standing. I learned a lot about clothing stores and working in retail.

good,"A typical day at work is checking in with manager and be assigned either at the register or sales floor. If assigned at the register I make sure that customers are happy with their purchase and that transaction goes smooth. At the sales floor maintaining store neat at all times is priority, as well as greeting costumers. Also, making sure that costumers find what they want and that they have a great shopping experience."
