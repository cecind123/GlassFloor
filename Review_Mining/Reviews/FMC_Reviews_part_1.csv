rating,review
bad,"Attended an interview here, was the most unprofessional and odd interview I have ever attended. Was interviewed by two recruiters at their site, both giggled threw the interview and asked me inappropriate questions such as ""are you a dog or a cat person?"" and even  ""where did you meet your partner?"". The salary was not as advertised (much less!). To top it off I never heard back, I had already decided the company was not for me but to not receive a response after an interview is rude and very unprofessional. I would advise anyone to avoid this company, if the interview is this bad and unorganised, I can imagine the job would be a nightmare."
bad,Poor management.  Hostile work environment.  No growth opportunity. Pay is not good.  All of the good people are run off.  Insurance isn't the best.  You have to use PTO for paid holidays.  Staff is not appreciated.
bad,"Terrible place to work for!  Management is not supportive for promotion no matter how hard you work.  Place is run by ""good ole boys"" club by both males and females.  If they want you out they will find a reason!"
bad,"Have tool box meeting receive our work day schedule."
bad,"FMC was too political and your job security depended on who you know as well as who you were friends with. Ethics, accountability and business acumen did not exist here."
bad,"Was promised a position upgrade to go to the field at my my first year, i stated i didnt want to stay in shop. they kept me in shop even though i had the skills too go out."
bad,"Incompetent, self serving, discriminating management."
bad,"no recognition in assembly department, assignments given out daily with no organization, no leadership from supervisors or managers. Poor morale lots of favoritizm"
bad,"safety culture is trash, they preach about everything, too much favoritism at this company. they pick and choose who they want for leaders. while working there learn as much as you can."
bad,"FMC Technologies is an okay company, work life balance was minimal. Management was predominantly the old boy network. Co- workers were the best part. Hardest part was the commute, 90 mile commute from Katy to Generation Park."
bad,Mostly lip service from upper management.  They do not keep their word as promised.  Use you and drain your knowledge for their benefit.  Not a good company to work for.
bad,"Great company, stay way from the Tax Dept and the ""Crazy Mexican"" (consultants' terminology).   He doesn't have a clue and has had issues from the last companies he's worked."
bad,"Metas de trabalho abusivas com a realidade condizente da empresa."
bad,"Boa empresa, lugar de trabalho agradável e pessoas simpáticas."
bad,"Though an impressive MNC, internal structures of department and reporting duties are confusing, protocol given but not adhered by the highest management; hence leadership example is distorted for staff to follow, confusing. Employs contractual staff via agency hence benefits are minimised; organisation prefers to re-contract staff but not conversion to full time; job opportunities given to non-Singaporeans."
bad,"Long days in an office calling all his old customers two weeks before christmas and most of the customers were restaurants,              Sorry nothing good to say about it."
bad,Management only favors within the office after a time employees starts to feel hostile if you don`t get along.  They expect for employees to stop their personal life to be there till they say so even thought it announced that same day without a advanced time.Pl ease stay away at the end management is always right.!!!
bad,Management allowed staff to run over RN's and manipulate clinic rules and policy.
bad,Stay away from this company they are horrible.  Employees damage product and play with the freight contents and reseal it.  The equipment is not maintained and disgusting.  There is blatant favortism and even harassment from office employees.
bad,"I was hired as a full time employee.  In the first week, I realized corporate IT was a hostile environment. There is extreme brown-nosing within IT, there was no team solidarity. "
bad,poor management no structure and very long hours and no respect for employees.
bad,The management at this facility are not trained very well.  They focus on safety yet do not provide employees with key badges.  The bathroom door to the office is unlocked and all employees are in a meeting at 9:45 till 9:55 leaving the building accessible to anyone including bio terrorists.  The office especially the traffic clerk makes rude remarks to other employees and sexually harasses the younger male employees.  If you work here you will see that they go through an office person once a month or more. The warehouse is incredibly dirty and the equipment is unsafe.  The batteries in the lifts continually leak and spill battery acid on the floor.  This is a facility that ships food grade items and pharmaceutical precursors yet open exposes product to contaminants.
bad,They hired me on and after 2 months layed me off with no warnings along the way.  Bad company!
bad,"Employeurs dévalorisant et désagréable. Ne veut apprendre le métiers. Harcélement morale envers ses employés."
bad,Mid-Management are lacking knowledge and people skills in how to manage their staff.
bad,"The company has a facade of a great place to work with great pay and benefits. However, when looking behind the curtain, it is obvious that both the company, upper management and human resources are unorganized and dysfunctional."
bad,My short time there was filled with large doses of political posturing and back stabbing. The atmosphere was on of always looking over your shoulder and hoping you had a job the next day.
bad,"Go somewhere else, this is a job full of drama from mangmnt. They do not care anything about you and your family. Hard heavy work that will get you hurt. Go somewhere else if you can. Plant needs a union badly!!"
bad,"I did not enjoy my six years at FMC they view people as tools to be used hard until broken. at the first sign of illness or injury they will beetray you. if you aree young and strong and can work 1 hours a day to gin up some cash this is the place for you. if you are looking for a career, look elswhere."
bad,"Worked in 3 areas in 4 years, advanced at a great pace because i never said no. Lord help you if you did a job and didnt have it wrote down and signed by management or recorded. Favoritism  is key in surviving. This company preys on the little man who needs to feed there family, and then your they're property. Night shift is the safest play here, because there isnt alot of management stirring the pot.  99% of the time its all about quickness in producing something, hurry hurry hurry by the weekend ... AND THEN...WOAH... slowdown your rushing, you forgot the garbage at end of shift,  maybe you need to watch this video again on your break. Oh and the benefits...  Great for Larger Cities. NOT great for small town America. I left with a running script of anxiety meds an pain killers... becaude thats what you need to survive the daily mentality of managment."
bad,"Horrible management, unsatisfactory work conditions, blind shop management. High hypocritical work ethics. The shop technicians are smart but overlooked when decisions are to be made."
bad,"This company has managers without any qualification for the job, you better treat them well and not worry only about your work, there is nothing good to say about this company. Big amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected to be a big company."
bad,Fluid control struggles on every level from management to techs. It struggles with innovation within the division. The lack of innovation drives management to cut its number one cost the personal. They do so by undermining moral.  The lack of true management skill also contributes to the issue. They most have an excuse to why the shop is not performing therefore blame personal. It is a very toxic environment. The techs cannot help the shop perform better because they are structure so wrong.
bad,"Chaotic, not knowing which direction to go therefore, everybody has their own view. Not able to provide  clarity, horrible management and not honest in their approaches. I learned that I can accomplish tasks give above expectation but scare my boss because he could not figure out the solution that cost the company so much money. Yet I was used as punching bags. Technically I was very happy to solve their problem but it truly was the worse place I have ever worked and everyone was always scared."
bad,FMC is a good company when the wave of oil is up high and times are rolling.  Their process of laying off individuals was quite sneaky an unprofessional.
bad,"I cannot stress the the word micromanagement enough, my manager corrects the salutations on my emails and checks the grammar, incorrectly I may add."
bad,Would not recommend nor would I consider working here again. Very poor management who blames everyone else for problems. Lean? very far from it...OTD? very bad.
bad,Having key strengths as a proven problems solver and team player
bad,Good products but bad leadership at the top. Human Resources team one of the worst that you will ever work with.
bad,not good didnt like much at all they really sucked when it came too treating you with respect. you get hired for one thing they assign you to do other things. trash company
bad,"I enjoyed my work.  I worked with clients over the phone.  I worked with the field employees to input their field service tickets into the computer, I filed.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.  The most difficult part of the job was working with the base manager."
bad,"Worked for small company in Fullerton, CA.. 50 people.  GM was fresh out of Navy, little experience and an MBA...fighter pilot, so real arrogant..knew someone who made him a manager right from the Navy... terrible management skills on top of  the arrogant attitude was very bad combination.  He eventually got fired for screwing up a contract...my boss, also former Navy, was almost as bad... thought he knew more than people that had been in the industry years more than him...everyone ran to HR like we were in jr. high running to a teacher.. miserable environment..."
bad,I worked at FMC while attending school to gain my degree.  I started in the shop as a machinist and worked my way up into engineering due to my prior work experience.  I had an understanding to the products above and beyond that of the engineers.
bad,"When I started out, it seemed like a great company. It pays well and the benefits are good. However, it went downhill slowly from day one. The corporate management has no integrity. They lied to us and said that no one was losing their job over a recent corporate split (we lost our jobs a few weeks later). They said the split would create more jobs, yet I see few postings today, about half as many, as when I started. They also said that their is no risk of being acquired because of the split, which I also doubt. "
bad,fast paced position when the work is not in progress. Didn't care for this job or the management
bad,"Unorganized, horrible management, verbal screaming, no lunch breaks, working from 7am to 10pm at night. Very stressful."
bad,"If you are looking to work in a shop where those that do very little work get praised and allowed to change job positions on the fly, look no furthur."
bad,"The place is very dirty and machines are antique if you like bathing in chemicals you would love it ,they have the worst managemaent I have ever seen the plant manager was a safety person has no idea about production ,the floor supervisor was a janitor and the production supervisor is like a giant sloth they have no idea whats going on in the plant and DO NOT. Care about any of their employees all I can say is stay away"
bad,"Upper management not focused on vision of the company"
bad,"Managment wastes money- In general bringing in and out new temps instead of hiring temps that have been there a year or more and know what to do. So NO JOB SECURITY, Priorities about updating the ventilation systems, process machines, etc. are low and building new buildings, putting safety slogans throughout the plant, putting up employee suggestion boxes (that managment no longer looks at because the newness has wore off of them), having 3 new rules a week(because like i said plant managment has not a clue on what she is doing and is wandering aimlessly.), installing cameras and forklift alarms seem to be more important. Plant manager took away all of the worthy bonuses that the employees deserve and work hard to earn., Employees do not matter to this plant in Wyoming, IL weither you are a full time employee or temp. The employees give their all working all the time with hardly any family time and there is nothing rewarding for them. The employees there keep the place running not the plant manager."
bad,"- experiencia no campo de trabalho"
bad,Management very inexperienced. Lie to employees. Play favorites. Group is very clicky like high school. Company doesn’t adhere to its own policies. Flowback and wellhead in red deer would do very well to have a management change. This company has gone downhill extremely fast when Past management teams left. They also only have 2 major clients so if those shut down there is not enough work to go around. Grass is really greener elsewhere
bad,"Local estressante e mal gerenciado, setor abandonado e com péssima comunicação entre equipes."
bad,"Drama filled, Clique's, The hardest part of my job was lack of support from management"
bad,"A lot of work to do.  Nice people."
bad,"entry level positions with little training. CBT based training"
bad,mandatory overtime to the point of 84 hours for some of the employees in the course of a week.
bad,"Management in the Pennsylvania region is terrible. Just God awful. They lack honesty, and communication skills. They will try every thing in their power to take money out of your pocket."
bad,"Day one your rallied into a conference room and given the company history and then told how happy they are to have you there, hmm. Afterwards you are forgotten. Demands are placed upon your shoulders. No valued training provided no mentoring given. Software sucks and no one helps you to understand. The parking lot is huge without cover. To park close you have to donate a portion of your salary to the United Funds to park close (within 200 feet of the door). Bad area of town to travel for lunch. Salary is ridiculously low for any job classification.What makes FMC so great, still wondering."
bad,I would never recommend anyone to work for FMC. The culture there is very socialistic.  They have a huge Micromanaging style of management. The programs to work with there are way over kill NX.
bad,The management was very awful. FMC was a very disorganized company that had no control of the employees. Some employees talents and work effects were over looked due to the managements lack of care. No raises were given when asked for. The time between being at home and working was very unstable. 87% of the time you worked for FMC you were at work.
bad,"Observer work i found it very awesome work and i inlove with it,  i was working on a tuna vessel ""Albacora Seis"".  All west coast of afrika,    "
bad,"I worked as a temp for FMC and it was a waste of time. They gave you remedial work with the hardest part of your job was cleaning up after the Ph.D employees. The Biology team was the worst. The team was constantly back stabbing each other and arguing. Poor management, no advancement, and very rude people that sums up my two years experience with FMC."
bad,"Empresa passa por um período de transição. Anos de sucesso consecutivos no Brasil, colocaram-a distante da busca por melhorias no que diz respeito a gestão de pessoas, gestão da performance comercial e excelência operacional em geral."
bad,Many temp workers rather than permanent employees.  Not a very good training program.
bad,"Typical day would be assigned job tasks that were associated with subsea equipment. i learned a lot about hydraulics, pneumatics, HPU's, and subsea equipment. the hardest part of the job was understanding product."
bad,The place was every stressful to work at. But the place was a place were you can make living for you and your family.  Working there in the shop you can get all the hours you wanted with no problem.
bad,"I worked as a contract technical writer for a subsidiary of FMC. They were a great place to work, except for the fact that the right hand did not know what the left hand was doing. They were still having growing pains, but when they couldn't deliver their first article to a very large customer, who canceled the order, FMC management decided to cut costs by dumping all the contract workers. I worked till the six-months mark, and that was it. Too bad, it had many advantages for me; good rate, short commute, friendly but overworked personnel. The CTO was a great guy."
bad,"In efficient Management skills and consultant oriented. No body take responsibility for problem, they always blame for low level employees. Where as problem occurs in upper management."
bad,"FMC overall is a good place to work, however in the IT field my opportunities were very slow in coming. FMC supplies support and equipment for oil and gas operating companies"
bad,Cultivates and tolerates a management practice of mobbing. Many good people run off and even careers lost. Hope new proposed legislation will force the  corporation  to enact an environment of cooperation to replace destructive practices
bad,"its a job, my checks never bounced yet. they really need to clean house and remove some of the old way of thinking people"
bad,"Worked for the company for several years and met great people, however the advancement opportunities are slim to none. Several years of layoffs with no end in sight."
bad,Managers request that you work more than 40 hours per week. Most employees work beyond 50 hours per week to complete job assignments. Not a team oriented work environment.
bad,"I enjoyed my job and coworkers.  I love people!  However, the owner and the management wasn't ethical.  High turnovers! No benefits or paid holidays.  "
bad,The management was struggling to deal with the local Union.
bad,once you hire on its very difficult to move up into company you have to be hired out at one particular job or move off to move up you cant at your locale location
bad,good company but if your not friends are family your job is not secure. The trainning is great but if you dont follow under the bosses friends or fan list your days are numbered.
bad,none at this time started out great but went down hill when new management came in. was over looked for promotion when it was suggested that i was going to get it provided the best design review ever according to the project manger but the gave credit to some one else
bad,This job requires a lot of time at work. 12-16 hour days. The leads there feel like they can do whatever they want. It has been 2 years since I’ve worked there.
bad,I would not recommend you work for this company.  It is very haphazard and it's sort of a miracle it continues to run.  They are going through a major overhaul - hopefully for the better.
bad,"The company is constantly making changes to the structure, laying off high performers, and implementing strategies that make no sense. No raises have been given in the past 3 years but employees have been asked to take on more responsibility.  The company does not recognize employees that perform at a high level and has taken a passive aggressive approach in an attempt to get employees to leave.  There are no opportunities for advancement, instead any responsibilities are transferred to existing employees.  For example if a manager leaves they will not promote to replace they will just give another manager that responsibility."
bad,the management is terrible and the compensation is way low. the lack of schedule makes planning anything impossible. paycheck errors every time and no room for advancement.
bad,"they brought in the leftovers from a better company to run their office, huge mistake. They only care about numbers not employees. I worked there several years. This Odessa office is horrible. what a shame and kinda sad"
bad,"management totally has your back when things are good or when a job comes up that ""they don't want to go to go do or supposibly ""have no one else to go"". but other than that, they wont hesitate to throw you under the bus to save themselves or blame someone . coordinators constantly try to take your days off away from you while they go home every weekend! incompetent coordinators !"
bad,"If you're okay with a new boss every few months, you'll enjoy the pace at FMC. They hire wonderful people, but those are the ones that never stick around."
bad,"The current leadership lacks the full understanding of what the work force does on a day to day basis. They continually put managers in place that do not understand the product or processes, possess little or no working knowledge of the equipment and services they provide,  and have little or no hands on experience in managing others. "
bad,tied immediately to market fluctuations rather than on going development and caring for employees at all levels.  Core values are promoted but not at all supported.
bad,"Foi uma organização que me lançou no mercado, trabalhar nesta empresa foi uma boa experiencia pois foi minha primeira empresa que trabalhei e foi dentro da FMC empresa que me veria no futuro e me contratou como seu inspetor"
bad,Wyoming facility was a traditional facility where driving change was difficult.  Worked there 3 months and wasn't a good fit for the company.
bad,"FMC was a family type atmosphere that was focused on quality manufacturing and service with a strong emphasis on safety.  Once the market started to decline, this all went out the window.  It is all about making money at any cost."
bad,"While the benefits and salary are good, there are so many better places to work where they'd better appreciate talents and personality."
bad,Salary and benefits at FMC are competitive.  The Green River unit has multiple plants onsite.  The current culture is hamstrung by Managers more concerned about maintaining their power and control over their respective areas than doing what's best for the company as a whole.
bad,"The Company has good work for its employees in the new product development team. I've worked on lots of creative works during my work time and have gained good experience of product knowledge and work experience. Performed multiple qualification testing and also provided manufacturing support for the components i designed in the plant at Malaysia. The NPD Team work life always asks you to work a little more than you have too because your accountable for several designs and clarifications."
bad,"Rarely saw teammates.  Most all meetings done via Skype.  Rarely saw my manager.  The PM  had no experience in the field that was being managed and provided wrong guidance and decisions making a situation that could have been done well, done with 11th hour stress. The PM was more of a meeting coordinator and note taker and couldn't provide a project plan. There was a huge gap in communication of what was being told to the team from the PM vs. what was being reported to the manager from the PM.  There seemed to be a total 'shoot from the hip' attitude and no real structure. Issues reported to the PM were blown off until they became urgent and then reported to the manager."
bad,"Very stressful environment; a great deal of dissension with rank and file employees due to management neglect."
bad,The company was in survival mode for the last year and a half with thousands of lay offs.  Very chaotic with the constant title changes and organizational re-structures.  No one really knew what their job was anymore.
bad,"Constant changes in direction due to poor choices by management."
bad,Good Flowback Company with a good reputation in their perspective market. Management takes care of you for the most part. Was let go end of March due to the low market demand. Benefits start the first day you are hired. They aren't as good as they use to be but they aren't terrible. 401k is good. They match up to 5 percent and contribute an additional 4 percent but you have to be there for 3 years to be fully vested or they recoupe their contributions. If you have family this job is not for you. You will be out of town living out of hotels 21 days straight at a time and barely get to see or talk to them. The hotels aren't always the nicest either. You will live off of fast food and convenience store food for the most part. You will work in every element of weather. The pay is good but the opportunity for advancement during the downturn of the market makes its highly unlikely that you will get promoted or receive a pay raise. Also Management has their favorites so when there is limited amount of work those select individuals will be the ones working while the rest are sitting at home.
bad,"Poorly managed, core product was buggy, transition from buyout was poorly executed. Employees weren't managed well, some did drugs on the job, the rest had to do the work that the lazy drug users didn't do."
bad,"No longer room to advance, my management team sees no need to move or advance it's hard working employees."
bad,"I was given very little effective training and based on what the job description was and what I was actually asked to do, there was no real connection between the two."
bad,FMC was a great place to learn as a new graduate engineer. Industry economics have eliminated opportunity within the company and management decisions (or lack thereof) are driving out talent.
bad,"Management was changed several times. The corporation seemed undecided as to the direction they where going and made several changes to then change back to their previous way, It was a great company but seems unorganized with new leadership."
bad,"Management is hit and miss. Some bosses are excellent, others are dishonest, clueless, and poor communicators. I've dealt with both."
bad,The pay was ok but not enough base on cost of living in area. I work with so many different people at the location . I like the workers and the experience. I did not like the unpredictable schedule. Never knowing when I might get off became a problem.
bad,"FMC was a great place to work, the staff and management were very friendly and great to deal with, overall good place to work and an organized environment"
bad,"A very busy and fast-paced shipping/receiving position, but helped the day go by quickly.  Verified shipping/receiving paperwork.  Made sure that outbound drivers signed and dated the shipping paperwork.  Sealed the outbound truck for security purposes.  Helped with inventory counting one to two times per year."
bad,"A typical day started off with inspecting all of our equipment and performing daily logs and tests. Then it was hard labor and cleaning and rebuilding our customer's frac iron. The process started off with recieving the iron, via serial numbers for each piece, by inputting the numbers in our database. Then after creating a scope of work for the pieces, we can inspect, UT, MAG particle, rebuild, pressure test, paint, and final inspect the iron. I learned a lot about the frac industry and the major companies involved in it. I also learned a lot about hard work, dedication, and perserverence. My coworkers were easy to get along with, but not many like to work hard and earn a paycheck. The hardest part with my job was dissassembling trailers and units. Also dealing with the dissorganization of the shop, and the poor leadership at the shop. Our manager was never to be seen, and he had broken some of our companies policies that he was never dissaplined for. I think that lead to complacency of my coworkers and leadership. There aren't many things to enjoy about this job except the very rare barbeques we had. Most of the guys are jokers, so that made my days a little uplifted."
bad,"Hi, I am a productive person willing to learn and work as part of a team."
bad,I worked their for a long time.  Laid off and never called me back.  At the time that I was laid off I was the most tenured person there for my division.
bad,"Very fluid at this time. Changes taking place effectively leave some employees behind. Management like to play favorites. Supervisors and managers sometimes over task with too many responcibilities leaving no time to do a thorough job. Upper management always looking for infractions and someone to blame."
bad,"O trabalho era interessante , aprendi controlar emoções , manter a seriedade e a firmeza , independente da situação . Sobre a direção e a gerência era um pouco distante e infiel quanto as obrigações , porem sempre nos tratava com muita educação . Os colegas trabalhavam em comunhão , e não havia muitas atividades em grupo . A parte mais difícil era se destacar em meio a tantos bons profissionais , e a parte mais agradável era superar as metas propostas ."
bad,"As time progressed, the work days have become tiring, annoying, and sometimes just dreadful. I have learned a great deal of finding and troubleshooting problems, pressure testing, and finding safer ways to work. Management is very indecisive. The shop is poorly managed and it is reflecting upon the technicians. The most difficult part of the job is dealing with engineering that copy and paste procedures that have the same problems from previous projects that have yet to be corrected and presenting a problem and the solution to the problem to management and being told to do the opposite of the solution which clearly shows that nothing will get accomplished. The most enjoyable part of the job is when I first started working at the company."
bad,It was a great place to work but some management was undersirable because of not being honest with employees. Last minute jobs and lack of communication.
good,"Poor management. Benefits expensive for a big company. Long hours, lack of communication. No degree behind your name you didn't matter. Poor training, no job security or advancement. Did not work around school schedule."
good,Great Team to work with.  Co workers are a great bunch of guys. 21/7 Schedule can be pretty grueling. Managment is pretty good with the guys.
good,"Pay is super low.  DO was so bad.  He prefers the one he hired, not neutral at all.  They do not fire anybody.  They want to keep just warm bodies, and it makes good people go away."
good,"Management is very inexperienced, well educated (college degrees)in fields they don't work in, at the company, which leads to a lot of mistakes, slow growth to recovery, and compartmental structures. Their inability to openly communicate issues and track them through process monitors, is either arrogance or incompetence to understand they need training in their areas of concern and how to properly resolve complicated and changing issues. I have worked for a company that did many good things to keep themselves competitive, but this company makes money to spite themselves, they are in some aspects a jewelry department, with the additional mark up of the product. They are losing millions of dollars a year in wasted time, productivity, material mismanagement, and customer satisfaction. I have learned a lot in what not to do, through my observations and experience of working at this company. Due to the recent cuts in the last 2 years, people are shy of ""rocking the boat"" against the close nit mid-management that work with the Vice President and keeps him out of the loop."
good,"Lack of management involvement"
good,"non viene valorizzata la persona e tantomeno viene tenuto in considerazione l'esperienza e i miglioramenti che il singolo può dare."
good,"As a technician, a typical day includes many different tasks of assembly and testing of assembled items.  Most of the time other tasks are passed down that are not normally the responsibility of a technician to include Production Control and Quality Notification assignments.  All good things if you want to advance and learn how the entire department works. The problem that exists is you will not advance unless you are selected by the hiring manager before the job is posted.  Management doesn't always pay attention to the technicians and expects them to be technicians for their entire career at FMC.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with management and their lack of respect for what you do on a daily basis, even when you do more than is required of you and expect nothing in return."
good,I was a former lead mechanic. Typical day consisted of being harassed by US airways. Co-workers were the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"typical day would be completions on a rig such as testing landing hangers and trees etc. management is not that great, co workers are ok. hardest part of job is dealing with management. most enjoyable part of job is direct deposit"
good,"wonderful people to work with. poor management. lack of opportunities for minorities. racism in the workday"
good,If you are a contract worker to become full time I wouldn't try hiring here. I mean they treated like an employee but they would drag their feet on advancement or full time position.
good,"for a large company they had very poor benefits.  They had several management changes.  Overall poor cross communication, and the Human Resource Department at my plant was horrible."
good,"You are treated completely different if you are a Technician       "
good,"Via this employment, I significantly improved my specialized and technical knowledge of automation processes and with control system discipline’s concepts, practices, and procedures. I was encouraged to use my experience, judgment and abilities to plan and accomplish project and technology goals."
good,"Not a place to spend a lot of time, you should move on as soon as possible. i do not know how much more I can say about how bad it is to work for this company."
good,"dismantle oilfield assets, inspect and rebuild. there was always something new to learn an new challenges daily. management was alright could use some improving. coworkers were helpful an we worked as a team the best we could. After learning the job and requirements there wasn't much difficulty to it. I learned a lot in short amount of time."
good,Just not a good atmosphere to work in.  There isn't enough money that comes with any of the positions.  There also isn't much room to move up.  Not what everyone thinks it is.
good,"Good benefits, great peer people. Management is totally indecisive when it comes to providing needed resources. Too much red tape with unfair expectations."
good,Good engineering company but sometimes things are overly design. And it make things difficult. Engineering supposed to serve its purposes in a practical way.
good,"Worked in the Houston machine shop for ten years. Slowly, as managers were shuffled around or fired, safety, quality, and production began to fail on all levels. When the oil market crashed, it gave executives the excuse they needed to move machining operations overseas. As layoffs began, a culture of fear took over the workplace. In the end, managers on all levels(many of whom contributed vastly to downturn in machining performance) began to lie, maneuver, and basically break every staple on the company code of ethics. But then again they found a way to keep their jobs."
good,"The company is positioned to ensure business in the region is at a good pace despite economy.  HOWEVER, there is a huge push to bring in high level managers who know nothing about the business or the company.  These people are making unwise management decisions that will eventually sink the subsea portion of this company."
good,"dia típico: sem muitos problemas"
good,Most of the crew is just there for their next big check. They don't always do the job and safe as they should. It was good money but it wasn't the safest environment.
good,"FMC was a great place to work. Really enjoyable. Everyone got along, and you felt like you were a respected member of a team. Within the last 6 years manangement changed and the culture went steadily downhill. The technical staff is overworked and remains unsupported. Finger pointing is everywhere and the only concern of management is to protect their own career. It is really sad. This company was a gem. Now it is a lump of coal. Everyone from the technical department to the operators feels like they must constantly watch their back. Everyone is afraid to make a decision because of potential consequences."
good,Work life balance is an issue at FMC. The culture is high energy and the people are very smart. The pay is not competitive but benefits are great and opportunity for growth as well.
good,"I started as a contract employee, after serving my purpose and performing well above what was expected of me, I was let go with no prior notice. This is after an explicit conversation with my direct manager promising me a permanent position. The week I came back to work from my wedding, 4 months before the birth of my first child."
good,"at the time of my employment, educational opportunities would arise but were not encouraged for attendance outside of the work environment."
good,stressful when they are busy.  I learned that you have be buddies with the correct folks in order to keep your job.  Culture they should have an incentive program and offer more for the employees.
good,not much work/life balance. managment did not seem to care either.not much room for advancement.no raises
good,The management turnover has had a devastating affect on this company. The safety culture at this organization is broken.
good,"Great working environment and great learning center. You get to learn a lot about subsea and interface with other groups when working on a  project. There is a big issue with management, the majority don't qualified to be a manager. It seems the less work you do and the more brown nose you do, the better chances of becoming a manager.  Don't waste your time applying for internal positions, management already knows who they want. You have a better chance on getting promoted outside FMC."
good,Several jobs lost.  They did the reduction in force in a long drawn out way.   They took several months and used people until no longer needed.
good,"Worked on challenging projects involving Consolidations, Financial Reporting and Support in a Global CoE environment."
good,"I worked there for 2yrs & 2 months gain a lot of educational knowledge, benefits are great and pay was good. Enjoy everyone who I worked with,  but I was just tierd of the same routine."
good,"I enjoyed my time until I was told to train a person to whom I would later report and they where new to the industry."
good,"Started as a temp. and was asked to be on full time. Really hard work fast. I was told no travel, well when i was asked to be full time I would have to travel 26 weeks a year. Could not do that, they told me to travel or find another job, so I found another job. I dont know how many times I almost got into a fight with one of the employee, he was a vet. and on meds. for controling behaviors. He was good at his job but he was always starting a fight with all the new ppl. Because he thought everyone was out for his job. Company would do nothing about it because he was good at his job."
good,"Toxic work environment with minimal support from management (individual clinics), Heavy unrealistic workloads/that are not compatible with TAP(some clinics). The company is working to improve."
good,"A typical day at FMC consist of logging into your computer going to your Ticketing System and helping users with different issue that range from user management, computer issues, voicemail issue, and network issues."
good,"Great company but to much favoritism threw out drilling department. It is sad to say but no matter how hard you try and how much you teach yourself out side of your normal training it goes without notice. The reason is because the hiring of family and friends over ride your skill level, no matter how much over time you put in to prove yourself you will never know if your not in the ""good circle"". The one's who notice your hard work don't have the courage to speak up because of these family and friend bonds so your left behind."
good,"The facilities were really nice. The work is boring repetitive and not interesting. FMC values training to the extreme, where the majority of the first year is attending pointless training."
good,"Good people were shuffled through and not appreciated, quit on a regular basis. Any sort of attempt at creating a structured environment was met with resistance, not only by local megalomaniacs, but a so-called process manager who was stuck in the frame of mind that we're still living in FMC of 2005, and only that person can suggest and/or approve any new ideas. Attracting and retaining top talent, was a lie! They should have declared ""We're looking for the most crooked people-preferably ones who will steal from FMC as a whole"""
good,"With the current market, FMC Technologies is having problems procuring projects to add value to the company.  I have made it through 2 rounds of layoffs and have no confidence in the stability of my position within the company."
good,If you live to work you'd be right at home. The work environment is toxic and detrimental to long term health. Literally.
good,A typical day consist of waking up for dinner have a bite to eat then heading out for a 12 hour night shift. when at work there is many things my night could consist of from rigging in miles of steel pipe to taking high pressure samples. I also on certain jobs look after the green hands and make sure that they are doing there tasks in a safe manner. I as a senior operator am also responsible for them and any equipment that we use during a work day and am suppose to inform the supervisor if there is any sort of problems.
good,"a typical day at FMC was inspecting all parts manufactured by the machine shop, reviewing all quality notification, assisting other departments."
good,The job was good. It paid well. But  sometimes you'll work almost twenty hours. Then have to be at work at seven in the morning.
good,Friendly environment.  Multi-cultural.  Lacks stability and solid foundation.  Riding coat tails of parent companies. Needs to establish itself in oil and gas sector.
good,"Core values and dedication from top to bottom to implement those values make for a good and enjoyable work place. Management seem at times to work in a vacuum and forget the full process it takes to manufacture a part/product, timing and planning. Very good health benefits and company contributions to the sponsored savings plan for the current business climate."
good,"I worked in a shop tearing down and rebuilding drilling trucks.  We had to inspect and test each piece to make sure they were safe enough to be used again.  It was tough but enjoyable work with a decent pay, however, it seemed like an ""every man for himself"" kind of mentality in the management and almost all of the employees had been there for less than two years, which made it seem like long term growth was uncommon."
good,Management is not the strongest aspect of the company. Further discussion should be in person or over the phone.
good,"A typical day at work is a Safety Meeting at the beginning of the shift. Grab something to snack, and start review where the last shift left off to pick from there and finish the project."
good,A typical day at work would be long hours of standing while recording tests on graphs and charts. I learned how to record and produce accurate test documents. The management was ran alright. My co-workers were outstanding and hard working until the job was done. The hardest part of the job was trying to push work out with no time for error. The most enjoyable part of the job was when everything was running smooth and on track.
good,"In one hour I'd open up the store and set up the booth displays. There was a cafeteria next to me so we shared the kitchen when I baked the treats for the day. I had to stock up for the first rush hour and prepare the coffee's & tea's. After that, count my drawer and make sure that the cafeteria on the other side was presentable and stocked. There was always a line awaiting for the booth to open. So the rush started immediately. I have never seen only one person working and pretty much running a Starbucks but I did it. Though the cafeteria next to me held about 17-30 employees I was asked to help them when they got busy. None of the employees wanted to get trained for my side they said it was to hard, so I couldn't depend on them for help when it got busy.  Before I was hired I was told it would be me and another lady working, come to find out she was only there for two days to train me and I work the store by myself. It was a lot of work for one person to the point I wouldn't get a break until the next shift came in and it would run into overtime that the manager didn't want done. I asked for help and was told it was coming but come to find out it was a replacement for me because they didn't want to pay another person to work. The day I was fired ""I was told they love my customer service and the customers love me, but they said this is a one person job and they are not hiring no help""."
good,it was a nice company with nice people who tried to help you out as much as they could if you needed help.
good,"Get with a great department that values your input, dedication and abilities otherwise you will be left on the outside looking in. The department I worked at was fairly young and the re-structuring did not help form any sort of stability. Other than that the company is great."
good,"My experience at this company was not good. Initially, they focused on the product quality then shifted to total financial performance which caused the product quality to fall sharply which then in turn lost business and profitability"
good,Started off as a great company shift in upper management changed culture of company. Towards the end of my tenure at FMC most employee's were unable to focus on their jobs due to the constant layoffs
good,"Direct manager was incompetent and a micro-manager.  She was intimidated by my expertise and played a lot of office politics. "
good,"I learned how to refurbish trip tools, function test single trip tools and ridged lock."
good,The people that work here make it worthwhile. Great company culture. Seemed like there was a reorganization very often. Sort of disorganized. Lots of layoffs where business dried up.
good,company in transition.  Organizational structure flattening and many mid level managers are being let go.  Market conditions are weak to support growth
good,The department I worked for wasn't family oriented. Their main concern was numbers only. More laughter and fun would have made this job more enjoyable.
good,"worked 12hr shift M-F, Some over time.i had more experience than most of the mgrs for the wellhead side.the culture was real good as far as safety. Clean work place in the front of office and in the shop.When i was there, we needed more hands to help build and repair and all other functions of the shop. the people were great to work with."
good,You have to play the buddy system in order to move up in this organization. There is a lot of talent on the floor but management fails to see that and use those with talent to their full potential. Management is more worried about production and numbers than anything else. There are some great people that you get to work with and if you do play the buddy system then the sky is your limit so buddy system here I come.
good,"If you want to have an impact immediately this is a great place to start your career. You have to thrive on change. Mobility is important. And a no fear, risk-taking personality will take you far."
good,My input would do no good because of how long ago I worked there. I am sure it is different now. I worked and got trained for 8 months and then they let me go. I was just getting my feet wet in the oil industry and was hired as a drafter but they really needed a designer. My experience there was a learning experience an thats it.
good,"create 10 to 15 quotes or jobs for all gulf coast customers daily."
good,"Multiple changes in management every year for past 5 years with limited prior experience in this line of business.  Made it difficult to "
good,"análise do perfil creditício de clientes, analise de risco de credito, atualização cadastral e bancaria, recuperação de credito. Aprendi a ser um profissional mais dedicado do que já sou, a definir minas próprias metas."
good,"This is an ideal place for anyone to start out of college."
good,"FM C Technologies  is good company to work for. At the floor level you do not learn a lot to advance your career, but it has career opportunity."
good,Company operates on a rotating bi-weekly rotation. Shift hours often change without notice .
good,"This job is very tedious everyday.  I have learned a lot about chemicals and also I am a maintenance mechanic and have learned a lot about fixing and troubleshooting on equipment such as pumps, lines, welding, fabrication etc.  I have also been a crew leader so I have some of what goes on behind the scenes as well."
good,Analytical Chemist/quality assurance
good,"A market leader, FMC offers a very good package to its employees at all levels, it develops its staff and offers the highest level of techninical solutions."
good,The environment at FMC is great. I love working here and the other employees are very nice and friendly. I will recommend this job to people. The job culture is alright
good,Empresa oferece excelente benefícios e remuneração.
good,"In my experience as an 8 year employee for FMC Tech, I worked hard and was always searching to gain knowledge of the company and the process. I was constantly and intentionally overlooked and disregarded which was unfair. As I worked hard and gained my Bachelors, I was continuously disregarded by my executive team and never given the opportunity to learn so I could advance. More politics and favoritism that would equal to the term ""The Good Ole Boys Club"" and the blondes with more fun would get the higher raises and promotions."
good,"If you want 8 .m 4 p.m daily schedule then it is a good place."
good,not a bad place people were great but the management was clueless and always kept you in the dark about what was going on.The main bosses came and told everyone things were fine then they shut shops down shady
good,"The benefits are typical,however the health insurance is high deductible only, no stock purchase plans are offered."
good,It is a great place to start your career. Nobody hold your hands to learn about the business. You will learn from the job and people around you.
good,"* work life balance in day-to-day activity"
good,"Empresa boa de se trabalhar, bem dinâmica com bom ambiente para se trabalhar."
good,"I enjoyed working for them, a lot of knowledgeable guys, a lot to learn with people willing to work with you and teach. Laid off due to the slow period in the field ."
good,"The pay and your colleagues at FMC is what makes people stay.  Unfortunately all the good people are leaving and the people that are replacing them are not as skilled or qualified.  Work/life balance for me was good for me, but I don't think others would say the same thing.  Some managers are great, others aren't so much.  You have to have the right connections to advance and move up."
good,"If you don't mind an hourly wage, being on call 24/7 including holidays, not having a weekend, being afraid to answer your phone in fear of it ruining your good time, getting extremely dirty 90% of the time, and working outside 100% of the time then this job is for you. If you don't mind dealing with A-hole company men, and socially awkward rig hands and coworkers then you'll fit right in."
good,"Typical work day consists of opening email first things resolving issues with foreign location in the UK."
good,"The only reason I left FMC Technologies is because I wasn't comfortable with the way things were done over there. There were a lot of shady practices, and two months after I left the entire night shift was fired, along with half the day shift, and all management above them (about 16 guys all at once). At least one employee got federal charges. If I had stayed, I would have been forced into that or face being shunned by the other guys."
good,"This company started out as a interesting place to work,but gradually become more corporate as it underwent an acquisition by a larger company stifling innovation and company morale."
good,"Mostly great staff that work well together. Fast paced and high stress at times, but everyone seems to work well under pressure. Salary was great and the times were flexible."
good,"The environment at FMC is very fun and is simultaneously productive the employees are friendly, kind, and workaholicps. Nevertheless,  these fellow employees and co-workers had been treated fairly and justly, with the utmost respect,  by their peers."
good,"very demanding place to work.  they are a little fire happy and no compassion.  They did fire the HR manager , i would say it was deserved.  "
good,fmc is a great company with many benefits and great pay. The people are good to work with. Safety is a priority and will always be put before production.
good,"Not the best place to start your career, at least under my manager. Very little freedom and lots of pencil pushing of forms and other tasks that always felt like a waste of time."
good,overall good place to start somewhere to get training. fmc is know for training and moving on to bigger and better things.  The pay is ok but could be better.
good,"Good people, communication betweeen employee and management can be improved, safety-driven environment, good work-life balance, Provide training of learning new skills depending on the project"
good,Took part in a school based work experience and went to FMC technologies in dunfermline. I explored many areas of the company however it never felt like the company was conducive together.
good,"This company is a oil, chemical and energy company. IT support will provide mobile provisioning for user to work at home, when they are out of office."
good,Before the merger it would take an act of congress to get fired. The slowdown and merger lead to some drastic changes which left thousands fighting for their job. Still great at promoting within.
good,"The market conditions impacted the structure of the organization and then the merger with Technip really changed the flavor of the company.  The company really needs to focus on what it wants to do - in other words, do they want to be an excellent engineering and field development company?  Then maybe the company should not try to manufacture sub-sea components and let the experts (other vendors) handle that.  People seem to be confused as to the direction of the company and people are losing confidence in management.  Moral has dropped.  The first 12 years, 5 stars, the two after that 3 stars, and the last year 2 stars and then the great layoff of 2018.  There have been a dozen layoffs which further added to the confusion and decline in morale.  Layoffs happen, but most companies have one big layoff and then people can move on with their lives.  But the layoffs seemed to hang over everyone's head for over two years and that didn't help people stay focused and be as productive as they should have been."
good,"If you end up with a good manager, you'll be okay. If you end up with a bad manager, don't expect HR or anyone to help you. Bad managers run amuck at FMC. There is no manager training. Upper management doesn't care how employees are treated as long as the job gets done. If you're a woman, don't expect any professional development, advancement, or professional respect. Salary for women is far less than that of their male counterparts."
good,it is an okay company
good,"If you crave being a number at a big company where IT and HR rule supreme, you'll love FMC.  Lots of micromanagement and oversight.  I have no idea who the CEO of FMC is, I certainly didn't interact with him/her at my level, so sure I approve.."
good,"Its certainly a young mans world. The hours are long, work is difficult, and not a lot of cooperation in the field. Certainly not for the feint of heart and takes a lot of dedication. A good career field for starting out."
good,lindo grupo de trabajo buen trato con los empleados
good,"You end up being a number.  They preach valuing people, but in the end, there is no such thing. Performance doesn’t matter as I had 1 of the top performing regions in the company. But I was still laid off."
good,"A typical day at work varied from designing products, to a bit of project management, to testing equipment, to researching potential improvements. Management is typical corporate management, and culture is stymied by the overbearing documentation requirements. The job is interesting but it is hard to get things accomplished."
good,"While the technology of the AGV's is  interesting the amount"
good,I've learned many things working for FMC. It's a good company and it has many talented people within it's organization. I would not be where I am today without them.
good,Good company. Work is hard but rewarding. Manufacturing can be boring when coming from the service industry. Good pay and benefits. Promotions from within.
good,Maintenance for United Airline's baggage handling system.  A sophisticated automated system which requires constant monitoring and maintenance 24 hours a day all year round.
good,"Some good projects to work on and interesting people on both sides, operators included. Opportunities within the company were limited where I was, it may be different elsewhere, but the work life balance was excellent."
good,"Recommend price changes based on a profitable margin."
good,Excellent place to find challenging career opportunities and work in a global market place.  I enjoy the requirements for leadership and problem solving.
good,it was a very long time ago.  I left there over ten years ago. I really don't know what it is like there anymore. I honestly do not know shat it is like at this time. I left a very long time ago.
good,"At FMC, the work environment was on a routine schedule...on Mondays, you knew what you were doing for the rest of the week..On Fridays, they had free from different customers."
good,"receiving inspection product coming in we log it in that we receive item after. we have data put in the system we separate it and send item to there destination, rework area are new product area"
good,Professional and friendly work environment. Could have better emphasis on training and advancement. Good chance to learn on the job since many responsibilities.
good,bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb
good,Management seems to be more self preserving than business preserving. This might have changed due to recent acquisition by Technip. Only time will tell.
good,"Recent downturn in oil and gas plus recent merger with Technip has left a tremendous void in employee development and commitment to such employees.  3 consecutive years without merit increase's,  continued layoffs and a toxic work environment make it difficult to stay passionate about your role.  Former GE executives have been promoted to Senior Positions and have applied similar management tactics learned while with GE-  Employee's now are only a number with an increased work load as the work forces continues to shrink and stock holders maintain a strong portfolio.  I truly enjoy 95% of the hard working, brilliant, awesome people within FMC, but there is only so much you can take from management before you question why your skills go underappreciated year over  year.  A simple thank you goes miles FMC-  miles."
good,FMC Corporation is a material handling equipment manufacturer. My position as Cost Accountant allowed me to work with all areas of the company. I was part of a great team of employees.
good,great opportunities with a growing company. fast paced environment really committed to quality and safety. great people to work with within the organization.
good,I was originally hired on for night shift which was twelve hours. As the company started to make plans to relocate and started down sizing I took on the dayshift. This lasted two years and I was the only one in this department after they reassigned or let go of the other four workers.
good,Excellent company to work as an intern. Advanced into full time upon graduation. Excellent jump into the industry and oil and gas field.
good,"Every position I held within the company required a lot of hours due to the high demands. Objectives are unclear, but the whole company worked tirelessly to achieve goals as a team. Bad management of personel generally led to many interpersonal upsets with employees and management. Its a good company to learn from as you will be able to assist in most areas of expertise and learn ALOT."
good,Past paced environment with both routine and non routine testing requirments.  Small department that is well organized and multitasks well.
good,"En god arbeidsplass med sterk faglig kompetanse og høyt arbeidstempo."
good,Hard work. Always on call when you are on your days on. Good management and most of the people are easy to work with. Hardest part of the job is dealing with issues that come up on locations. Diagnosing and resolving them.
good,"There is lots of talk about a strong culture, but in reality only new employees seem to live it. When you work in a quality role, you should never be told by your supervisor that: ""You are being too accurate"" Unfortunately this is what you can expect at many levels. I will not say that this represents everyone, because it does not. But there is enough of this mind set in the wrong places to sufficiently impact total quality.There is much more focus on production and on-time delivery than on quality, which is counter productive at the end of the day. One hopes this will change but it is becoming less less the case. Quality preached more than practiced. Lack of Sustainable and effective systems,Pay is good, but get what you want upfront, increases are few."
good,It has a good platform and system for learning and knowledge development. It can be consider the best among its competitor.
good,"I enjoyed my relationship with the suppliers that I worked with.  I would rather not discuss FMC itself at this time.  Majority of HR was not concerned with the workers, only management."
good,"Always unpredictable scenarios on any given day. Learnerd a lot about oilfield equipment, surface and subsea. Management was hands-off and allowed you to do your job.Co-workers were mostly enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of job was leaving. The most enjoyable part of job was having my own shop."
good,"Great place to work for."
good,Tree Assembler- Built oil rig trees and valves. and drove the forklift and help build trees for the oil field and help test
good,I was a material handler level lll/assembler. This company is very strict to the point unfair. Be careful if you decide to work for this company they will not think twice if you have a minor accident with will lay you off. The only good thing about this company is they pay triple time for holidays and double time on weekends. I had no hardest parts of my job.
good,great place okc base though is the worse management is difficult a lot of people will sabotage you just to move up in the company
good,Small company feel in what is now becoming a large global company (integration in progress).   Flexibility in supporting projects.  Very nimble commercially.
good,"Empresa agradável"
good,Typical day at work involved testing and troublshooting welhead valves. Co- workers were friendly. I learned to test and chart graphs.
good,"The job is what you make of it. There are three shifts; days, nights, and weekends. The day and night shift operate on four 10 hour shift Monday through Thursday. The weekend shift works 12 hour days Friday through Sunday. The job is customer demand driven and can be very fast pasted at times. Work consists of getting dirty, greasy, and sweaty disassembling and reassembling iron used to frac and cement gas wells. The pay is usually good for the area the shop is located in. Over time varies from shop to shop, which is driven by customer demand. Technicians are required to travel up to six weeks a year if needed by the company."
good,The rotational program isn't the most structured and sound program the company has to offer. The management wasn't very clear on objectives but expected you to change the company within a short period of time. There is no objective metric to base performance for each individual worker.
good,Good company. I was very proud of the work that I did for the company. The culture at the Corporate office is very good. The company tries to maintain a good moral.
good,There was absolutely no support from upper management district managers just got thrown to the wolves so to say with no guidance
good,"Typically a good company with a lot of positive growth. More focussing on improvement plant in process and capability ."
good,worked on subsea equipment and enjoyed the projects that we did
good,Always got hours there with overtime. Good benefits. Was a good place to work at then it changed. People higher up lie all the time. Fire everyone who has a  opinion. Pretty much don't care about you
good,"My 7 years with them I've seen mainly Engineers right from college"
good,"L'environnement de travail au sein du contrôle qualité réception est excellente, un véritable esprit de camaraderie est installé. Une équipe où l'atmosphère de travail y est très bonne ou le stresse au réduit à son minimum. Le chef dirigeant cette équipe est extrêmement compétant, toujours à l'écoute de ses hommes et à leurs apprentissages pour un meilleur contrôle du produit et une meilleur connaissance personnel. "
good,Good systems.  Good people to work with.  Benefits and pay need to be better.
good,Great company with good benefits and compensation in a fast-growing industry.
good,"I created technical manuals for Army ordinance (tanks, etc.). This was hand work, before computers were used for graphics. Then I was the editor of a weekly company newsletter, getting feature stories from other employees, and also promoting the various vehicles we were producing."
good,Typical day:
good,"I am working as a travel nurse at a FMC clinic. The staff has bent over backward to make me feel welcome and to help me in any way they can. I did not receive any training with FMC, so it was difficult adjusting to the computer system without instruction. The patients have also been great. The one problem that I do have at this clinic is that Monday, Wednesday and Friday the staff is expected to work from 4:30 a.m. until 9 or 10 p.m. These days are killers! There are 3 shifts on these days and it is non stop running. Most days I don't even get a lunch. There is usually at least one call in a day, so besides our own work we are trying to fill that empty spot. I honestly don't feel they would have so many call ins if they would split those long days up. I have been told that they used to do it that way and everyone was much happier. After one of those long days, I can hardly function for 24-48 hours afterward. I have been there for 11 weeks and have had the same schedule since I started. I went to work this morning to find out that I wasn't supposed to be there. The schedule wasn't put out until Saturday afternoon, and no one bothered to call me and let me know I would not be working my regular days. This type of this is frustrating. These are the types of things that get the staff upset. The upper management doesn't seem to care how hard they work the staff. They have some very good employees, but they are loosing them left and right due to the schedule and treatment they receive. It's sad."
good,"In the field, the company is strong. HQ needs to be more involved in what is happening in the field"
good,My last two years were the worst two years of my working career as an adult. Reasons I will not document here but are directly linked to the culture at FMC at the time.
good,"I was only at FMC for a short time and I do regret leaving."
good,"The company Once Upon a Time was an awesome place to work with great managers and coworkers it felt like family for so many years. But, over the past 4 years management has taken a turn for the worst. This company has shown the employees how much they truly care about them. And will continue to loose good people if they don't get thier act together."
good,"Many benefits at FMC, pay and future opportunity is lacking. Great management and staff. Much has changed with the recent merger and much of what used to be done in house is now being worked over seas."
good,"I was grateful for the opportunity to work at FMC Technologies.  They did a lot for their employees, great benefits, and I respected my boss.  I'd recommend working for them."
good,Had an awesome time working in a multi cultural atmosphere where people are friendly and well advanced in what they do as well the developmental skills. FMC is a place to stay or life! If you love working hard and learning all corners of Oil & Gas this is a definite yes place to work and grow .
good,This company encourages innovation in products and production processes. It is currently suffering due to reduced demand for deep ocean exploration equipment.
good,"Management priorities shift frequently. CEO took multimillion dollar bonus in a year the stock price fell 80% Good product, safety culture. Production, logistic methods not standardized world wide."
good,"Upbeat, young atmosphere with focus on performance.  Good prospects and training opportunities. Excellent place for starting careers and very good salary."
good,"A empresa é excelente e me deu muita oportunidade de  aprimorar o meu conhecimento, assim como conhecer diversos equipamentos diferenciados. O único ponto ruim é que atualmente está bastante instável e há muitos conflitos por interesses pessoais, devido à toda crise."
good,this was a great pace to work and would still be there but was downsized.  the workload was heavy at times but manageable and the people I worked with were very good and professional in all they did.
good,The pains and joy of working for a fortune 500 company.  They treat there employees well on the surface but will not stand behind you if the rational decision turns out to not be the best in hindsight.  Managements main concern is getting to the next promotion.
good,"good for training, I met some wonderful coworkers. I travelled the world. I have learned alot but it is a company that needs to improve alot regarding on how they treat certain employees. there is still some injustice."
good,"Pros: the people, good family-work balance, compensation, growing industry"
good,It's a good balance between work and family. My manager really understand the family value. It's nice to come to work everyday and work with a group of nice people.
good,"we assembled oil field equipment as on needed basis,had to meet a quota everyday. also had pretty good co workers and management.the hardest part of job was the heat ."
good,"– Till day)"
good,Operating in the Frac Flow Back division is a healthy blend of physical and mental tasks.  Setting up and tearing down the equipment is physically demanding while the operation of the testing equipment is mentally challenging.  Troubleshooting problems and recognizing the effects/physics of flowing gas/oil wells through testing equipment can keep one on one's toes. All traing is on the job and all essential skills and knowledge is learned while performing duties day to day. Both teamwork and unsupervised work are expected depending on the size of the crew ranging from 2 man to 10+ man crews with day and nightshifts.
good,If there was adeqaute staffing would be a great place to work.
good,"Transfer phone from answering service, take calls, greet customers and visitors to the facility, keep employees informed of important Human Resource dates and materials, data entry for several departments, and ordering supplies for the HR department. Transfer phone back to answering service at end of day."
good,A typical day at work is busy. There are lots of materials coming from the warehouse department that requires inspection. I have an amazing quality team always eager to guide through any challenge. My job has made me learn how to use qms-sap.I find the job interesting.
good,FMC is a large corporate government contractor that has a very rigid structure to its development organization. This makes for development jobs with a narrow scope of responsibility which seems to stifle innovation.
good,"I enjoyed my time at FMC due to the team I had reporting to me my direct Manager and Director. It was a pleasure to have 9 likeminded individuals working for me that had the same work ethic as I did when I was a System Administrator.  The hardest part of the job was the culture or resistance to change, it was hard to get anything implemented due to the lack of cooperation from the other 6 counterparts we couldn't agree on anything so not much was done other than planning out our system upgrades. Not having a CIO proved to be detrimental to productive progress.  in the end having the down turn of oil prices and multiple redundant positions it was understandable the amount of layoffs that we had."
good,Good place to work at.  There are very flexible.  They will cross train. They have many shifts that will fit your Schedule.
good,Hires highly qualified people.  Maintains high work standards.  Everyone works as a team - very enjoyable.  Management is typical as in other large companies.  Some are in touch; others not so much.
good,"Honestly never had issues with the team as far as drama or being thrown under the bus. The only fact that they shut down our division with no pre planning, just a quick call from Texas saying by the way your 2 million usd under so terminate all your guys in the field. But during the final meeting of our ends they have management out there making big mistakes that got them ran off and yet a selected few of us are getting calls to get paid more to come finish the job as contractors."
good,"It was a good job, but I was transitioning into another career path and needed to relocate. My Manager was a great guy and left the positioning so I also left to seek other avenues."
good,"Overall a good company, but very volatile to the industry changes and oil and gas prices. Overstaffed and thus volatile to market changes in prices of commodities. Could have been running a little leaner initially in order to prevent such high lay offs when the industry took a hit."
good,"Bon environment de travail, les conditions sont bonnes."
good,Good environment to work in but the work can be very mundane at times. At other times the work is very interesting.  Not much of an opportunity for project management experience.
good,"Grande experiência adquirida, relacionamentos profissionais."
good,"O trabalho é permanentemente dinâmico, pois há sempre prazos a cumprir. Aprendi a gerenciar o tempo e ter foco para resolver problemas ocasionais e pontuais. Tive gestores bons e maus. O convívio entre os colaboradores é harmonioso. O fator complexo, são os feedbacks que as vezes não são compreensíveis. O desafio de concluir o trabalho com qualidade e dentro do prazo exigido."
good,Entreprise qui donne la chance aux jeunes malgré un marché compliqué.
good,"I had a great time learning new technology and advancing my career there, work on QNX and cutting edge computer vision, management was great, very communicative and the co workers exemplary."
good,"They are a diverse oilfield company, that is generally concerned for their employees. Very customer centered company. Great staff to work with. Lots of long hours."
good,This is a company that has done its best to be suvessful no matter what is happening in the world. Unfortunatly the Wireline division was not one that fit into their longterm business plan.
good,"Empresa tem ótimas instalações, refeitório. O clima de trabalho é muito bom, lá eu realizava operações de pontes rolantes, teste com pressão e operações de plataformas elevatórias e montagem, teste, manutenção e inspeção de equipamentos."
good,"The company opened an office in Kansas City with the thought of having several executives move here from Philadelphia, but then they changed their minds and I was hired to support then, so I was laid off."
good,"I loved the shift work with this job... a week off every 3 weeks!  The pay is very good, the company is cut throat though.  Overall, I would go back in a heartbeat because of the pay,."
good,Det er ingen dag som kan beskrives som typisk. Prosjek jobb er fullt av utfirdringer.
good,"With TechnipFMC what you put in is what you get out of the company. There is not a lot of room to advance at this time due to the market, when thing pick up there will be."
good,"O ambiente de trabalho  e a convivência com as pessoas é maravilhoso. Aprendi, e continuo aprendendo na empresa"
good,"empresa boa, bons beneficios. não ofrece muita oportunidade de crescimento."
good,"lots of work turned iron swivels. Plug valves, pressure testing assets, lots of swinging a sledge hammer 10-25 pounders great group of people to work with lots of training"
good,"12hr shifts a lot of change in management, a lot of overtime some guys are willing to train you and not burn you.Very safe work environment.Shifts starts with safety meeting and work scope for the day.They do provide luncheons for the technicians over time on holidays with holiday pay is available.You will learn different types of pressure testing setups at various test pressure ."
good,My review with this company that it is a good company to work with if your job does not get moved to another location becuase they can pay someone else less
good,"long hours"
good,"I think FMC is a great place to work.  "
good,This company only requires a once daily EVS service. I am looking for a full service account.
good,όμορφο περιβάλλον και καθημερινή συναναστροφή με κόσμο !
good,"It was a great job, but I felt like my department got lost in the shuffle of all the other business units.  Also, being a satellite office/warehouse made it difficult to partake in the fun stuff whenever the main office would have employee appreciation activities."
good,"This company focuses primarily on employee safety, project on time delivery, quality of goods, and cost savings or cost avoidance."
good,"I worked for the Employee Service Center (ESC) which was responsible for the payroll and benefits for 25,000+ employees.  My duties included the monthly billing of the payroll and benefits expense to the division level.  It was where I learned a lot about payroll but unfortunately it came to an end when the Company decided to outsource these functions."
good,"After working for FMC for 3 years, I would hesitate to work there again. Although I made a decent amount of money, given the hours worked each week compared to the time off, I do not feel it was worth it in retrospect. However, I did gain some solid experience and enjoyed my co-workers. That being said, I felt the middle management had little to no say in daily operations due to the corporate structure. This left many employees feeling undervalued and unhappy with the way the company was headed."
good,"I worked at FMC Technologies full-time (More than 2 and a half years)"
good,"Salário muito abaixo do mercado, e sem muito interesse em promover seu funcionários."
good,"Eram apenas 6horas de trabalho, onde tinhamos que passar por diversas situações de negocioação.A gerência bem flexivel, os colegas de trabalho existia muita conversa."
good,Company runs really lean. I perform the job functionality of 4 people where my workload is backed up over 3 months and more work is always being assigned.
good,"Uma excelente empresa, mas a liderança exerce partidarismo onde deveria ser um ambiente democrático. Formação de grupos (panelinhas) que contribuem para que medidas injustas aconteçam ."
good,Overall FMC was a great job and they gave me opportunities to grow and advance however the industry is very unstable (I endured about 4 different lay offs during my tenure with the company)
good,Continuous work from morning till evening and sometimes we have to work overtime without benefits on locations due to shortage of manpower from client side and company side
good,"Excelente ambiente de trabalho , uma empresa ímpar quanto à aprendizado, desenvolvimento profissional excelente.Problemas em relação a promoção , o que leva a desmotivação do profissional."
good,"The position that i held at this company was good when the industry was on a good note. But as a TSP there was never a guarantee that you would get work."
good,"Tons of room for advancement."
good,"lots of confusion , not very well managed. No communication between field employees and office personal. Management never gave you a recognition for the hard work put forth."
good,Management and engineer oriented working environment with little consideration given to industry standards in the design and drafting environment.
good,"It is a good place to work but you need to accept low pay and high stress.  They do a great job of training and trying to prevent layoffs, which are two huge plusses."
good,"I have worked on pipelines, well pads, and at coal mines. I am used to long days at work at not scared to get dirty. At FMC we installed wellheads and did maintenance on valves. Also opened valves before they could frac the wells."
good,"Empresa muito boa de se trabalhar, porém com sem grandes perspectivas em aproveitamento dos jovens aprendizes da minha área."
good,"Boa experiência profissional e de ambiente de trabalho."
good,"Great for a single man. Not much work life balance. On call 24/7, in general good people to work with. Be prepared to be away from home, sometimes weeks at a time."
good,It doesn’t take a hard worker to work here but it does take a hard worker to keep your job you can be replaced very easy and it doesn’t take much to be replaced.
good,"Una empresa comprometida con dar oportunidades a estudiantes ya que trabajaba y me daban disposición para mis horas de escuela, aprendí mucho de esta empresa."
good,"team environment, high pressure,  long days, long work weeks home life and work balance needed improvement, good team building events wages was above other service contractorsl"
good,"i learned everything i needed to know in less than two months and haven't gotten taught by anyone nor anything new. job is pretty simple and most of the people are very great here. i just don't agree with most of the management as well as the people themselves the field sup and cord are useless terrible people that have less experience in the oil field than i do and I'm half their age. all I'm saying is this place is based way to much on friends, but thats how i got this job so i can't complain to much."
good,Work was really challenging and rewarding. Worked with Chemists and learnt a lot of new things. Open to new tools and technology which was refreshing. Hard part was the long meetings and hence had to work long hours to complete the work.
good,FMC has been a great place to work at these last 8 years. The medical and retirement benefits are some of the best around. Competetive pay alongside yearly bonus makes it hard to beat
good,"Det var veldig dyktig firma fra 1991 til 2013"
good,"All in all, my experience at FMC as a whole was a good one. I met a lot of great techs across the board, that for the most part, were pretty professional, and always willing to help out. I know this isn't the case across the industry."
good,good company. not the best salary but very decent. Good atmosphere. Lot of learning. I would definitively recommend it to friends and colleagues. No major complaints
good,"I loved my job, and I loved the people. When I was let go during one of the many Reduction in force layoff's I was devastated. After working for this Co. for 10+ years. I was escorted out like a criminal, It was very demeaning. I hope I never have to go through this again. "
good,"super entreprise d'inport export, le travail en équipe est très agreable"
good,great pace learned a lot and if they wanted you to learn more they sent you and payed for school as a machinst we made sure everything was right but still had time have snacks on floor and radios
good,"I really enjoyed working at FMC Technologies except there were some ""bad apples"" in management.  One particular manager had a 100% turn-over of all his project managers within 2 years."
good,"assistance téléphonique, gestion des documents a transmettre et rédaction de  courriers"
good,"No job security, poor management and HR is a joke. Growth potential is limited due nepotism. Really enjoyed the benefits offered through this organization."
good,Good place to work with great people. The workplace culture is fantastic. Very helpful coworkers. The training provided was second to none as well as the benefits.
good,"Great group of guys in Washington, PA. Management unfortunately was worried more about bonuses than providing the field operators with the proper support needed while on locations."
good,Good people to work with. Opportunities to seek other jobs within the company. Experience of middle management similar to others I have worked with.
good,I enjoyed working here. They have a lot of very knowledgeable employees in various departments. I learned a lot about process management and engineering while here.
good,"Trabalhei, por 18 anos nesta empresa (já incluindo, o período antes da aquisição pela FMC) e, foi muito gratificante, todo este período em que estive nela."
good,"The employees at FMC are great to work with on a day to day basis.  The newly built Generation Park facility is truly state of the art and has a lot of amenities to include an onsite cafeteria, starbucks and gym.  The company gives great incentives for a healthy lifestyle.  The 401K matching is unheard of in this day."
good,"Challanging and fast paced work environment."
good,This is a great place to work for several reasons. Hours are flexible as long as projects are completed. There is a positive working environment.
good,steady and challenging work for safety culture company. many different areas and systems to learn and  to add skills related to maint
good,"ambiente stimolante e dinamico, ho lavorato in completa autonomia"
good,"Being on call 24/7 can be daunting at first, but crews are usually provided with time off and some sort of scheduled work, jobs, and shifts to balance the work weeks out."
good,The most enjoyable part of my visits to FMC is meeting other people in the workplace and learning about there job role and experiences at FMC and past work. The people that I meet are always happy and willing to give advice and share there experiences.
good,"Super group to work with, very helpful and knowlggdeable about their plant and surroundings and very understanding to a newbie"
good,Fun place to work. Relaxed atmosphere but busy.  Co-workers were great to work with.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a great group of guys.
good,"Great company with great benefits.  The pay isn't the best, the management is sort of distant and it seems difficult to advance."
good,"Wonderful work environment, really enjoyable colleagues. Company is still recovering from rapid growth and is settling into better structuring. Middle management not incredibly qualified to lead, but getting there."
good,"The management is good and fun co-workers to work with."
good,Empresa que fornece muito aprendizado. Pessoas colaborativas.
good,"FMC has given me a lot of opportunities to grow throughout my career here. I got the chance of working in various global markets including North and South America and Europe, Middle East and Africa, and had the chance to build on my marketing, strategic planning, business development and project management skills. "
good,"Recrutement :"
good,The company was a good company to work for when i started.  Management declined over the years.
good,My daily duties are verifying invoices along with attaching document support into SAP. Ive learned alot besides scanning and verifying invoices. I had the priviledge to learn International processing and invoices as well as clearing bank payments. My team sees that I pay close attention to invoices and catch alot of incorrect items. They also see that I get the job done very quick and in a timely manner. My co-workers teach me other things that will help me meet my career goals and gain more knowledge in Accounts Payable. I have yet to come across a hard moment in this role. I enjoy my work to the fullest because I am willing to learn.
good,Empresa Muito agradável com uma ótima cultura corporativa.
good,"Empresa com muitos talentos, bons funcionarios e boa estrutura de trabalho. Gerentes acessiveis."
good,"A FMC Technologies é uma empresa que tem muito aprendizado a oferecer para quem nunca trabalhou no mercado de óleo e gás. O dia-a-dia de trabalho é sempre muito dinâmico e os colaboradores de grande parte dos setores são sempre dispostos a ajudar para o desenvolvimento de quem chega.Mas como uma empresa que teve um crescimento acelerado num curto período de tempo, ainda há processos não definidos, fazendo com que atividades sejam realizadas conforme o que cada um acha ser a melhor prática. Mas mesmo o problema pode se tornar uma oportunidade, pois com isso existe a demanda de desenvolvimento de vários processos ainda embrionários."
good,"um funcionário sempre atento, ao bom andamento do serviço."
good,FMC is an interesting place to work.  Being part of the law department provides a variety of interesting issues and challenges.
good,"* Currently FMC have adopt Lean Manufacturing process."
good,working in many different locations within the oil and gas industery around the world
good,FMC is very organized and by the book. They are big on safety. They pay less than competition and benefits aren't that great.
good,Great experience working in the Human Resources migration department.
good,Locating Manufacturing equipment in chemical plant facility.
good,A large enough company to provide a global footprint and opportunity but small enough that employees don't get lost in the shuffle and become only a number in an organization
good,"FMC is overall a good place to work. It is a fully air-conditioned shop, which is nice in Texas. The pay is above average for the area and the benefits are pretty good."
good,"6am start opening the unit & start the machines up & lining them reddy for the paiteints to go one when they arrive at 6.30 am. Warm friendly arrival of paitents - make a cuppa & biscuits for when the nurse has put the patients on there machine, Check emails file paper work, update records in a arranged fileing system, order stock within  a stock controlled system. ( Esker computer ordering system.) Keeping up todate with the staff clinic indexs ( health & safety issues & staff training indexs ) check deliverys, & keep up to date with the every day runing of the unit."
good,"Management needs to focus on saving money and hire people that have managed before, not just a degree. This job gave me 120+ hours a week so the pay was good on that part."
good,FMC is a great company that knows how to treat it's employees. My first real job out of school and I was a different person after I left work each week. The on site cafeteria is awesome. Lots of company sponsored events to attend through the year. FMC offers lots of training courses and groups that you can join that not only helps you to grow professionally but personally as well.
good,"long hours and the people make it worth the long hours. i like the work,the office just likes to send the techs on trips to work out of the countryy on a hours notice."
good,Supervised 7 accounts payable clerks on a daily basis including reviews and vacation plans.
good,Maintained staffing as well as management of faciltiy overseeing financial and clinical outcomes
good,FMC was a very employee driven company that took care of you. Since it merged with Technip in 2017 the moral has been terrible. So bad that many people have quit without having any back up in place.
good,"Working with SAP was new maintenance toll I had to learn. Ordering supplies and working with a union group was also new and had some hurdles I had to learn to either move or go around. New plant, learning the production and finding the right resources, also knowing how to use the resources and be productive. Overall  I welcome the challenges and made it a every day goal to be able to raise above the problem or situation."
good,"FMC is a global company, structure in IT was not configured during my employment there. The 1 year Mentor development program was a very good offering."
good,"not afraid of advancing. This company offers plenty of possibilities for growth for the ambitious ones."
good,"Depending on your department there is flexibility with working remotely. The organization tries to keep an inclusive corporate culture. Be aware when negotiating salary, they have no problem paying you well below their range to save money. Two people can have the same job and earn 20k pay difference easily."
good,"This company was good to work for. Work/Life balance was nonexistent in the beginning but I learn to manage my time. Its a decent culture, was laid-off wouldn't have left."
good,Gain a lot of knowledge if you are willing expose to new technology.Friendly environment and having a good and friendly American General Manager.Can highlights matters that can benefits the company.
good,This was a great place to work. Seems like everyone knew who everyone else was. Nice friendly place. The only reason I left FMC was that I got a what seemed like better offer from another company.
good,Overall - this is a good company .Enjoy working with my team and management.  Great place to work.  would recommended workplace to friends if there is an opening
good,"A good Company with potential, but depends highly on how the Oil industry is doing - which in recent years, is very much up and down."
good,"great coworkers,clean environment but very fast pace environment"
good,"Great environment for ""go getters"" when industry was booming. Tough and stressful now during the down turn. I am certain the industry will turn around and with the merger with Technip there will be bigger and better things to come for FMC."
good,really enjoyed my time here at FMC.   I've learned many thing and have gotten the chance to grow and make myself better while being employed here at FMC.
good,"great company to work for.  in my experience, there was many things that changed over the course of a year.  this was from management to process and procedure.  If consistency were to fall onto this company, internally, then it would definitely make it to the #1 spot."
good,"Otima empresa, bons beneficios, plano de carreira deficitario."
good,"As a intern, they just give me simple job to do because at that time I was certificate student, so clearly they not trust me to do something complicated to do. I learned on how to make a complain or report about hardware to be replace, troubleshoot computer problem. The hardest part is none and I do enjoy my job as intern"
good,"Muito boa."
good,Good work place with work life balance. It has great opportunity for learning. Communication between various levels can be challenge and little team building efforts.
good,FMC is a great place to work. The company culture encourages training and development of personal skills. There are a lot of intelligent people that understand the importance of doing and great job for the clients as well as being there for your family. I highly recommend FMC Technologies as an employer.
good,"FMC Technologies has very competent employees. However, I found the communication between and within groups to be less than adequate. For whatever reason, employees do not seem to share information."
good,Managers need to be overhauled.  Managers and buyers get promotions based on everything but qualifications.  This was not always the case but since the down turn people are watching out for their friends rather than those who should truly hold the position.
good,"everyday there was something new I never stopped learning new things. my manager was very helpful hands-on, my co-workers were nice never rude and always willing to lend a hand or advice to prevent injuries. the hardest part of the job was the pressure testing I did not like very much. but overall I liked the experience that it has taught me along with team work, being organized, and hard work."
good,"I worked here for just over 3 years and I enjoyed the majority of my time there.  I learnt so much about the Oil & Gas industry and found it hugely interesting."
good,Great place to work when the oil field is booming.  With all the cut backs due to market conditions everyone is stretched thin.
good,Good Company to work for. However management is not proactive enough. Needs to be more stern with employees. Tend to promote employees and assign them to projects that are deserving.
good,"The day at work varies, according to the work load."
good,"A empresa possui um bom ambiente de trabalho, é líder em seu segmento e desenvolve novas tecnologias."
good,The service technician position is a challenging job in a dangerous environment. FMC has a strong safety oriented culture and they do everything possible to keep their employees safe. I enjoyed solving the difficulties presented on each job site and felt a great deal of personal satisfaction when the job was done.
good,FMC is a vibarant organisation with a clear direction of where it is going. With a clear focus on Saftey and Quality as a primary concern.
good,"I have worked in this company two years with well manner and i got some experience in this field and also i have learned how to provide the best service of facilities to client. Meantime, the company provide facilities to personally for improve the quality in service."
good,I have nothing but great things to say its a great culture. Good people and nice safe environment. Mostly all pro the only cons would be they could pay employees better.
good,"When I first started, it was stated working shifts were to be 12 on/2 off...Overtime is what people on the floor wanted and work got done. Things shifted multiple times while I was there and the last I heard was they went to a 4 on/4 off shift. Not sure of how much opportunity there is for a lot of OT now."
good,"A FMC é uma empresa que dá total liberdade aos seus funcionários para fazerem o que desejarem fazer. Ela possui uma gestão tipo empresa multinacional porém no Brasil ela ainda está em processo de transição entre empresa familiar para multinacional."
good,"Ótima Empresa Para trabalhar, uma Das melhores do Rio de Janeiro."
good,"Good job security,Company does not like to layoff during slower times"
good,"Otimo comportamento quando o assunto e seguranca, altos investimentos em protecao individual, otimo ambiente profissional. Beneficios como: plano de saude, plano odontologico refeicao no local (otima qualidade) e P.L.R"
good,"I worked in security for a company that was not security minded, However the production and Mining jobs were great."
good,"Good Place to start and learn.  HIgh turn over. They hire alot through the front door. At the Back door, alot get fired, quit or leave for whatever reason on a weekly basis.  Bad Planning on management and who they like."
good,"good company if your limited to the area. managment structure is a mushroom     "
good,"Nice place to hone skills.  "
good,"Journée chargée de demande de client"
good,I've learned a lot of important things. I have been offered the occasion to be very productive. Very challenging projects.
good,"Uma das melhores empresas do brasil na atualidade no que se faz, bons salarios e hambiente bom de se trabalhar, aprendi tudo que sei aqui, mais estou a procura de novos desafios."
good,As atividades diárias eram bem dinânicas e exigiam especial atenção dos colaboradores.
good,"Great training, and spot awards.  Good team work and friendly environment. Big on process improvement, but a little low on actual execution. Strong safety culture and Quality team."
good,401k matching was great idea.  Travel available if you wanted it.  Leadership was good for the most part.  Somewhat groupthink mentality.  If you were part of the group you were good.  Lots of different options for jobs available.
good,I started as a tech in the shop and moved Lead tech. After a few years of that I moved into a coordinator role. So there is room for advancement. But the marked is down and there are several people that are stuck with no window to go through.
good,"Took some time to modernize, but processes improved. High stress, but manageable, volatile market. Good opportunities for employees. Lots of room for advancement, good pay, great benefits."
good,"FMC was a great place to work. The people there were friendly and eager to help one another. However, as with most oilfield companies the work/family balance is very weighted on the work side as I typical work 10 hours a day in the shop and might go offshore over the weekend."
good,Flexibility is good. Benefits are good. Large company so jobs are available across the United States. I had a good supervisor that was very helpful and supportive.
good,"Overall a great place to work, excellent benefits, good working hours, close to my home. Provided ongoing education, worked with people from all over world with different cultures,"
good,"A typical work day would be 100 miles an hour from the time you walk in to the time you leave. No one day is the same from the day before. You are met with new challenges and problems to solve. I learned many skills and was afforded may training opportunities which is one of the great things about this organization. The hardest part of working here was finding the work life balance. There is a lot of pressure to achieve goals and there are a lot of goals to achieve. Some days you will complete a lot of tasks but non of them may apply to your goal. However, it was fulfilling when a goal or milestone is reach to feel accomplished and satisfied all your hard work paid off."
good,Good working style but employees facing some problems this will be cleared management  to very soon I have believe this    we waiting for that I hope to that
good,Good place to work but the subsea industry is changing. Good work work/life balance. Good benefits. Opportunity to shine exist but up to employee to find them and make a difference.
good,"Worked there for many years, most of them were great.  Work lif balance is good.  The HR group needs some work as they are not very well trained.  Overall a great place"
good,"At FMC I had the opportunity to learn from leaders in the field of MCC food additives. I enjoyed the entire experience my 10 + years there.  "
good,"Exciting projects to prevent the job from being repetitive and boring. "
good,"Being a Subsea drilling technician has its ups and downs, and FMC treats its field hands with the upmost due diligence and will teach you as much as you're willing to learn and train to better yourself and your career. On the other hand if a mistake is made even with true honesty they will scapegoat a hand in order to cover their own blame. All in all FMC is an outstanding company and couldn't be a better choice for anyone looking to make a career with a company that will treat you well for your time well spent with them."
good,Well established company with strong teams and direction. You know your role and expectations but still have the freedom to help make a project successful.
good,"Decent place to work, although being oil and gas, advancement can be limited and job security is not the greatest. Management seemed fine, i had great management in my division but never really met many outside of my area."
good,"Em geral um bom lugar para trabalhar com um bom ambiente e uma cultura de preservação dos interesses do cliente, segurança e qualidade."
good,"Spend at least 60% time on emails. High tempo and fast paced working environment from tender review to sourcing / procurement, manufacturing strategy. Review demand and supply scope to manufacturing targets, translate S+OP into manufacturing plans, review warehousing and logistics needs / constraints for large tenders to ensure footprint and space adequacy. "
good,"Everyday, I report to my direct manager, accounts payable, HR, and HSE."
good,Amplio conocimiento del campo asistencial relacionado a su rama
good,FMC offers wonderful benefits and takes care of it's employees.  As a global company the opportunities to meet diverse individuals is endless. High level management can seem a little disconnected from the field facilities at times.  Safety focused culture from the top down.
good,A strong culture for safety which is always a plus. A good ethic for team building and good service. Striving to be innovative
good,"Everyday on the job we would typically just watch and monitor gauges and record all the data. I learned how read every kind of gauge, how to rig in all the pipping,how to use certain tools that are needed on the job. Management was wonderful, always helped with just about everything when needed. Coworkers.. some were great and respectful. other weren't so friendly. Hardest part of the job was the drill outs. Most enjoyable part about the job was driving from and to different states"
good,"1- Bastante Agitado"
good,"I work at FMC Technologies, Not FMC Corporation."
good,"The company was great until FMC Bought Pure energy services. They are a large company that treat you like a number. You are a salary that is expendable, like most large global companies."
good,fmc is a nice place to work. I like the guys I worked with we all worked good together. I would like to work for this company.... fmc is a good company to work for management was ok not the best but ok the hardest part of the job was working at night
good,FMC offered me the opportunity to lead a team of scientists in developing process for design and execute laboratory toxicology studies required for product registration according to global regulatory requirements.
good,The management was getting shifted around and it was hard knowing who to talk to. The benefits were hard to beat from any company and the pay was pretty good but it was hard to move up in the company without knowing someone high up or having the major skill set to be considered. overall good place to work but the warehouse was not in working order and getting parts was harder that need be. The moral was kinda down due to the downturn but overall it was a good place to meet some great people.
good,"With hard work and application, it was easy to move up."
good,"Great company, but lots of politics. The company provides great 401k match and really good benefits. You only get paid once a month so it's good to manage your money accordingly."
good,"Just typical days at work, Always learning new things everyday and FMC really help their people progress thru their career. We also face new people and learn to deal with different cultures and environment."
good,"A typical day at work consists of solving a technical issue to satisfy several goals with no easy answer. This is both the hardest part of the job and the most enjoyable part of the job at the same time. "

good,"Great job, great benefits but no real room for advancement. Great people to work with."
good,"FMC allows you to be independent and freedom to work without micro-management. A fast growing company that offers great security and room for advancement. My only complaint with FMC is that there is no such thing as a vacation. They expect work on weekends and evenings to get the job done. I wouldn't mind that once in a while, but it never stops. Vacation days can happen, but expect to work on just about every one of them."

good,"The company has been around for more than a century but it is run like a start up. Most of the management and workers are very young, under 40, and it can be very stressful."
good,"A typical day at FMC can be fast paced and you may be required to work in a different area each day. Because there is so much work at times,  employees often work unsupervised. Everyday can be a learning experience, but what matters is doing the job safely and accurately. Often times, management is at the mercy of their employees and must depend on the knowledge of their crew to work on projects from start to finish. FMC's culture on the floor is safety first, and anyone can stop a job if it  appears that there are safety hazards. The hardest part of the job, but not difficult, is bringing a project up to speed that is behind by hours, and doing it while maintaining a safe and organized area. The most enjoyable part of the job is after all the hard work and hours put in to over come QN and non conforming parts is seeing the customer finish product being shipped before the due date and knowing this is all a direct result of you dedication to work as a team."
good,"Local bom para desenvolvimento do colaborador"

good,I would work from 9am to 5pm on a non class day or 9 to 6:30 on a class day. I would look over course curriculum and change it accordingly to new system updates and requirements. I would provide a safe work environment for students to perform hands on instruction of the robotic maintenance procedures laid out by the company and the clients. Management was very receptive to new possibilities in training update and would send us off for more training  constantly to make sure we were up to date on all the goings on for the robotic systems we needed to work with. I can't say there was a hard part of the job. If I need something I just need to ask and if I had a question I could alway get a hold of someone with an answer. My most enjoyable part of the job was the people. Everyone cared for what they did and were so happy. Both staff and students were always engaging and upbeat. I still get calls from students that need help in the field even though I am no longer with the company.

Oferecem estabilidade e não de costume da empresa trabalhar pressionando os funcionários."

good,"I worked at FMC form 2005 to 2009 i love working for the company. "
good,"Very busy work place and interesting place to work. "
good,"It is a great company. Willing to teach you and my manager was good. Very stuck in their old ways as a company need to revamp how some things are approached for instance projects and qoutes need to be more aligned. Handoffs from Qoutes/FEED studies are awful and salesman tell customers unrealistic delivery dates. I know that all sounds bad but they really are a good company. They have a gym that offers classes, cafe with Starbuck, carpooling incentives, flex hours and plenty of opportunities to move. My co workers were all great."
good,"Fast pace job and very important duties, managments fair  co-workers great and work as a team hardest part of the job is just keeping everyone happy as far as customers and meeting requirements on shipping times."

good,The airline industry is volatile at best very up and down. Corporate tried to smooth this out as much as possible but layoffs still happen. The corporation as a whole has great bargaining ability when it comes to benefits and the result is lower premiums. The local facility Jetway is very heavy industrial and in turn a loud very dirty environment. Fun place to work with great people.
good,"Good environment, good management. Overall there is not much to complain about."
good,The patients of a Dialysis Clinic are the funniest bunch of people I know. They come in three times a week but during this time I as the Clinic Secretary got to learn alot about the patients. I would arrange transport for them and any appointments they had to have.

good,"With our proprietary technologies and production systems, integrated expertise and comprehensive solutions, we are transforming our clients’ project economics"
good,High tech company with a lot of opportunity. Had 3 managers there. 2 great and 1 not so much so. Really liked the massive 401k contribution. That makes up for a lot of what you don't get in salary.
good,"As a technician I learned quickly and was able to move up quickly within the organization, management was very helpful and knowledgeable and the work was long and arduous. Very repetitive day to day, long hours 12 hour days to be exact sometimes you’d work 12 days on and only 2 days off and repeat. Pay was decent, but could have been more competitive."

good,Innovative organization open to change. Senior managers are welcoming of fresh ideas and looking to collaborate with young talent to stay ahead of its time
