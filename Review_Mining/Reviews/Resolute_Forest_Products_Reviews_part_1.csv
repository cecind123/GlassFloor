rating,review
bad,Very toxic place to work. Management  has no respect for there employees. Supervisors are pricks they sit behind a desk and watch the cameras and bark orders. Work with junk things are bubble gummed up to make it run. Would not recommend this place. Very hard place to work. They hire anybody now some can't even speak  English. It's  a messed up place.
bad,Hot work environment horrible management no training no job security long work days 12 hr shifts high turnover just a bad company overall I would not recommend
bad,"Very poor training and no communication what so ever, they expect you to know every safety aspect of the job, but fall short on training. Management is very bad, specially HR."
bad,The culture at Resolute Forest Products is not ideal for someone who wants to work in a professional environment. The culture is very difficult for anyone who doesn't have previous manufacturing experience.
bad,This mill is poorly managed! They do not have enough trained management staff! the most important thing to management is production and if they don't get production they will threaten your job. Safety is at the bottom of the priority list at this mill! I don't now recommend working for this company unless you absolutely have to!
bad,"Very poor management, starts at the top. Try to rule by intimation and threats of shutting down if things don't go as they plan. Manager wouldn't deal with issues as they arise, making things worst. Safety is important as long as production is not effected. Have to have the beloved piece of wood out the door at any cost. Employees are expendable, when you have served your purpose they don't need them anymore. Worked for many companies, Resolute was by far the worst. Avoid if possible"
bad,"Horrible work culture.  High stress.  Incompetent management.  What else could you ask for?  Constantly beaten down and humiliated by management while given no resources to accomplish tasks.  Even if you do manage to do well, you will get kicked in the teeth repeatedly as the company does very, very little internal promoting and would rather hire for vacancies from outside.  No rewards for success, and sometimes even punished for success.  Pay is better than average, but it just isn't worth it in the longterm"
bad,"I worked here for over 20 years.  The managers are incompetent.  They knew less about papermaking than I did.  Micromanagement was rampant.  Managers made sure they knew EXACTLY what time you came in and what time you left.  I was forced to work many weekends, even when I was not ""on call"" to provide data to accounting.  As the ""single person"", I was almost always forced to work Christmas or Thanksgiving.  Don't plan on seeing your family if they live out of town."
bad,"Particulièrement l usine de Clermont, la gestion est malsaine de plus les cadres sans compétences non scolarisé (Ami de.la famille gagnon) l employeur n a aucune reconnaissance envers ses employers.  Il faut ce battre pour faire respecter les normes du travail, employeur sans coeur ni âmes. Elle se crois tout permis elle se dit même au dessus des lois"
bad,"Good pay with poor insurance. New management monthly because of poor run ability and it never improves. This would be a decent job for a single person, but if you need steady employment look elsewhere."
bad,"Horrible work culture.  High stress.  Incompetent management.  What else could you ask for?  Constantly beaten down and humiliated by management while given no resources to accomplish tasks.  Even if you do manage to do well, you will get kicked in the teeth repeatedly as the company does very, very little internal promoting and would rather hire for vacancies from outside.  No rewards for success, and sometimes even punished for success.  Pay is better than average, but it just isn't worth it in the longterm"
bad,"Everyone in management always passes the buck and is afraid to make a decision because the incompetent leaders. This could be the best place in the country to work and the most profitable, but they still have the 1970s mentality. the owners need to wake up and reevaluate the profitability of this plant make the necessary changes and start making money."
bad,"When I see the behavior of extremely selfish, insecure, irresponsible, unaccountable, arrogant spoiled brats, I think of certain top managers at Resolute Forest Products. Some people have no conscience because they simply don't care."
bad,"The whole experience was very disappointing. The job turned out to be very different than what was discussed in the interview.  As time went on, more and more was required with very little training."
bad,"Management is all french, they choose non local contractors so the can fly french contractors in. Not good work exposure for a millwright apprentice, you can expect to clean the shop of oily rag bins, sweep the floor and dispose of garbage and be paid 25$ an hour as a fourth year millwright. the like to get you to use the CNC finding machines to sharpen and change planer head knives, this company has great hourly workers but lacks in the operations supervisory roles, and upper management is favoured to french  speaking people only. think carefully about considering them as an employer."
bad,This company is lacking a forward thinking management and will continue to go down the drain until they make some serious changes. The management that is in place were placed their with a lack of training and more so based on friendships.  If you are offered a job with this company....Run! The staff that is there doesn't want any new employees with new ideas and they run off the new people.  This place is a joke when it comes to management. They pay people to do jobs that they are not doing.  Maybe this was once a good company but not anymore. they lack money for basic office supplies!
bad,"There is a reason they are always advertising for people, staff turnover is huge. Poor wages and benefits. They can't attract competent management so you end up working for supervisors that know nothing and act like little children throwing temper tantrums when they don't get their own way. Safety is a big issue with management always pushing to cut corners to get production rolling. Management style is that of trying to rule by fear, always trying to threaten to suspend people or discipline them, they fired one guy because he took 10 feet of rope from the garbage to tie his truck door shut because it froze open, they disciplined another because they crimped a hydraulic hose wrong, is just some examples. Best advice I can give is find somewhere else to work, everybody else does."
bad,"j'ai travaillé pour l'usine de Clermont , tres mauvais employeur dirige ses employés comme les années 60. Usine remplie de conflits d'intérêts , n'a pas de reconnaissance de ses employés ,détruit l estime de soi, régime de peur et suspension pour arrivée à leur fin . pour la formation et avancement (arrange toi tout seul ) coupure dans le temps formation , je crois que le but est de mettre les bonnes personnes aux bonnes places(conflit d'interet) . Cadre à l image de ce qui a été mis en place avec les années , narcissique. N'a aucune ouverture pour le travail \ famille , seul le rendement de l'entreprise est important , horaires de travail sans ame"
bad,Management lacks professionalism and communication skills.  They are more concerned about production and money than their most important assets their employees.  Very old fashioned.  NOT A GOOD PLACE TO WORK.
bad,"I would not recommend this place to my worse enemy."
bad,The workers here are good thats the only good thing. Management is terrible don't care about anyone and lie all the time.They pay $5 dollars hr less then anyone else. they ride you all day and allways say your not doing a good enough job. The mill I'm at there is 5 harassment law suits.
bad,"J'ai beaucoup appris à travailler en équipes,travailler de façon sécuritaire."
bad,With the newsprint market shrinking and everyone trying to pick up the scraps I feel Resolute has dropped the ball. With shutting down a machine and now maybe the whole mill they haven't been effective with their time or money.
bad,"its loud, poorly managed , treats employees very poorly."
bad,Was good pay and good benefits but the unions had to fight to improve them  and keep them but shift work was hard.Vaction time was decent as was sick pay.
bad,"They were hiring employees up to 3 weeks before they issued a reduction of force. This forced the new employees to leave good jobs, just to get laid off from here."
bad,This company likes to say and do one thing while working towards hidden objectives that the management team may have.  I would not recommend working for this company if you have long term goals
bad,Not a good place to work.  Set in its old union ways.  You don't get promoted by how hard you work or how good you are.  You move up by seniority so not many people are motivated.
bad,"Calhoun TN is one of the most wasteful and poorly managed places I've ever had the dissatisfaction of working at. If you enjoy working with or around other people who hold zero accountability for nearly all work related tasks, this is it.  (Hard working/intelligent humans need not apply) This is a culture based off of a "" S**T where you sleep,"" mentality. Do yourself a favor and spend a little more time/energy with your career search. Good luck."
bad,Racism runs rampant at that mll. They gave their favorite people there. The HR department is a joke. Needs to be replaced. The pay is great and overtime is available
bad,frustrating. Don't work in a toxic environment for too long. management needs more trainings. good people but sad lifestyle. no proper management and precise instructions.
bad,"The co-workers are very much like a family, strong safety culture."
bad,"the culture is very hierarchical, not much improvement in the company and really not open minded. work-life balance is impossible and they make you work like crazy"
bad,"Very quick paced jobs . Not a stable company at this time , shut my paper machine down. "
bad,My manager micromanaged me to the point where I decided to leave. It was not a good work environment. No opportunities for advancement. The management team is out of touch with its employees.
bad,"Les Ressources humaines de cette usine sont incompétent et malhonnête, on ma approché en m'emvoyant un courriel comme quoi il pouvais m'offrir un programme de relocalisation, après avoir été embauché j'apprend que la chef RH refuse d'honoré l'engagement, WOW méfier vous de leur ressources hummaine et de leur belle promesse."
bad,"Due to layoffs and lose of wages, its been very hard to to make a good living. There are no set job descriptions making it difficult to know what is expected of you."
bad,Worked at this place for 14 years worked in three departments. Learned a lot. I've been laid off twice with the possibility of getting laid again. Looking for a job that has a little more stability
bad,Really poor management. They do nothing to help you. A typical day is mostly meetings and nothing gets done. There is really nothing about jobs here that is enjoyable besides the paycheck.
bad,Not Suitable for a person who wants to grow and achieve the best they can. Good pay rate for a decent comfortable lifestyle. Averagely safe work environment
bad,"Too many changes in last 15 years being bought and sold to different companies, not the same happy place to work as it was years ago ,used to be more like a family now your just a number ,,"
bad,Overtime is pulled at the last minute with no warning. A person cannot schedule any family time except no vacations. No sick time. Possible 16 hour days and plenty of them.
bad,"Market has had the particular location I worked at shift into survival mode for a long while. The long term workforce is increasingly jaded and its relationship with management is luke-warm at best. Management trends from recent internal transfers are bent on micromanagement from mid-level down through to the worker level, which is met with a predictable outcome.  "
bad,Travail exigeant et doit être disponible en tout temps
bad,Staff positions get worked pretty hard. Seems like the trades are the only ones who benefit from a lack of staffing since they get compensated for overtime worked. If you are staff expect to get maybe 25-50% of what you put in.
bad,wearing hard hat steeltoed boots ear plug safety glasses gloves production type environment 12 hr rotating shifts lot of overtime hot environment demanding as is most jobs good benefits unfortunately dying market
bad,"This company is struggling to remake itself as a global paper manufacturer. The company recently went through a bankruptcy and is out and starting to make money again. Reorganization is continuous and sometimes overwhelming. But the company is starting to show profits, even in the Newsprint area, which is remarkable given the current state of the industry."
bad,Company directors are crazy about health and security. A lots of people are suspended without pay for insignificant reason. Working atmosphere can be stressful because of the none sense rules.
bad,Management has unrealistic expectations from management staff. They increase workloads without compensation and expect all to act like they are getting the same salary as the CEO.
bad,"coworkers were excellent. not very pleased with the way maintenance was managed. very good training program. lots of long hour days, up to 16 hour shifts"
bad,just good i save some money while working with resolute its way easy to save more money.  i which i could work with them again but just because of the bad management
good,It's a horrible place to work.  Bad staff and nothing runs properly.   I'm not sure how the mill is still running.  I wouldn't recommend anybody working there.  Im.not sure why they would want too.
good,"A typical day at work is a day of unknowns... what you will do, where you will go, how long you will be here."
good,Stay positively motivated. The pay is great. The rotating shifts allow you to have a week off every month. People are willing to help you learn new things but there is always a bad apple somewhere that spoils the bunch.
good,Very stressful and dangerous place to work but you can also learn a lot of different skills. Everyday you would come in and take over the job which your skill set requires. Every work day is a 12 hour shift
good,"Job isnt that bad, but youre micro-managed and the shift is always understaffed so youre always working on your days off. The management is never straight forward, and there is always a threat for a lay off."
good,Very short staffed with high turnover makes it a very frustrating place to work. Management doesn't seem to value it's employees which is causing the high turnover and lack of ability to attract qualified employees.
good,Resolute is a good place to work that is trying to move forward.  this is a difficult process due to the lack of career development plan.
good,Pulp and Paper Industry is an economically challenged industry.  All effort should be made to improve processes in order to remain economically viable.  Failure to do so is a burden to all others in the industry who work hard to be really efficient.
good,"from very old to very advanced."
good,"Been a employee for almost 2 years. I climbed through the 'ranks' fairly fast, but there is a lot of serious occurrences that get brushed under the carpet, or just plain out ignored. A few of the staff members are very nice and knowledgeable in their trades, but the majority of them are just there for the pay and thats it. The hardest part of the job is going in and wondering what stupid stunts the company is going to try and pull today. The most enjoyable is that the pay is very well, and overtime is as easy as signing your name on a sheet of paper. Some days are good, but they are few and far between."
good,"During my early years the company was more like a family.  Over the years, the Paper Industry started to struggle, and Bowater was bought out and eventually became Resolute.  I was serving a special assignment, as the Pulp and Paper Union Rep., as Safety Coordinator.  I was a role that I held for 5 years.  It was this assignment that made me realize that the Safety field was where I needed to be and could offer the best of my talents.  In August, Resolute laid off 180 people, and my special assignment ended and I had to return to the labor force.  I made to decision to stay with the company, even though I had accept a lesser paying job.  I believe in being loyal to the company, but I am ready to pursue my desire to get back into safety."
good,"Very customer demand environment, a lot of order entry. SAP is a great system in today's market if you're an account manager. Very well ran company, enjoy working there."
good,"Once upon a time, this company was a good place to work.  They cared about their employees and you felt that your role was appreciated.  Over the years, through mergers and acquisitions, changes started to take place and company began a downward spiral."
good,"L'environnement de travail le bureau et les facilités sont très biens et comparables à d'autres entreprises."
good,"The position that I do, I enjoy. It is stressful but I work well in stressful situations. I have learned to work with logistics, how the affect of data entry is very important. I have had the enjoyment of meeting some great people."
good,"Hourly workforce is great to work with, but HR does not provide support for the hourly employees. The HR manager does not communicate well with us, and seems caught up in his own agenda. It seems to me that HR should be working more with us hourly employees and also provide better management employee relations. But it turns out that the HR manager wants to be involved more in other functions than his own. Total disappointment!"
good,"Good industrial complex to work at, lots of variety. works twelve hour shifts on a four on four off format."
good,"This used to be a really great place to work when paper was king, they are inherently tied to the market and the market fro newsprint and coated paper is dead. Lots of good people trying to make a difference and keep it alive"
good,Good place has had ups and downs. Since been here went through 2 lay offs. Really not sure about future has been up for sale but not sure what will happen from there.
good,My typical day in the last department i worked started with making i sure i had my proper work equipment eye and ear protection. Then before actually starting up  checking run list on computerThen beginning to operate watching making sure everything is operating properly. There is a 7 step process before the finish project the last is ensuring proper labeling
good,"Dispassionate employees, paid and trained to react to plant interruptions. Sit in a chair and gripe with coworkers."
good,Le secteur des pâtes et papier est très diversifié du point de vue technique. J'ai participé à plusieurs projets d'optimisation et de sécurisation des machines outils.
good,This company is a nice place to work. Well situated and comfortable work environment. Co-worker are friendly and supportive.
good,Originally I have a great time to contribute to the company and improve a good unique work or job to ensure that everything runs smoothly and be creative about your work and all i need is to win and a dream team maker
good,"Good workplace."
good,"Travail avec une équipe formidable."
good,"The site is an interesting place, the crew provided superb support with issues that were a daily task"
good,Job pays well but no balance between home and work. Basically always on call. Job is hot and a 12 hour shift can turn to 16 in a seconds notice. Coworkers are great for the most part. Extremely hot job.
good,Manquement de maintenance lasser à l'abandon manque de ressource
good,"Assisted with the efficient day to day operation and reliability of an entire paper mill. Taught new technicians, and examined problems daily."
good,Typically the work day is catching call to keep your area running smoothly and filling in the slow time with check sheets and PM work.
good,the day starts with shop talk and safety then we get our work orders to do our jobs routine inspections of the plant to make sure everything run smooth listen for different noises of pumps or motors and conveyors or up to specks anything wrong make a report and take appropriate action to get the job done in a safe and timely manner being that is is a paper industry we deal with lots of departments so you have to have a great knowledge of everything also we have a wood yard and more conveyors that carry the wood to big debarking drums that remove the bark witch is sent to a big press that releases the water then sent to the blowers that sends it to the steam plant witch is then burnt the clean logs or then sent to the TMP witch it converts it into wood chips then sent to big refiners that turns it to pulp witch is sent  to the paper mill and turns into paper the hardest part of the job is dealing with major break down getting all the parts you need in a hurry management always asking you how long or when your going to be done and the most enjoyable part is when you finish early and everyone is happy then its shower time and you get to go home with a smile cause you know you did a good job in a safe way and no one got hurt.
good,"This place had poor moral,less than optimal management, and inadequate training situations, however was fruitful in acquiring new skills and experiences."
good,"15-16 hrs de travail par jour et souvent obliger d'aller travailler la nuit sur le chantier par ce que les problèmes de chemins forestier ne sont pas prêt pour le transport de bois, pas assez d'avance de chemins gravelé pour subvenir aux besoins en bois de l'usine qui produit tres bien meme trop pour la production en foret!!!"
good,"Many opportunities for advancement and jobs, good salary, good benefits, good hours,better quality of life, good company to work , learning new skills"
good,Got to work with other employee's who were very knowledgeable about the Millwright trade. Got to see how my first year prepared me for industry and was able to apply the things I learned about applied in the workplace.
good,The coworkers are some of the best I've ever had the pleasure to work with.  Hard working and conscientious. It's a pleasure to work with my customers everyday and know that they appreciate my efforts on their behalf.
good,"Good job, great people.  Employees are valued.  Good work life balance.  Canadian headquarters so management is more liberal than United States managed companies."
good,"The department that I worked in, was in start up of productions. Converting has come a long way within two years, but lacks organization.  Once the kinks are ironed out, I believe this department will show awesome profits."
good,"Resolute was a very stressful place to work. I did learn a great deal in the paper industry. The management was great, however we were in the process of learning a new production system"
good,"Paper company. The pay was great , hours were long. We worked 12 hour swing shifts. The itself was not hard, just dealing with the heat was the worst part. Got plenty of overtime. Overtime that you wanted and overtime you didn't want."
good,I like the people I work with. I enjoying working with everyone on my crew. I like my job and love being apart of recycling. I like what we do at Resolute.
good,"Working in a manufacturing plants is a task in itself. On good days it really is not a problem because the machine does majority of the work, however on bad days between the heat (which could reach up to 115 degrees) and the maintenance strain it can be trying. The compensation is very rewarding and being apart of a union is reassuring for job security."
good,The hardest part of the job was dealing with the constant threat of the mill closing due to the evaporating paper market.
good,"The mill gets a bad rap, but really it’s not that bad of a place to work. Most departments are 4 on 4 off schedule, so lots of time away from work. There was also a lot of opportunity for OT. Payment was fair."
good,Enjoyed my stay there but after 26 and 1/2 years i got tired of the rotating swing shift.It served it's purpose raising a family.My divorce after 29 years showed me i had missed my children growing up. i won.t do the same with my grand children.
good,long but gratifying days. learned lots from certain employees but nothing from others. good pay for an intown job that doesnt require relocation. management needs a reboot
good,"Union based,  seniority operatered. Great benefits and pay. Overtime offered as needed or not needed. Fellow employees are great. Everyone watches out and helps one another."
good,Vieille usine mais endroit stimulant pour travailler avec plein de défis.
good,Une équipe de manager très ouvert et à l'écoute des collaborateur.
good,"Interesting process to work in.  Very challenging, fair balance of work versus personal life.  Demanding at times.  Good group to lead, accepted changes with excitement."
good,Working in unison wth fifteen people in a safety conscious workplace. The ability to nurture and train employees for certain jobs to their skill ability. The best part of job is to learn how each employee can use there skill set to full potential and utilize it.The most enjoyable part of job is making sure we have a good shift and no one gets injured so they can go home to their families.
good,"Enjoy the environment, co-workers, and leadership. Resolute is a safety oriented organization that provides good pay. The 401K is excellent for those over the age of 40, but their insurance plan has room for improvement."
good,"Lots of opportunities for advancement. Locations in Canada and US. Good place to learn for young people. Not afraid of the Greens, and willing to speak up."
good,Travail d'habilleur de machine à papier. C'est un travail où les journées passent vite et ne se ressemblent pas!
good,Very involved with the safety team. Always put safety first whether it was a coworker or myself. Open to learn at all times. Train new employees to load and unload trucks also did inventory count and put desired information in the computer
good,"It a nice place to learn and develop technical skills with good compensation and vacations. "
good,"All in good place to work, great pay but hours were horrible, never knew when you were going home. Coworkers were great no complaints here. Management could use a few pointers."
good,working here is a fun and exciting place to work but at the same time you have to realize that there is danger everywhere around you. the hardest part of the job is watching for others. your actions in the work place can not only put you in danger but also the people around you. the people you work with are all friendly. of course like all jobs tension will rise but you all have to come  together for the common goal and that is to make high quality paper at a great speed!
good,"Les journées sont très simple et très demandente: on doit s'occuper de prendre les appels entrant, faire le suivis des billets que tu as pris en charge, créer des nouveau, vérifier dans le systèmes de billetteries ceux qui n'ont pas été fermé et aussi aider tes coéquipiers pour les courriels et leurs billets."
good,Fast paced working environment. Each day brought about different challenges.  You work under limited supervision. Had to learn how to multi-task in order to keep up with the daily work.
good,"The salary was great and the environment was always about employees safety.  Sad that the newsprint industry is dying out, which is what caused the closure of this mill."
good,"Day is from 7AM to 5PM"
good,worked a lot of over time made great money decent beneifits had great lead men couldnt have asked for a better carrer then they shut down # 2 paper mill and out the door we went
good,This was a great work experience. The work was demanding and the hours were long but we were compensated accordingly. The management and team building that is  there is great and provided good direction. They stress on safety procedures and a healthy workplace which makes ergonomics in the workplace great. The hardest part of the job was being able to cope with the heat and physical demand.
good,Premièrement les journées son tous différentes et elles comportent différentes situations qui nous font apprendre énormément. Se sentir grandir au sein d'une enterprise et pouvoir exploiter son potentiel son des choses très importante au cour du cheminement.
good,"Its nice to work with people who are focused on safety and driven to meet production targets. Managers, supervisors and administrative staff have all been friendly, helpful and ready to assist when needed."
good,"Vérifier la bonne qualité de l'enveloppement des rouleaux,"
good,"Pour Résolu, travailler en toute sécurité, ce n'est pas négociable, c'est une des valeurs le plus importantes, ainsi que le développement durable."
good,It is overall a great place to work. The management is great and there are a lot of people willing to help you. The co workers are very open to helping you on anything. The part i like the most about this job is that you get to order your lunch from a very good restaurant called the wagon wheel.
good,"- Bonne équipe"
good,Start up and shut down paper machine. Accountability a product.lead other workers.kept files on computer.w.orked on down equipment.reported all accidents to supervisor
good,"Throughout the duration of my summer employment at Resolute Forest Products, I was exposed to the inner workings of an engineering department, while simultaneously gaining knowledge related to the processes and equipment utilized in a pulp and paper mill."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company that offers good opportunities for job mobility/advancement for motivated individuals. Great work atmosphere and team dynamic. I would NOT be looking for new employment if the company was downsizing at the pulp & paper mill in my hometown.
good,Bonne compagnie socio-responsable. Bonne possibilité d'avancement. Des gens motivés et de coeur
good,go in put on all your ppe do your 360 booklet load orders on trucks load orders on rail cars unload line coming from header clean as you go do routine maintenance
good,Travail en équipe. Bonne expérience de travail et beaucoup de défis à relever .
good,Produits forestiers Résolu est une compagnie dynamique offrant des possibilités de se développer personnellement et professionnellement.
good,"Cette entreprise priorise la santé et sécurité au travail avec aucune exception et c'est parfait comme ça, c'est assez dangereux comme travaille, tout peut arriver comme accidents"
good,"Good place to work. "
good,"I was trained in cleaning, scheduling, water sampling, and inventory. The hardest part of the job was keep up with scheduling when I dealing with confusion. The most enjoyable part of the job was the water testing. My co-worker were all helpful and good people. I overall enjoyed my experience at Resolute."
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Resolute, however I am only hired on for a temporary position as an intern while the company switches software systems. Most of the accounting department has been in and out training or travelling to corporate headquarters.  I have gained a lot of experience using accounting systems along with communicating with co-workers, and dealing with responsibilities including inputting hundreds of invoices into the system for both the accounts payable and accounts receivable."
good,"This was an old but sufficient paper mill that closed in the three quarter mark of 2014. Learnt many different systems and had the opportunity to do a little bit of everything from electrician apprentice to drafter and then to automation but having the title as a control systems technologist. Meet some great people whom I will never forget. Sadly, the building and mill, being almost 100 years old had to permanently shut its doors as newer paper mill from Resolute Forest Products were making cleaner paper with newer instruments and new technology that made them more efficient and easy to keep running. Overall I have a fantastic experience."
good,"365 days a year operation.  12 hour shifts.  This is a continuous process that requires that your shift pick up where the prior shift left off and safely run the process.  Must handle any upsets that arise.  The teams on each shift ran the show, but with supervision input.  There are 5 distinct operations in the Fiberline and all co-workers learned to run each job.  This was done through a rotating schedule  The hardest part of the job was when a machine failed.  There are a lot of valves to open or close and a thorough check-off list to insure that the maintenance can be done safely.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working alongside co-workers who know what jobs need to be done and get out there and do those jobs."
good,"Great Safety Program, great vision. Location was operating 24/7 therefore work/life balance came as a area with opportunities for improvement. Management supported the safety culture, and invested massively in keeping employees safe. Environmental friendly company with climate change approach. Overall good company to work for, if you are into tissue industry."
good,Excellent career opportunity with lots of chances to both grow and advance through the company. The job demanded that you work lots of hours in high stress and hazardous environments.
good,A typical work day is one that you never when or if you are going to get home from work.  Scheduled to work on off days as well as holidays with very little warning.  Most members of the management staff did not have a clue as your day to day activities or the workload of the job.
good,i have enjoyed working there. i learned a few thing  while there. but now they are shuting down a whole line and have a lay off in july. so this is why i am looking for a new job. i am looking to maybe changing my field of work to forklift work
good,"Hard but rewarding work, nice co-workers management was a bit iffy at times but generally alright. work could be challenging at first but becomes easier"
good,"This is a great company to work for. They invest heavily in training their employees. They flew me to Columbus, Ohio for a week training and also to Houston, Texas for another week. I was customer service representative when it was known as Abitibi Bowater, then it changed to AbiBow and now it's Resolute Forest Products. My position was eliminated due to Chapter 11 Bankruptcy reorganization in 2011. It's a shame because I really enjoyed working for them when they were in Orando, Florida."
good,"I started as summer help, worked my way on to permanent position. The management team was great. If you worked hard they noticed it. The work was hard but very rewarding. I earn a great salary weekly, and life skills."
good,"International Account Management Representative "
good,Excellent place for students to learn in a safe fast paced environment. Helpful honest people. Excellent pay and balance between work and life. 5 star work place.
good,"Hard Working oriented company"
good,"Good atmosphere, good management, good hours, easy commute, enjoyed the job, the people I worked with.the wage was good. Good benefits. Easy job requirements."
good,I learned a lot during my time at the mill. It was a great experience. It helped me support my family and their goals. I would definitely recommend them.
good,"Days work are good, put the night shifts are long too, put i loved my job as a sawmill worker. I work 2 different shifts every 2 weeks. Very stressing driving home each way 2 hours every time i go to work....put i still liked my job.
