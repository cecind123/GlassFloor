rating,review
bad,Dishonest supervisors and management so much fraud on the time clock in Hardeeville South Carolina nobody cares it’s the worst place I ever worked no discipline people do what they want come and go as they please no order whatsoever so sad I feel bad for the company because they just bought caraustar and this is a place they need all new management and staff
bad,"Also the need schooling on how to fire someone instead of having the whole management team as in HR,GM Supervisor ,plant manager and another supervisor being in the same room as with the employee when terminated."
bad,Nice team to work with but the management is bad. They work the temps for 90 days then let them go. A typical day were working and the co-workers were nice and friendly they were the most impact of me trying to get hired and I thought it would of been a nice place to fit in.
bad,a typical days work was on a preduction line putting oil drums onto pallets and sending them the shrink wrap machine the management was ok my co-workers was friendly people the hardest part of the job the physical demand of working long hours and the most enjoyable part of the job was been able hit the targets set by the company
bad,Very toxic stressful environment. Can't reach out to HR for assistance because she is biased due to an ongoing relationship with IBC Supervisor. Very unprofessional and she runs plant management. Change of mangement is desperately needed!
bad,They let new leadership that don’t fit the culture and organization get rid of long time employees. Then the new leadership is let go after the damage is done.
bad,"Alsip Plant Review - Very demanding, poor management, blames employees for plant failures and poor sales. Encourages employees to have work- home life balance, but hourly people are expected to work entirely too many hours while salary employees work minimal hours. Job responsibilities are not balanced properly and favoritism is abundant!"
bad,They treat outsiders wrong and there friends with the upmost respect. A lot of favoritism to people they know they don’t wanna see you susceed........
bad,"The crew are a great group of guys to your face, the chance they get to complain about you they'll take it to try to get favor from the managers. The constant fighting between maintenance and operations is staggering and the production suffers."
bad,"Company does not display loyalty to its own employees, including upper management. The mission and idea behind the company is great, however it is not followed, pushed, or felt Within. Sr HR managers are more concerned about their positions, than helping their GMs in difficult times. Such potential, but the lack of support from corporate levels is extremely unfortunate to their ""culture"""
bad,"No management,poorly trained operators,the place is one big dumpster fire. In maintenance you have good days and bad one's it's my job,but this place is a mess every day. Call to call to call, all day everyday.come on 3 o clock."
bad,It was a good place to work before the closed down. The management team was helpful. The shifts was long but was still a good place to work. It was a fast pace job and most of the employee was not always that fast.
bad,"Terrible management, no set hours, Troy attempts to rule with fear.  He enjoys micro-managing.  It’s no wonder people come and go here.  It’s not a friendly place to work by no means."
bad,Management makes it hard to do your job no help at all with employees Run barrels that's all and inspecting them. Co-workers are lazy and do not want to work. dealing with the management and co-workers. there is no enjoyment there. Hr  is buddies with line workers and lend money to line workers and makes fun of peoples problems.
bad,maintaining machines was my job. Management rarely allowed for Pm's to get done and on time to maintain machinery.  fire fighting was a common expression. Management will ruin the company
bad,Ho lavorato presso questa azienda con agenzia interinale azienda seria agenzia meno perché faceva contratti settimanali una settimana si una no
bad,"Brak możliwości rozwoju,zła atmosfera pracy,kolesiostwo,..."
bad,"Been there 2 years with only a 3% increase on pay and no respect whatsoever, plant management is new and doesn’t know how to run the show and tells lie after lie"
bad,very stressful place to be. Management is terrible working tons of hours extended shifts weekends ect. No advancement hiring temp workers no training programs
bad,"Temperaturas elevadas, prejudicando a produtividade do colaboradores."
bad,"This is one of the hottest, nastiest plants that I have worked in through my manufacturing career. There is a union, but this only serves to uphold a long standing division between workers and management. Some of the union concessions over the years are borderline insane."
bad,"repaired equipment, lots of scavenging for parts, no new parts, make it work one way or another. improved my skill set in thinking on my feet. management was not the best. this company was doomed, could see the righting on the wall"
bad,fhe system of annualised hours w ith a maximum working day of 11hours and a maximum 48 hr week together with staff shortages made3 for a very poor work life balance.
bad,"There’s always plenty of work to be done, but this place is a nightmare. With the lack of training you receive for the job and tasks. Supervisors take no time to teach you and pass you onto another employee who’s been there as long as you have due to turnover rate of employees. Lack of training is putting it nicely honestly, there’s absolutely no training. Family life doesn’t exist and you’re expected to work 6 days a week."
bad,It was a good place to work I would recommend other people to work there the manager on night shift was a good guy and the pay was good I was a shift lead there
bad,I was a machine operator for Greif.  The pay was not good for all the hard work that was to be done. a typical day at Greif was making boxes in a timely manner for companies. there was too hard about the job. Just get the production ready for delivery
bad,"Very fast paced environment.  Long hours every day.  Unreliable equipment.  Lack of leadership from the top; lots of great ideas, but no direction or solutions offered; just fix it!   HR is useless and vindictive and is at the root of the problems in this facility.HR is not to be trusted.  Backstabbing supervisors who are ""very close"" to the HR person and get promoted or transferred instead of terminated!   This is a sinking ship...STAY AWAY!"
bad,"Most days were 12 hours shifts, which are fine, but it starts to wear your body down. The manager for my department was a good manager, so he was one of the few positives about Greif. I liked the people that I worked with and the job that I performed, but there was no room for advancement."
bad,This place offers a lot of hours but be careful its a very fast paced environment and has a lot of demands but=t if you can handle it then you'll be great here
bad,"Going over the daily production schedule before the start of the shift, Overseeing production needs and demands for customer needs, overseeing shipping and all shipping issues with shipping as well as repairs on trailers ready for shipment. dealing with daily production issues directing maintenance for repairs in all production needs."
bad,Could have been better they expect you to work very long hours and cover for people who are not pulling their weight I could have completed my work had I not had to cover for everyone else
bad,"travail à la chaîne "
bad,"Şirketteki mali sıkıntılardan dolayı çalışanların işten çıkarılma korkuları sebebiyle bilgilerini ve tecrübelerini şirketin hedefleri doğrultusunda tam olarak kendilerini verememekteydi. Ayrıca staj yaptığım dönemde orada bulunan mühendislerin karşısındaki insana tecrübelerinden bahsetmesi bir nevi destek olması gerekirken ay sonunu bekleyen , kendisini ve çevresindeki insanlara katkı sunma konusunda zayıf bir çalışma arkadaşlığı vardı."
bad,Worked there as a temp. You literally just drop a light in barrells all day and check for scratches or defects. Most of the drums were for Dow Chemical so they had to be perfect.
good,this job required non stop dirty work because the p.ms are never done they run this plant into the ground (24/7) and get mad when in it breaks I was let go under false reasons I even approached management and was told that the reasons were false.
good,working at greif bro very loud team work was sour no communication there where no proper training you have learnt things on your own and the supervisor whould make the hard has if you should kno verey on hand
good,Dead end job with alright pay production supervisor Isn’t equipped for the job management has to be the worse I have ever worked under. A lot of favoritism goes on within certain skin color. One set up of people do the lower paying jobs and another set of people do the higher paying jobs .
good,Plant chronically understaffed. 12 hour days for 4 months. Safety ignored. Quality ignored. Personnel not held accountable. It didn't start out that way but it went downhill fast.
good,"The day starts very much the same way every single day, go in. Clock in. On rare occasion there is some issue that is brought to the shift's general attention. Go out to the line, check the first part that comes off the line and ensure it's within quality specification and be certain that there are no deformities or defects in or on the part. Do process control sheet and record all of the machine's current settings and temperatures. Begin the Production Paper work. Move parts to stock and ensure quality throughout the day."
good,A minha chegada não foi comunicada à equipe que achou que eu era um consultor. Havia muita pressão por resultados que deveriam vir de outras áreas. O relacionamento entre a equipe era ruim.
good,Great people - one side of management not organized and not capable of giving good information or communicating with shipping causing late deliveries and detaining charges.
good,Not sure I can give an unbiased review. I am not very happy with this facility. I use to like coming to work and solving the problems that would arise through out the day. No so much anymore.
good,"O trabalho era corrido mas tranquilo,trabalhava com solda ponto e já conhecia o processo e aprendi trabalhar em outras máquinas. Nosso encarregado não era muito comunicativo, havia muitas trocas repentinas de turnos oque complicava um pouco, o barulho das máquinas eram bem fortes e a parte boa era o joguinho de sinuca depois da refeição."
good,"Corporation had a pattern of buying older companies and converting to container manufacturing without spending necessary capital for reliable equipment. Instead, would send in my group to 'band-aid' or just get equipment to work."
good,factory work production line very hot heavy lifting not very good management  low pay how to make metal barrels learned how to paint
good,"this job is very fast paced and demanding to get the product out the door,  if they are behind they will pull people from other depts and they dont care if it is time for you to leave or have other arrangements you dont leave til the product is on the truck"
good,The facility is impacted heavily due to economic downturn in the region. The facility is planned for Sadara Chemical company's packaging needs and the uncertain delay in Sadara project is badly impacting the plant atleast till mid of 2018.
good,"When I first began working here, it seemed like a good place. Hours and workdays were very good and near home. However, the way management runs this place made me think twice within my probation period. They try to penny pinch any way they can, they really don't know how to treat people. they have two short breaks, and one half hour lunch. Warehouse, no AC, fans to blow hot air at you. Union plant, so everything goes according to union contract, which seemed wasn't negotiated very well."
good,"I would come in everyday and do stretches with my co workers. Then we would have a meeting about how many drums we had to do that week and so our supervisor could give us our jobs since I was temporary. Then we would work, but the people were nice and made you feel like a family. Then i'd go home."
good,I liked the job very much hard work and good pay but they didn't have the best system i think things could of been ran a little smoother but was grateful to have the opportunity to work there
good,Very fast paced and very warm inside.  Management is very poor.  Pay is ok and the benefits are good.  Management can be understanding over certain issues and take care of issues when needed.
good,Fast paced day taking care of problems and fixing issues.  There is some wonderful people who work there  in the shop and I have many wonderful Memories of my time there.
good,I've worked at grief yrs worked in the warehouse loading trailers..also was the yard dig moving trailers in and out of docks.... before that I worked at neodesha plastics and drive a forklift for 5 yrs....
good,I had a lot of fun working with the people in this company & learned a great deal.
good,"Greif has been a great place to work.  The Greif Way is observed in most places around the world."
good,"standard assembly line/warehouse. Hot days, long hours crumby pay. union job."
good,Troubleshooting and escalation of helpdesk tickets from inbound calls.
good,Worked with Greif for 7 months and enjoyed working there.  People were nice and work was not overwhelming.  Good leadership and supportive staff.  I do recommend working here.  I only left because of the traffic.
good,"En typiskt arbetsdag - Förberedning av order, kontroll av maskin, vickning av kartonger för maskinen."
good,Good co workers but the management and supervisor no are soo good they don't care much about the employees just care about them. Definitely i looking for better job
good,"Good company with great benefits but has been poorly ran with lack of communication from employees to managament. Great people on the floor and have learned several jobs from stacking, running a bander, fork lift, shipping and receiving and my current job now operating the machine."
good,"- Reunião de segurança, analise dos problemas do dia anterior,distribuição e acompanhamento de serviços,programação de preventivas,aquisição de peças de reposição, estudos para melhoria em equipamentos, acompanhamento de serviços prestados por terceiros,etc."
good,"Atividades bem desenvolvidas e elaboradas."
good,"Always opportunities to re-invent the wheel and participate in growing the business.Bi-lingual staff can be a challenge as many things can get lost in translation but with determination and a consistent message of accountability and excellent, one will prevail."
good,"A typical day of work at greif starts off with a morning safety meeting, self evaluation or rating and discussion about how the previous day went and what can be done to improve for the next day as far as safety and production goes which is good to keep employees gaged and involved! You always pick up on something new as machines malfunction theirs opportunity's to learn either how to fix a problem or troubleshoot it and become more valuable and useful. Management is short staffed so it puts a burden on others to do more. The hardest part of the job is working through the heat and enduring the excessive walking for 12 hours."
good,Sin comentarios ya que no debo decir nada en contra o a favor de esta empresa
good,"Es bueno el ambiente, pero algunos trabajadores son un poco prepotentes y hacen el ambiente un poco dificil."
good,Um serviço bom de trabalhar mais começou a cair na rotina e cansativo porque era a mesma coisa todos os dias nunca mudava eu ja sabia oq fazer só mudava os clientes por o produto era o mesmo para todos.
good,"Great company to work for as well. Leadership strong, many years of tenure. Need more technically advanced machinery in the corrugated operations of the business. Great work/life balance."
good,I like working here. They gave me a chance and now I'm running a machine. The job is pretty simple. Keep a clean work area and everything runs smooth. Machines are a little old but maintenance keeps them running

good,"Great company to start a career with, but no to stay for long. "

Excelente clima organizacional onde tínhamos a liberdade para negociar horários flexíveis.
good,"Empresa en la cual se vive un ambiente de trabajo agradable debido a la calidad de gente que labora en ella, momentos dificiles que vivi  durante mi estadía se daba en tiempos de altas producciónes en donde se tenia la responsabilidad de entregar los productos a su debido tiempo y con buena calidad se debía acelerar con toda la gestión, pero con la buena voluntad  y el empeño de la gente ayudaban a sobrellevar la tensión que se vivía agradablemente"
good,"It was a nice job. The schedule was fantastic, but the job itself could become a mental headache just do to the fact that no one the floor has a set position besides the shift leader."

good,"Enjoyed the idea of the job to be customer focused; however, not all individuals have the same drive or idea of what is best for the customer.  This makes your job more difficult."
good,sécurité de l'emploi mais peu d'évolution je voudrais connaître encore plus sur la sérigraphie d'autres support .
good,Greif is the largest industrial packaging company in the world. However Flexible Business is not stable and not managed well.
good,São 20 anos de grande aprendizado e dedicação. Pude realizar muitas tarefas que me dão hoje experiência suficiente para trabalhar em outras grandes empresas.

good,I really enjoyed the environment at this job. This job was very easy to learn and overall was a good company to work for.
good,I painted parts and operated machine presses on a daily basis
good,excelente equipo de trabajo pero mucha rotación a nivel operario
good,Worked long hours during the week so the supervisors could get paid for working M-F even if the hourly people only worked three or four long days. They liked to have control over the employees who get paid hourly.
good,"Goed, maar typisch Amerikaans bedrijf om voor te werken. Jammer van de vele reorganisaties waar ook ik nu slachtoffer van ben geworden."

good,"En un dia tipico de trabajo produciamos alrededor de 4000 tambores en un solo turno, aprendi a hacer varias cosas, como planograf de tapa, manejo de balancines y la colocacion de burletes en los tambores para que no pierda su contenido. Tenia muy buena relacion con la gerencia, y con mis compañeros tambien ya que como dije anteriormente, habia un buen clima laboral. La parte mas complicada era, planograf, pero solo me costo al principio. Me gusto aprender todo lo que aprendi, y el buen clima laboral que habia en la empresa en general."

good,Greif is a great company! I learned a lot. They are highly ethical. I like the service leader approach taken by the CEO. It filters thru the organization.
good,Company is good to work fork. Benefits an awards are given to those who are productive. Days could start from a 8 to 12 hour shifts depending on work schedule. Only reason I left was due to my child support court order.

I've learned to listen to and respect management as well as supervisors. I've also learned to get along and become friends with co-workers because there is no I in the word TEAM and no matter what SAFETY FIRST.   The most enjoyable part of the job were break times and lunch because not only did you get to relax, refuel, and recharge, you got to mingle and converse with your fellow co-workers.

good,"A typical day at the Greif warehouse checking all orders demanded before assembly start up time. What would follow were daily safety meetings, and groups would share safety tips from past days to ensure quality production. On the floor everyone had there designated spots, and waited for tubes to come down the assembly line to add whatever it needed. I learned a lot of safety procedures, and really enjoyed the culture for everybody was helpful all the time. The hardest part of the job had to be turning in orders on time, and the constant change of heat and cold from seasons. Overall I enjoyed working there, and I would wish now that I had never left."
